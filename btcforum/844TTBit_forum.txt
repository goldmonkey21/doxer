These new miners do not want to be part of the "monopoly", but do want monopoly prices.  A pool with 30% of mining power may have an incentive to do this.

Its better to be the 2nd biggest mining operation, and let #1 push up the fees. Donated. God speed I'd like to host the first NCAA pool with a contestant that has a perfect entry.

I went back in time and gave you bitcoin. You don't want to know the alternative.You're welcome Gold is fungible. The Federal reserve and German central bank can make a sweetheart deal for $30B in USD rather than the 670 tonnes of gold. With this money, Germany purchases gold from other sources (locally). Once complete, Germany announces a successful swap.This way, the Federal reserve can continue to lease out over 100% of their reserves. It works every time until it doesn't. I thought about creating a service, like boomerang for gmail: Person signs a transaction from A->B, but doesn't broadcast it. My server will broadcast the transaction only if you don't check in for the last 30 days. If you get thrown in jail (or die), no one would suspect that transaction is yours. I helped create LBAAT along with nelisky.One use I envisioned was similar to captcha. You provably send bitcoins to YOURSELF as a way to prevent spamming a site. The site can verify that you sent $5 worth of bitcoins to an address that can not be redeemed for X days. Once the private key was released, you sweep the coins back into your wallet. lbaat will give the public key upon request. You combine this with your private key to get a 3rd public key (private key is unknown).
not possible, it takes 2 private keys to decode lbaat.net releases a private key every hour, called a "timepoint secret". The timepoint secret keys are connected - the hash of next hour's private key is this hour's private key. By requesting a public key in the future, you can combine it with your own private key to create an address with no known private key. When lbaat releases the timepoint, it can be combined with your personal private key to release the coins.lbaat has no way of stealing the coins....and its my siteÂ   This is true, I could have. Every transaction is going to have risk. Sending funds to an escrow would have the risk that I claim the package was empty, or the escrow agent just runs off with the money.The watch trade was not going to happen if it came down to one of us sending first. We were able to change the risk parameters so that we both felt comfortable trading. You still need honest people on both sides. I picked up the watch this morning and it is as described. Very happy with the trade. guigui371 and I agreed on a price and have done a blind escrow. We decided to use 2 addresses due to insurance reasons, max value on insurance is 1500 EUR. One is funded for 1875 EUR, one for 375 EUR. I will post my private keys here once I receive the watch in good condition. If it is lost in the mail and a claim is made for 1500 EUR, guigui will receive the 375 address, and I will receive the 1875 address.I provided 2 public keys:0427AC054CB81348C11CBCEF2FAFDCBDF0C5D1B7C3AEC7A5271F95287436873D0C008ADBCCBA498 112B25D908AE5D377D1DEAA8AB60F4E0401D497CFB1A8360AA8049F8A962D844DDD80F11D011C15AA5534AD6B28F24D10768C4F965BAD51C839AC9BB622B32124A C6FF7F816A0142AC3BA02932341D8E789308659012EF61B3AE7guigui provided 2 public keys046411479EA8C18ABF06A1775C5E4C32CF4E754E5C2E2A5AC723D2A8ABD226AAE48C7F97C5423A3 B6D86B18BE47779614C3CEC0F3B0E50BE4F087F1CA9CBDCDDF104F65F2C9CE89DA50A01B6626B312A56DB33D85790DEC573772BD431111770E3E93A5936D8C89C1 0DB16427DDC95CBCE152CE7268431FFD5CB7431A9961268D834This resulted in bitcoin addresses:13x6DVWRY8TgRB5jhsTAB5KctsENpdYD2m1JieQoJtDA9S8w1mXi29SJ5avKupq1vBc6Which were funded by myself with tx: 3b3befee21611c4e0b95008797cc9b45926f4d4815e718a9268b0e6af458f86fedit: guigui371 also funded 375 EUR to the address.

There are no known collisions and there never will be.  sorry. back on A faucet is created to get people to use a new currency. This works economically when the cost of giving away a free coin is less than the value of having a new user of the currency. Faucets are initially funded by individuals who have a vested interest in a new currency, and are kept going by donations. I'd say bitcoin faucets are no longer economically viable - the margin gained by a new user is not worth a transaction fee. I too listen to the show daily, and agree with your comment. I have heard him say something to the effect of "The dollar is so weak, even bitcoin is rallying today", with the implication that people are selling their dollars so hard that they are chasing worthless internet money. Thank you for using DR. I see the tx is marked as "done", and assume it is in your ripple wallet?  In favor of forced regulation, or voluntary? Your POV will not be respected if you force 2 people to follow a set of rules which they ordinarily wouldn't agree to. Have some regulated exchanges, have some without. Let them compete in a free market. You suggest the regulated exchange will be preferred, some would disagree. We all knew June 2013. Is there a risk that the court will order all settlements in Yen or Dollars, therefore any BTCs left will have to be liquidated, and this movement of coins is to exchanges?sorry if I'm out of the loop, haven't been lurking here lately.
It is the setup to an epic april fools joke. Oh that graphic is way off. * Silk Road probably did $300-$400 Billion of revenue per year. * Hit men can easily be found on the Dark Webs, usually for about $15-$30 depending if you have a coupon or not.* They didn't mention child slave labor. I routinely hire 11 year old boys from Canada to mow my lawn. All, We've had syncing issues the last few weeks. Physical contact with servers has been necessary, and it has been bad timing with real life situations. Thank you for your patience. Thank you for using DR! I'm confused - ripple can't hold actual bitcoins, only the IOUs. You have bitstamp ious for bitcoins in your ripple wallet and want to withdraw? it should find a path. Do you have adequate trustlines for DR bitcoin IOUs?Bitstamp -> DR ious should ripple through to your wallet. but if you have tradefortress or cousin larry ious, a path probably wont be found. No problem.If actual bitcoins are sent (by you, bitstamp, or anyone) to the issuing address that DR has for your ripple account (1ABCd....), DR will issue you an IOU that you can see in ripple.If you then wish to have actual bitcoins and not DR IOUs, you send the DR IOUs to DR's ripple address (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX). But you probably see a problem - DR has a few hundred accounts, how do you tell DR to redeem to the specific bitcoin address you provided? The answer is to include the destination tag (dt) when sending. Your dt is a 9 digit account number. The first 7 digits are the account number and the last 2 are a mild checksum. example: ?dt=100039417, the dt is 100039417hope this helps Gox could have had a small problem when btc was under $30 in early 2013 that blew up in their face when the price skyrocketed. Short but not an intentional, speculative short. I have been around a bit and would say the ascendancy was due to spongebob stickers, alpaca socks and papa johns pizza. Call me a dork, but the novelty of transacting in something other than USD was liberating. Silk road was a bump in the (errrr...ummm) road for bitcoin. I've since changed my opinionÂ    Yeah, we've had sync issues between DR and Ripple. I'm going to try and kick it right now. Sorry for the delay and thanks for using DR! Sorry about this. Trying to re-sync now. If I knew something and had to buy $500k worth of BTC at mtgox right now, I'd put up "fake" walls, hoping to entice a large sell. Looking at the depth, you can't buy 3000 BTC without moving the market $100+ if Gox comes through and makes good on all BTC and USD, 90% of the forum will be eating crow. Myself included. ah yeah, there is now a separate line for destination tags.leave off the "?dt=1" and send to DR's address: rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDXwith a destination tag of: 1 When redeeming (DR IOU's to specie), you can find your destination tag by putting your ripple address in the search bar. It will be under "To Redeem". It will be a 9 digit numberCode:To Redeem: rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=100123411the destination tag / account number is "100123411"let me know if any issues. Thanks! Everyone is assuming all the trades were at arm's length, which they may not have been. If a broker has an order to sell at $500 if the price gets to it (a stop order), and you own a certain % of the orderbook, it is in your interest to fill your own orders down to a certain point, then bid for the offered coins. Yeah, some people got cheap coins at the expense of the large trader, but he was able to score the majority at $110.It works because few people have large standing orders in the $200-$500 range, the only reason you would get filled is when you don't want them.  Trying to dumb this down for me so I can understand it better and explain it to my friends:I request $1,000 to be wired to me from Company A. Since there are so many wires with Company A, they have developed their own automated process. I notice a flaw in their code, so that after they send the wire, I can screw with the receipt that they get from the bank, making it seem to them that the wire didn't go through. Their flawed system doesn't check the bank balance, it just goes off of their flawed receipt. Therefore, I can request they send again.Is this about accurate? Exactly - TO an exchange. Have there been any reports of a receiving wire denied? I suppose there very well may be a bottleneck, but it would have been pointed it out as the source. Also, some USD transfers would have made it through. Instead, you have to pay 5% fee and wait. Sounds like MtGox can arb their assets if you pay the 5%Best case scenario I see: MtGox is terrible at hedging. A customer would deposit Pesos and ultimately withdraw USD. That would mean MtGox is sitting on weak currencies such as PLN, PESOS, BRL. But wouldn't there be some evidence of this? A MtGox employee talking off the record in a chat, etc? Seems more likely employees are being directed to not blame it on any government entity/regulation to buy them as much time as possible.
Was just in Vegas, took this pic: Here is what I think they will post: * Look for a '7~10' days to give them some wiggle room.* Look for a trading fee discount / deposit bonus. A deposit bonus might be a giveaway of the severity of the issue, but its funnier to write. A trading discount is more likely. I get the angle shootÂ   I'd rather be the one enjoying your labor for popsicle sticks.  Its about time we stop putting the dollar sign in front of mtgox quotes. It hit 1037, but certainly not $1037 Sounds like you will need someone to trade xrp for nmc, which is not done by DR, but by others on the ripple network. If you send NMC to your personal nmc address in DR, DR will issue you a receipt for those NMC. DR doesn't make any markets in XRP. Cheaper btc prices will attract fiat to bitstamp over other exchanges.  Ok, makes sense Mikcik, I have a question on gold manipulation, hope it is OK to ask in your thread, as this is where the eyes seem to be.We all saw what happened when MtGox stopped paying out USD, or at least severely rationed USD. The result was the price of MtGox bitcoins (paper bitcoins if you will) rose substantially. If you do business with actual bitcoins, the price is now currently ~17.5% less.As related to gold, the expectation seems to be that if the Comex runs dry (or stops paying out in real gold), the price of physical will rally to substantial levels above paper gold. But the MtGox episode explains the opposite - that it will be paper gold (comex futures) that explodes higher as it tries to lure physical gold into its coffers.Conclusion: Physical gold will therefore trade at a significant *discount* to comex futures if there is a run at the comex. Yes? Yes, you'll use the trade option in ripple (warning: the order book was down for the past day or so in the default client).IOU = "I Owe You" - which makes more sense in english Â  Ripple doesn't move any physical assets (such as gold, bitcoins, USD, CNY, etc), but rather a specific receipt for that asset held by a gateway. DividendRippler is one of the gateways. DividendRippler is not an exchange, it does not hold XRP. The exchange is in ripple itself. DividendRippler can exchange BTC for an IOU of a BTC (and vise-versa).It looks like you sent 420 XRP directly to DividendRippler, not to a specific account (which would be automatically refunded). This is similar to writing a check made out to "Bank of America" when you really want to send it to an account holder at the Bank. I'll verify and send the XRP back. Yes, we have talked about it. Exciting times indeed! Please excuse the bump.An unexpected server issue is going to keep wager processing offline for all chains for the next 24 hours. Sorry for any inconvenience. Update 2014-01-17:DividendRippler had a server issue that doesn't look like it will be fixed until tomorrow (17 January). I apologize for the inconvenience. Are there many reports of banks getting upset for receiving wires from bitstamp (for individuals not doing business type transactions)?Â  The stories I hear are sending wires out of the country and those who are obviously engaging in business activity with a personal account. The idea I floated definitely has. We have had a website all set up for about a month now, but haven't posted it publicly yet. There are a few details that need addressing (redeeming, getting a PO box?, how long do I plan on doing this?, etc). Holiday downtime did not help, but it is not a forgotten project. When people were connecting computers together in the 1980's, they didn't have the goal of the internet as we know it now, much less websites such as Facebook or Twitter. It was clear that the value of two computers connected together was greater than two computers not connected, so it was done. Protocols were written which are still in use today. Today, there appears to be a value in a public ledger, otherwise it wouldn't be done. The early adopters of the internet failed to see Facebook.com and Twitter.com, but that doesn't mean they didn't see value at the time. sometimes an IOU of a bitcoin is worth more than an actual bitcoin and you need services such as ripple or traditional banking system. If you don't currently have the need to keep assets in IOU form, don't do it. Last Christmas I gave out delayed bitcoins as a gift using LBAAT.net. The site can *never* know the private key, as it is a combination of something only you know (private key, under scratch off in picture) and secrets that LBAAT.net publishes on a timely manner. All LBAAT secrets are connected and provable, so there is no Tom Foolery.Here is an example of one of the 5 BTC cards I gave away to my nephew: I hope Uncle TTBit gets a decent christmas gift this year. Once the secret is published on christmas 2013, my nephew can combine the secrets and redeem the coins. * I get a lottery ticket as a birthday gift, but the dog eats it before the drawing. The numbers hit for $100 million, but I can never cash out. Taxable?
So does Mike have the option to just quit producing casascius coins without further legal trouble from FinCEN, or is he going to need lawyers looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life? Bring itI wonder if the SEC or CFTC has anything to say about a private company issuing a currency... Has a 3rd party transaction fee business been discussed?A business keeps a public database of transactions. If one of the tx are included in a block, a bounty is paid to the newly generated coin address. Miners can choose to look at this database or ignore it, but they will get the bounty regardless.* The 3rd party now has an incentive to include as many tx as possible, and could pay less for small blocks, more for larger ones - enough to offset the cost of not including them (not sure if the economics of that work out).* could negotiate with MtGox / BitPay for bulk rates on transactions, customers wouldn't have to worry about fees sending or receiving. Its what you described, but instead of the merchant requiring an active database of bills, all he does is post a public key, and anyone can send money to a bill under his public key. Bob's Bar and Grill doesn't need to have a database of dollar bills, or worry about disputes. Either the bill is in the blockchain, or it isn't.+ Bob's Bar and Grill (Public Key)Â  - A12345678B ($1 USD bill)Â  - C47891235F ($1 USD bill)+ Alice's Coffee shoppe (Public Key)Â  - F78426288B ($1 USD bill)Â  - E29887103A ($1 USD bill)A bit technical, and looking for a way to make it easy to understand. Thanks for the interest, will post here on launch! This idea is launching in the next few days. We hope to set a standard so anyone can act as a 3rd party, such as coffee shops, bars, and trusted individuals. So you might not trust a guy living in Iowa to redeem btc, but if the local coffee shop was 3rd party, you can always use it to get a coffee. I wonder why is there no real competition to ebay.Â  $65 billion company. Wouldn't you think that someone could come up with a superior product, maybe chisel away 2% of that and create a billion dollar company? I continue to own bitcoins and lean on the 'ebay' effect -- less than perfect product, but everyone uses it by default. I am a fan of Gary North. Most of his articles are subscription based, so there is an incentive for him to write articles that get a rise out of readers. If I sell pizzas for $20 USD or $18 worth of bitcoins, who is the fool? every trade makes someone happy It just so happens I'm selling a bitcoin for $1200.

Oh so obviously better for the masses such as myself  Are there any graphics of a small 'b' to indicate mBTC? Peter Schiff incorrectly believes that the product known as "bitcoin" is over. With colored coins / Mastercoin, a company can buy a single bitcoin and essentially destroy it, removing its fungibility with "standard" bitcoins.Â  This off-shore company can now back its own currency with any number of items, including gold. The new coins would trade freely world-wide backed by gold, anonymously. For Peter Schiff's gold backed currency idea to work, he has to have a centralized database of clients, complying with different government regulations. Only clients of Mr. Schiff can participate, whereas no account is necessary for the bitcoin backed gold currency.Once Peter Schiff sees this technology, he'll change his mind on a decentralized currency. Hahaha. Yeah, the 100 BTC (about $6 total at the time) has been given away. If anyone wants to buy me a car, PM me.(Locking the thread) Yes, the paper is going to be what I check before releasing coins, and should be checked by those who accept it as payment. Maybe I'm underestimating criminals, but the risk involved to counterfeit a $1 bill to get 0.05 BTC for free seems a bit steep. I would contact authorities if I came across a counterfeit bill. Hoping to launch in the next few days - website is being built! We are taking steps so others can re-produce the idea. With luck, many local pubs and stores around the world will be able to release coins with their own keys.  What if the merchant gives a 50% discount for using BTC? Customer: gets $10 sandwich for $5. Spends $5 and gets more BTCMerchant: gets $5 worth of bitcoins today, but will be worth $10+ with patience.WIN-WIN. The advantages of a strong currency in action - encouraging work and production. Of course it is a false flag. Nobody is going to get $75,000 worth of benefit from his death when there is a laundry list of bernanke wannabees lined up behind him. It's so preposterous that it should help bitcoin. If you pay me 6% per year in interest on $100, I wind up with $106 at year's end. But if you allow me to compound that twice a year - 3% every six months, I make $106.09. But if you let me compound it monthly, my final balance is $106.1678. Daily $106.183. Each time is more and more.(wrong) Conclusion: If you allow me to infinitely compound at 6%, I can make infinite amount of money in a year?  So frustrating that only half the story continues to be told.So if I believe in the US dollar, I should never work for it? I do $1000 worth of work today and it is only worth $900 in a year. Take this to the logical conclusion and there should be few working and a whole bunch of debt as people fight to borrow to consume today and pay tomorrow.It is true that you should not *SPEND* a deflationary currency as much as an inflating currency (btc and USD here), but you should want to *WORK/PRODUCE* for it. Wherever that market meets between employee and employer is up to them.A $25 pizza went for 10,000 bitcoins a few years back. Today, that pizza is about 0.08 btc. This is hyper-deflation never seen before on the planet. And yet, is the bitcoin economy larger today or 3 years ago? A keynesian clown would have you believe the former. These boards are crawling with people wishing to work and sell goods for BTC. As a bonus, there is very little lending, very little debt denominated in BTC. This is the benefit of a strong currency.
Thank you. I believe I have addressed these points in my development which should post in the next day or so. I wish to use US currency ($1 bills specifically) because I want to lean on the counterfeiting security and laws. I wouldn't know how to verify paper rubles, pesos or rupees, or how unique each bill is. It would take huge balls for someone to knowingly counterfeit a FRN and send it through the US mail system. I have stickers that one can "paperclip" to a bill, to set it apart from one another (I don't suggest defacing US currencyÂ   ).Looks like my fears are a bit overblown, I would technically have custody of other's BTC and promise to redeem upon demand. This doesn't have much legal risk, at least on a small scale? Yes, I purchased what will probably be some very expensive silver! Looking forward to the coins, thank you. So the logic is that people are pouring USD into bitstamp and Yuan into chinese exchanges because MtGox isn't paying? Taking the fees out of the tx itself would also allow for pool subscriptions. I pay 0.01 to "BTC Miner" and get a set amount of transactions. It would allow for economies of scale, i.e. bit-pay could get a better rate per tx than the guy that processes 1 per month. Dust transaction sites would have a different agreement.edit: sites like btc guild could also "guarantee" transaction times (say 60 minutes or your tx fee back) based on their hashing power relative to the network.  I asked a question in the legal forum:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=327073.0 about it.I'm making a mockup of exactly how it will work. Will get something going in the next few days. In the thread How to use fiat currencies for Bitcoin offline transactions? I proposed an idea, which is to send coins to a special address using the serial number on a $1 US dollar note. To release the coins, you need 2 keys. 1 key is the serial number (public info), and another is one that I own (private). Nothing is written on the note. Bitcoins could then trade off-line using the counterfeit security of the USG, with me as a trusted party. To redeem, you must send me the physical note and another address to move the coins. (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=305590.msg3443357#msg3443357)As a resident of the US, am I asking for trouble? I would not exchange any fiat for bitcoins, just use the inherent security features of US fiat. I'm keeping the $1 as fees. I wouldn't issue the bitcoins, that is done by the person first holding the $1 bill and the address is calculated by him.DeathAndTaxes's recommendation seem relevant in: Online Wallet/Holding Services FinCEN registration? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=322821.msg3456848#msg3456848"If I were creating a e-wallet service that did not exchange virtual currency for EITHER 'real currency' or another virtual currency I would not register at this time"However, using the term "3rd party" means regulation in my experience. Yeah, I might have to do just that. Any idea what the legal issues would be? I don't want to go to SEC jail over $20 The probability of finding a private key to a specific address is the same probability of finding a hash of all zeroes. I don't know what the lowest hash found to date is (maybe 17 leading zeroes of of 64?), but its not even close. You'll need to have computing power many trillion-trillion times more powerful than the current bitcoin network, and a few trillion-trillion+ years to run it. just because the market is 1 BTC = $200 USD at the moment doesn't mean everyone must exchange freely at that rate. You chose not to (you would rather buy BTC with USD), others choose to do so (sell BTC for USD). Critique my idea?If a trusted entity is involved, send coins to sha(serial number) under their trusted public key. * A Trusted Bitcoin Company puts out a public address on a website:04C4F72B99D120AFDE0C4CEAD09CFA4C0336F4C672807E5D8BAA80C1F984A260AA1F2EAFC579546 4F7EC97D5D642F7ECB72EB1F1E53F554CCB1A4B67B309FB78BE* I look in my wallet, and have a $1 US fiat note serial number b71626423n. Using an EC calculator (bitaddress.org or armory for instance), I multiply the public key and the sha(serial number). The sha of "b71626423n" is : 0aecd03819d9c5a693df67e876d5d228270b8f9b725e6b3c7da9c9bd5f83d723* Which results in a public key with bitcoin address: 1PnMoiwmLBmGMgyNTHVYo1jq467JzAN3jo* I send 0.10 BTC to 1PnMoiwmLBmGMgyNTHVYo1jq467JzAN3jo.* The Trusted Bitcoin Company probably doesn't know that I sent coins to the bill (adding optional entropy to the bill ensures they don't.)* I meet you for a trade, and say this note is worth 0.10 BTC. You do the math yourself and discover that there is indeed 0.10 BTC at that address. Because you trust the Bitcoin Company (or know someone who does), you know they are the only ones who can decrypt the private key and coins are locked until redeemed.* You wish to redeem the 0.10 BTC. You physically send in the $1 note to the company with an address that you control. The Trusted Bitcoin Company receives the genuine note and sends the balance to the address provided. Depending on how trustworthy the entity is, there wouldn't be many redeemed, as the physical form may be superior. * Trusted Bitcoin Company keeps the $1 fiat as fees.Here is the private key to the public key above:5JjVqgLXS1cRmjxBJRcpfSnR6o4nYhmafMhDDWbyYiCfviJMQUMEDIT: The bitcoin ATM system would be an optimal trusted entity. You put that $1 into the machine, it reads the $1 bill and serial number and asks where do you want your 0.10 + $1/200 = 0.105 coins sent. Bitcoin needs to be viewed as an asset among portfolio managers. I haven't done the analysis, but bet that the correlation between bitcoin and any other traditional asset is zero. From there, it doesn't matter what the volatility is - it can be added to portfolios to reduce overall portfolio risk no matter what the volatility of bitcoin happens to be.  proof? Maybe we are all talking ourselves up and that in reality, no one gives a damn about us, including law enforcement.  Fixed. Looks like a ripple hiccup and we got out of sync. Thank you for pointing it out. The site had flagged us that there was an imbalance and we like to do things manually when something doesn't go as planned. There was no chance that funds were lost.Thanks for using DR! it is automatic/immediate* (but have to wait for 1 confirm due to the site being hit with double spends) Well yes, but for non-china customers it involves the BTC/CNY spread at the moment. My fault, I shouldn't have inferred that it is currently easy to get CNY into ripple. There is a CNY.ripplecn / USD.bitstamp pair on ripple for those that want to take a shot at arbing. Not the most liquid at the moment (.1506 bid / .1610 ask), but more eyes on it the better. the "How to Play" describes in better detail (http://diceoncrack.com/howtoplay), but here is a quick rundown:* Sending an amount to the "Simple" strategies is a fixed amount (0.10 TRC in this case) up to 15,000 times. You can change the threshold and exit points by the dust you send on your payment. For example sending X.XXXXX407 TRC to the simple address will look for a "magic" number less than 100 and if you ever get to 2x your initial wager, your wager loop exits.* Martingale strategies will keep betting enough to get you positive if you win the next bet. The [BUSTO] and [EXIT] form define how you treat the situation when you have to wager more than your balance to get the desired effect.* There is a fun reverse Matingale strategy (elagnitraM), where you keep parlaying wins until you get to an exit point. * Minefield is quite popular. You need to make 1000 steps through a minefield. Each step defaults to a success to 99.93%, which returns (about) 2x the initial wager.* 3 Card poker is just like the casino game. Send an amount to the address and it will simulate a 3 card poker hand.For these games, you'll need to own the private keys that you send. Otherwise, any winnings will be sent back to the shared wallet.Best of luck! Why the assumption the OP negative on bitcoin? OP's may be saying there is room for $1000 coins. OP has tried to move assets in the past, but government regulation is very cumbersome and costly. Bitcoin makes it possibleOP is saying very few people are selling their coins at these prices. If prices were higher, it could flush out some of the early adopter's coins.OP is saying bitcoin popularity is booming. There is even specialized equipment built just for bitcoin. It doesn't of course. Haven't used vanitygen in a while, and think it gives out a probability of 50% to start with? if it guesses at a rate of X/second and the probability of success of each guess is Y, the chance of success in the next second is 1-(1-Y)**X.example:I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10,000. You have 10,000 guesses per minute. (blah blah, assume i get to choose new number after each guess)The chance you hit in the next minute is 1-(1-0.0001)^10000 = 63.21%. If you want the 50% mark, solve as ln(.5)/ln(.9999) = 6931.125 guesses. Since you guess at 10,000 per minute, the 50% mark is in 6931.125/10,000 minutes or 41.59 secondsAnd that is what vanitygen puts out, 50% chance in the next 41.6 seconds. If it still acts the same way, once 41.59 seconds goes by, it says 75% chance in the next 41.59 seconds, but it really means 75% chance in 83.17 seconds from when you started. Its game theory & con game rolled into one.Â  If the debt ceiling can be raised forever, I can assume at some point it will be 950+ Trillion and growing. This requires dollar creation to pay off. Knowing that each dollar is worth less in the future ad infinitum, I can conclude the dollar today is worthless.But keep the dog and pony show going every time the ceiling is hit, and I might not make that conclusion. Expect bigger and better shows in the future.
DividendRippler.com has turned ripple into a decentralized stock exchange. The accounting for shares and dividends is decentralized in ripple itself. I agree. The Fed was expected to taper, and they didn't. I see this leading to more and more people wondering if it will ever stop. I'm looking into why it took a bit. Thanks for using DR! cool game.

Sadly, this is typical. While I don't have exact details on how each business works, it is too risky & costly to have a warehouse of silver and gold on-site.

Awesome. Issued and redeemed many DYM over the last few months! I'm not a developer, but this reminded me: I have been looking for something I call "nuisance encryption", similar to hashcash. I give you an encoded message and the key to decrypt it. Your computer must do some work to come up with the final message. If you could get enough people to use it, it would become in-feasible to decode *everything*.benefit for sender: you can push an encrypted message to anyone, don't have to have a public key - "You must download this app to read this message" or send them to a java page. haha. Never noticed that, thank you. Off topic: I had a private key in my signature (with bitcoins on it) for months and no one took them, when coins got to $200 each I decided to redeem myself. It was base64, so it wasn't obvious. Wanted to prove that no one looks at the signatures, guess I'm guilty of not checking my own sig.Cheatsheet - its not complicated once the idea is understood. Start out trusting only Bitstamp for USD and BTC, and go from there.  After verifying my bank account at snapswap.us, I was able to get $100 into ripple. I then bought dividendrippler btc ious, which I then redeemed in my client. Pretty cool - business got done with 2 independent gateways.I have not tried to redeem USD ious to my bank account with snapswap yet. You'll be able to withdraw via coinlab It is back up. Sorry for the downtime! The large increase in difficulty from late sunday night could have an effect. Less coins for new miners to sell. Just hit ZeroHedge We'll see this on Pawn Stars in the next 12 months. DividendRippler doesn't hold XRP. The trading isn't done on DividendRippler's site, it is done on the ripple network. You need to bring up the BTC/XRP market in ripple, making sure the issuer of BTC is DividendRippler. This may be related to the upgrade to 2.24
I apologize. The number is the amount of seconds the server is behind, currently about 50,000 or 14 hours. I'm looking into it.  F- The odds are dependent on how many others are playing, it is the same as a raffle.Â  The selection numbers are the last digits of the block hash, for example "4d783" in this block: http://blockchain.info/block-height/237472The odds of any winner in a pick 3 is 1 in 16^3, or 1 in 4096. If you hold 1 ticket and 19 others are holding 1 ticket, you have a 1 in 20 chance of winning (eventually). Of note, it doesn't matter when you join a game, as you have to hold the ticket number when it hits - meaning you can't have the prior block be 12345 and then you select ticket #12345.

If there is force placed on me to comply, I'd rather sell my coins and move on with my life. Yeah, the 0.01 is basically lost. Ripple controls who owns the IOUs - 0.01 was sent in for redemption to the issuer, and no longer exists. Since the fee is 0.10, there is nothing to send. When you deliver an LTC IOU back to DividendRippler's ripple address, DividendRippler sends the stored LTC to the LTC address on record (specified by the dt=xxxxx). Similarly, when you deliver a BTC IOU created by DividendRippler, a BTC is sent. You would not want to deliver XRP to DividendRippler, it is only used for verification when changing addresses.Keep in mind that what you send and what is delivered is not necessarily the same. You can send XRP from your client, but if BTC are delivered to DividendRippler at a specific dt=xxxxx address, this flags DividendRippler to send a specie payment to the dt=xxxxx on record, regardless of what was sent. http://www.myfoxorlando.com/video?clipId=8905459&topVideoCatNo=237186&autoStart=trueSaw this on my local news last night. She starts out by saying "It can be a safer way to shop on line".  Instead of owning a bitcoin, you give it to DR, and we give you a promise to pay (an IOU) for the bitcoin! This is counter-intuitive, as the reason many here on the forums were attracted to bitcoin for the ability to control their money. Granted, an IOU of 1.0 bitcoins < 1.0 bitcoins. But the value lost in specie vs IOUs is made up in the services that can be provided by the ripple network.As much as we hate banks, most of us keep balances at a bank for a few reasons. It may be safer to keep $20,000 as an IOU at the local bank rather than keep 200 $100 bills at your house (theft/fire). It is easier to pay your bills with bank IOUs with checks, ACH, or bill pay than running around town with cash. Sending large amounts of money via bank wire across the country is best with the banking system of IOUs, rather than sending wads of cash via UPS.To sum up, DR is a gateway that lets you get your BTC/LTC/TRC/NMC into and out of ripple IOUs on demand. Safe and automated.Solutions that gateways, such as DividendRippler can provide:* Safety. Having some of your BTC locked away at DR can make your portfolio safer than keeping it on a local machine.* Due to double spends, merchants will value a BTC IOU from a trusted gateway > a random stranger specie BTC. Think vending machines, coffee shops, etc where waiting for confirms is not possible. Similar to green addresses. * Merchants and customers no longer have to agree on a currency to base the transaction. **This is huge** How many threads have you read "so and so just started accepting bitcoin!". Pfft. With ripple, a merchant can accept Sweedish Krona, and the customer can pay with Litecoin. Ripple finds someone who prefers Krona to Litecoin and makes the trade.edited 2013-08-19: Added NMC Yes, you can send Bitstamp BTC IOUs to a DR ripple address to get the actual BTC in the client. What really happens is ripple finds someone who trusts DR and Bitstamp for BTC, and swaps balances so that you can withdraw the DR IOUs. The conversion rate is 1:1, there is no bid/ask between bitstamp and DR. This is why the Trade Fortress "BTC giveaway" was so dangerous. Ripple will find someone who trusts Trade Fortress and DR (or Trade Fortress and Bitstamp) and swap IOUs in their account, replacing good IOUs with worthless Trade Fortress IOUs. Note you have to pay bitstamp the transfer fee (they charge 0.20%). So if you have 1.000 BTC in Bitstamp, you can withdraw 0.998 BTC to a DividendRippler BTC address. You're over-thinking Consider this - the US used to be on a min-ripple system, the gold standard. People routinely traded in their gold for paper IOUs and bank IOUs (and vise-versa). Ripple is a way to do this for all assets. We're getting lost in why people would want to turn in perfectly good assets for IOUs of said asset, but there can be advantages of doing so. The MtGox / Bitstamp market, currently a 4.7% premium to hold dollars at MtGox.Certainly something to watch over the next few days. oh Only trust gateways that are worth trusting. When sending USD, BTC, Credit Card numbers, Social security numbers, etc to a gateway such as MtGox, BTC-E, BitcoinStore.com, Amazon.com, Citibank, you must trust them to be good stewards of your BTC / USD / Credit Card / Data / Products.Why do you see gateways in ripple differently from a local bank, retaurant, amazon, etc? I'm not familiar with all of this, can you elaborate please? The UIEGA thing kept banks from doing business with offshore poker/gambling sites. Why couldn't they just announce the same thing with bitcoin exchanges? This affects dwolla, and dwolla only? Will they target banks to not accept/send wires from/to Gox? OT: How is extortion a crime? "Pay me $1000 or I'll release these pictures of you and a goat" -> You're the jerk who did wacky things with the goat. If it were me, I'd gladly pay $1000 to keep it quiet. In fact, if I did something shameful (assume legal) and someone had pictures of it, I may approach that person and offer money for his silence. I want to keep his interests with mine.Don't get me wrong "Pay me $1000 or I'll cut your wife's thumb off" -> Illegal, as it involves violence. But the former case is a simple transaction benefiting both parties. The 'error' payments are there because you have not set sufficient trust with dividendrippler.com (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX). You'll need 3 lines of trust, one for TRC, BTC and LTC. Try increasing the trust - you'll have to type in LTC and TRC, they are not in the dropdown box. After that, send 1 XRP to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=1 from your ripple address. This will flag our server to try issuing the IOUs in your account again.I see that is your redeem address controlled by you, set up in DR. Once you have funds in your ripple account, try sending them to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=100009111. Note this is the dividendrippler address, followed by your account number. The account number 100009111 tells our servers to send the specie payment (in this case BTC) to your 186ZJv7Bm1ydrsVxPDuVtdJNZZUwAXL2jH address. A fun trick is that you can send LTC, TRC, XRP, (or bitstamp BTC ious) and it should find a path to be withdrawn as BTC if you select it as so.Same applies as above. What is super cool about ripple is that you can have TRC, LTC, XRP, etc in your ripple address, but don't have to withdraw in kind!

There is no movement of coins in the blockchain. Instead, MtGox changes its pointers to your account, debiting here, crediting there. MtGox runs its own proprietary version of ripple. So does Bitstamp and Btc-e. Ripple is a generic system that everyone can use, and not just for bitcoins and USD.Question: You have 100 x $100 bills. How do you send that $10,000 to someone in seattle from new york? You can FedEx the physical paper bills in a box (send specie payment), or you can get into the banking system by getting an IOU at your bank in New York and "sending" it to seattle. Most people choose the IOU system, due to the convenience. The regulation should be "if you deal with bitcoin, don't come bellyaching to the CFTC. We can only 'protect' you when you use USD". Count me out. We're all used to the super inflated fiat regime. I'm holding out for them to adapt to us. 0.03 BTC for a gallon of gasoline seems high. Sure:advanced -> trade. TBL/BTCBase (TBL, not TRL) is rNF5qUPCcge7uSStj6oKuoQs38BaM8362s, and the counter (BTC) is from dividendrippler (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX) May dividend has been paid. There is an error with one shareholder that does not have enough trust to receive payments.https://dividendrippler.com/asset?ra=rNF5qUPCcge7uSStj6oKuoQs38BaM8362s Debt, lending, creating out of thin air? Don't deal with those gateways. The gateway dividendrippler.com backs all IOUs with specie BTC/LTC/TRC 1:1 ratio. No BTC are created. While not supported yet, we can easily prove we control all BTC/LTC/TRC and the amount of IOUs are public information. It would be 1:1 ratio at all times.Why does one need ripple?What if you trust Bitstamp or DividendRippler more than the guy paying you in BTC? No need to wait for confirms, as all IOUs have gone through the process of confirmation.Think how exchanges work: Bitstamp, MtGox, Btc-e, etc.. All have their own trading software, their own matching algos, and their own IOU system in place. All have their own rules for depositing and withdrawing. Little redundant, dont you think? Why not have a decentralized system that everyone can use? Now you only need a gateway to specialize in accepting and redeeming IOUs.  yes, dividendrippler.com holds the physical BTC, LTC, TRC in our wallets. Your ripple wallet holds the IOUs from dividendrippler.When you pass dividendrippler IOUs to a 3rd party, that party does not have to trust you at all, nor you trust the 3rd party. But they do have to trust dividendrippler to be able to redeem the IOU, as the IOUs are not able to be counterfeit. It is different in real life - if I paid you with a coupon for a free BigMac, you might question the IOU is authentic (did I print it up on my color printer?). In ripple, you need to trust McDonalds for delivering on the BigMac, because its provable they issued it.In this sense, I wouldn't describe it as a chain of trust. In fact, you can pay someone with your DividendRippler IOUs that doesn't trust DividendRippler. If that person trusts Bitstamp, ripple will find someone who trusts DividendRippler AND Bitstamp, and adjust their balances so that payment can be made.Let me know if I didn't answer your question... Thanks!Yes, you can trade. In ripple, advanced -> trade. To trade dividendrippler.com ious, you will need to set the issuer to dividendrippler (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX) and most likely bitstamp if trading vs USD.For trading BTC (dividendrippler) vs XRP, advanced->trade. Select BTC/XRP. Set issuer to DividendRippler.com. The market will be displayed under "order book". The order entry is pretty straight forward, enter how many BTC you are willing to part with for XRP. There is a tab for "Buy BTC" and one for "Sell BTC". Warren Buffet has commented on bitcoin? Come a long way.What are the odds Obama says "Bitcoin" by the end of the year? I'm sure he would be pro-bitcoin and glad of all the wealth created because of itÂ   The whole point of bitcoin is that no regulated entity can touch it. A currency created by the most regulated industry on the planet offers nothing more than what we have now.

I may have mis-spoke in my last reply, I don't trust myself for DYM, I just issue them. Since I am the issuer, I am forced to take them back in ripple. Simply PM me, "I want to redeem an amount of DYM, will be coming from address r....., Please send the physical dimes to Bob Smith, 123 Maple Street, anytown USA." When I see the DYM come in, I'll ship them out right away at my expense. Think of DYM as a warehouse receipt for a physical dime. The supply of DYM decreases with a redemption.I've had plenty of people send me physical dimes. I'll give you my physical address, and you ship at your cost, with instructions to "please credit ripple address r....." When I receive, I credit the DYM to that ripple address. The amount of DYM will increase by what what received.How are they created? I didn't do anything other than "send 1 DYM to r....." from my client to someone that gave me a dime. Its important to note that when sending DYM back to me, I only trust myself for DYM.Â  If your cousin starts up a DYM, I can not honor them, would have to be redeemed by your cousin.Not sure how to enforce gift cards, what if someone sends you stolen gift cards, but not discovered until the gift card IOU was issued?

There can be IPOs, bond issues, and high-rises to increase supply, but this is not a large price risk to the market. The price is simply what will someone pay for it. These prices are subject to price collapses, as lower prices can actually reduce demand in human psyche.In supply driven markets such as orange juice, gasoline, grains. The demand is relatively known, but the supply is a concern. Weather and war impacts the potential supply of these markets. The price risk to these markets is to the upside as a frost and drought can wipe out a large portion of oranges and corn. A hurricane can cause natural gas supply to be halted. War in the middle east shocks supply concerns of crude oil. Update: DR will now fetch quotes from ripple on each refresh. Look for bargains in the ripple. We can do just about any asset.

Enter your ripple address in the search bar, hit "register" and send 1 XRP to the address shown (include the dt=1). PM or post here when complete. Keep in mind that bitstamp already had you send specie coins to them first. They gave you an address, which you sent and waited for the 6 confirms. THEN you asked for ripple funds. We are actually 1 less step - just send funds to the issue address.As for 'sending' to get something, it's confusing because we have been exposed to a different system for the last 100 years. In the old days when we were on a gold standard, you would bring in gold for a gold IOU (US currency), and redeem us currency for gold. Same concept here. Now, we are all used to the "IOU Nothing" system, where nothing is redeemable. You should(?) be able to go to the BTC.bitstamp / XRP market and put in an order, and have it ripple through with DR btc. I can't test from my wallets, they are all tainted with bitstamp btc. Let me know how it turns out. Other option is to use the BTC.dr / XRP market, but it isn't as deep. I have it as complete - you did everything right. We wait for 6 confirms, that was probably the issue. There is one global retry for all payments that are in error. To get an immediate result, send 1 XRP to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=1 from your ripple account. This will flag the server to retry errors in your accout.We'd like to make it easier.

The 'offline' is hit and miss for me. You'll need to be able to trust DividendRippler for the 3 chains, plus 1 XRP for signing up. But this giveaway is to increase your balance above zero. Well please try to withdraw them after playing around, and let us know of any issues. We're hoping to change that. It takes a very raw way to look at banking and IOUs. But once the mindset is there, it becomes clear. There is an "AHA" moment that is needed. For example - how would you explain twitter to someone 25 years ago? 
You don't 'owe' us anything! When you hold DR IOUs, DR owes you. You are correct, any amount of XRP would do. In fact there is a social engineering angle to using exactly 1.000 XRP. It may be changed to a smaller, random amount.In the OP, I did list the 1 XRP as a fee.Why am I sending 'real BTC' for IOUs? One point of the giveaway is to show how to get funds into ripple. Anyone can send to your personal issue addresses for ripple credit. Whoops. Not set up. You'll need to hit register then send 1 XRP to the address to prove you own it.

Giving away ~$5 worth of BTC/LTC/TRC (mixed, our choice) to the first 100 replies. Ripple haters welcome.To participate:1) Set up your ripple address on the DividendRippler.com site. Â DividendRippler OP2) Post/PM your ripple address after registering on the site.3) We will send specie payments of BTC / LTC / TRC to the issue addresses. I'll reply with the tx(s). Total will be ~$5 worth. Our choice what to send, you get what you get.edit: ** Forgot to mention ** You will need to trust DividendRippler.com for an amount greater than what I send. If this happens, you'll need to flag the server to try it again by sending an XRP.Do whatever you wish with the coins - trade them, deposit in bitstamp, or just withdraw them. To trade them in ripple, the issuing address will need to be DividendRippler.com (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX). But payments should just ripple through the system, if a path is found.We'd like to get responses about the user experience, and of course any bugs. To be eligible:* Must have at least +32 posts to qualify.* Only 1 giveaway per ripple address per user.** To clear up some confusion: We have called this an 'anonymous' gateway. By anonymous, we don't mean a mixer. Anonymous means no username & password needed to use the gateway. Thanks for testing it out. The "try again later" message was probably just a warning that all processing was a few seconds old. I'm trying to understand the workflow, you entered your ripple address in the search bar. From there, you had the option to enter a BTC/LTC/TRC address (not necessary if you don't want to redeem IOUs in DR). Hitting 'register' should prompt you to send 1 XRP to the dividend rippler address with ?dt=1.You may be all set up. If you see issue addresses, then you definitely are set up! An issue address is how you create a DR IOU in your ripple address. Sending to that address gives you ripple credits. Sending from ripple to DR's ripple address destroys the IOU and you will receive funds at the redemption addresses.Feel free to PM/post your ripple address and I'll check to see. Right now, nothing other than OpenCoin having a bad reputation. When decentralized though, I believe it would take a consensus. Much like a consensus would be needed to increase btc to more than 21 million coins. Do you think this bitcoin rally is due to people printing up their own money in ripple, depositing it in bitstamp and buying bitcoins?That statement is false. This is like saying I write $100 on an index card and expect to use it to purchase goods. Please add to list: BTC / LTC / TRC ripple gateway: DividendRippler.com - Anonymous ripple gatewayhttps://www.dividendrippler.com ripple makes it easy  Simple and complex at the same time. I know you're familiar with ripple.Someone comes to us and requests to issue an asset. We create a ripple address for them, needed so we can control the amount of shares outstanding. You don't want the issuer to issue another 1000 shares while you sleep. In the case of TBL, that person was issued 100 shares, assume for this case it was rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt, but it doesn't have to be a current owner. He then distributed them as shown below (75%, 15% and 10%). This is a snapshot taken for this post from the asset link, the asset holders can change at anytime, and updated in real-time!Suppose the company wants to pay out a 2 BTC dividend. By submitting 2.000 BTC to 1HY2oZop..., all current asset holders will get a pro-rated amount of those BTC. So, rLDDq8z... would get 75% of the 2.000 BTC, and so on down the line. If the dividend was in LTC, the payment should be made to the LTC address. I want to stress that it is important to name rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX as "DividendRippler.com". This is due to the fact that XRP sent from your ripple address changes our servers. A 3rd party may convince you to send 1 XRP to "his" address, when really he is changing your account information. IÂm pleased to announce DividendRippler.com (DR), an anonymous ripple gateway. The gatewayÂs function is to create and destroy ripple IOUs on demand. No logins or passwords. Not described in this post, but DR will also create and maintain custom listed and unlisted assets by users (link)ÂMake everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.Â Â Albert EinsteinThe gateway is simple:ÂÂ Â Â DR ties one of its own BTC/LTC/TRC addresses to each ripple address. IOUs are created and sent to your ripple account when specie payment comes to these addresses.ÂÂ Â Â Similarly, DR ties your BTC/LTC/TRC addresses to a ripple address. When an IOU is sent to DRÂs ripple address (using the assigned destination tag), the IOU is destroyed and specie payment is made to your client.First time setup:ÂÂ Â Â Add the contact ÂrfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDXÂ to the ripple wallet, Â named ÂDividendRippler.comÂÂÂ Â Â Trust DividendRippler.com for the currencies in the amount you wish to use. (BTC, LTC and TRC). ÂÂ Â Â Enter your ripple receiving address (rÂ) into the search bar on the DividendRippler.com website.ÂÂ Â Â Enter BTC/LTC/TRC addresses you wish to have specie payments returned. You donÂt have to enter all 3 at this time; they can be added / edited later.ÂÂ Â Â Clicking ÂregisterÂ will lock edit functions for 5 minutes. During this time, you must send 1 XRP to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=1 from the ripple address requesting changes. If this is not done, the edit will fail.ÂÂ Â Â Take note of your account number (destination tag), this is what you will need to get specie payment.Issuing an IOU:ÂÂ Â Â Send specie payment to the address created by DR for the given ripple address. These addresses will not change, so feel free to give it out to others to receive payments.ÂÂ Â Â 6 confirms required for all chains.ÂÂ Â Â Once confirmed, the IOU will be issued in the ripple address.ÂÂ Â Â If there was not enough trust for the IOU, the status will change to ÂerrorÂ. Give adequate trust and then flag the server to try again by sending 1 XRP to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=1. You wonÂt get your XRP back.Redeeming an IOU:ÂÂ Â Â Send the IOU back to DRÂs ripple address (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=<account number>) will redeem it.ÂÂ Â Â Using the destination tag (?dt=) directs DR on where to return the specie payment.ÂÂ Â Â No fees to send the IOU back to DR. Keep this in mind. If the receiver of the IOU is going to convert to specie, it will be cheaper to send the IOU directly to DR. Notes on trustÂÂ Â Â Only trust DR for the amount you are comfortable with in total balance. Consider the trust line can be exhausted at any time with no action by you.ÂÂ Â Â No trust is needed to destroy an IOU. This means you donÂt have to trust DR in order to accept specie payment from DR IOUs!Fees:Users will pay 3 fees when using DR. 1)Â Â Â Ripple: While there is no fee to create an IOU and no fee to destroy an IOU issued by DR, fees are charged when IOUs are transferred to another ripple address. DividendRippler.com has set a maximum fee of 0.19%. The fees charged will not increase beyond 0.19% without a 30 day notice on the front page of DividendRippler.com. That said, DividendRippler is launching with a 0.15% fee, and reserves the right to lower or raise this fee without prior notice (up to 0.19%).2)Â Â Â When an IOU is redeemed, the end user will pay all chain fees if required. Example, destroying a 5.0000 BTC IOU may only return 4.9995 in the userÂs client. This fee is payable to the network, not DR.3)Â Â Â The XRPs needed to communicate with the DR servers for setup and retries.2013-05-20 Update: Chain fees are now fixed, which is the minimum fee requirement. DividendRippler.com will pick up any additional fees. BTC 0.0005, LTC 0.1000, TRC 0.0000, NMC 0.005.Security:ÂÂ Â Â Without giving details, we have created a redundant system. The web front end is separated from the server.ÂÂ Â Â Please keep valid redemption address at all times. We may (or may have already) implemented a security feature which returns IOUs in an emergency. ÂÂ Â Â The redemption addresses should only be pointed to addresses you control. If pointed to other address and coins are redeemed to your ripple account, specie coins will not come to your client.Issues:ÂÂ Â Â Transaction fees are paid by receiver as required. You canÂt send an exact specie amount, because fees will be paid according to network requirements.ÂÂ Â Â We have plans to implement a hard cap on the maximum fee, but currently not supported. If you need to move large amounts and donÂt want to pay the fee, you will need to redeem the IOU and take specie payment. Remember you can also redeem the IOU with receiverÂs destination tag to avoid fees.ÂÂ Â Â While possible, it is not suggested to use DR to send specie payments to a merchant using your own ripple address. It is cumbersome, insecure, and exact fees cannot be calculated beforehand. However, please ask them to support ripple and DR IOUs!ÂÂ Â Â DO NOT USE DividendRippler to play satoshidice or similar games where you need to control the sending address. It will not work.If the markets are deep enough, here are some ripple tricks to try:ÂÂ Â Â Try depositing BTC into Bitstamp without trusting Bitstamp. ÂÂ Â Â Try depositing USD or BTC into Bitstamp with LTC. (Requires LTC markets Â anyone?)ÂÂ Â Â Send a BTC tip to my client, with whatever currency you happen to have at the time: rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=100000304ÂÂ Â Â Get yourself a physical silver dime by sending me a DYM (PM me first is best).>>>Finally, DividendRippler.com is in beta. We have done our best to keep everything safe and secure. We will try to make everything right in case of an error, but there are no warranties.edited 2013-08-19 Added NMC I am pleased to announce DividendRippler.com (DR). DR provides an easy way to pro-rate payments to asset holders, much like a dividend payment. BTC/LTC/TRC is currently supported. We are not an exchange; ripple is left doing the heavy lifting, such as trading and ownership maintenance.DividendRippler is simple. When a BTC/LTC/TRC payment comes into the main asset address, DR calculates current asset holders and sends out pro-rated ripple payments accordingly. All information is public.DividendRippler is set up to offer listed as well as unlisted assets. Listed assets will require a signed offering document. Unlisted assets wonÂt. Both listed and unlisted assets will require DR to create the asset.Listed asset at time of launch:TBL Â The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery (TAABL.NET) (rNF5qUPCcge7uSStj6oKuoQs38BaM8362s)Trust:ÂÂ Â Â In order to trade a DR asset, youÂll need to trust the underlying asset in ripple, such as rNF5qUPCcge7uSStj6oKuoQs38BaM8362s in the case for TBL.ÂÂ Â Â Because payments are made in the ripple network using DR, you will have to trust DRÂs gateway address for the dividend. This address is static: rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX.Fees:ÂÂ Â Â DR collects no fees to issue payments. The user will face chain fees as required by the network. For example 1.0000 BTC redemption may only return 0.9995 BTC.ÂÂ Â Â DR collects no fees on asset trading (because they are not technically DR assets)ÂÂ Â Â DR does collect gateway fees if the BTC, LTC or TRC IOUs are transferred (currently 0.15%). Note ripple does not allow DR to charge a fee to redeem its own IOUs, so specie payment can always be taken free of charge. More information on the gateway is here.ÂÂ Â Â Initiating a new asset will have fees, currently unknown. While in the initial testing phase of DR, the fee is waived.Have an asset you would like to offer? While DR is in beta, weÂre offering to bring a few assets public over the next month. If youÂd like to have your asset considered, please PM.  I agree. I was just trying to come up with different terminology for IOU in ripple, but gave up, because that's exactly what it is. We don't deposit money in banks, we lend our money to the bank. I voted 'yes', but why should bitcoin support alternative currencies? If alt coins only value is riding the coat tails of bitcoin, maybe it isn't such a great alt coin. I don't see this "domino" effect taking place, at least not anymore chance than currently exists. Bitstamp could be issuing IOUs in ripple and secretly using specie on the side. However, they don't need ripple to do this. They could have less USD or BTC than they have in customer accounts, hoping there will never be a run.In fact, wouldn't ripple help prevent this? Their ripple address balance is public information, customer account balances are not. If I tally their ripple address info and it comes to $4.3 billion, I might suspect something and take delivery of my USD and BTC. 
With this logic, paypal wouldn't exist, because $1 in my pocket is worth more than $1 at paypal. Paypal exists because there is utility in moving that $1 when physical transfer is not practical. Logout/login would be my first guess. At $66 here with 259 days to expiration and a 10% daily volatility, I'd quote the price of a $50 put at ~$21. (But 10% seems low, I'm not selling at $21)BTW, that puts a call price at ~$38.  The power of ripple:One way to fund your bitstamp account with USD is buying physical silver dimes, exchange for DYM through my service. Because others have placed bids in the market for bitstamp USD, you can use that to your advantage. Sending DYM in the example below will fill an order in the market, raise Bitstamp USD for yourself which is then sent to bitstamp. Beautiful, isn't it?You can also withdraw via bitstamp USD, convert to DYM, take delivery of your dimes and cash out at a local coin dealer. In the future, bitstamp may ask how you would like your withdrawl, which you can ask for it in DYM.TTBit. Granted the DYM market is a bit thin at the moment - need more eyes on the market, and more willing to take delivery. But it does show the power of ripple, and how all assets become fungible with each other. I predict you will be able to fund your Bitstamp account with Arby's coupons in the not so distant future. You'll need bitfloor to support ripple.But if bitfloor had withdraw codes (dont think they do), a gateway could stand in the middle and issue bitfloor IOUs for codes, and vice versa. These would then be fungible with other exchange IOUs (as long as there was a path). There is a DYM/XRP market. I saw it last at 800 bid offered at 1200, but feel free to put in an order. You have to trust rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3E to hold DYM.As for the trust paths for USD, you still need to have USD, trust lines are not enough, it doesn't work like a credit card. Getting USD is easiest at bitstamp, sell $5 worth and withdraw via ripple. DYM is just held in the client, no server needed. OP is right. Ripple has the best chance at becoming the decentralized exchange that everyone is crying for. For MtGox to function, it has to manage both assets (USD and BTC), as well as actually creating the exchange. Don't like MtGox's AML policy? Worried about their handling of BTC? Don't like the lag? What are your other options? MtGox is the jack of all trades, master of none.But ripple brings together gateways. A gateway may only have one function, such as exchanging BTC for BTC ious. Another gateway may be exchanging USD for USD ious. The gateways don't have to worry about matching orders or creating an exchange. All they have to do is give specie for ious. With each part of an exchange broken down, now you can select where you do business with USD (and USD alone). Another gateway may have BTC security policies that you find attractive. Why not make it voluntary? I can check a box in my client and those coins will be destroyed at the pre-determined rate set by a handful of people. Or would this be a forced issue, where everyone has to participate? MtGox will suspend all trading, but they should suspend orders not on 0.05 price increments. Or, accept order prices down to 0.0001, but charge for them, which would be fine for larger orders. The idea was that many people get their salary at the end of the calendar month, which is then put into the stock market. So buy a few days before they get their check, then sell after they have bought.As for vehicles to trade, I would consider the S&P mini futures. Each contract is ~$60,000 right now. Great liquidity, and you can get $5 fills. As a bonus, if there are any profits at the end of the year you get to report 60% as long term cap gains (40% short term). Its a decent chunk of change to be sure, and you will want to be careful not to lever up which is so easy to do. >>> Note: This post is for entertainment purposes only. It is not intended to be a complete portfolio solution.Hope you don't mind me sharing this in the bitcoin forums. I've traded stocks/commodities/futures most of my life, and often asked where I believe the price of stocks/gold/bitcoin are headed. I'll always have an opinion and love to talk markets, but making money involves strategies, and managing those strategies.Here is one. I applied this strategy to the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the last 90 years (April 1923 - April 2013). 12 trades a year, each one enters the market (long) with $100,000 and held for a week or so. The results:Number of trades: 1058Average trade net profit: $636 (0.636%)Winning trades: 666 (62.95%)Overall, you are in the market 37% of the time, flat the other 63%. The 90 year performance:Skeptical? Here is the opposite strategy. 12 trades a year, you are long the market the 63% of the time, but flat 37%.Number of trades: 1058Average trade net profit: -$0.15 (-0.00%)Winning trades: 567 (53.59%)Here is the chart of the 90 year performance:The super complex strategy:Buy stocks on the 27th of the month, sell stocks on the 8th. The coded strategy gets in on the first trading day after the 26th, and out after the 7th.as coded in Tradestation Easy Language:Code:buyx=100000/close;If dayofmonth(date)>26 then buy buyx contracts today on the close;If dayofmonth(date)>7 and dayofmonth(date)<20 then sell today on the close;A 0.636% 12 times a year is 7.9% annualized, while only being in the market 1/3 of the time. Conversely, the Dow Jones has risen from 101.1 to 14865.14 in those 90 years, or 5.7%.You could tinker with the strategy. Adjust position size based on volatility, add stops, etc. Thanks for reading, happy trading.As always, past performance does not guarantee future results! ShireSilver,I thought of you when creating DYM. Why not create something similar for ShireSilver? In addition to a shopping cart, just offer on ripple 1 gram SIL for $2.00 (your current prices). When someone redeems, you ship to them. A market may develop and wouldn't have to have a buyback program. I don't post it, but considering PO Box.PM sent. Thanks for looking Please post the other 1000 screenshots selling at 14, 15, 25, 35, 55, 70, etc when it didn't work in your favor. MtGox should consider a fee for orders. You get 500 free per day, after that, must pay a token amount to get your order in their DB. Or consider a mtgox subscription fee for bots. This is assuming that it was a flood of orders that caused the lag. The market has a way of figuring out where you panic  Because I saw a lot of silver traded in the goods section, I introduced a currency on ripple called DYM (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149533.0). In a nutshell, it is 10 cents of pre-1965 US silver. The OP has the details, but 1 DYM is 2.47g of pre 1965 US dimes, quarters and halves (my discretion).If you send me 1 DYM via ripple, I will ship to you one pre 1965 silver dime (free *US* Shipping). If you ship me 1 silver dime, I will issue you 1 DYM (You pay shipping).A market has developed in DYM, mostly for bitstamp USD and XRP. The markets are somewhat thin, but I have received hundreds of silver dimes by people I've never met, in return for DYM. I currently hold over $250 (face) worth of silver currency from others.The idea: if you want to sell some silver products in the goods section, you can accept payment in DYM, which can be more marketable and less volatile than dealing with the lag in BTC payments. For example, if you are selling a random peace dollar, you may accept 11 DYM as payment which you can then convert to BTC. If you have US silver currency, you can opt to send to me for DYM, and try to convert to BTC in ripple. If it fails, you can always get your silver back with free shipping.I will also send pictures of your DYM so you can sell them on ebay! After the auction ends, you instruct me on where to send the silver, while you get paypal in return. Conversely, you can buy US silver on ebay and have it shipped to me for DYM.Why am I doing this? I believe in BTC and ripple. I have been surprised by the amount of "aha! this is cool!" moments in my PMs. Feel free to test it out with a dime or two. Thanks twelph. I am looking forward to receiving coins. Will post with updates when received. This car might solve the next week problem: Note: Got this from Drudgehttp://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/digital-currency-bitcoin-surges-through-200-mark/article10932113/
I tell the truth. I had tens of thousands of coins at one point. Gave many away, lost some, bought a bunch of worthless crap, and got scammed out of the rest.  Bumping this to get some more eyes on it with the price increase. Next round of free bitcoins is April 07 at 03:00. Did you have a balance at MtGox? I had a dummy account there that I used a while ago for testing. I tried to bring it up, but couldn't. I suspect that they delete inactive accounts. I've invested in so much stupid shit in my life, and the one time it works out for myself - nothing but hate and spite. Thanks for the listing. I don't have anything to announce at the moment, will let you know when something is worthy. Markets in:DYM / XRPDYM / Bitstamp USDhave a decent bid/ask, and do have a few trades every now and then.I am guessing the BTC market has been too volatile for a tight market to develop. Thanks for the kind words. I am working on DYM and ripple. I will hit the goods section in bitcointalk and offer up my services there. There are some vultures (in a good way) over there that would increase the liquidity of DYM. Once the depth/liquidity/trust is there, I expect other items to be traded for DYM, say silver bullion, etc. There have been a few bugs with ripple that have kept me from moving forward, but it appears to be mostly fixed.Keep trusting TTbit.DYM!  I don't know if I can do it. Logging out of bitcointalk, no quotes, no bitcoin emails please. Will not return until Sunday night at this time. Driving me crazy to check this every 2 minutes.Last: 87.95 bid / 89.94 ask. lets not forget this guy: www.downside.com This is why coins could reach $1,000 each. You can't leave a country with your own money? You can only have 300 eur per day of you own money? You certainly can't leave with 100oz of gold either.bitcoins are currently the path of least resistance to economic liberty. Automatic?The last thing I need is a porsche, but I'll bid 235 coins. If anyone wants to step in front of me, please do.If it gets close, I'll put up 20 coins in earnest money, and you can do the same to complete the deal. As long as the title is clear and there isn't a raccoon living in the backseat, I'll find a way to get it home. This is one use for LBAAT.net. You require a user to send bitcoins to themselves in the future. It is provable that the coins are locked up, and allow access. * inflationary currency encourages spending and debt (and speculating, gambling).* deflationary currency encourages saving, working, production. The premise that we need to encourage less saving, less working, more debt, more spending is preposterous. Japan can't print up US dollars and EUR, isn't that what MtGox holds?Japan is a disaster. Check out youtube for Kyle Bass, here is an example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY6IEpKRA7Y Not really. I like to think I have a decent stash, but couldn't hold onto 3k coins. Joke is on me - I saw the future perfectly, and didn't get filthy rich. I introduced a close friend of mine to bitcoin in august of 2010. He followed up with me just an hour ago.

Anyone could issue DYM, but I'll only redeem the ones issued by myself for obvious reasons. I follow ZH daily. Some articles seem to be more entertainment than fact. ZH is seeing something that isn't there. Silvervault? I guarantee those are not DYM.TTBit.  Total DYM outstanding: 2549.3055! Silver prices have done nothing in the last few weeks, so trading has been a bit thin. Thanks to everyone who participated. Moving many of the silver to a secure location.I plan on supporting this for as long as it takes. The response has been better than I expected. Photo of an anxious DYM holder sent me:(they are pretty cool, plug for his site - http://donttreadonmeme.com/)
He is a big fan of the environment too. For $600, your judgement is key. If you are worried that he'll hand you a wad of bills that only come to $590, don't even count it. Say "I trust you" and leave. Consider the probabilities and his actions. 10% chance he screwed you out of $40 on purpose? Thats only $4 worth of value, you'll be much better off with the "I trust you" route. 25% chance he will beat you with with a hammer in the parking lot? Might want to leave out the side door. Trillion? damn. I was calm before opening this thread. Reasonably priced too.  Good question, anxious to see how it works in ripple. I dont understand why you would have to drive 20 TTBit DYMs out of the market. But suppose you don't offer free shipping and random_cat DYM trade at a discount to TTBit DYM. Those who hold both issues would have one DYM total balance. This is similar to BTC-E USD trading to a premium over MtGox USD because BTC-E coins are cheaper, but yet only one USD balance would display in the account.Now, someone with TTBit DYM wants to buy something, but that person only trusts random_cat DYM. When he sends DYM, will orders be filled in the TTBit / random_cat DYM market to make it work, or will the sender be credited with XRP? Update: Total DYM supply has been increased to 2185.91. I'm going to close the XRP bonus for DYM, paid 20,000 XRP.Be sure to check out the DYM (rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3E) / Bitstamp USD market (rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B) I am exploring ideas as a gateway for other things. Business is easier with higher levels of trust -- although you can argue so is scamming. Getting in on the ground floor of a brand new technology might pay of handsomely in the future, all for a few hundred dollars of shipping & insurance now. And it hasn't been a lot of effort, ripple is doing the hard lifting - accounting and trading.Ultimately, I love shit like this and think its super cool. Alice private key * Bob's public Key = Transaction Public key -> Transaction AddressBob private key * Alice public Key = Transaction Public key -> Transaction Address Both verify that the Transaction Address is the same. Bob sends coins to Transaction address. Coins are now in an address that no one knows the private key.When Bob gets the item, he releases his private key. Alice Private key * Bob private key Â = Private key to transaction address. Only Alice has the ability to decode.I think Bob has an incentive to give away the private key in this instance. He has already paid for the item, and his reputation is at stake. What quantity & cuts do you get from a whole cow?Can I order 1 tenderloin and 1 set of Porterhouse steaks for example? It is currently better to buy DYM (or deliver to me) and sell on ebay. But as that happens, the price of DYM should be bid up to that of ebay prices. If it overshoots, I expect it to swing the other way.Buying PM and having someone else store them for you is a risk. DYM is not for those wanting to hold for 10 years. But some people need to sell, and some are looking to buy. We have all trusted our BTC to exchanges for IOUs in return. I'm sure MtGox right now has a pretty good supply of BTC that they don't own. Many still hold some mybitcoin IOUs. But we take those IOUs at risk because it makes it easier to achieve our financial goals.If you don't place any orders in DYM and don't extend trust to me, you can't be hurt by it. But you can't benefit either. looks like it was drilled into to test I'm doing this now! I am planning on making a thread in goods section. Started March 5. I am currently storing 1990 dimes that trade as DYM on ripple. Current bid is $2.09 for a silver dime, offered at $2.19. There have been a few large trades of 100+ DYM. Free US Shipping when you redeem! Details in my thread, but I don't own any of the dimes. I have already had a small redemption, and given out my physical address to forum members to send me more dimes.If you redeem DYM with me, I will take a photo of your dimes and you can post them for sale on ebay. After the auction is over, you can direct me to ship to the buyer. PM me for an address, I take all 90% (dimes, quarters, halves).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149533.0 After watching some silver dimes go off on ebay for high prices, I am introducing a way to convert DYM->PayPal. Upon redemption of DYM, I can send a photo of your specific dimes for auction on ebay. You can then direct me to ship to the buyer's address. You never have to touch a dime! Conversely, if you buy some dimes on ebay and want DYM, you can have them shipped to me.PM me before you redeem please.Paying 1000 XRP/$1 face for the next $20 face converted to DYM.  Haha, very nice!This is where the trust comes in, and a market may develop. I could pay an auditor to audit the stash. If you try to redeem and I don't have any dimes, you have another avenue to sue (me and the auditor). As it stands now, I only offer my reputation. Trust in me would need to grow. If ripple fails, that doesn't mean my IOUs are no good, just the network. I'd still redeem. I am not selling or buying any dimes. Buyers and sellers come together on ripple and trust me to hold the dimes they are trading. Some have dimes that want XRP, some have USD that want dimes. By having a 3rd party hold the dimes, it opens the door to more trades. crazy stuff indeed my friend!If I can suggest: I think I know what you want to do. Don't trust me with BTC, trust me for DYM (say 5).  Update: Total DYM is down to 1990, there was a redemption. Giving away 100 xrp for sending in dimes for DYM. My DYM iou is backed by 1 silver dime. I will deliver a silver dime to you if you send me 1 DYM. How you acquire that DYM is up to you. The 3 easiest ways now are to send me 1 silver dime, buy one with bitstamp USD, buy one with XRP. In order to hold DYM, you must trust rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3E for DYM in the amount you are willing to hold. You wouldn't want to create an order to buy 20 DYM, but only trust me with 3.Adding DYM/USD to your drop down menu? I don't know how to do that. It is just that easy. I created the DYM last night (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149533.0). There was actually a large trade in it already (100 DYM). Anyone else can create a currency called 'DYM', but it won't be redeemable for my 'DYM'. A DYM/XRP market showed up just a bit ago. Now anyone who has enough XRP can get a silver dime delivered to their door. Large block of DYM/USD traded earlier today. A DYM/XRP market has been made. Thin and wide, but looks like you can get 1 DYM for 2500 XRP at the moment. Ahhh, I see. That is probably why when I send 1 bitstamp USD back to bitstamp it calculates for 10 seconds and suggests 1.000000, max 1.1000000. Exciting stuff! Great work.
Going to be interesting to see how it all works. An issue I see is that BTC-E USD is worth more than Bitstamp USD. If you owed me $100 USD, I would prefer it be in BTC-E because I can buy 5% more bitcoins there. Therefore, people would be willing to sell DYM for 5% less to those who have BTC-E USD. Good question - I don't think ripple does that yet. There is a market for dym/bitstamp usd, and there is a market for xrp/bitstamp usd, so there should be an automatic way for ripple to fill multiple orders and provide market depth. Until then, looks like someone will have to do it manually.Does anyone know if this be a feature in the future by ripple, or will it have to be user created? I see some people are having issues, but I received a small gold purchase earlier this week. First trade in DYM/Bitstamp USD was made at $2.09! Not sure who it was. Though I haven't received them yet, I am expecting to issue a few more DYM in a few days. its 90% (http://www.coinflation.com/)I thought about offering general bullion, but it would lead to delivering the worst silver rounds. I'd have to give premiums for eagles for example. The most common size is 1oz, and the amount of people who trust me for 1oz is less than who would trust me for 2.5 g. By using a recognizable, small, abundant coin, you get what I deliver and there are no issues. love the 20c gasoline cards ones. PM sent. As for gateways, a line of trust could be set up so that others could issue TTBit DYM, but at the moment the trust only goes one way. Just had a similar idea today! Except the currency I offer would be "VGC" -- for virgin coins. Pay the miners a premium for mined coins, then stash them and have a currency back them up. When someone needs to be super secret about a purchase, simply redeem virgin coins. Thanks! Had to be done, right?More paths to getting into and out of the currency of your choice is better for everyone. Maybe it will get used, maybe it will work better some other way. In an effort to test ripple, trust, and alternative currencies, the DYM is born!1 DYM is equivalent to 1 pre-1965 silver US dime (worth ~$2 at this time). Using ripple, you can trade it as if it were a real silver dime!I, TTBit (rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3E) will provide 2 services for DYM.1) Issue 1 DYM for every silver dime sent to me (you pay shipping)2) Send 1 silver dime for every DYM sent to me (free US Shipping!!) Notes:Update 03/09: Upon request, I will now send a picture of your dimes before shipping. You can now sell your DYM on ebay! I am not going to make a market in DYM. Â Trust me only for receipt & delivery. There may or may not be a market for DYM by other parties. * In order to handle official TTBit DYM in ripple, you must trust the address (rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3E) for an amount of DYM that you are willing to hold.* Your trust in TTBit means:1) You trust me to properly identify & store dimes.2) You trust me to properly ship & receive dimes.3) You trust me to weigh dimes and allocate DYM accordingly.* delivery details: 1 silver US dime weighs 2.50 grams from the mint. You will receive 1.00 DYM for a dime with normal wear that weighs 2.47 grams (1 DYM = 2.47g silver dime). I will measure to 2 decimal places. Heavily worn dimes will get less than 1.00 DYM and a superior dime will get more based on the pro-rated weight. When refunding, you will get a dime worth at least what you deliver. Minimum delivery is about 1.00 DYM.* I will accept - and make good for delivery - pre 1965 quarters and half dollars at the pro-rated amount (i.e. 2 half dollars = 10 dimes)* I have issued ~2000 DYM to a 3rd party as the first trade! A market currently exists in the DYM (TTBit) / USD (Bitstamp) in ripple.* For a limited time, I'll give 100 XRP for each dime sent to me. Â * PM me for a physical address.current inventory, 2000 silver dimes. Not that I understand it 100%, but I think it will be very simple, in fact it is old school. Ripple is similar to writing checks, but who does that in this day and age? Anyone can write you a check for $100,000, but the value of that check depends on how much you trust the person. You can write a check for $100,000, but same rules apply. The advantage of ripple is that trust lines are pre-defined, not judged on the fly. The tweet makes me question his intentions. He has already publicly pumped and dumped a stock, doing the same with an anonymous asset would be perfect. I am having trouble with this myself. I create a currency "Fred's Awesome Valuations" and it circulates at my work, where 10 FAV's = free dinner at chilis. I don't want my client to add FAV's from different issuers.But I do want my client to add some currencies (BTC meaning 'bitcoins') if they are from different issuers. I can only deposit MtGox BTC ripples into MtGox and Bitstamp BTC ripples into bitstamp (because they don't trust each other, and shouldn't). What about BTC-E ripples? Bitfloor ripples? Should they all be added together in the client?  These are the only BTC balances I have. (Bitstamp is rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B). I would think it should work, yes? Or is more information required? I have extended a small amount of btc trust to many forum members. No open orders.  Trusting a friend for $20 on ripple is giving them a signed blank check that says "not to exceed $20" on it. Now, your friend can't go into the grocery store and sign over a 3rd party personal check for groceries, it would be rejected. He can write his own iou/check for groceries however. The grocery store will come after your friend if the check bounces, not you. The Purpose: Basic example how ripple works. This was to help myself.Here is a diagram of what was created:I created 5 ripple accounts for my country Zed. The currency is ZZZ.Two Banks:1) BankOfZed (Issuer of ZZZ)2) SecondBankOfZedThree Citizens1) AlanFromZed who banks with BankOfZed2) BobFromZed who banks with BankOfZed3) ChrisFromZed who banks with SecondBankOfZedTrust & Deposits:* Alan first trusts his bank for 5,000 ZZZ (this is not a deposit, just trust)* Alan sends (in person) 1000 ZZZ to his bank, the bank sends (in ripple) 1000 ZZZ IOU* I did the same for Bob (5000 trust, 700 sent) and Chris (10000 trust, 3000 sent)* BankOfZed trusts SecondBankOfZed for 500,000* SecondBankOfZed trusts BankOfZed for 1,000,000The payment:* Chris can now send 25 ZZZ to Bob through obvious channelsAfter:* Chris has a 2975 IOU from SecondBankOfZed* Bob has a 725 IOU from BankOfZed* BankOfZed has a 25 IOU from SecondBankOfZedHere is what the ripple accounts looked like after the transfer:To Continue:* Would anyone like to be a citizen of Zed? I'll issues 1000 ZZZ for 0.001 BTC. I'll buy them back too.* Would anyone like to create their own currency from their own central bank (say YYY)?* Would anyone like to create an exchanger so we can trade ZZZ for YYY, etc?* Someone should try to create fake ZZZ? I'm not convinced this can't all blow up.Data of accounts:BankOfZed,ra88Lr8fyo9cUTuyjVFMTrvTSBU93erjyhAlanFromZed,rhR5j5LXsujSuwG2bcn1P39utdTA79ceaWBobFromZed,r4ixnhDRE5VktpgtFkw5L8v1bNGsFusQJSChrisFromZed,rPA9PquwamoriknybdishCdWp6N1m2iEF8SecondBankOfZed,rnqQ7YEStMBBqn6qBP4AYsyGhy1RKfUeRR I enter Bitstamp (rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B) and try to send USD I get:However, when I go to Bitstamp and click "send using ripple client", It appears to fill out the exact same data as before, but: rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3EI've extended trust to bitstamp and have a small balance with them in USD & BTC. I'm curious if someone can take an IOU from them.Thanks! No kidding. As soon as we all figure out ripple, 'quantum physics coin' will be unveiled. Would be great to see some movement on my screen.TTBit: rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3EI've trusted pretty much everyone in this thread for a small amount of USD and BTC. PM me if I missed you. also - BitStamp looks impressive, can I use this to determine how much trust I grant? Under no obligation? Maybe not face to face, but if molecular is owed $100 via ripple, I can swap IOUs with that person, yes?
You can put the transaction ID on the site to get the details. PM me or post the tx.Edit: you must be talking about: http://diceoncrack.com/tx?_=5131091c4d8b205791008e1bWith the 'simple' strategy, you made 15,000 wagers (0.001 each).

After providing the key the first time, this new nickname will no longer need to repeat it.Code:<otheruser> wallet get <address> <key> and from then on simplyCode:<otheruser> wallet get <address> For security, you can not change the return address.4) Fund the walletIf you have coins, this is easy! Send coins to the <funding address> from your client* of choice. Using IRC as a proxy for DiceOnCrack, you CAN use a shared/web wallet for depositing. You don't need to own the private key to the withdraw address, but use common sense and not use a one-time shopping cart address. Remember, redemption addresses can not be changed.On-line shared & web wallets that appear to retain deposit addresses include blockchain.info, MtGox, and instawallet. There are probably many more, but little information is disclosed for the most popular wallets. Please do your own due diligence. If you know of others that work, (and especially ones that don't!), please let us know.5) Placing betsAll IRC bets are immediately sent to DiceOnCrack.com as a regular transaction. This means the user is responsible for proper fees which are calculated automatically and taken from the wallet's total balance. Basic format:bet <strategy> <amount> [options]Strategies include: Simple, Martingale, Busto, Exit, Elagnitram, Minefield, Pokerget details for each strategy with:Code:<user> help <strategy>Examples:Code:<user> bet minefield 0.50places a minefield bet for 0.50 using default thresholdCode:<user> bet minefield 0.75 65430places a minefield bet for 0.75 with threshold of 65430 (which pays 5.00 for 1)Code:<user>bet simple 0.8015 5000 1.25places a simple strategy bet for 0.8015 with a threshold of 5000 and will stop when return is 25%Note: wagers may take up to a minute to be processed. There is a small chance that you won't get a message after a bet, in which case you can use the command 'last':Code:<user> last <number of wagers, default = 3>to check your recent bets (max 10), or you can visit the website and input the txid.6) RedeemCode:<user> wallet redeem Redemptions are only made in whole, and only when all transactions have completely cleared. We use 4 confirms to signal a cleared transaction.  We are not a wallet service. Therefore all wallets that have 4 confirms and 8 hours of inactivity will be immediately redeemed. This is also a feature.  If there are any transactions that don't clear due to double spends (intentional or unintentional), it will prevent redemption. Please contact us. Again, user is responsible for proper fees which will be calculated automatically and taken from the wallet's total balance.Notes: wager details, including graphs, will be available on the full website diceoncrack.com The 1 satoshi return has been removed for total losses in proxy wagers. This reduces fees, potentially speeds up wallet redemption, and lightens the load on the blockchain.As always, BEST OF LUCK! please do! thanks.

Dang - I was going to sell 6.5 million of BTC next week and crash the market, but now I don't want to prove this guy right. Bitcoins -> Vendor Scrip instead of Bitcoins -> CashI provide a machine to Joe's Bar (and Alice's Laundromat, Bill's Bike shop)etc. The machine can do Cash -> Bitcoins exactly the way demonstrated. But it can also do Bitcoins -> Joe's Bar Scrip to pay for a bill. You send BTC to the machine and it spits out a $74.14 coupon only good at Joe's Bar, and for that night only. Joe would need a way to prove it came from the machine, easily scan a receipt with smart phone.The next day, I visit Joes Bar and give cash for the scrip. My money comes from the few % off of the bid/ask.

Bump for service announcement that TAABL has included LTC and TRC. Good Luck! EDIT 2013 02 20. ** SOLD OUT **SgtSpike was not satisfied with the quality of the coins in a picture I offered. Didn't feel right to post in his thread, so started a new one.I have 10 to sell @ 2 BTC each. US only please, and I ask you pay first. I'll honor a one week refund policy if you return at your expense.What I sent to SgtSpike originally. It does seem to have a bunch of black crap wedged in the crevices, and a dent in the sticker but I don't notice when holding them. The original DiceOnCrack.com Now accepts alternative currencies LTC and TRC for your pleasure. Please post any issues with LTC/TRC wagers in this thread.Best of Luck! Announcing:DiceOnCrack now offers LTC and TRC for your dice needs! Let DiceOnCrack satisfy your alternative urges. I blew my 1500 on a slice a few years back High was $21.33 *one week ago*. Still +10% since then.  Well, the purple line fit pretty well in mid 2011 too:
I like it. Amazon grants power to an amazon subsidiary to issue amazon coins. This subsidiary deals with the banking part. Legal problems would not be on amazon. Most likely, he sold it to himself to attract this kind of attention. Paint the tape It is great to see, but I am surprised that pizzaforcoins.com is getting so much attention - but I'm still amazed at satoshi dice too. Got into bitcoin investment thinking it would revolutionize on-line porn with its anonymous features. Well, count me wrong. Congrats on the site, hope you make a ton. After some more thought, i dont want to be part of any m of n. Last thing i need is for a large amount of btc to go missing, and i own a private key. Put me down as someone who would just take responsibility for a small amount of coins.  Rather than a 2 of 3 scheme, maybe a 5 of 10 scheme. Hand out 20 keys to well known members (with 10 real, 10 fakes). Don't announce who holds any keys. This prevents collusion, as if forum members start asking around if they hold a key, alarm bells may go off and report back to theymos.If something were to happen to theymos, everyone can turn in their keys to whatever authority is present at the time. Hopefully a bump worthy update: We just surpassed 5 million wagers. Thanks everyone! Would you rather have:* $50 million US guaranteed* 10% chance at $4 Billion US2nd option is worth 8x the first, so you take that one? Take the 25% chance and sell it for much more than 100 BTC Final score 34-31 Baltimore lands on field as well. All wagers have been paid out.Last few minutes got exciting. Hopefully next year we can fill out all squares!Thanks again for playing along. 3rd Quarter (15 BTC) goes to the Field Baltimore 8, San Fran 3.Turned into a good game 30 BTC paid. Nice hit! (2e67d243665e4163aaa2b87c602a64ea2c0c64752d4b78cd481e28817d100164) Hold your breath pacolito..... 1:45 left.

Square numbers will be determined by the first block with a Timestamp after 6:00 pm ET (23:00 UTC) according to Blockchain.info. As stated in OP, use: http://www.random.org/sequences/?min=0&max=19&col=1&format=plain&rnd=id.txinfo, but replace id.txinfo with the hash of the block, including leading 0's. Squares can be bought until that time. Turnout is a bit poor, but I'm excited to play. reminds me of an old joke:Bettor keeps losing week after week in football and basketball. He complains to his bookie that once basketball season is over, there is nothing to bet on. Bookie suggests he bet on hockey, which bettor exclaims "But I don't know anything about hockey!" ..Yes you did! good luck Confirmed! Thank you. GL Confirmed! good luck
Confirmed! Best of luck. Last call!!!Game is 11 hours away, will target a block 30 mins before gametime.Ill open the boards to quarter shares if that generates any interest. Remember you can also place a field wager of any amount that will give you a share of all unsold squares. once numbers are drawn, entries are closed Payouts will be in real time during the game.  Very nice - super fast downloads for me. Will use this service. It appears DiceOnCrack will purchase a significant portion of the grid. If you would like to be part owner in all the remaining squares, send at least 0.10 BTC to the field address 1QFDZaiQ7vqYNK8iYfcTVK8DL6GK7SkniZ. I doubt we will have an overflow, but field wagers will be returned if there is more than 100 BTC received. First come, first served.Example: 50 squares left. You buy 1 BTC of field bet, DiceOnCrack buys 49 BTC. You will receive 2% of all field wins.I will announce the block number for randomization tomorrow, want to target 1-2 hours before kickoff. .. and thank you for the wagers! Good luck. Confirmed! Thanks for the bets, best of luck!Hoping for a last day 'push'. Not true, unless you mean "recent history". I personally ran bitcoinsportsbook.com and routinely had thousands of coins wagered on both sides of a football match. Book was open and verifiable by anyone who visited the site. Granted, coins were under 15c at the time. Bumping for interest: Pick 5 has creeped up to ~75 BTC, and will be our largest lottery when hit. Join anytime for 99% payback by sending 0.10 BTC or multiples of 0.10 BTC to 15TaABLmhxiRQ9DTX6ZcZ9S9RknVZmP5jX, details on taabl.net bumping. 5 Days until the big game!  That explains it. At least I'm not crazy. Thank you. Question:I need to provide a ~20 char password before sending coins. Sometimes when I make a few (single) payments in a row, I don't have to put in a password, and I don't know how I am doing this. I copy my PW from keepass, and when I click on armory, the coins are already sent. How am I doing this? Is armory checking my clipboard for a pw? 0.86.3-beta It is stories like this that make me think bitcoin will be huge. The government can't seize your bitcoins (that you don't disclose at least). They can take your house, car, bank accounts, etc. But if you rent your house, have a used car, no substantial bank accounts, they will leave you alone. What needs to be done:Sort names in an array from Z-a.My solution:30 lines of code, 2 global variables, nested loops, etc.Book solution is 1 line of code similar to:Code:l_Sort() -> (Z-a) | @Variable Idea - have an accuser send btc to themselves in the future (using lbaat.net). * Ultimately get the coins back, only a 'hassle' to the accuser.* Provable that the coins are locked up* The farther coins are sent in the future and quantity can dictate how serious the allegations are. Disclosure - I partnership with lbaat.net, but there is no money to be made from the site. Like most things bitcoin related I only pay! This. I would farm so many rhinos there would be more of them than cows. Confirmed! Best of luck! Bumping to say the graphic was updated. Superbowl is 9 days away!1/2 squares are available (0.50 BTC), but might lower it if needed. I don't know. From what I have gathered, it is a distributed database. Users would only need to hold their own data, but available to everyone upon demand. It wouldn't be a 'blockchain' with every transaction. its a p2p system, everyone holds the ledger, which is updated every few seconds How I see it working:* You want to buy a pizza that costs $10 USD.* You don't have USD, you have BTC or Â.* You are the landlord of the pizza employeeCurrently, you have to go to MtGox and trade your BTC / EUR for USD, then buy pizza.Â   This is the bottleneck.But with ripple, you have more options:* Pizza owner buys his pepperoni from someone who takes BTC, you can pay the pepperoni guy in BTC for a $10 pizza.* Pizza owner buys his olive oil from Italy, which means if you have an EUR bank account, you can satisfy some of the debt (or give credit to) the olive oil producer.* You take $10 off of the employee's rent to satisfy payment.Ripple is just a way to keep track of all this. Most importantly, it keeps track of the relationships between pizza owner/employees/olive oil producer. Or, maybe I'm 100% wrong. It is confusing.
Do you have 9 friends that want to pool the pool?Â   Confirmed payment! Best of luck! haha! Thank you. Good luck. Will update the graphic. Any innovation that gives choices to the traditional banking system is a positive for the people. Money doesn't have to be these pieces of paper with numbers on them issued by a government. These pieces of paperÂ  have turned out to be a joke - some work 50 hours per week for them, some just print it. It used to be difficult to get on the side of printing, but that has been relaxed in the last 5-10 years. At some point all the people who work for paper are going to feel like suckers.If ripple works the way it works in my head, it should put another nail in the coffin of government issued currency. I was thinking for PW recovery. You can send the same 1 BTC to the address 100 times to satisfy the requirement. I'm not claiming it is very practical at the moment. An idea I had for authentication is to provide a bitcoin address you own when signing up. To change your PW, you must send 20 BTC (or whatever threshold) to that address over the next hour. This would allow anyone access to your accounts, but at a price. Just set your own threshold when setting up the account.

We have always had a design from the start to address this, but it wasn't implemented because it was a lot of work and the site may not be used. We are currently working on it, but it has been slow. With your post we may kick it up a notch.A cynical person would worry we could hold coins hostage. This would be especially easy if you let LBAAT discover the address for a given public key, rather than the other way around. We would never do that of course, but it is something for users to keep in mind for our service or a competing service.  Not my computer, but malwarebytes won't let you get to bitcointorrentz? You only need to buy until you have $80M worth. If coins are $200 each when you buy the last one, you only need 400,000 coins.  bitaddress.org now offers EC Multiplication so it can be used with LBAAT to create and redeem future addresses. It is found on the vanity tab, and you have to select "Multiply". Thank you pointbiz. Thank you to bitaddress.org. It is now possible to use EC Multiplication on the vanity tab to get (and redeem) future addresses.

It could prevent scams & schemes. Who would loan BTC to someone who only has outstanding debt? Who would loan money to someone who's only credit is that from Pirate? Such a system could prevent a pyramid foundation. Whatever lender and borrower agree to I guess. I can only imagine how I would implement a ripple system myself, and am very excited at the possibilities. I plan on using the system from day 1 of launch. Waiting for the initial discussion thread. The hot wallet on TAABL / DoC / is in need of a kick. This being a holiday, it probably won't be fixed for the next 8-12 hours. Bets can still be placed in queue. We are looking into redundancy. Thanks for your patience and happiest of holidays! Nice catch! I can confirm we own the private keys to those addresses. I believe they were our testing address when setting it up. Might not have transferred to the new server correctly. Sent a few cents to your public key timepoint:December 28 2012 12:00 UTC If Acme is a defunct company, then there is no recourse. Acme is punished by not being able to deal in ripple. Bobtech is punished by being a bad lender.But how did it get to that point? If Acme sells pizzas for $10, you can buy a pizza by paying Corpco, but at what price would Corpco charge for a $10 Acme Pizza?
Interesting. I guess I have no idea what it will be. My point what I think would be powerful: I owe you $50 and you owe John $100. if you are on the ripple network, you have to accept me giving John $50 worth of USD/Gas/bitcoins/hard drives/sex, etc. My receipt from John is payment for our debt. Now, I owe you $0 and you owe John $50.Â   Is there more information other than the wiki page on how it works?I picture it working like this:I go to my chinese restaurant who accepts ripple. My bill is $50. Instead of paying the restaurant directly, I pay off one of his ripple debts by giving one of his employees a $50 hard drive. The restaurant gets $50 USD settled of its obligation to the employee, I get $50 of food, and the employee gets a $50 hard drive.Yes? Nice implementation!When creating LBAAT.net, I suggested something similar - you send coins to yourself, but in the future. The card provided would have the user's public key, and send coins to an address that won't be revealed until tomorrow, next week, etc. Wayyyy easier than it looks. Worked 1st time for me.edit: took another one with bitcoins, gold and paper along with luigi Isn't this exactly what Kim Dotcom did with LetsBuyit.com? LT Capital gains tax increasing in US. Profitable trades could be exited early to take advantage of this. Applies to AAPL as well Thanks for posting! How long does the buyer have in order to initiate a chargeback?When we come up with the idea for LBAAT.net, I thought selling coins past any chargeback period would shift the favor to the sellers of BTC and away from the buyers. Got stuck with a chargeback? At least you can race to get the coins back."4-D" banking concept:Seller can submit the private key to LBAAT, and it will move coins to a pre-determined address in case of a chargeback (same point in the future, just different address). This is set up before coins were offered for sale. This means the seller could scam freely, but shift the burden to buyer. The first Pick 5 was just hit, winner received 23.76 BTC Congrats! I wrote up a few replies, but best to show by example because it's easier than it sounds.1) Go to bitaddress.org.2) Get a private key (5....) Save this private key and don't disclose it!3) Put private key in the "Wallet Details"4) POST here the public key ("Public Key (130 characters [0-9A-F]")5) I'll send a few cents to a new address that only you can get to. First two have been claimed without much delay.  Today's secret is sha(tomorrow's secret). From how to play:The secrets used in the HMAC_SHA512 portion of the seed are disclosed after 2 days, and they can be verified as each day SHA256 hash will be the previous day secretThis means that we have pre-calculated all the keys, as we can only know today's key if we already know tomorrow's, and the next day, and so on, since SHA256(today's secret) which is yesterday's secret had to be calculated ahead of time. Ripple could be the solution to this problem. As it stands now, when you loan someone $100, you don't know who his creditors are. But with ripple, a 'taint analysis' shows that this guy's credit is all with someone named 'pirate' who owes a bunch of people money. From this point, you can make a better decision on credit and interest rates. You may extend credit, but charge a higher interest rate. This will force him to pay you before others.This is price discovery. As a bonus, the person requesting credit may discover his problems before its too late. He can now mark his debt to market, rather than mark it to some imaginary number.Excited to see the project. Yes, this is true.Although all secrets are connected, so all you need is the seed if the site were to ever go away. We have a solution to that problem, but not worthwhile at the moment.  No - the funds are at an address that can not be determined until a secret is reveled on christmas day 2013. Its a plug for my site lbaat.net (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128581.0). Basically your secret and lbaat secret combined make private key to address. Since you need both secrets, lbaat.net can't ever know anything of value. The gift of bitcoins that can't be redeemed until Christmas 2013: I was thinking it was a bad game and no one wanted to play.We each bring either peanut butter or jelly, with the payoffs as below:If all I bring is peanut butter, the player always makes 13.99% (1.1399x). So I have to threaten to bring jelly, which opens the player to a 599% (6.99x) return. It's 99.608% to win each iteration. But you must win 1000 iterations in a row to claim the prize.Â 0.99608 ^ 1000 = 1.9689% chance you win. Still available. 4.00 btc or you can win it with a successful 0.065 wager to 1PipeBMryPGnN3Ms3HfnNjetCS4THmkpkS If I had 12,000 coins that had to be converted into USD, I would dump all at once and get a better price than selling in 50-200 chuncks at a time. By selling in chunks, you give the market time to pull bids and sell ahead of your order.
Update: DiceOnCrack.com server was updated, and should be a bit quicker to load. We still offer 99.90% per iteration promotion on many wagers. We will be moving DiceOnCrack and TAABL across servers today, so there might me a few short downtimes as DNS records get updated. You can safely continue using them as there is no expected downtime on the blockchain  Yes, MtGox will sweep all funds out of that address and into your account balance.Don't believe there is a limit. So if you are not careful casting in sterling silver, you wind up with a higher purity? That doesn't seem right. I am questioning the math myself:100 grams of sterling silver is 92.5 grams of silver and 7.5 grams of copper.To make it 99% pure without taking out the copper, you need 7.5/.01 = 750 grams of metal, or 742.5 grams of silver and 7.5 grams copper. You need to add 650 grams of pure silver. Correct? I am not familiar with "lock time". Hope we didn't re-invent the wheel. I want to look into that.The secrets go for a bit more than 200 years.  Thanks for the kind words!Here is what the nieces and nephews are getting for Christmas 2012: Bitcoins for 2013The private key needed to combine with the timepoint is under the scratch off.

Hard to get the tense correct when describing a past point in the future that is still a future point from now.nice catch. Fixing.. To help launch LBAAT.net (http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128581.0), we have put BTC 15.01633744 into the future over the next 4 years. They are split up over 100 addresses. To claim, you need the timepoint secret for each interval and apply it using the following information:Private Key:WIF: 5KMFa22QksQjRYnkErs6Agzd2tedj2ipYTaD9erCF5vxHSHjheSRAW: ca01b35d68b393d419ac20bdc8c2136b802c71194fa7665190e35743e8ef2927Public Key:0462a36a3b67f4b5bf90dc6c48ac9030f7aaa2d31210e2d7c8274bc2c350d9857bd20ee5a15a261 791b1d8329a0a82ff3e374dffb07915630127aad5c6d135a2c9This will help test LBAAT to see if the coins sent are secure in the future. Note the BTC 1.000 prize in December 2016. Fastest finger gets the coins. If coins are redeemed early, it is a sign that the information has been compromised.

LBAAT.net (short for "little bit at a time") has developed the tools necessary to create a future bitcoin address with no known private key. This address can be funded immediately. However, coins can not be redeemed until the selected time, and only by the intended recipient. It is 100% secure in that at no point in time does LBAAT have the ability to create the private key. Why would you wish to send coins into the future?* Forced savings. You suspect bitcoins may go to $1000 each, but don't want to find yourself 2 years from now having sold them all at $12.* Monthly/weekly payments. You send coins to addresses that can not be redeemed by your service provider until the payment is due. * Leave coins to your children and grandchildren for after your death.* Give the gift of delayed bitcoins. A 1 BTC gift that can not be redeemed until next Christmas / Birthday.* Authentication. Force users to send coins to themselves in the future in order to use your web services. For example, force a user to send 1 BTC to themselves tomorrow in order to sign your guest book. Delayed MessagesUsing AES encryption, LBAAT.net makes it possible to post messages that can only be revealed at a specifc time in the future.* Increased auction formats. Have everyone display their bids which can only be revealed at a certain time. Now host a blind auction, vickrey auction, and all-pay auction on the forums.* Prove you know something now, but don't want to reveal until later. All messages are timestamped.To redeem future bitcoins, you will need the aid of an EC calculator. LBAAT has javascript calculator that does the necessary calculations for you. This page was on the wonderful work of bitaddress.org. The EC calculator in Armory works great as well.How does it work?Delayed, connected secrets make it possible to send bitcoins securely into the future. LBAAT.net releases a 32 byte secret every hour on the hour. We call these "timepoint secrets." All timepoint secrets are connected - the current 32 byte timepoint secret is the hash of the unknown timepoint secret one hour from now. If you have the current timepoint secret, all prior timepoint secrets can be generated, but not the next one.What if the system is compromised?Because all timepoint secrets are connected, a compromised future secret will compromise all further secrets from that point. This is an incentive for LBAAT to secure its data. It will be easy to tell if the site has been compromised, as future addresses will be redeemed early. Even though a compromised future secret would lead to early redemption of coins, note that LBAAT never has access to any balance.Generating a future address:By submitting a bitcoin public key, LBAAT.net will multiply that public key by the timepoint secret using EC math, which will result in another public key, and a bitcoin address is obtained. If you own the private key it is possible to verify the address by requesting the public part to the timepoint secret, and multiply this by your own private key using an EC calculator, as found in Armory.Revealing the private key:When the timepoint secret has been revealed, multiply this secret by your private key to reveal the private key to the bitcoin address in question. LBAAT has created an on off-line javascript calculator created with the code from bitaddress.org. All calculations are done on the client side, no information is sent. Armory (bitcoinarmory.com) is also capable of performing the calculatioins off-line.What happens if you disappear? If the site is closed, we are prepared to provide the seed hash. With this seed, all secrets can be obtained. We also have prepared a 6 of 10 shared secret of this seed. 10 trusted members of the bitcoin community will have a code. If we disappear, the community can still revive the seed hash (details to follow).I sent coins to a future address that I want now. Can I have the secret?No. Once a future secret is revealed, the system is compromised. Do you have an API?Yes. Check out the How to Use page for documentation Notice that we don't display every possible value (there are no blank rows). We have worked with different ways to make it more visually appealing than just dumping all data. With your request, however, we will work on a toggle feature. Thanks for the input! Made this game up. Takes a bit of time to complete, but could be fun.The picnic situation:We have to make all sandwiches at the picnicYou love Jelly sandwiches! I hate Jelly Sandwiches!You like Peanut Butter sandwiches. I don't like Peanut Butter sandwiches.You hate Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwiches! I love Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwiches!We know each other's sandwich preferences and decide to each bring one ingredient (Peanut Butter or Jelly) to the picnic and combine them to make the sandwiches. Which one do you bring?Payouts:If we have Peanut Butter Sandwiches, I pay 13.99% (1.1399 x your wager returned)If we have Jelly Sandwiches, I pay 599% (6.99x your wager returned)If we have Peanut Butter and Jelly, I win, and pay nothing.This game is played in 4 rounds:1) You announce you want to play. Leave a funding address for me to pay in case you win.2) I'll give you an address to fund and I announce my encrypted guess (sha of guess).3) You fund the amount and announce "Peanut Butter" or "Jelly". Funding amounts 0.05 BTC to 2.00 BTC.4) I reveal and pay. If I can't prove hash, I pay. Good luck with your raffle. Would love to host the raffle at TAABL.net, can set up to your specifications (minimum 50 tickets).  Minimum wage laws make it illegal to create a job worth $7.00 / hr or less. (Wonder why there is high unemployment?)As for debts, legal tender laws keep from offering to pay in another currency/barter. If you claim I owe you 100 sheep / 500 bitcoins / 20oz of gold, A court would not order me to pay in specie. A USD amount would be assigned that I pay you.

Another decent pick 4 underway at taabl.net. Currently 2nd largest pot at 16.6 BTC. Jump in anytime for 0.1 btc. A major milestone with DiceOnCrack, and bitcoin in general - we were able to verify our first DoC Pipe winner! It was sold by Bitcoiner2012 who received 4.494 coins on a 0.40 wager by an anonymous forum member. The anonymous person signed a message with the sending address that contained his shipping information.With interest, we want to make the process more streamlined. Congrats go to Bitcoiner2012 and to anonymous, as DiceOnCrack took the loss but facilitated a transaction that otherwise wouldn't have existed.If you would like a Pipe address, please PM me! If you decide to play a Pipe, please note DiceOnCrack only hosts the lottery/wager, and does not hold the goods. I confirm that DiceOnCrack lost its first wager on this.

Good luck! I'll have to read up on type 2 deterministic wallets. I don't think I'm discovering something new. I question why we need all these addresses and private keys in the first place. All you need is one private key per entity. Create a new address? Just sha(description) or sha(timestamp). Want my SMTP to send your email? sha(message) to each recipient so they can recover coins. Should I stop drinking coca-cola unless I am drinking for entertainment? After all, I can drink water for much less, if not free.One step further: What if I am gambling for a coke? Plug for my site: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=121920.0 With that, you pay 60% of a coke's price for a 60% chance at a coke. Am I still gambling?One more step: Do you buy insurance on your house in case it burns down? Aren't you hoping to put down a little bit of money up front, and if the odds go your way, you get a new house? Surely we can all agree that home insurance is a losing bet for individuals (gamblers) and a winning bet for the casino (insurance company)? Would you advocate people "Stop buying insurance for your house!" What about someone who generated 10,000 btc a few years ago and paid tax on the $600 he made. Can he spend the 10,000 btc as if it is tax free? (Of course not, but what is the answer?) What if coins go to $0.00. Can he get back the tax he paid on the $600? I am not developing anything. I have low-level EC math capabilities. This might not be the right place to put this. But I have been thinking there is another way to send unique payments to others without waiting for them create an address first. Its a different way to send coins without waiting for them to provide you a unique address.

Taking advantage of DiceOnCrack's Pipe feature (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=121920.0), we are giving everyone a chance to win a cool 1 oz A-Mark silver ingot.

To claim prize if you win: *You'll need to sign a message from the sending address* with the transaction number and your shipping information. If you are unable to prove you own the address, we can not ship.Once prize is won, the pipe address will be switched off and wagers will be refunded. Wagered amounts less than 0.065 will be refunded. You can check your wager on DiceOnCrack.com, alternatively, check only this lottery: http://diceoncrack.com/address?_=1PipeBMryPGnN3Ms3HfnNjetCS4THmkpkS. The first "Success!" will receive the prize, shipping included.For sure, it is a bit complicated. We are still in beta, and are looking for feedback, suggestions and bug reports.

This may still change based on hot-wallet balance at the time.Thank you! We introduced a service called (wait for it) "the crack pipe", because you can pipe wagers through to a fixed address that you own.The announcement is here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=121920.0.We create a custom 1Pipe address for you that makes a wager according to your terms, and forwards those winnings to an address of your choosing. With it, you post your personal 1Pipe address for tips, raise donations or sell products. All wagers will show up on DoC.Its in beta right now. Please post or PM me for a custom 1Pipe address. Include what wager you would like to use. My pipe address: 1PipeZHgQXcjAYsUQ4WRXyKZn1X3sJNrpkThanks, and good luck! [Announcing / Development] The CrackPipe - Have transactions piped through DiceOnCrack.com so you can sell more goods / gain extra tips / raise more funds!A hypothetical: You have 60 cents in change, but want a $1.00 coke. Nothing gets done. Imagine there are 10 people who would be willing to do this. That is $6.00 that coke does not sell, and $6.00 worth of refreshment the consumer doesn't enjoy. What if that coke machine would take your 60 cents, and give you a 60% chance at a coke (that is provably fair)? Isn't the economy better off? Win or lose, there is an extra 60 cents in GDP vs 0 cents in GDP, so yes -- we argue society benefits from the risk taking of the consumer and producer. As a bonus, would the consumer not get SOME satisfaction, even with a 60 cent loss? And doesn't a $1.00 coke for 60 cents taste extra sweet? In the long run, the consumer will get a coke for every $1.00 he plays, but there will be MORE product sold and consumed. USESProduct Sales:Selling an item? Why not get a 1Pipe address with a wager that will net you the amount in BTC if it results in a win. DiceOnCrack.com will take the risk of loss. Note: The buyer will have to sign a message from the sent address to prove he/she sent the wager as DiceOnCrack will not mediate the transaction itself, only the wager. (We suggest the "Minefield" game for fixed price sales, and you will need to request a certain wager). Example, suppose you have an item to sell for 5.0 btc. You can offer:* Buy now for 5.00 btc* Try to buy now for 0.20 btc: 1Pipe... (With This pipe address offers a 25x wager)You (the seller) will receive 5.00 btc for a win or 1 satoshi for a loss to the address you provided. Tipping:Sending 0.05 BTC for a helpful post might not seem worth it. Why not send it through their Pipe address, with a 1 in 20 chace of receiving 1.00 btc? Raise Funds:DiceOnCrack.com believes more funds will be raised for development work and charities. This is due to the entertainment value of the wager.Fees: It will depend on the wager involved, but the house edge is anywhere from 0.10% - 2.0%. So for this to be a positive for the bitcoin economy, it must attract (at worst) an extra product sale / tip / funding once every 50 times.All wagers will be posted on DiceOnCrack.com for verification. Please note that DoC is introducing the technology, the buyer and seller are still responsible for completing the transactions. At the time of this writing, DoC is still in beta, and has a wincap of 10btc. If you plan on offering higher-priced items, please be patient while we grow.1Pipe addresses are now being offered upon request. With interest, there will be a webpage. Please post (or PM) what wager you would like from DiceOnCrack.com, and what address you wish to have the proceeds sent. We will respond with your personal 1Pipe address. We are listening for feedback and suggestions.Good luck! I don't understand the math:Is there a way to prove that the funded address is correct, without having to actually put the two private keys together?  Why is this better than me sending you a bitcoin address to send coins to?

Each transaction is mingled with the secret of the day to produce a provably fair shuffled deck, using a hash based Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. You are given the top 3 cards, and that hand is then ranked. Payouts:Royal Flush: 50 to 1Straight Flush: 40 to 13 of a kind: 30 to 1Straight: 6 to 1Flush: 4 to 1Pair: 1 to 1(Straights are A-2-3 to Q-K-A)All games are for 0.10 btc, and an amount greater than that will result in multiple games. Winnings are not gambled. Amount less than 0.10 will be wagered in entirety.Play anytime you feel lucky. 3 Card Poker address: 1CracksLRtQMcTF4HXNrvPzRgvz7Qr6wNdThe shuffling algorithm explained:The unshuffled deck begins with 52 cards in sequence. The sequence is Ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K for each suit, Hearts, Spades, Diamonds and Clubs.When the hash seed is determined, the two leftmost hex character are taken from the hash. For the resulting hex byte to qualify it needs to be less than the quotient of (value / cards remaining) * cards remaining. This is to ensure an equal chance for every card to be selected. If the hex byte does not qualify, the next pair of characters from the hash is used.Once a qualifying byte is found, card MOD( value / cards remaining) is moved to the end of the deck. This is done 52 times. When necessary, the process SHA256(Hash) is performed to keep the process going. Note that the first 3 cards moved would be cards selected for play.
Introducing a third party does not increase the value of bitcoin (he sold you his btc). Increasing the amount of transactions does not either. In this scenario, BTC would rise in value only if the person selling goods for BTC then saved (hoarded) them for future purchasing power. Be careful what you wish for, if bitcoin was not worth saving, by definition it would be worthless. Said another way, the less bitcoin savers you have, the less bitcoin is worth.

There could be one anonymous account on bitcointalk that everyone would be able to post from, for a fee of 0.02 btc. This would be useful to buy pr0n via the goods section anonymously, or say something that you wouldn't want your name associated with (i.e. if a user wanted to comment about something illegal in their country). Proceeds go to the forum.* All forum users would still be able to ignore the user.* The use of PGP would be used so buyers & sellers could verify the anonymous posting.* Maybe have an 'anonymous' section, and all anonymous conversations go there.

This way, buyer and seller can agree to a price in the future. As it is now, I send a PM to buyer "3.00 btc for oz of silver", and he now has extra value from waiting. If btc/usd price falls, he accepts, but if it rises, he declines.But "I'll pay you the price at 11:00pm tonight as posted on boollion.com" takes this away, and is fair. Should lead to more transactions. Thanks for the wagers! Lotteries are slowly finishing, and here are some raw stats to help with your wagering.The pick 2 (0.10 BTC) has been getting hit every few hours with 25 wagers.The pick 3 (0.05 BTC) was just hit for the first time. With ~50 entries, it should hit about 6 times a week.The pick 4 (0.01 BTC) should be hit about 3 times a week with 250 entriesAny interest in a pick 5, or a larger lottery? Thanks for playing!We had 3 recently retained bets, which I assume were yours. For 2 of them, fees of 0.0005 were not enough. They were manually pushed again, and seem to be fine. The 3rd one is a design issue for the type of bet that was placed. The deposit was 0.007, and the first iteration was shooting for this +.001 = 0.008. The issue is that to get to step #1, a wager larger than 0.007 is needed (a very high threshold was selected). When this fails, the [EXIT] strategy is designed to return any balance to the user. However, this should be treated as a 'refund', not a 'return'. A return for that tx would require fees >0.001, but as a refund it was 0.0005.In the future, increasing the fee on retained bets will be automatic, but for now we are checking what is going on. Thanks for your patience and participation! The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery returns! www.TAABL.netWell, sort of. It's a close clone of the original TAABL that was born circa August 2010 to be the original bitcoin lottery.One of the games provided, BitPick, is reproduced here with a twist; no accounts are needed, we'll be using the bitcoin transactions as medium to place bets and extract addresses to pay prizes, just like DICE on CRACK and Satoshi Dice (added anonymity)Please read http://taabl.net/howtoplay for instructions and explanations.3 games are provided: The very fast paced Pick 2, the slightly more sedate Pick 3 and the "once a year or so" Pick 4.In a nutshell, you pick the last digits of the hash of each completed block. If your picks match exactly, you win the entire pot! The house fee of only 1.0% means your expectation is 99% no matter how many entries there are.Don't want to read, and just play? Jump in anytime into a pick 2, just send 0.1 or multiple thereof to: 12TaAbLWBNKB1NLYH92CPnC1DizQoNK6FN, you can even place a bet larger than the available slots in a Pick, the remaining credit will be used against future picks. You will receive 2 satoshis when a round is complete, and the whole pot when you win.Enjoy! Thanks to everyone for the positive reviews!Couple announcements#1Regarding slow payouts confirms, we have been adjusting the way unspent transactions are chosen to speed things up.The payout TX will never be included in a block before the deposit TX because the latter is used as input for the former. They might go into the same block, likely so even, but if your original deposit doesn't get included for lack of fees or whatever, the payout tx won't either.and#2we are now on DiceOnCrack.bit for the 7 of you who know how to get there. We had forgot to include fees upon launch, but have since included them. Sorry for the delays. We are aware of the amount of unconfirmed. Processed. It looks like it needed a higher than normal fee, and was retried manually. It is now marked as a successful. Thanks for your understanding! Wait a sec! We were not posting tx fees on payout unless required, which greatly slows the inclusion of the payout tx in blocks. We have changed that now, fees will always get added (our treat  ) This isn't DiceOnSpeed.com.Seriously, it is on the improvement checklist. Thanks for your patience everyone. Thank you! There is a small learning curve when placing wagers like martingales. You can go the high probability route, but any loss will take quite a hit on remaining balance. With a lower threshold, you can take many small losses. High exit points make it much more likely to fail in entirety, but much more rewarding with an overall win.I suggest making small wagers at first to see what is most entertaining.Be sure to click on the link to get your seed/final hash as well as a graphical representation of your wager! Yes. All wagers return something. Unfortunately in this case, the 1 satoshi means your wagers were bet in entirety as a loss.Under recent bets, you can click on the time link and get a graphical representation of the wager.

***EDIT 2012-10-28 1,000,000 processed bets promotion! Fees lowered to 0.10% house edge, giving 99.90% expected return per iteration!***Bouncing dice off the blockchain is fun and all, but what if you need to do it 10 times to get your fix? Sadly, this still isn't enough for some of us. Introducing DiceOnCrack.com, which allows you to throw up to hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of throws with a single deposit!

Ok, who got bitcoin on the obverse and Pirate on the reverse? Data please.  I do like much more now, thank! Nice work. I am a fan of the service, works well. Congrats.You can charge what you wish, but it is a bit pricey for my wallet. I'd probably spend more overall if prices were cheaper. I have been playing with this all day. Very cool.Question: Why hasn't anyone used this for Escrow? I bet there has to be a page on this somewhereExample:* Seller goes to Escrow-BTC.com and signs a message from address 1EwMryEWqFLrfyyK6gTz3HUwgmLsVTFuQr (proves he knows the private key, not on-line wallet)* Escrow-BTC.com then generates a vanity address with that public key and sends Buyer a PrivkeyPart: 5KiThyF8KKXm51jRT99Yckn63hGXFsBjniQNdYqyqDvhSHvQmEB* This produces a vanity address: 1ZZZZKnrZRAmCgfVtjpgzZc1f9SkfndF5, which buyer sends funds to.* At this point, no one knows the Private Key to 1ZZZZKnrZRAmCgfVtjpgzZc1f9SkfndF5* Seller has delivered package, buyer can release his PrivkeyPart to seller. Buyer can only not deliver funds out of spite.* Seller combines his private key with buyer's PrivkeyPart:Code:keyconv -c 5KiThyF8KKXm51jRT99Yckn63hGXFsBjniQNdYqyqDvhSHvQmEB 5JuwtSBD2SbnZ8dWgtGiUsd5D14tC7UTvoDeqCsabS5f7KN326DAddress: 1ZZZZKnrZRAmCgfVtjpgzZc1f9SkfndF5Privkey: 5JsNqVXDQstLEKPxCFMN4G4LerFg8AD2fmk8FHhEtRAheiKoeb6And viola!

If I understand correctly, you will have 2 private keys (5J... and 5H... for example) combined to make a 3rd private key (5K...).Could you send 0.10 BTC to the first address (5J...) and 0.10 to the 2nd (5H...) but send 100 btc to the 3rd (5K...)Set up to be notified when one of the first 2 addresses are drained, this lets you know you have been compromised on 1 system. In the CPU mining days when GPU software was just being developed, there wasn't much talk of the price going down, or that it would be bad for bitcoin. Why is it different this time?  Headwind is the currency risk. If you expect bitcoin to rise to $100/coin over the next few years, it will be difficult to justify a purchase of 5000 btc today.  +1This is the system I would try to create. Make 3 of 7 scheme. 7 sets of 200 QR codes that each reveal a private key. Keep 1 in the house, 1 in SD box and 1 encrypted on dropbox. The other 4 carefully distributed among friends & family (who are not familiar with the others). Don't tell them who else has codes. You can give a set to a relatively trusted forum member. If you ever die or get in trouble, your friends and family will start asking around.Bonus: Make a deterministic wallet, and engrave 1/2 of the seed on a mountain in Las Vegas, the other on a large rock in Minnesota. Thank you.  By random, I mean not predictable. I ask because SatoshiDice takes the hash of a txid. Would it be possible for someone to calculate the id (or part of an ID) before sending? Why doesn't SD just use the txid? I suggest that the premium is due to the real interest rate for bitcoins. There is no Federal Reserve keeping rates artificially low, and the cheapest people can 'borrow' today for bitcoins is 50%/year. Back up!  I keep getting:Code:WARNING: couldn't get memory lock (ENOMEM, try to adjust RLIMIT_MEMLOCK!)when attempting to use SSSS creating a (3,7) scheme for a 51 character private key. Sometimes the scheme is created immediately, and sometimes it takes minutes to create. Is this error why it sometimes takes so long to create? I want to create 50 schemes, so it would take all night.How to fix? Is there some .conf file I need to address, or do I need to edit the code of SSSS? I'm not an expert at linux or coding.  There were 10's of thousands under 7 cents each. Price would rally to 8 cents, back to 6.5 cents. The few people mining back then were piling them up, why not take $700 and sell 10,000 of "nothing". I have pieced together a name and address from return labels, and according to google, the name and location exist. Did HeavyMetal (scammer) use his neighbor's name or some random address in the phone book? Quite possibly. However he did successfully send me an insured package international (Canada to US) and declare a $1,000+ value. Not sure how he would have claimed insurance if names and addresses didn't match.If you're good at tracking down people or just want to do some googling yourself, PM or email me at auto31524412 at hushmail.com for his name and address.

If it helps, my prior 2 successful trades txid:#1) a85707d9507f97399201444d63a3660dc84ea24b2d83b9c7e1894a1f5d37aa15#2) b1c924d16e85a012badc53d58bb473681a916906e9bdfe0204b46b564bb969ebThanks for the help! I had done 2 prior trades. Total was about 140 btc, first one ~20, 2nd one about 120. I can pull up the transactions if it helps when I get a chance.The Tor issue was a blow to my investigation as well, I had thought he was an honest guy that went bad when faced with a 600 coin windfall. But I still can't figure out why he tried to save face with the new account, it would be more profitable for him to keep quiet. I should say theymos has told me that the original "HeavyMetal" account and "Real Heavy Metal" new account were always connected via Tor, and not much help. ha. Â I did, and he has sent me 2 PMs already, very helpful. Thanks theymos. Thank you.I have made the request to an admin. Unfortunately, I believe admins are busy people these days. I am out 596+ coins. Let me get the story straight:This person supposedly doesn't know you, and...This person is into bitcoin enough that he is able to generate a 6 char vanity address very similar to the vanity address that you completed several trades with (1AuAgBT..), and...This person hacks your account and posts a large thread taking offers on gold, while...This person somehow got astronomically "lucky" that you were indisposed for a week so he could pull off this elaborate scheme, not while you were logging in every few hoursThe perfect timing of this means it is quite obvious you either "know" the hacker or it is you. I mean, if I hacked Theymos's password, how many fake posts could I generate before it stopped? Hmmmm... your new name was created 1 minute and 50 seconds within the original HeavyMetal's last login (screen caps in: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=105810.0 post #28) neither the "fake" or "real" HeavyMetal will reply to my PMs. If my username was hacked, I would want to see what the hacker had posted so I could get in touch with any dealings right away. But not HeavyMetal, just spew out an "omy gosh! I been hacked, warn the others! I won't bother to check what he did, but I was hacked!" in the newbie forum and leave. Was that your real name and address on the label you sent me the few times we made a trade? I think it is, otherwise why the hack story? If it was an elaborate hoax, just disappear - why try to save face? I hope I'm wrong and the real HeavyMetal and I can figure out who took my coins. Maybe you would like to "refund" the coins from your own pocket, since you are responsible for your own account. If anyone is an expert at looking at the block chain, I'd like to pay a few cents to tell me anything about the transactions and if they are correlated. Will the draft room pop up or is there a link I need to go to? I am on the draft page, and I test my system ok, but it doesn't look like a draft room. Lets light this candle My investigation, I submit 2 pics and a plea to the real HeavyMetal to help me:His "real account". Last active 8:31:50 am-----****-----His "Fake Account" was amazingly created less than 2 minutes before this:-----****-----ADMINS: Are there IP logs? Looking at the blockchain, I bet he knows enough, won't prove anything unless he got sloppy.To the "Real" HeavyMetal, I have been scammed out of 596 coins. We have been successful business partners in the past - will you help me? I have your name ("BW") and city information, I will contact the other people you have done business with on these forums. I am sorry to hear about the accident, and hope everyone is OK. I hope you can understand this seems fishy to me, and I am out ~$7,000. I would like to see a report about the car accident, and confirm with police that you did not fulfill a $7000 order worth of merchandise with me.If it is true that there was a car accident and you talk with police, I can be sure I did all I could. I had done a previous, large(ish) successful trade with him, he delivered. With this new post, I bought another 596 coins worth, which he has not delivered obviously.  I am out 596 coins, please get in contact with me to help file a police report. Can we get some IP records? I am out 596 coins After reading this thread, I started looking up the phosphate issue and ordered a batch of "bubble bandit" with phosphates. I believe soaps with phosphates would be a perfect product for the libertarian minded bitcoin community.If you make up a batch of dishwasher / laundry /  detergent with phosphates, put me down for a large order. I would be interested in welding lessons for BTC. Location: central Florida Yes, lightchop is taken care of by me. If bitcoin goes fiat by choice in the marketplace, there is no problem. Government fiat currencies are forced upon the population. I didn't think through the size. Yes, $1M would be large. But how about a large car loan? Seems most could qualify. The blackmailer wouldn't be able to "run off", he would put up his reputation/assets for the loan -- he's not anonymous. The blackmailee would make payments. If the info gets out, stop payments. Blackmailer would owe the balance. Instead of a $1M upfront, if I were to be blackmailed, I would insist the "blackmailee" take out a $1M loan, and I would make the payments. Info ever got out, I stop making payments.
A person should be happy he has the opportunity to pay to keep information quiet. If that price is too high, the person being blackmailed can release the information himself, or negotiate a lower price. With careful, escrowed payments, the person doing the blackmailing now has an incentive to make sure the information is kept secure, otherwise he wonÂt be paid in full.IÂm not suggesting ÂPay me BTC10 per month or I punch you in the faceÂ should be legal. That is physical violence being held back. IÂm talking about holding back information that you are otherwise free to announce at any time. In the Romney Â bitcoin situation, these people appear to have broken the law by stealing (if true, which I think is a hoax). If they stole the information and then announced it to the world however, they wouldnÂt be arrested for the release of the information, but the theft that occurred first. Want to announce that lightchop is my brother. So he is already paid Possible to end betting before the game starts? Currently through end of day on the 5th. Request: 3 card poker. Surprised I am the first. None of my business, but I don't think posting on a forum is in the best interest of your site. Skeptical types will be wondering if you are setting up to reverse wagers down the line for winners, all the time stating "we did it for the players that lost too, see post #....". The wagers were made, refunding does not undo them. The crucial part is that there is an incentive for the game to be fair by the house. If there is a way to predict an outcome, the user would be able to take advantage of it. If hashes were biased -- much less predictable -- SatoshiDice wouldn't still be in business. For casino craps (IRL), biased dice can be exploited, therefore I feel confident that they are not screwing me over when I play.For online, a dice game where the user can put in the offset for the dice after the server has rolled.Example:computer: 5b0f45c9c40e7fd9606bfc22efbb0c6d03f38b50528734c68d5466ffdd2634d8User, enter an offset: +1 , +4computer: You rolled (1) (6) = 7.

Nice job. "SMPAKE" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue thoughÂ   Autodraft: I'll do whatever, but I already have 2 other drafts I need to attend. I was looking forward to having a random autodraft league. Also, getting 10 people to agree on a time is going to be a bear this late in the season.Question on autodraft: How does it work exactly? Will it give me a complete roster before picking up a 3rd RB or 4th WR? I have been watching this thread ever since it started. This thread and a few personal dealings led me to create my own thread where I sell put options on the gold/btc and silver/btc rate: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=104468.0. If you believe gold will fall while bitcoin rises, I am offering a way to capitalize on it. Lowered the gold option prices a bit. I'll put them in the same category. Philharmonics too.  I purchased some of this gold and everything went very smooth. Thank you. Absolutely. For you, I'd consider sending coins up front. Just return either the coins or silver in January. In this thread, I will attempt to write put contracts on the BTC/Silver price and BTC/Gold price. This gives the buyer (you) the right - but not the obligation -, to deliver silver and/or gold for BTC at a fixed (strike) price during the length of the contract. Benefits to you (the option buyer, metal seller):* If the btc price crashes, or the price of silver/gold skyrocket, you simply walk away with no obligation. Your loss is the premium paid in BTC.* However, if the btc price skyrockets or the price of gold & silver crash, I must purchase from you at a relatively high price.* You don't have to own the metal at any time to participate, but you must deliver if you want to profit from the contract. You can send the metal to me (or have me purchase it with escrowed BTC) via 3rd party, such as coinabul, only if in your interest to do so.Details:Delivery: You are responsible for shipment to my location (USA East coast).Contract Expiration: December 31, 2012. All packages must be postmarked on or before this date.Strike Prices are a fixed buy price to purchase from you at your discretionThe variable:Premium you need to pay up front (Prices good as of Aug 31 2012 ET). Silver:2.00 Strike: 0.040 btc per troy ounce1.00 Strike: 0.015 btc per troy ounceGold:100.0 Strike: 1.00 btc per troy ounce50.0 Strike: 0.40 btc per troy ounce.The fine print for delivery:Silver: I accept .999 and junk (.900) coin silver ($1 US=0.715 oz for 1964 and earlier dimes, quarters & halves). Sterling jewelry / flatware is not acceptable. I'll offer a rebate of $2.5/oz for US silver eagles, $1.50/oz for other .999 silver, and $1/oz for Peace/Morgan dollars (1 US silver dollar = 0.760 oz). No rebate for coin silver (junk). Coin silver must be free from holes and major dents. I'll reluctantly take 40% silver ($1 US=0.295 oz), but no war nickels.Gold: Coins and bullion only. At least .900 purity. Again, no jewelry. Rebate of $60/oz for US gold eagles, $50/oz for Krugerrands, $30/oz for other .999 bullion and ~22 karat coins (foreign currency & US pre-1933 gold coins applicable).Rebates: Delivering a superior product entitles the buyer to a rebate. The closing price of BTC/USD will be taken for Dec 31, 2012 (or earlier if delivered) and refunded in BTC form. Example: Year end price is $40/BTC and you delivered 10 oz of US silver eagles, expect 0.50 btc ($20) in rebate. I may offer a slightly higher rebate for fractional gold or higher quality products, but this will be at my discretion. You can over/under deliver (say +/- 10%) for rounding purposes when delivering foreign gold & US Silver junk, but there must be a good faith delivery. I'll pay/credit spot based on year end close of silver/usd, gold/usd and BTC/usd.With every trade:* I'll publicly fund a separate address for every potential delivery with full value. * I won't buy back these options, I intend to take delivery. If it is in your financial interest to deliver please acquire the metal or sell your contract to someone else. Remember, you can just direct me to purchase from a 3rd party with escrowed BTC to satisfy the contract (rebates still apply).* I'm happy to do escrow at your expense, but I have to agree to the agent.Example trade:You purchase 10 put options with a 2.00 strike from me at 0.07 btc per ounce. Your total is 0.70 BTC. I fund a separate address with 20.00 BTC. At any time before the end of the year, you can deliver 10 ounces of silver to me and I will send the 20.00 BTC to you.  Still looking for players.. I did a successful trade with HeavyMetal, all went well. Thank you. Might have to move the draft day to 3rd or 4th to give everyone the holiday weekend to consider. Football will be a bigger topic at that time. Player A: I'll bet you $10,000 that I have $100,000 in my bank account.Player B: Ok, I'll take that betPlayer A: You win, I don't have any money.Player B: Where is my money?Player A: I will bet you $1,000 that I have $10,000 in my bank account.Player B: Ok, I'll take that bet...... Pardon me for not reading the entire thread if this is in here:Suggested feature: I'd like to accept tips via SD. I would get a unique address via SD for the bet I want (ie less than 4000), and a payout address. My thinking is that a site operator gets more tips if there is a chance a 0.05 tip could turn into a 1+ btc tip for the tipper.

We all know (generally) how many bitcoins there will be on any specific date in the future. When considering the market cap of bitcoin, I use 20m as a ballpark figure. $50/btc will be $1B cap and quite the milestone. I am surprised that SatoshiDice took off -- people who are smart enough to understand cryptology and coding dice bots not understand the logical end of a martingale system?congrats on the #1 hit. I'm sure the price increase has plenty to do with every successful application such as satoshi dice, and we all should be thankful. Got it:5HrGsm6TekRMjjB3MvLD9E8Sbe29EBseNcsGGXEQkhL3t3pfHaU My point is that bitcoin in March of 2010 was thought of as an experiment. These coins were certainly mined on a CPU (Difficulty of 4).Â  People who generated a block didn't think about backing wallets, as the coins were worthless.  First seen march of 2010. Coins were under 5 cents back then. My guess is those coins / private key are gone. Wasn't there a bug a few weeks ago that halted trading, and when resumed came back at a high of $9.70? Start the rumor that $1B is trying to go through, and $100 coins are a reality. I think it was an error - someone wanted to buy 1 billion coins, not pay 1 billion for a coin. I think you are proving my point?I'd rather PAY in an inflationary currency. Be it my employees or my groceries.
If you believe deflation is a problem, answer this question: Would you rather work and be paid with a deflationary currency (gold / bitcoin), or inflationary currency (USD / zimbabwe dollars)?Conclusion: We all want to spend money that is worth less and less each day, but this is only looking at half the story. We would rather work for a currency that appreciates in value. The more a currency is debased, the less work gets done. And isn't that exactly where the world is today? Flush with depreciating currencies which led to low productivity (high unemployment), declining GDP, etc.Â  Coins are up ~25% since july 29. If coins are frozen, you have extra $$$ to get proper documents. If one *legally* had $200,000 in USD paper, how would such a person get it across national borders? Might be easiest to buy $200k in coins, move to the new country, then repurchase the USD.  But what if it doesn't calm down until $80/btc after shooting to $150/btc? agreed, but it would still be a hack. Some forum members would sell their mother's arm for 0.40 btc. I'll take SatoshiDice. All you need is to change the deposit addresses with a vanity 1dicexxx Bitcoin needs a prediction market for these things. Information would get out and affect the market, alerting those who have accounts there.Information such as you get your password in plaintext from a new exchange. Or could be that someone talks about how he is going to break into MtGox, etc. Hoarding hurts the individual, not bitcoin in general.Imagine an individual owns 99,999 bitcoins. He can acquire the 100,000th coin for $9.40 right now easily. However, at what price can he sell his 100,000th coin? -- About $7.50. The more coins he owns, the harder it is to receive equal value when converting into goods (USD in this case). Cool!Wish I kept better records. I think my 'salt' was an extra carriage return by mistake for my first few addresses. 1 confirm on the withdraws. Still 20 bid for 13.45, but able to sleep now. No, that is first few. Waiting for some confirms. Um... no. 2.18 of it to: 12JGzgb7ezdp5UT4EoJN3Spcn3P8fyyFav  Sold at $30+, bought at ~$20. Withdrew, BTC in my wallet Sold a handful at $30-$32. Trying to deposit more. We'll see the results. I'll be a buyer at $15 tonight though if anyone is willing to jump into this.... BUY ALERT!!!Those who sold @ 40 now have $$$ and are going to want to buy a TON OF BTC now to get their money out of the exchange easier Got to have a few btc spread around for the upcoming craziness. I just happen to reply to the thread of the guy who owns TTBit.com? Am I being setup? ...Or just call it a stupid tax Also, mixers such as the one from blockchain.info could add to the DB after the address is deleted Idea: A DB of addresses that pooled funds such as MtGox can contact so they don't send to them. Lottery and SD addresses come to mind.
IMO: There are too many choices for the average user. Have a featured set of options each month with free trading for traders to see the potential it could add to their bitcoin portfolio.Example: Offer the Aug 31 $8 call option on 1 BTC for free. Have writers put up 1 BTC as collateral and collect a small premium.Is there an API for market makers? or gold from coinabul. Any coin or pawn shop will take them at spot. I am selling a 1958 Franklin Half dollar (worth ~$10) on the ebay clone webstore.com. I stated preferred payment as Bitcoin, but will accept paypal for an additional fee.http://www.webstore.com/1958-Franklin-Half-Dollar,name,19416531,auction_id,auction_detailsIf all goes well, I'd like to suggest adding bit-pay as a preferred seller. It would be a lot of managing work. I considered doing this a while ago, but thought it would be a lot of work for no money and a lot of risk.Overall suggestions:* Shares should trade at silver price, not with shipping. If you ship to warehouse, it is on you. If you xfer shares for silver, you must pay for shipping. Otherwise, you lose the economies of scale for transporting large amounts.* Don't have a expiration date. More like an ETF with delivery.* 1 share = 1/20 oz. Redeem/Issue in 20 share lots per oz. * 1 oz bullion rounds and bars only.* Need to have recent updates on silver proof of inventory* Need a slush account to handle redemption and issues. You need to allow for people to ship you silver to get shares.Â  A good way for people with silver to get bitcoins. Just a thought, change the terms a bit so you can offer generic .999, which these buffalos are. Maybe include a specific premium for eagles, and a discount for junk silver. For delivery, buyers get what you send and must pay the agreeded premium or take the discount.  DCA is effectively scam pushed by brokerage firms to pay more commissions (for stocks, N/A to bitcoins). EVERY TIME they will defend their position by giving the example where you start buying at Price A, then price moves down to Price A/2, you accumulate 2x as much stock, then the stock takes off and you have more stock. What if the volatility is to the upside, and not the downside?Take this example:A)You buy $5,000 bitcoins at $8 (625 coins)-or-B)You buy $1,000 bitcons at $8 (125 coins)You buy $1,000 bitcoins at $10 (100 coins)You buy $1,000 bitcoins at $15 (66.67 coins)You buy $1,000 bitcoins at $25 (40 coins)You buy your last $1,000 bitcoins at $50 (20 bitcoins)Would you rather have $31,250 worth of coins in scenario A, or ~$17,500 in scenario B)?If you believe in an asset, invest what you are willing to lose when you have the funds. Turning $31k trades into $17k trades is for losers.Dont get me wrong, if you are working with an income stream - putting int $1,000 per month - then you will be DCA by default, but its not a 'strategy' that is +ev. I would argue if coins are going to $1000/btc, you are better off buying now no matter what the volatility may bring.Â  Designs for the reverse? I'd like to buy blank notes and fill in myself. We're back to where we were..... 3 days ago All are nice: 2, 3, 4, 1 Have it like a Mad Magazine fold in, but front to back. 1/2 the private key is on the reverse, 1/2 on the obverse. Someone would need to copy both sides of the bill to steal. Could also rip in half. When finished, I would like to buy finished blank color notes on decent paper and load them with a template.  But what if "trusted" person sends to fake person #1 then to fake person#2 then fake person #3. How do you link back to the real scammer? You will be going after 3 people who dont exist.  I will try to throw out a few bids on some call options, size 100. With the price here at 6.80 on 7/9, I'll pay $15.05 for the right to buy 100 bitcoins from you on 7/27 for $700. Sell the option to me, and you will be credited $15.05. Price stays under $7.1505 and you are better off. After that, you'll need to credit my account the difference.I think I threw out a good price, but feel free to outbid.Suggestion: Open up a december 28 2012 option, I would put a bid on a few 100 calls. I threw a few not-so difficult pass phrases into the block chain a while back, only '1LdgTMX2MEqdfT3VcDpX4GyD1mqCP8LkYe' has lost coins. Keep in mind you could/should be able to get a premium to spot when selling well recognized gold coins. Example: APMEX.com is posting a buy price of 1oz US eagles (random year) for $1631.10 and a sell price of 1665.09 with spot at $1595.10. In this case, its only a 2.1% premium if buying at $1,665.09. Congrats. Potential stupid question: Would it be safer to sell a PDF with a private key on it, rather than "sending" coins? Is digital delivered content harder for a chargeback? Why back all 21 million coins? Collect 100k coins at an address and get a company to back it with 100 oz gold. These 100k coins would be traded at a premium, since you can always turn in 1000 coins for 1 oz of gold.Is it possible to differentiate between coins using only one block chain? If so, could facebook collect 100k coins and deem them "facebook coins" and use them for facebook transactions, while mooching off the one 'main' blockchain.  "Hyperinflation" is a bad term. It implies that it is the extension of "normal inflation". As more people realize that they have to get out of bed and work for 8 hours a day for the same pieces of paper that a select group of people only have to print or borrow (w/o repayment), this will lead to hyperinflation. What chump would work in this scenario? It is backed by currencies weaker than bitcoin. The old joke with the punchline "I don't have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you" applies. I'm a huge bitcoin supporter, but if major countries decided to return to a gold standard, I would be selling my coins. But while the world plays pretend with fiat, bitcoin is superior.Â  
25k so close to the market (<5 cents) tells me it someone is ready to pull the trigger at much higher prices. A 25k bid 50 cents off the market is probably some guy trying to goose the market because he's long. I would be careful putting any sell size under $7 at the moment. * Rumors of European capital controls strong positive for bitcoin. Move currency around the world with no govt interaction.* Rumors of MtGox not paying USD: Strong positive for bitcoin. What else would you do with the USD in your acct?Anything could happen, but there is a non-zero risk of waking up to a $10+ bitcoin any given night. Suggestion:Have MTGox price settlements every 4 hours on your site so prices can be agreed upon in advance.Buyer: I will buy at the 2012-06-12 MTGox price at 20:00 GMT provided it is less than $5.70Seller: I will sell at the 2012-06-12 MTGox price at 20:00 GMT provided it is higher than $5.50at 20:00 GMT, it is posted to settle at 5.57, the trade now has an official price. Gox is waiting for the exchange to be set up so they can buy their liabilities back at 50c on the dollar.  I have placed a bid of 0.21 on SATOSHISDAEMON.HORSE. There will be no dividend, and I will request a de-listing once investors have been satisfied. Thanks for your interest in the project! Sorry, SATOSHISDAEMON.horse as listed on the GLBSE will, in effect, never pay a dividend. You should sell those shares at 0.210 btc. If we acquire a new horse there will be a new issue, probably with different terms. After we go a few months without any trades, I will request it gets de-listed. Hope this answers your question.p.s., just waiting on the confirms and I will place a bid of 0.21 for this issue. Yes. Names can change until the horse does something official such as a workout or race. Satoshi's Daemon was not her name at birth and I forget her original name at the moment. There was ~$100 fee to change her name when we acquired her. Thanks for the gesture. However, she may be gone already as JE2 was looking for someone to take her last night after the races, rather than have us pay to ship her back.  Since we may structure it differently, I suggest you sell after we re-organize. Thanks for the interest! Sadly, JE2 and I have determined she is not a racehorse. The trainers and jockeys have confirmed that she does not have a desire to compete. She gave all she had in the last race, and was never in contention. As of now, she is going to be basically given away. The trainer wants to try to run her on the turf, but from a manager's perspective, we will not pay for the experience. We still have an outstanding balance which will be returned to investors.As a show of good faith to our loyal investors, I am going to place a bid for all membership shares of SATOSHISDAEMON.horse at the IPO price. We recommend you sell at this price. This was an experiment that JE2 and I put together, and don't want ~100 BTC to ruin that relationship. Once the dust settles, we may want to seek a claiming horse and race within 2 weeks of acquisition under a new issue. Please give 24-48 hours for the bid in the market, while I re-align the wallets & addresses ahead of the holiday weekend (read: I am too disappointed to deal with the loss right now). Thanks to everyone who participated and followed along! Disappointing to say the least. Land of the free, home of the brave Her morning line is 30:1.

Holy crap I want to do this, if only to f*ck with govt regulators. With interest rates at 0% and fee after fee, this seems economically possible now. I would scan each bill that is deposited, and when you withdraw you get back the exact same bill (I am thinking by making your money non-fungible that it would be more legal?) This would also mean no fraud. Back on topic: I don't understand the hate for MtGox. The most successful bitcoin application yet, and yet it gets dragged through the mud. Very disappointing first start out. With her odds going off at 11:1 in a 14 horse race, she was far from the long shot in the race. The race was an easy race too with soft competition. When talking with the jockey after the race, he confirmed that she just wasn't that fast on the muddy track.On the plus side: She was run clean - no drugs in her. JE2 is more familiar than I am, but most trainers juice their horses in the weeks/days before the race, and run their horses on Lasix. After this result, we have some leverage to go to the trainer and demand some extra help.Looks like we will get another start in the next 3 weeks.

Current book value is 0.0686 BTC per Bitcoin Interest Right (BIR). There is also a liability to the prior owners who have the right to the first $500 that the horse wins (Cuff deal). We feel we need at least $4500 to comfortably progress with Satoshi's Daemon for her racing career. For her first race on May 2nd, this means that there will only be a dividend for a Win or Place. However, it is worth noting that the $500 liability will be paid for a 3rd, 4th or 5th (partial payment) showing, increasing her 'book value'. With a strong showing, expect a higher dividend payment for next race due to 1) Potentially higher purse 2) Fewer liabilities and 3) Higher account balance. If she is claimed, we retain all winnings from the race, but lose the horse to a new owner. The claiming price is $5,000 for this race. Expect dividends to be paid on Sunday, May 06.

Bidding 100btc thinking you'll take it when the next highest bid is 2.422 only works if you are the only one with this strategy. Received my tiny payment. Thank you.Hopefully this was a proof of concept this year. I see advertising potential with this, you could get some bitcoin businesses donating a decent amount of coins next year. We were delayed. She has had 2 official workouts now. There are some videos of her galloping on Youtube, just search for "Satoshis Daemon". Feel free to post your thoughts. Thanks everyone for the interest. I don't want to be bumping threads with little information. Events:Satoshi's Daemon had her 2nd workout today at the Louisiana Fair Grounds (3/31) and finished with the best time (#1) out of 8 horses on a good (not fast due to the rain) track. Improved her time by 2.40 seconds despite the sub-optimal track.Two weeks ago (3/18), she had her 1st workout ever and finished 17th out of 18 horses. She started out *very* slow in her first official event.Some Official Links:Workout link for today: http://www.equibase.com/static/workout/FG033112USA-EQB.html#SATOSHISDAEMONSatoshi's Daemon profile page: http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&refno=8602579&registry=THistory:This has taken longer than we had hoped. She had (has) an attitude problem and our attempts to fast track (no pun intended) her only frustrated the trainers to where they didn't want to deal with her. She was shipped to Mississippi and took the long, slow track to becoming a racehorse. I am not the horseman that my partner is, but this is common.Status:Satoshi's Daemon needs to get gate approval, then can be scheduled to race. She will be entered into a 4.5 furlong training race on April 18 2012. If she breaks well, she gets her gate approval, then can be entered into an official race! Early/Mid May is my best guess without setbacks. I want to thank all bitcoin interest rights holders (traded on the GLBSE) for their patience. I pledge $49.99+ in btc when it hits beta. I have been on the losing side of up front costs too many times - while this seems like a slam dunk, it is a personal issue for me. I check the armory thread all the time. OT question about deterministic wallet: If someone were to get a few private keys from a deterministic wallet, can he extrapolate the data to retrieve all the keys? Great Job with the site. Wish I saw it earlier, I would have created a pool. Do the funds somehow wind up with the RP campaign, or in your pocket? Me too. I think I broke it. Links to 4 torrents, first 2 went started OK, then the phantom box. Maybe an incentive, or at least the ability, for the user to delete the file after successful download? Thanks for doing this.

How do we know you didn't just create a name here of a respectable ebay account? Does it say anywhere on your e-bay account that you are Zodiacdragon84 on bitcointalk? I have taken the $483. Thank You. But I would have the newspaper IN the 'after' photo. Wouldn't this satisfy doubters?Day 0: 'Before picture', place MD5 in blockchainDay 100: 'After picture' with today's Newspaper Thanks.My situation is a bit different. If you ever see before and after photos of a fat person who became thin using product X, how do you know that person wasn't thin and got paid to get fat? You will sometimes see a person holding up a newspaper, but the problem is you can always hold up news from a year ago.So, my solution is to throw the photo's MD5 into the blockchain once taken. I don't want to post the picture first, or even announce the md5 publicly. If my project works out I want to prove before and after.Looking at that story gave me an idea though: have the camera put the hash into the block chain when taken. You can the photo existed at least when it hit the chain, and not later.
Silk Road doesn't sell drugs or guns. I suggest bitcoin-idol combined with march madness. Top 64 in a bracket system, and we vote with bitcoin. Have voting proceeds either go to bit-pay, the girls, charity, or into a black hole. Could an expert let me know if I'm doing this in the best way possible...I need to do a set of before & after photos. I want to prove that the 'before' photos came first. So I took an MD5 of a photo which as an example is: 00000000398b240be4ae3661ca630ec695d2a6a5. I put this into this page (#3): https://gobittest.appspot.com/Address, at #3, and came up with an address of: 11111oVqz8zbAY75wyvM3xKn4GxLA6ak, Which I sent 0.0001 coins to, and is in the block chain at '2012-01-31 23:48:38'. Looking at the Hash160 of this, it confirms 00000000398b240be4ae3661ca630ec695d2a6a5 (https://blockexplorer.com/a/1111LL3D)Later on, I plan on taking a photo with today's newspaper of the same project to prove the work was done.Would this prove the work is done for those who can not be with me to verify? Would you do it differently? Same problem here, 2 different torrents. I get the throbber, but no stats. You need to bet both sides in proportion to what you think the outcome will be. Example: A die will come up number '6'. You bet 5 on 'NO' and 1 on 'YES'. If anyone feels lucky and bets against true 5:1 odds, you make money in the long run. Thank you government for allowing me to spend my own money. I owe you one. In for 12 months. Good luck.Need a few dentists out there to subscribe for their waiting room. Why can't votes be sent to bitcoin public address 1VoteForPedroxxxxxxxÂ  (whatever base 58 allows and checksum)? Because the thread was bumped, I will reassure everyone that the horse is on pace to race this spring. Waiting to hear word on when the official workout will be, was supposed to be late January, but it might have been moved back. Jesse and I were impressed with the horse and tried to fast track her into an aggressive schedule, and it backfired on us, costing us some precious time. But all appears to be a 'go' right now.The stronger bitcoin market is hurting the dividend schedule a bit (and the share price).Thanks everyone for their interest! Few questions:How do you print the (mini) private keys on that little circle? Looks like many were printed on piece of paper, then a hole punch was used. If new coins were purchased, can the indentation be larger, accommodating longer, non-mini keys?If I bought holograms from this group purchase, how would that prevent someone else from buying the same hologram and produce a duplicate coin? I'd like to guarantee every coin that meets the outside appearance, and at 75c over cost, sounds like it is inviting trouble. small potion, I have 4 of them. Says medical, restore 100 health.

Nice work. This is similar to the 100 btc bounty I put up for a compromised casascius coin: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52004.0If an attack were to happen, there would be an incentive to publish the breach for 100 btc, users would stop accepting coins as payment, and owners of the coins would immediately redeem.Question: How can this concept be expanded to know if someone is reading my email, or has logged into my bank account?  in So there's a chance...I like how you sent btc from the address to prove you own it.

Well done.Mine came with ford keys, not PorscheÂ   When phone is in bluetooth range, release snack. Good luck. Will be looking for news reports. Keep in mind its a two way street: People would rather work for a strong currency than a weak one. Production & quality should increase in a deflationary environment. 
"Early adopters" are not like the people who complain about "early adopters". They invest in new technology, new businesses, & new risks in general. They make a lot of bad investments, but deal with the loss differently than the whiners of "early adopters".  I agree he can refuse the transaction. I don't know the details of what happened.Maybe this leads to a clean coin exchange. I'll pay 50.500 btc for a virgin block. What is at issue here? A) "Bad business decision by MtGox" - ok, I can agree, but haven't heard both sides of the story.B) "MtGox can't do that." - They can do whatever they want with their business (not including defrauding people). MtGox owes the community nothing. I wont buy a cup with a heart on it. How about one with your "Bitbrew" cursive into a coffee mug? It was taken off of the wikipedia page. Hoax? I've made some pretty crappy investing decisions in my life. No one wants a piece of those losers, those are my problems.But buy/mine a few BTC a year ago and I need to spread the wealth.Losses = privatizeGains = socialize Makes sense. Thank you.This is the most used service for my bitcoins by far. Thanks mjcmurfy. Stupid question: Why is it safer to download an .avi from bitcointorrentz.com rather than downloading the torrent? Can't my ISP identify bitcointorrentz.com as a pirated site? I might have to take up smoking! Best of luck with your site.I've read stories of the tax man sending a bill to USA residents who order cigarettes online. Does anyone know how the state finds out? Voluntary from buyer, customs, credit card statements, voluntary from seller?Are packages labeled as "carton cigarettes" for customs? I have a stock in GLBSE, and think I could have raised additional funds if there was an independent site that made a few phone calls on behalf of potential investors. * I could post an "information checked by XYZ company" on my website/signature. If XYZ adds value to my stock, I would pay for it. Similar to verisign.A "level 2 service" could have a guarantee of some sort, where you hold some coins payable to investors in case of a scam/fraud. These funds could come from investors betting the site isn't a scam, not necessarily from the companies.  create a bitbill for 1.00 btc. Have a DB at trusted central server.on bill, have 12 scratchoffs. This particular bill has 12 A-z on the scratchoff, while under the scratchoff has A-z as well.You hand the bill to someone, he puts in the 12 char code at central server to confirm 1.00 btc. In this case, it is:A B C D E F G H I 5 4 3 He then secretly scratches off 1-12 boxes (his choice), which reveal a new code. In this case he scratches off 2 to make the new code, and tells the server what he did:A B Q D E F G 8 I 5 4 3The central server now needs this new code to redeem. Even if the bill was compromised, the first person wouldn't know what was scratched off.W/O scratchoffs, you can just keep appending a prior code. Maybe each new merchant could attach a new QR code (sticker/print) w/20 random chars. What about a 0.01 BTC dabloon to be thrown out at Martis Gras parade? People collect them like crazy. What's the cheapest we could get a token for? For low security, give away coins, I wouldn't put the public address on the coin, only private. Public/Private keys imply a level of security, which is too high for this.Run a vanitygen so that all private keys equate to public keys '1NoSend...' so that people know that these addresses were created in a low security environment for newbies, and not to fund these addresses. Even Grandma would be able to understand if her account started '1NoSend...' to not put money in it. Now, a newbie would see the private key and ask himself "if only there was a way that I could fund an address without giving away the private key...", which leads to the understanding of public/private technology.edit: have your website be able to sweep these (and only these) private keys to a public address of their choosing, or to check balance. I have faith this won't cost me anything. If you're robbed or come across a bad employee, this could help track that person down.  First: I am not associated with Casascius in any way.

I won't release bounty to poorly produced fakes. This is not stupid insurance.

On 12/31/2012 I will refund to sending addresses.Also, I want to sign this post with the same signature in my GLBSE post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46929.0, but I can't get it to work - tips on how I did it before? Bought a package yesterday, can't download. I click on 'Download Now', nothing happens. I have plenty of credit.EDIT: I don't think I waited the 5 seconds! Works. I have tested both pre-pay and multiple downloads, both work for me. Excellent work. nice service. I would prefer to buy a block of GB, rather than send for each download.also, a better way of downloading more than 1 file at a time. You cant have one tab download file 'A', while another tab downloads file 'B'. Each tab gives status of 'B'. I have this issue as well. I used random characters, and wonder if a '\' or double quotes are messing it up blatant advertising, which I will overlook because it's super cool! 
not at all. I'm a Casascius fan. Just pointing out that anyone could have sent that e-mail. How do we know the guy who wrote the note is the guy who owns the site? To take it one step further... why not just scan it on the shelf and walk out? It's now yours. Eliminate the middle man. Love the idea. I have noticed a trend over the last year from keeping private keys "private" - no matter what, into another way to exchange information. In a way, I just did this. I loaded up a bitaddress paper wallet with 5 btc each (x7), and sold one of the qr codes. He inputted into strongcoin and was able to send immediately (iirc?).  Â We're happy with our investment so far. Hopefully there will be some coin to spread around. Great service. Thank you.I had to use chrome instead of firefox 7.0.1 to import a private key, the "import" button would not activate.

If all goes as planned, she should run in top condition for at least a few years under our ownership. Owners hold 10,000 BIRs and we're offering 500 of them, a 5% stake.Whenever there is an owner distribution in USD, we'll make an equivalent distribution in bitcoins. So if SD wins $15,000 and owners take out $8,000 of it, we'll make a 1,600 btc dividend (with bitcoins at $5 each), or 0.16 / interest.

Because Louisiana has four race tracks, we will be able to race year-round for attractive purse money. The horse has been named "Satoshi's Daemon".

Steve: Just saw this post. Nice meeting with you.I'm a little out of place in the development area; please excuse.The issues I see with exposing private keys are:a) the client may assign change to that address at any time if in wallet.datb) a new bitcoin user may expose his private key for his public payment address, which he receives a stream of payments.If all semi-private keys meant to be 'published/printed' started with a certain prefix (i.e '1BTC' or '2'), the client would never send change to those addresses. When a new user creates a new address, he could select 'for deposit only' if it were his billing address.In general, I see value in exchanging private keys in print for payment.edit: easier to get funds out of 'savings' addresses that only exist on paper/your head. Just used your service for the first time last night. Very slick!Coincidence? you show me a qr code with a private key on it which has 2.0 btc on it, with change address. When scanned, a website asks how much to send. Punch in 1.23 to your address, and 0.77 goes to change address. Note is now garbage. Website doesn't hold any coins (but must be trustworthy enough to facilitate the transaction)Or, send coins to BTCWebsite.com. BTCWebsite.com prints out notes for you, with QR codes for whoever scans them. You lose them, they are gone, same as cash. Have to trust the website, as they now hold coins. Maybe if notes are not spent by 4:00am they are returned to your personal wallet. Just received a few coins, and they do look great.For those that might be a little timid about paying 1.2 for 1.0 coins, remember that you may be able to get that premium back if exchanging in person.Â  i.e. I'll send 6 coins to your wallet to mow my lawn, or 5 physical coins. When someone sends coins to Mybitcoin, they are now Mybitcoin's coins, and sender receives an IOU for same amount of coins in return. It is easy to say "I have 100 coins" when that person means "I have an IOU for 100 coins". If it was blatant, then it is fraud and not theft. We should all be careful when sending coins, if they dont have a reason to honor the IOUs, or don't protect their coins well enough, we shouldn't send in the first place. To finish the thought if not clear: If MtGox goes belly up, the auditor can then be sued for damages, and put up a bond. Of course, the auditor is going to require a fee to do this. Pick your poison: do you want to pay higher fees for a little more security, or place a discount on MtGox funds that you lay claim to.

I printed the one above out, so I'm not crazy, looking at it now. Stupid, serious question: Is it too high tech? Why not just print up a QR code included on person's bill? He can leave cash or pay with bitcoins or any mix of that. This way, you only need the customer to have internet. Waitress can check the terminal in back to verify payment came through. Or print up 100 qrcodes before and hand them to customer. Waitress would write total due on the sheet of paper. To offset capital gains up to your loss. Otherwise, you can take off $3k/year. So, if you've been holding onto Apple stock for the last decade, sell $25k in profit to offset the bitcoin loss.Someone please verify.

Create a private key and give a share to your lawyer, college roomate, aunt Mary, neighbor, co-worker, etc. These people would never be able to come together without you being aware. However, upon your untimely death they could seek each other out, and if you have the threshold amount of shares, they can decrypt your coins. BitcoinIron.comBitcoinSteel.com What does not kill bitcoin will make it stronger. I intend to come up with random, save it on paper and store it where one would store jewelry/gold. What's cool is that I can now store my 'gold' in my safety deposit box at the bank, in my wallet, engraved on my toothbrush, or on a postcard sent to my grandma. Double edged sword indeed, my 'gold' can now be stolen in many different places too.

I am not a programmer.* Windows 7, 64bit* installed Python 2.7, its in \Python27* Downloaded v1.2 from: https://github.com/jackjack-jj/pywallet I threw it right in the \Python27 directoryCode:C:\Python27>pywallet.pyTraceback (most recent call last):Â Â File "C:\Python27\pywallet.py", line 1320, in <module>Â Â  Â class WIRoot(resource.Resource):NameError: name 'resource' is not definedEDIT: Fixed. Thank you! Suggestion to MtGox:Monthly/Yearly cap on fees. This will bring in the bots.Or:Buy an annual membership. Just saw this thread. THANK YOU! Its just a single hop. Once it's revealed, you would want to withdraw. I request an idiots guide to doing this. I can't compile anything, but yet I don't want to do it on a website either. I have been playing around on this site for the last few days, and support has always gotten right back to me. Sites like this were the reason I got into bitcoin, there are a lot of people who want to get together to trade opinions, but it has been difficult & expensive to do so before bitcoin was invented.I will try and dabble in the sports area when I get the chance, so I hope to trade opinions with others on this forum. I am my own central bankF*** the Fed Will work for bitcoinI MinedI Mined My OwnDo you Mine? Send the coin to yourself, then open the flower for 15 minutes so that all the bot owners think they just missed it. FWIW, I mined 10,000,000 ShitCoins before I took it public. It never caught on Bitcoin decentralized movie rental. I want to be able to rent out the movies I own.  meh. When market makers are super long and don't want any more coins with the price at $10.75, they will put out a bid for $10.50 for 1000 coins, but have their finger on the cancel button.I want higher prices, but pointing out an angle. How do you get ousted? Can't you just sell into the market?If you need to sell 50 and the market is 10.10 for 10, 10.05 for 20 and 10.00 for 20, you can sell 50 @ 10 and get an avg price of 10.04. Without the "early adopter problem", who has the incentive to adopt it? BetterCoin might not have an early adoption problem, but it would have an adoption problem. I disagree. Regulations don't change the presence of spoiled food. She should sell her ice cream without regulations and be responsible for it. If you're going to introduce all these regulations and she follows them to the letter, the IHDA (whatever it is) should be responsible for the end product; but of course, the IHDA would never be held accountable. In a free market, private 'regulators' develop and act as auditors who take responsibility (i.e. pay if sued) for the product after inspection. But with government intervention, you get worse products & higher costs. I bought another code for multiplayer. I don't think this guy sleeps, he sends codes back within a minute. Thank you! Issue with me: I don't want $30k in my MtGox acct. In a scam-free world (coins at $10, up 25% last 60 minutes), I'd probably do 1500 coins for $30k+interest, and if price got to $20, I'm buying with that $30k and deal is settled. Like add-ons for browsers? That would be cool. Someone writes an add-on for their sportsbetting site, etc. random thought: Instead of bidding, why not send the coins to a personal bid address for each auction. This way, there are no fake bids. losing bids get their coins back obviously. You might not want to do that if buying a laptop or car, but if I'm bidding on a 0.85btc beach ball, it speeds up the whole process. Signed up for demo. Suggestion: while its not a 0-100 market, something like HSX.com may work well for bitcoins.
Game suggestion:* number 0-99* Player guesses number* Computer guesses higher or lower by exactly 1 in the directionThis way it can be a 50/50 proposition. There must be an edge in this game, but I can't figure it out.Example: [secret number is 86, give sha]Player (0-99): 50Computer: (higher and guesses 51)Player (52-99): 90Computer: (lower and guesses 89)Player (52-88): 80Computer: (higher and guesses 81)Player (82-88): 85Computer: (higher and guesses 86)COMPUTER WINS! Just purchased a code, total wait time was about 1 minute. Thanks! Can we get an idea of threshold you need? 1000 oz minimum? will that mean $6 over spot? etc. min/max?sounds scary. Do funds need to clear 2 confirms by sunday 20:00? Do you expect a 5,000 btc deposit with 1 minute to go? My password wasn't compromised at mtgox. i like the jackpot.How about a defined timeline, but the 2nd highest deposit wins the jackpot?I already suggested game ends after no new bids after 24 hrs or a 10.00 btc deposit to kill the round.Or, countdown time starts off at 24 hours, but goes down 2 minute after each deposit, i.e 1st deposit is 23hrs 58 mins. 2nd deposit is 23 hrs 56 mins, etc. maybe a running pot total could be posted somewhere. Or, another column which shows how much new money is needed for payout by each entry. Banned member bounty: 20btcThe banned member would get a perpetual loan of 20btc from a 3rd party and the forum would pay the bills to the loaning institution (say 1btc/year @ 5%). When/if the member comes back, the bills stop being paid, but the banned member still has to pay the 20btc back, enforced by 3rd party. This way, the banned member can spend his 20btc right away. As long as he doesn't come back, he's fine.This is how you bribe people - you can't just give someone $100,000 and promise they don't leak the photos of you and your wife's sister. Everyone has to have a vested interest. arggh, so the rules to the right on round #3 don't apply to round #3? Those people investing at 18:29:50 must have expected a miracle!enjoy my 0.30 coins whoever at the top! So round #3 is over, even though someone has placed a wager within the last 24hrs? suggestion for jackpot rounds:Bounty to end the current round, say 10 BTC (50% to owner, 50% to pool). If the jackpot gets close/over 10, there would be an incentive for the last guy to pay the bounty and win the jackpot.  Sorry, but I can't find my answers in the threads..A) If someone bets less than the minimum (0.30) or more than the maximum (1.2), they can still 'play' and get the 10%, but they are not eligible for the jackpot, nor does it move the countdown timer another 24hrs?B) an 'unconfirmed entry' doesn't extend the clock, so you shouldn't wait until there is 5 minutes left in the 24hr period to place an entryC) how many confirms until official?  What is confusing is using a decimal point at a level other than the BTC level. I suggest if anyone uses a decimal point, it is implied at the BTC level4.12345678 BTC is equal to the sum of: x 4 x 123 x 456 x 78It would be bad practice to say 4,123.45678 mBTC Glanced through this whole thread, and think you're onto something.Observation: Isn't it funny how we all (at least in the US) can look at a $5 bill, three $1 bills, 5 quarters, 6 dimes, a nickle and 4 pennies and quickly come up with $9.94? Imagine if someone on the boards here suggested that a 'gavin' is 0.25 btc, and a 'binary' is 0.05, he would get laughed off the boards. one bitcoin received coins today, happy with them.Thank you Yeah, it would involve a central authority, which most won't go for. Trying to get around you spending coins intended for myself. Even if you were to destroy the private key after transfer, if there was ever a breach in a client's wallet, there would be doubt cast upon yourself. Firstbits.com could allow pointing of the address to another, no?A) I find 1NickABCD, and "1Nick" is the firstbits after I send 0.00001 btc to it.B) Along comes Nick Smith who wants to buy 1Nick for 10BTC. C) Nick Smith Generates 1NickXYZ... on his own and sends 0.0001 btc to itD) I send the private keys of 1NickABCD to Firstbits and the pointer 1NickXYZ... E) Transaction is complete, I get 10BTCPrivate keys of 1NickABCD are then published on firstbits. Now 1NickXYZ... would show up at firstbits as "1Nick" If you're going to do that, I'll need you to pay $55 pretty cool:
I can't add/delete markets. Want to get rid of EUR and GBP vs btc and add thUSD. I hit the '+' and cant delete or add market "fake" may be a bad term, perfectly OK by me to bid $16.25 for 10,000 BTC if you are just trying to show demand and sell at $16.85 or so. It's Ok to show offers if you don't want to sell, but rather buy a few pennies lower.However, if someone is bidding $16.25 for 10,000 when the market is $16.70, and have someone offer 20,000 at $16.25, that person bidding for 10,000 btc better eat them. Donated to the cause. Good workFirstbits: 187G (Helps if you received coins before 0.3.18 with the 100 default addresses)Can we tell if all 3 char combos are taken, how may 4 combos left, etc? Doesn't work well for creating address on the fly. This is a good way to remember a static payment address when there. I'd vote for wild wild west. Bounce 1 btc off of firstbits.com, and you can name it whatever you want. Go for max growth and see what users demand. Don't allow to search for "Meze Grill", just the firstbits. I would think the owner of '1mtb' (who is not Meze Grill) might register "Meze Grill", but as long as the owner is aware, or registers a new address, he's fine.I like the idea of paying 1 btc to register the name, firstbits sends back 0.90 btc to the address in question. firstbits gets the 0.10 fee. Great work. A+Suggestion is to pay to register a name with an address that shows up on your site.I 'own' "187g". when someone asks for my address to pay, I would say "Bob's lemonade stand at '187g' ", and it is confirmed on your site with the full address: 187G5EpRm7rYs6M7X5QDEZpqvw5iVQvXtF and "Bob's Lemonade Stand". "1mtbk" would show up as "Meze Grill", etc so the bitcoin world came to an end a week ago, and coins are down $1 to $16.50? Looks pretty bullish to me. I check your site all the time, great work. Due to the extreme volatility, it is too difficult to leave an order out there, but I caution against offering a service that cancels orders based on mtgox price. Too much risk for bitoption.org.I'll contribute 1 btc bounty for a very basic functioning bot that you approve. Please include a basic BS model.I like your API, I place all orders with it using an excel spreadsheet. I don't place orders through the browser.Suggestion: fees - 0% if you make the market, but 2% if you hit the bid/offer. Give an incentive to market makers and bot writing. The people who wait for a huge move and pick off orders should pay the fee.best of luck with the site. bitcoin is not related to dollars, euros or gold. By moving the decimal place, there is an inference that it is. My story is just the opposite: I sold short around $6, bought it back around $20, was down close to $50k. But I then leverage up and shorted at $30 and thank god some sucker sold to me after it dropped 20%, and made $100k+ in the process. Someone can put up 1.00 BTC, sell the 12/29/2011 100 call and receive $6.70 in their MtGox account.Â  If the price rallies to $95 per coin, they keep the 1.0 BTC and the $6.70?Or sell 5 of the 12/29/2011 $50 calls, put up 5.00 BTC and get $9.0 each ($45 total), which you can use to buy ~2.0 btc at mtgox at $22.50 each? Can you use the funds right away? If bitcoin could be put on an ironkey like device, would that help?https://www.ironkey.com/ I'll stick one on a baby toy I bought with bitcoins. Looking back, I'd rather have the $5,300 now instead of the toy. I have less than 100k, should I answer <100k? never. Hope I'm wrong. not enough the value of goods traded doesn't depend on the quantity of coins. Do you think if finding blocks were 500 instead of 50 that there would be 10x the commerce going on? Didn't want to bump, but a deal is being worked out for less coins and older aircraft. Thanks for the interest. Reminds me of the Yogi Berra quote "Nobody goes to that restaurant, its too crowded"Prices are rising to flush out the hoarders. Where do you get 681 coins? I see volume of 21,000+ at mtgox according to the ticker. Is there a volume number I don't see?
I spent the $3.99 and bought it. Not sure who programmed it, but I am happy with the purchase. I cringe at spending more than $0.99 for any app as well. I just spent the $3.99 and bought the iphone app. Last price, 24hr/7day/30 day line charts. Says "give us one more week" for mybitcoin wallet.Because I'm always checking MtGox in safari, I'm happy with the purchase. The more the hoarders hoard, the more my coins can purchase. The total value of goods exchanged remains the same in either case.HOARD ON! I hate being the stupidest one in this community."Do not overrate what you have received, nor envy others. He who envies others does not obtain peace of mind." a) tattoo the password on the bottom of your foot.b) How long of a password would I need to make it so it took a computer a year or so to crack? Put the data in a SDB, tell the lawyer that the data needs to be cracked, its a 20 char A-z password. When computers get 2x as fast, encrypt the encrypted file with another 20 char A-z. I suggest a newbie discussion room. For what MtGox has done for bitcoin, they are underpaid. So if I keep pyramiding bad bets, eventually it will be a good bet. Genius. Think I'll send 0.01 btc to that address, just to screw up his accounting. Pooled mining from the client. This would give the immediate impression that you get paid to contribute to the network, no matter how little you get. Implied network power for last X blocks, using block explorer:(2 ^ 256 / (2^224/Difficulty)) / (time in seconds between blocks) * (number of blocks)Example:Implied network power between blocks 127259 and 127295(2 ^ 256 / (2 ^ 224 / 434877.045527)) / (20423 seconds) * (36 blocks) = 3,292,375,105,494.02 hashes per second(actually, this seems low) I am serious.It is a standing offer that I anticipate would not go through until coins get closer to $13 - $15. At that point, it should make sense for group of investors to put the cash together.I will create a new bitcoin address, post here and deposit the 10k upon request to verify funds. Ha. I'm sure 10k bitcoins will buy planes, castles and small islands in the near future. I'll settle for a small plane. Open offer: 10,000 BTC for http://www.cessna.com/single-engine/skycatcher.htmlCurrently about 115,00 USD each. I would like a *brand new* one (less than 50 hours) delivered to any airport of my choice in the USA. If you're looking to put serious money into bitcoin, but don't want to move the market, this is an option. I'm only on YouPorn for 3-4 minutes, then lose interest for some reason. 2 Hours?!? "Son, you can have one slice of pizza or one year in college"I'm not one to talk, my wallet is full of -100 btc transactions for tips and nice posts  You can still kill a guy with them, right? Sorry, my question was how big/heavy is a railroad spike? 10" and 1-2 pounds? I can't really tell from the photos if its the size/weight of scissors or the size/weight of a hammer.Are you taking orders?I'll pay 25btc for 2.Also, request you take a before, a few during, and after photos. I think these would be a cool gift. How much does one weigh? The 2nd picture looks more like a letter opener. Being serious here...Maybe these other community projects should help the bitcoin network. I download the 'protine' project, but might also run hashes 10 minutes out of every hour (user setting). In this way you get paid to help out other projects.
because it's my computer and my power Would there be interest if I re-opened the difficulty wagering at BSB for a specific block #?It would still be in beta, and would not charge any fees. As a reminder, it's pari-mutual. If you calculate a 40% chance of being over X on block Y, you should bet in the ratio of 2:3. An gambler/miner would wager on one side or the other as a hedge. Good work. I thank you for the wagers. If it makes you feel any better, BSB is down a bit of coins since inception. We set very low juice to encourage action, usually about 0-4 coins per 1000 wagered.Setting up daily games has been a chore, and weekly football worked great. It was difficult keeping on top of the scoring mostly. I've come up with ways to implement automatic scoring, but it is slow testing. I plan on getting back to televised MLB/NBA games. This seemed to bring in the most action.Bonus: Expect a new set of wagers that ARE being tested right now, data is flying. Its secret in case it doesn't work out. I'll pay 1.00 btc provided I get my 1.00 back after I don't hit the servers 10,000 times in 24 hrs. pay 0.01 btc to get on the whitelist. I read it as a joke I'm not a web/programming expert, but the getTrades.php doesn't load anymore from the script. I read the getTrades.php from mtgox as a string, and I think that is the problem. I've sold on biddingpond in the past. My suggestion is to have a payment address field when setting up the auction. Using the block explorer, it would be a way to verify payment as sent. Also a way to verify that fees should be charged for listing the auction. Got error first time trying, worked after refresh.I like the site. Suggestion: Log scale for the difficulty chart. At the time of your post, there are no open wagers to bet on. The MtGox wagers close at the end of each month, the end of March wagers will open in a couple weeks. We offer national televised games as well, currently NCAA basketball and NBA. Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass. Don't play too often, and btc>usd. Someone should be able to input the serial # of the bill on a website and get a small sum of coins. That $10 bill has 6x "4's" on it, wish I had it to play liar's poker. Sure,You would effectively make a market. If bitcoins close today at $0.6000 and you feel there is a 50/50 chance they will close 2/28 at $0.6000, you should bet equal amounts on each side of the 60 cent strike price.So if you be 100 coins on each side at 60 cents and the wagering ends at 2.15 (+115) on the OVER because a miner is trying to hedge against lower prices, you effectively will make 15 coins if over, and lose 15 coins if under. MtGox wagering settled at 0.5161 for the month of January.

Yes, waiting on a response. Looks like I'm the only one, so not worried. I deposited 4 bitcoins 34 confirmations ago, and hasn't shown up yet. Its in the BBE.
$8500 just crossed the tape, 40c - 44c Should read "Stop the fed, use bitcoins instead."  thank you for the help. I am happy to work on it.

There will be February 28th 2011 wagers opening soon.good luck I am looking to corner the bitcoin wagering market.I will bid 123 BTC. I bumped this to say that there has been some activity on the MtGox ending price of January 2011. Currently about 5,000+ coins if anyone has an opinion. Zero fees for this new contract, so feel free to bet both sides.The price will be settled with an average price weighting at MtGox for all trades at MtGox on January 31st 2011 Eastern Time. Note this is a weighted price average. I will post all MtGox trades for Jan 31st on bitcoinsportsbook.com. Certainly! Good luck.

Maybe thats where I got the idea fromÂ   coins have increased in value, the site is a bit expensive. Thank you for visiting the site. I need to create the help page - this is my fault.Wagering closes at the DATE/TIME indicated on the bet. All wagers are pari-mutual, meaning you wager with other participants on the site. If you are familiar with horse race betting, it is the same. The timing of your bet in this case is similar to placing a bet at a horse racing track with 30 minutes until close - there are few wagers at the moment. Once the time becomes closer, more wagers are attracted. Everyone will get the same line upon close. I'm not sure of your exact wager, but if you bet on mtgox over 0.30 for 10 coins, you can freely bet up to 10 coins on the under 0.30 right now in margin (most you can lose is only 10 coins total). Once the wager closes on 12/31, you'll only need to maintain a worst-case scenario and can freely withdraw the balance of the coins. We have a market maker who will price out each contract and put 1000+ coins or so on each side when the wager is close to going off.You understand how the line works. If there are 100 coins on wager A and 200 coins on wager B, then those 300 coins will be split proportionately among the winning bets.Rules for MtGox USD Price for Jan 2011 close eastern time: A settlement will be given for price action for trades that take place on january 31st, 2011. All trades that day (eastern time) will be price weighted. So, 1000 coins trade at 0.25 and 100 coins trade at 0.26, the settlement would be (1000*.25 + 100*.26)/1100 = 0.250909.  I had a similar idea - bitcoin graffiti - create a large blank canvas, say 20,000 x 20,000 pixels (400 million total pixels) and charge 0.0001 btc to edit each pixel (1btc gives you 10,000 edits). This would be 40,000 btc to change the entire picture at once.cool page I am not a domino's pizza fan but if you set up a way for me to pay via bitcoins, I'm in.Order dominos pizza via command line:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7pPajOvQGo&feature=player_embedded#!

I added some <html> and a <title>. Let me know if it needs anything else.Rolling over the quantity now gives the individual orders. Works best in non-firefox browsersÂ   That is a great idea - use block numbers instead of dates. I should switch to that.Right now I'm a majority of the market, and I might not be the most talented in predicting future difficulty levels (I will lose btc). If the contracts become self-sustaining, I'll open up more markets. I am open to suggestions. My thinking is that 1 month difficulty is almost predictable, as it is only 2 changes away.Oh for the days of triple digit difficulty and CPU generation... I have received some interest in re-opening the difficulty factor wagering at bitcoinsportsbook.com (BSB) therefore:BSB will offer pari-mutual betting on the difficulty factor 3 months in advance. Wagering closes at the end of each month. Example: Wagering is now open for March 2011 difficulty, and bets will be frozen 12/31/10 11:59pm ET. April 2011 difficulty settlement will have betting closed 1/31/11 11:59pm ET, etc. There are NO FEES with this wager at this time.I have created an opening line for the following difficulty levels to expire 3/31/11:25,000 98.7%50,000 88.9%75,000 72.1%100,000 56.1%125,000 42.0%150,000 32.4%200,000 18.6%250,000 11.5%I'm basing this off of my calc of a 50/50 of difficulty at 109,820.Quick tip for pari-mutual wagering: If you don't agree with the current market, the best solution is to bet the percentage you believe it to be.Example #1: You think the 50/50 mark is 50,000. Your best solution is to wager 20 on 'OVER' and 20 on 'UNDER' on the 50,000 wager. You are only required to put up 20 coins on this wager. Once a line is set on 12/31 you are refunded coins above the worst case scenario. Example #2: You believe the difficulty will be over 200,000 40% of the time. Your best wager is to put 20 on 'OVER' and 30 on 'UNDER'. You need 30 coins in margin to do this. Again, you also are returned coins above the worst case scenario.Once the betting is closed a worst case scenario is calculated and you are then free to wager/withdraw unused coins. In Example #2, if the odds went off at 2:1, you would be able to withdraw another 15 coins. (either win 40/lose 30 net +10 OR win 15/lose 30 net -15).Good Luck! I am working on a generation calculator which takes the network growth into consideration: www.taters.net/btcgc It is static right now, I will collect data and make it dynamic. cost of a 5970 at $500 USD generating 0.625 ghash/seccoins at 0.19current network size of 95 ghash/secnetwork growth 15.23% per 1000 blocksit would take over 50,000 blocks to pay for the 5970. I don't like the tone of this post. I have nothing but praise for MtGox.
We quote the decimal line along with the american odds in brackets. i.e decimal: 4.5454 / 1.2804 and american: +355/-357 for tomorrow nights game.Â  I'm unfamiliar with fractional, if a game is 5/2, are you credited with 50 for 20 bet? Is there rounding involved, possible I get 50.29 for 20 bet?All settling is done by hand right now. Nelisky did the programming and has tinkered with auto settling, but it hasn't been necessary. When we expand, it would be included.Currently we book based on a pari-mutal basis. With this, market makers can put in their own odds and gain edge from gamblers. I watched that entire video, and they never dispensed any gum from it.I think I'll hook up a bunch of wires to the coke machine at the mall with a QR sticker and create a video saying I have a bitcoin coke dispenser. I am noticing this too, many trades with size of 0.004 at .2824. Please confirm my suspicions about a dark pool order:current market is .27 bid offered at .28, but trading is thin, only $500 on each side at those prices.I want to buy 17,000 coins at .29 (~$5000), and enter it dark. I select it to be filled by 'dark pool' only in its entirety. Once there are 17,000 coins offered at .29 or under, I am filled at their offer prices (i may get 3000 @.275, 1500 @.278, 2500@.2800 and 10000@ 0.29). Correct?Are you the only one who gets to see dark orders? There is a lot of edge in knowing large orders at prices away from the market. Watching to see if this takes some orders from the books, there has been a steady $55k on the offer up to 0.47 I will be looking for trades at prices w/o a bid or offer, writing it already for my site. If anyone wants to explain bitcoins to their family and friends over the thanksgiving holiday, please consider bitcoinsportsbook.com. The site will take wagers down to 0.01 btc.Â  I have cut fees to zero (from .001 per 1 btc) all weekend. Please excuse the bump, but I believe the site is a good way to show how bitcoins work. I then suggest you withdraw some of your coins and show how the transaction shows up at the explorer http://blockexplorer.com/Happy thanksgiving A+ duh. I don't know what I was thinking If you can keep track, I'll pledge 10 btc to the faucet to reload (0.05 btc is 200 uses) I like it. I think I will send this link to those who ask me what a bitcoin is.I don't want to nitpick a nice page like that, but is exchanging bitcoins to 'normal cash' is implying that bitcoins are 'abnormal'? Â I describe to my friends that the current exchange rate is available at MtGox, not the current value. I try to be specific, as the value of a bitcoin will get you 'X lbs' of coffee for instance.Very nice page, I'll use it. Thank you. Great catch, but no, I am not affiliated with Trading Technologies - however, I am a member of the CME, and used their software years ago. The 'TT' comes from the "taters" name which was my softball team in college.Their format must have inspired meÂ   update: Volume data was addedMtGox volume in the ticker doesn't match up with the volume I sum up from the data provided.Â  The 2nd row is MtGox ticker volume. Thank you for the tip. I enjoy programming, and will learn as I go.Having the matrix update real-time would be sweet. I think there are a lot of shadow bids out there. No one is going to tip their hand and display they want to buy $20k worth of coins. I think if we had the total account balance at MtGox, it would show a different picture. http://www.taters.net/cgi-bin/btc/matrix.pl?axisinc=0.01Should be obvious, however:*Change your axis increment at the top.*The Green Columns on left and right is total USD bid/offered at that level, with [Totals in brackets]*Total coins bid/ask at that level [number of orders in brackets]price & volume data will be included, my goal is to make a complete front-end for trading at MtGox. Above is written in Perl, and I'm reading about php - I'm stuck at the 'hello world' sectionÂ   The bitcoin vs the state thread got me thinking about how small of a chance we are talking about.Please rank the following in the order of likeliness:A: You thoroughly shuffle a deck of cards into its original order.B: A normal 6 year old girl who never bowled before bowls a perfect game 10 times in a row.C: A MLB baseball pitcher strikes out every batter he faces in a season.D: Tiger Woods gets a hole in one for every par 3 he faces in a year.E: A person wins 5 Powerball lotteries in a row (Say 80,000,000:1 against each)F: A bitcoin address collision is discovered in the next 20 years using most modern technology.If the 'atoms in the universe' rule is true, my guess:A, D, B, C, E, F. When I sell something on BiddingPond and post the address to pay to in the listing, this would help verify payment was sent. As a non-programmer, I like this. I can see how my transactions are not 100% anonymous.I'd like to re-visit that bitcoin laundromat... Good question, not sure what amazon would do if it came back as stolen credit card. DYODD.Anyone know if gift cards are irrevocable? If you owned 20,000 bitcoins, wouldn't you want to spend an extra $5.00 and buy 10 bitcoins at 50c each, therefore bringing your net worth of bitcoins to $10,000?The individuals putting out these quotes in thin markets know exactly what they are doing. In this case, they may be encouraging new offers to come to market.
This is a great idea for those who can't get bitcoins from other sources, as you can directly buy bitcoins with a CC.I need a $20 amazon gift card, and will pay the current mtgox (best) *bid* price when you contact me. Currently that is 0.3281, so 20/0.3281 = 60.96 btc.You can e-mail amazon gift cards with a CC here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8&ref_=gc_lp_4ways_emailPM me for e-mail address to send to, you must ship first.status: completed I just e-mailed support on his radio website asking if they will accept bitcoin as payment for premium services.  I haven't been able to play with it yet, but I shipped my 100btc bounty. Good work.Please mark me as paid.  you should charge 1 btc per bid, whether it wins or not  I pledged 100btc, is there an extension I can download and pay? If you are taking votes, I'd vote 'no' because I think there will be a default at some point, especially if you are thinking 100:1. My guess would be 3:2 ratio would be a good place to start margin.Suggestion: Post cash on hand and total bitcoins available versus margin cash and btc. This extra info would help a lot, seeing there are an actual 30,000 coins with 200,000 outstanding. how exactly would the margin be secured?If I have $1000 cash in account and lose $1500, how will the other side be compensated? Or if I have 1000 btc and lose 2000 btc, where will the other 1000 btc come from? good luck. I don't have the coins. We'll all be watching bitcoinwatch to see if it goes through. Or, he just bought 1,000 btc at MtGox and wants to scare the market higher. If so, I want to buy 300,000 tooÂ   Hope we can get another table going tonight around 8pm ET for monday night football. 25c NL. Well, I would buy the 200,00th coin at $1.25. Assume my average price paid was 60c for 200,000 coins. Bad example by me, but I think I'm stating my point. Until China can produce fake bitcoins, they wont want the real ones. http://justmeinparis.blogspot.com/May 3 2007Looks like the ring. Yeah, my bid is off. These larger transactions make the currency stronger, as any sound currency does. If I went to MtGox and bought up 200,000 coins and drove the price to $1.25 each, would you consider 200,000 coins? (I am not bidding on your house, only example)In a fiat regime, you just print up what you need, and let everyone else worry about the debasement. Someone let me know if my math is not correct...10grams ~ 0.32 troy ounces. 18k means 75% gold.Gold is ~1340 per ozt USD.1340 x .32 x .75 about $321 worth of gold.I can't say I really want it, so I'll bid 1/3rd of the metal value, about $107 USD. 107/0.19 exchange rate = 563 bitcoins, shipping included to USA. This is my bid, good through NOV 2.  Could someone explain the US dollar in 15 words or less to me? looks better than craigslist.I read SOH's description before going, and expected much worse. sure, just logging in now, dinner went a little late I just topped off my account and am waiting for action tonight. Hope we can get a full table. My nickname is 'Acco' by the way.I'll be there about 8pmET for the 8:30 MNF game start.I'll load up 2/4 limit and a NL table. I think it is fine. Let the market decided what MtGox USD are worth. If you don't like it, offer 100% of your money for MtGox USD.
Suggestion: This could be your new business model. MtGox only clears trades, funding is done by other companies.MtGox charges a flat .001 btc fee per trade. For every 10,000 coins cleared on the exchange, MtGox gets 10 coins. Not getting super rich with that.Now, someone could start a business called 'BitcoinFunding.com' send you a check/wire for $10,000 and then sell off that interest using paypal, pokerstars money, whatever they like. Any clients they bring in are BitcoinFunding clients, and any funding issues/chargebacks are BitcoinFundings problem, not MtGox. Then let BitcoinFunding charge their own commission table, say it is 0.009 per coin. Total coin cost is 0.010 per coin to customer.BitcoinFunding would have their own website, own graphs, own quote service, come up with an iPhone app, etc. I plan on being in the poker room every monday night for monday night football, which starts at 8:30pm, lasting about 3 hours. I'd like to get a full table going of NL holdem and/or limit holdem.https://betco.in/Hope to see you there! I'll bump this thread each monday afternoon.plug: if anyone wants to bet on the MNF game, bitcoinsportsbook.com.  We need a poker night for the forum. I want to play, but don't want to wait for an opponent and then play heads up.I'll start and say I'll be here during monday night football, which is 8:30pm ET (on monday) for 3 hours. I don't like to play short handed, meaning I'm bad at it. We need an "I'm selling bitcoins" thread for all these to get moved into. Its a shame you can't get these 50,000 coins onto MtGox and get $5k instead of only $2k. Old wagers will not be re-opened. What we really need is a contract prediction market to accomplish this task. I set it up about 10 days ago, and I had to set the closing at some point, and chose 10/8. Only got a few wagers.I was thinking the same thing, might be nice for miners. I could set up another wager with interest and a different end time. So a bunch of babies who can't stand up and be a man and pay for their charges is ruining it for all of us. Well played jerks - you beat the system and 'won'. Well, your trust would shift from him to bitcoinsportsbook, whatever that is worth. Coins would have to be put up. Problem I see is BSB is a public site and anyone could bet along with you and it would change the odds. [off topic]Maybe a feature of BSB should be to have private wagers. You create a wager and send a password to friend to put up his coins. BSB could declare a winner (for a small fee) or just hold the coins and let bettors settle (for a smaller fee). Or, not even hold coins and just show proof of wager and settlement status.[/off topic] Yes. Please let me know of the details, and bitcoinsportsbook will create the wager. If it is something as simple as DJIA close on a certain date, BSB will also make a market if needed.BSB will be happy to create and make monthly or yearly wagers for spot close of gold/silver/stocks, etc.  Best of luck with your casino. I play. Yes. I pledge 100 coins. I'll pledge more with interest.I use firefox, but chrome seems to be gaining ground.  I would suggest to MtGox to freeze all outgoing coins if there is a problem and trades can be undone.maybe thinking irrationally though No, I don't have any documentation, just personal experience.I did something like this years ago where I called myself some company and there was an issue. I don't remember the exact details, but I finally received the mail, but the company name was crossed out. Is the PO BOX registered to 'bitcoin2cash LLC' or is in your personal name? I bet is is your personal name. The post office should not purposely deliver mail that is addressed to someone else. The obvious scam here is I call myself a legit company, but have nothing to do with it, i.e.:IRS Express Pay1234 Main streetMyhouse, ST 90210The USPS will not deliver that mail to Bob Smith's house at 1234 Main St.You will still receive old mail and mail that has no name on it. Should be pointed out that there are only 16,579.29 coins offered at this moment at MtGox, totaling $1,172.89, versus 63,881.94 coins bid totaling $3,845.73The coins just are not there, IMO now would be the time to pick up a few. What is the risk to LastPass? So they have a handful of customers pay 16 btc/mo instead of $1/mo? MtGox could offer them a payment option, and send them cash each month automatically.  Bumping this for info...I came across lastpass.com and liked their service, wanted to use it to save some passwords for my phone. It is $1/mo, so I emailed them and asked if they would consider bitcoin as payment, instead of paypal.I received a response:"Thanks for the suggestion - right now this doesn't look very user friendly."I sent a friendly follow-up, thanking him for his time, saying I respectfully disagree and to please consider bitcoin in the future. He is bid for 15,000 @ .0605. You can sell him his 15,000 at .0605 then buy them at 0.04 each, making $0.0205 15,000 times over, or $307.50. Catch is you got to get the 15,000 at 0.04. Next difficulty factor is set to go down - i have it pegged at 1278 - down from 1319 - to be hit in the early morning of 10/13. I don't want in, and I hope this project goes off. I predict cheap coins at MtGox for a couple weeks until the difficulty jumps to 20,000.late edit for plug: bitcoinsportsbook is taking wagers on year end difficulty levels. wagers close this friday
Anyone notice coins are not being produced as fast since the increase in difficulty factor to 1318?As of this writing, we are on block 83107 at 10/1/10 11:23 ct. This puts us on schedule for the next difficulty factor to 'only' be 1449, not even a 10% increase over the current 1318. It jumped to 1318 from 917, +44%. and from 713 to 917, +29%. Start a pool yourself. If you are generating 4000k/sec 10 others are generating 20,000k/sec combined, you get 4,000/24,000 of each block generated. Seems this code could be introduced. I don't think the GPU Oligarchs are making a mint, in fact, I bet they are losing money to my benefit. I bet you could pay nelisky for proprietary code yourself. But, the economics won't work out. I want 10% of all coins generated. oh wait.... I'm not worried about receiving coins at said rate for $1-$5. I'd like to buy a majority of offered coins w/o stuffing $100 bills into an envelope, and taking all the risk. Still, please keep us updated. jimbobwayprofile:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=325 You can also send them to the global developer's bitcoin verification address: 1PaUpJr6PEHjGxgL7YtwjsiGcAYqsZ8vD.Coins won't actually transfer, only verification of the amounts. Â  I opened a new wager at bitcoinsportsbook.com where you wager on the bitcoin difficulty factor (BDF) at the end of the 2010 calendar year. I invite everyone to join in who might be interested.Here is the info I am using to make my predictions: http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/difficultiez.php.On July 16th, 2010 the difficulty factor shot up to 181.54On September 28th 2010, the difficulty factor was changed to 1318.67The BDF increased by a factor of 7.26 in 74 days, or 2.716% per day. With 95 days to go until the new year, a 2.716% daily increase would put the ending BDF at 16,814.51.My gut feeling says this is possible, but not likely. Therefore, I set up certain BDF targets on bitcoinsportsbook.com, and assigned my own probabilities. Hopefully, if others participate, we can get a representation of what the outlook is for bitcoin generating.BDF 5,000: I think this is in the bag. I wagered 100 on 'yes' and 16 on 'no', meaning I am 86.2% confident (or 100/116) that the level will be over 5,000 going into 2011.BDF 10,000: Even though my math says otherwise, I don't think this is very likely. I wagered 75 on 'yes' and '100' on no, meaning I am about 57% (or 100/175) confident that the BDF will be lower than 10,000. BDF 15,000: Even more unlikely, I just can't believe my math. I wagered 40 on 'yes' and 100 on 'no', giving a 71% chance it wont happen.BDF 25,000: Bitcoins make it into the news or someone comes up with a killer generating program, which I think is unlikely - only 16 wagered on 'yes' and 100 wagered on 'no'. 86% chance it wont happen IMO.BDF 50,000: I don't think this will happen, but I threw in a gift for all who want to wager. I bet 100 on 'YES' and only 1 on 'NO'. If the BDF stays below 50,000 my 100 coins will be disbursed to all those who bet against it. Yeah, this post is kind of a plug/giveaway for the site as well.Betting is open now through Friday, 10/8/10 9:00pm ET, at which time wagering is closed and the final lines will be determined by the site.Disclosure: There are no fees charged for this bet. Although BSB is nelisky's and my website, BSB is technically not taking any action, it is all my coins. In general I do not wager my own coins on the site vs the 'house' as this may cause a conflict of interest between me and nelisky. Wagers can not be retracted.Total wagered: 648 coins, of which only 500 were needed to be put up as margin (worst case for each wager). All accounts are margined in this same fashion. A straight up wager does not receive margin. After lines are finalized, a worst case for each wager will be determined, and any excess coins can be withdrawn.Good LUCK! If there is interest, I'll bump the thread and post final lines and thoughts! If I sent you $1.00 and you sent me 25 coins, would you then believe that I am trustworthy and start sending coins first, before I send cash payment? I don't think your business model will allow this.  bitcoin2cash,I would like to buy 50,000 bitcoins at $0.04 each, but I can not agree to your terms. I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you may be legit, but I will not give you the benefit of my money.If satoshi posted he wants to sell 50,000 coins at 0.04/each, I'd probably ship him cash and wait for coins. Â (Although, this would open a whole new can of worms Â  )Good luck with your business. Would you mind posting the 50,000 for sale at mtgox at the exact price of .0900 so I know you have them?In all seriousness, I graduated from the University of Alabama, and was thinking of going for this week's game on saturday. If I knew you had the coins, I wouldn't mind driving to huntsville to arrange for an in-person transfer. I was thinking I'll buy 25k coins for $1,000? fair enough. Good luck Would you consider sending bitcoins first? Would you consider escrow, with that being a trusted poster on this site?Or, is the only way going to be sending you coins first, then waiting for cash? Where are you located. I'll buy them. However, I suspect you're trying to move the market with zero coins. I think the real risk here is just the opposite: Some organization or even some wealthy guy will just bid 50 cents for 2 million bitcoins, or $1.0 Million. This is a lot of money to be sure, but not so much if you consider the amount of USD in circulation right now. .02300001 bid I bid $0.02 for 1,000,000 coins. PM me for details. I am serious. I don't understand. I bid 1 cent for 25% of all bitcoins and he sells them to me. Are we not in the same boat? Why would you now need 100,000 coins to buy a cheeseburger? If he owns 25% now, he's giving me more value for my coins right now. His hoarding is letting me buy things with less coins now.Thank you, whoever you are. I invite everyone to go out and try and buy 1% of all the coins out there! Don't think its a big problem, people have a pretty good trust meter already.When I go to buy gas, I give the clerk $50 and say "$50 on pump #6". No receipt. He could easily just pocket it, or only give me $30 worth. I wouldn't know until I'm out of the store and pumping my gas. not worried. Even if he has 25% now, he won't have 25% in the future unless he's generating 25%. 
Wanted to make an official post that www.BitcoinSportsBook.com surprisingly accepts bitcoins. The site is for wagering on the outcome of sporting events. Shipped. Post if you do not receive.Good Luck!8 Coins left for giveaway. Post your BCin or personal address. Do not post BCout. exactly. My 100 coin jets bet right now is really crappy. As more people bet on miami, my bet will become better.Not quite sure what angle you're coming from, but the people who already have money on Miami now have a great bet, as the dolphins are a clear favorite in the game. If they were wagering at a typical book, they would have to put up 60 units to win 50 units (which is 1.8333 returned for each unit wagered, or -120 for american odds). Currently, people with money on the dolphins at bitcoinsportsbook are getting 2.0436 units returned instead of 1.8333 at another book.Â  So, bitcoinsportsbook is trying to attract miami investors right now.As it turns out, the best strategy is to just bet the ratio that other books are offering, which is now about 6:5 in favor of miami. You could just bet on miami, but you open the door to someone else betting on miami, in which case you have a bad bet.Hope I'm making sense...   I shipped 8 coins to address. Please post if you do not receive them.GOOD LUCK!12 coins remain for your BCin or personal address! Please do not post your BCOUT. True to my word, I put up 100 coins on the "New York Jets to win" tonight. While there is no pure arbitrage profit here, wagering the dolphins over the jets in a 6:5 ratio will result in a good bet, as the Dolphins should win about 6 out of 11 matchups.Â  So, putting 6 coins on the dolphins and 5 on jets (or 3 on dolphins, 2.5 on jets, etc etc)I will not make any more wagers on this particular entry.Couple more accounts have popped up. Thank you! interesting.How about anyone can cast their vote for who won, but must put up 0.10 btc. If you cast a vote on the wrong direction (say Gore won the election), you lose that 0.10 btc, but if you are right, you collect your 0.10 btc back plus a little extra set up by the exchange.Â  If there is a real discrepancy, say more than 10% disagree, the mod has the final vote (Kiba) If a user can create his own prediction, how are predictions settled?I start a prediction "The difficulty level for generating bitcoins will be equal to or greater than 3500.00 on 12/31/2010 11:59:59pm ET"and the predictions total on 1/1/2011:Yes: 500 btcno: 347 btcthe difficulty level settles at 3700, who clicks on the 'yes' button and distributes the coins? Accounts and wagers are slowly trickling into BitcoinSportsBook.com, - thank you! I wanted to point out some major improvements to the site.1)Â  Â  All market maker accounts are now ÂmarginedÂ. Whats more, all accounts are currently market maker accounts! By ÂmarginedÂ, only your max possible loss is factored into your balance.Â  Example: you bet 20 coins on Team A and 10 coins on Team B. Your max loss is 20 coins. BSB allows you to float those 10 coins on other games.2)Â  Â  Once the game goes off and a final line is established, you are again credited with your worst case-scenario. So, if you have 20 on Team A and 10 on Team B, and the payout from Team A is 28 coins, and Payout for Team B is 35 coins, your worst-case is now 28 coins and that is credited instead of your 20 coin balance.Why would you bet both sides?This can allow the average guy to make a market. If you take a baseball game where the probability of team A to win is 60% and team B is 40%, you can wager 60% on A and 40% on B, and any deviation from that will result in net long term profits. It does not matter if joe six pack wants to bet on the favorite or underdog, you are protected.Â  Any sportsbook on the web will post spreads and lines, and one can get expected probability from these numbers. IÂll make a post if this needs to be expanded on.Fees:Currently, IÂve been setting the fees at 0.10% or 0.05% (1 coin per 1000 bet or 1 per 2000), but also have some free games, like Sunday and Monday night football. Nelisky has procured a hosting site that is payable in bitcoins (!), so we have a goal we are trying to meet.That said, I will cap all fees at 25 bitcoins total from now through the end of October, which will be 25,000 Â 50,000 coins wagered. This will come out of my personal account, not the site. YouÂll need to PM me for a credit, and IÂll be happy to oblige.Notice Sunday & Monday night football currently have a fee rate of 0.00. IÂm going to put a surprise 100-200 coin straight-up bet before each game, if anyone wants some free edge. Disclosure: I am allowed to bet as the sportsbook as well, but will bet in proportion. I'll post my bet after the games start.Thank you for visiting and supporting the site! cant get 5000 done at mtgox though at 0.0623, offer is .0624, but for 10 whole coins. Would have to pay .063 for the last 1000, if you get 5000 by then. Â But opportunity is there, you are right. As a market maker, I'd rather buy 5000 naked at MtGox and then offer .0635.edit: And with 25,000+ bid at 0.061 on MtGox, it would be nice to lean on that order. Buy buy buy! I am not a programmer, so excuse my dumb question: In a future version, can us common folk expect to see the bitcoin program recognize that I have the right video card, and have the option of generating with it, or is this going to be limited to those who can play code? I like the bcout. If I lose it though, am I screwed? Happened to me too. You need your BCout, not BCin. I am excited to announce the launching of BitcoinSportsBook.com. It is a combination of my ideas and coins, and neliskyÂs code and patience.It is not a traditional sportsbook where there is fixed price betting, instead it is pari-mutual where everyone gets the same odds on an event (i.e. horse racing). The site will explain a lot, but I plan on answering questions in this thread. Thank you nelisky!Please ask questions about the site before using if not perfectly clear.Disclaimer about the site:BitcoinSportsBook.com is an experimental site for the bitcoin community. The purpose is to educate and demonstrate a use for bitcoins.Play BITCOINSPORTSBOOK.COM AT YOUR OWN RISK! Sadly, it is beyond the ability of the creators of the site to guarantee anything. There is no staff, no customer service, and no insurance of any bitcoin balance.Having said all that, we obviously do our best effort to keep things under control, backup often and keep logs of everything that goes on. We consider the approach we've taken very safe, and will do our very best to fix any issue that may arise. Still, no guarantees folks. More money means we all get rich, right?Â  I would think that as difficulty increases, this would also mean an increase in value of the coins. A 3500 khash machine currently produces 50 blocks every 13 days, which is about $3.00, or ~$0.27 per day. When the difficulty hits 9,178.3093, coins should be worth about 10x as much, but take 10x as long to generate, so I'm still making the same $0.27 per day. Of course, some of this is negated by faster computers & code.As long as difficulty keeps increasing, I'm going to continue to buy coins. Starting in 2011, paypal will start reporting to the IRS if you gross more than $20,000 in a calendar year, or if you do more than 200 transactions.Full article: http://ebay.about.com/od/sellingeffectivel1/a/_sbe_tax1099k.htmSellers on e-bay who want to do more than 200 transactions in a year might be looking for a new payment mechanism. I'm not suggesting this is to avoid paying taxes, but rather to avoid government regulation. I suggest buy/generate coins now, and buy shares in biddingpond.comÂ  Â   bad link: clicking on 'Pick 4' in the bet management page brings up all picks for the pick 6. looks good. This.Bitcoin is a solution in search of a problem. It will find it eventually.  4 decimals is fine. I would even go the other way, and suggest 1/2000 quotes - bids go from 0.0600, 0.0605, .0610, etc. On 1,000 coin orders, this is a 50 cent bid/ask, which I think is reasonable.If I buy 10,000 coins with precision of 0.00001, this is $0.10 difference. 1,000 coins would need to change hands for it to be 1 US penny difference.
I've done this on a small scale already, for my own personal gain. I bought a bunch of bitcoins, then e-mailed on-line poker rooms and sportsbooks, asking to consider bitcoins as currency and to forward my e-mail to development. I received a few canned responses. My thinking was one sportsbook would see the obvious benefits, buy $50,000 worth of coins and just open betting with them, as there would be relative little to lose, but a lot to gain. Still waiting...good luck, haven't sold my coins I don't understand. How can you make an order inactive? Did someone get to sell coins at 0.10, 0.17, etc? Did someone buy coins at 0.10? Shipped 4. Post if you do not receive. Good Luck!20 coins remain. Post BTCin or personal address.Do not post your BTCout! Shipped 8. Post if not received. GOOD LUCK!24 bitcoins remain. Post your BTCin from the lottery or personal address.DO NOT POST YOUR BTCout shipped 8 each. Post if you don't receive. Good luck!32 Coins Remain. Post BTCin from lotteryPick 6 at 987 coins. Who will bump it over 1k? Kinda like when I go to the horse races? I have winning tickets that can be used to bet against, and a machine just gives me back a credit voucher (my change). There are thousands of old tickets lying on the ground, but everyone knows these are worthless. Doesn't seem too difficult if thought of this way. What kind of a nut would want a computer in their home in 1985?What did people think of a network of computers communicating with each other in 1995?I don't know what will catch-on and what will fail. Bitcoins seem to solve current problems, and are worth investigation.  You keep wanting to covert everything to 'cash', because this is what you know as money, what buys things. Bitcoins are challenging that thought process. US currency in its current form has only been around for decades, not forever as many people believe.Example:Assume English is your only language and you wanted to learn Spanish. You learn that 'los manos' are 'hands'. But to people who speak Spanish, 'los manos' are the things at the end of your arm with 5 fingers sticking out of them, they don't know what the spoken word 'hands' are.Likewise, If I want to sell you a cheeseburger for 30 bitcoins, you probably think 'hmmm. bitcoins are about 6 cents each, that means a cheeseburger is $1.80'. But to those who don't know US dollars, they just equate 30 bitcoins with a cheeseburger. If printed bitcoins were created, I would use them. Please keep up the good work.I would use it to print out 100 BTC notes on 3x5 index cards and stash them away in a fire proof box/safety deposit box for safe keeping. Software would be needed to print/decode/verify the coins and forward to my wallet when needed.I understand I can probably do this with a thumbdrive, but for a non-techie, there is a relaxing feeling of actually holding a physical something with a number on it. I am terrified of moving around my wallet file, especially if I had 1000+ coins on it. 16 million possibilities. But with 900 picks and 150 draws/day, this is 135,000 shots a day. The pick 3/pick 4 were getting hit so often that I had to check the site hourly to make sure I had action. My message to nelisky was a lottery that gets paid on a weekly - monthly basis would get interesting if he could raise a couple thousand coins.I think the friday bet might be a bit too soon though.. Shipped. Post if you do not receive coins. Good Luck!48 free coins remain. Post/PM your BTCin address from lottery. Shipped 8. Post if you don't receive.

You could verify the account exists.nelisky, I hate to have you the policeman for something I created. Unless I'm hurting the lottery in a way I don't see, I'll just take the chance that the people on these forums are decent. If not, I'm out a couple coins, but wiser.thanks for the lottery, hope someone hits it big.84 Coins remain! PM/Post your BCin from the lottery! Good to know.Best of luck! Too much work for you. If you have a snapshot of # of accts and totals, could you just compare and give an idea how many accounts and coins this brought in? 84 coins remain. Either PM me or Post for an address
Don't make me look like a fool please. 8 coins shipped. Post if you don't receive.From now on, I'll put these type of payments in limbo...84 coins remain hmmmm.... Am I not doing this right? My intent was to help the anonymous lottery, but I'm taking away the 'anonymous' part.Suggestion on how I can help seed the lottery? Should have asked first  shipped 8. post if you do not receive.Â  Good luck!92 Coins remain I messaged nelisky an idea for his lottery - pick6 instead of pick4, and he implemented it.To thank him, and in the interest of creating new accounts and traffic to his site, I'll ship you:A) 4 bitcoins if you wager those 4 bitcoins.B) 8 bitcoins if you wager 16 bitcoins (match my offer).Just reply with an address and whether you'd like 4 or 8 coins.Lottery homepage: http://taabl.datlatec.com/I have no way of verifying your actions, honor system.Even if you have 100,000 coins, please request your free ones and wager. Post your tip-jar address and consider it a large tip if you win. Â GOOD LUCK! If you win a jackpot, I want nothing in return.* I reserve the right to ignore brand-new forum accounts created after 9/12/10. whats the hook? I assume you are getting affiliate money, and giving back.Are there items or accounts that don't qualify?I pay in USD, you pay in bitcoins, is there a conversion rate?I buy all the time from amazon, I'll try your link next time. I think if donating 0.06 USD worth of anything will get me back > 0.06 USD in return, then its good for me. Say I own 10,000 btc, but get 20 more people into bitcoins because I donate 10 bitcoins to each. If the value of the bitcoins increases by more than .00122, then I should do it. I think I have been pretty generous with my coins, trying to get new people into them.I see your point that if donating just meant they convert back to USD and cash out, thats bad. But if 1 of the 20 sees value in them, it doesn't take much for me to benefit.If the members of this forum are the only ones who see value in these, then we're fighting a losing battle. nelisky was kind enough (by surprise) to implement my lottery. If you have an acct registered on the forum before this post, post an address and I'll ship 4 btc to you for you to put in the lottery. Honesty counts. giving away 100 btc total, 25 total.will credit in 12 hours.GOOD LUCK! wife's car broke down, have to leave. quick message. 1000 bets will take 11664 blocks to be 50% in picks 6. So, at least my math agrees with yours. This is 80 days at 144 blocks/day. From my understanding, the lottery was more about large paydays few and far between, not 100 coins 2-3 times a week. A 2500 lottery appears to be 50% to hit once a month. The way it stands now, I check the TAABL every couple days and see if I have credits and if the lottery was won. Turns out I won the last 3 by the way.I want to articulate more, but cannot. Good work nelisky, I am behind whatever you do. I like the idea. Hope everyone ships a few coins to the lottery. The concept of the Pick X is a lot of fun.Good luck to all, but I'm on a hot streak!  When your merchant stuff gets going, your site will be ideal. I would really like to have more control over incoming bitcoin addresses. I sold about 10 things on biddingpond, and I wanted to create an address, assign it a name like "Auction 30 - butter knives." The bitcoin program is still the best for sorting incoming bitcoins.Would be great if I could use it on biddingpond, but I don't know the final price until the auction ends, and if I remember correctly, it wanted a price? Something I either couldn't figure out or couldn't do.congrats on a great site. Rounding error? Have you received bitcoins from the faucet, then paid 0.0495 btc to someone. Ever done anything in the 3rd decimal or beyond? I have 0.01 at TAABL that I can't withdraw due to rounding error. Still, +50.00 is +50.00, and should be able to withdraw that.Fresh blocks take something like 100 blocks to confirm. I assume you waited. ummm. yeah! thanks! if its your site, well done. I'm a TAABL Luck Box! I keep putting in a few coins and hitting.I don't understand the payouts. I thought:Person A places 20 bets, pot is 20.Person B places 50 bets, pot is 70.But this doesn't seem to be the case, as the pot was 50 with zero bettors? I think I see your problem ;PWhat is the house/charity edge?Is there a way I can deposit 50btc, and auto-fund 10btc at a time when the pick 4 is hit? Otherwise, I have to keep checking when the lottery ends and resets to zero. Since I've basically given up on generating, I would prefer to deposit my bitcoins into an on-line bitcoin bank.Advantages:Let the bank worry about my wallet.dat file. I'd pay to insure the balance.Give me a better interface for making and receiving payments. I want to pay "TAABL" or "Charlie", not "14uIjoimio32mqZai0"Completely portable.I can get my friends & family into bitcoins by pointing them to a website instead of downloading an application.More of a 'banking' feel. Someone on these boards (Free Money?) mentioned it would be nice to have employees do basic cash register without complete access to entire wallet and balance. This could be done.Dis-advantagesI don't trust anyone with my coins yet. Don't know why, I have all my $$$ in banks around where I live.Basically, I see an advantage to have people get into bitcoins without ever going to bitcoin.org. I'm just not smart enough to implement my own idea. using seconds from 12/18/2009 3:56:01 as base 0 (the last time difficulty was 1.0000), A y=mx+b linear regression of the log of difficulty levels:m=2.87698e-07b=-0.611057use b=-363.4351 for the seconds you programmers use.example: block 46368 was generated at 1269212064. exp(1269212064*2.87698e-07 - 363.4351) = exp(1.71409) = predicted level of 5.551602 vs actual level of 4.565162.The correlation factor was 0.957 between the date and log of difficulty level.This predicts future difficulty levels of:9/30/2010 : 677.796310/31/2010 : 1,464.714811/30/2010 : 3,087.533412/31/2010 : 6,672.14611/31/2011 : 14,418.47812/28/2011 : 28,919.27763/31/2011 : 62,494.43074/30/2011 : 131,734.61495/31/2011 : 284,677.91886/30/2011 : 600,084.448612/31/2011 : 58,149,375.6523If the trend continues, it will be quite difficult to generate coins in the near futureÂ   The market for Spongebob stickers is even more reasonable now. I set up a Kill-a-Watt to my computer and calculated with 2200 khash/s, I was using 140 watts (monitors off). According to the calculator, I should produce a block every 14 days, 2 hours, 3 minutes, or every 338.05 hours. It would cost me 47.327 Kwh to produce a block, at 12 cents per Kwh, thats $5.68 per block, a net loser. What is interesting is the reports of the people producing 25,000 khash/sec with their video cards in the CUDA thread. If they are using less than 1000 watts (and should be), it would be profitable again to produce, electricity wise.Difficulty level 1000 by year end. I'm not a programmer or expert user, so go easy on me please.I have an old athlon machine that can generate ~1850 khash/s. I have a geforce 8500 gt on that machine, and used this to up production to ~2150 khash/s (says GPU 2150, so I know I'm using the -gpu). How can I get these 20,000 khash/sec that everyone else is? Is my athlon the bottleneck here, or can I just buy a nicer video card? Will these coins be used to sell on MtGox? Can't keep the market down huh?This is a big buy signal. Load me up! Spades are blackHearts are RedClubs are green (not black)Diamonds are blue (not red)easier to see flushes, especially if multitabling. 
I was thinking -Â  couldn't this site be marketed as 'produce bitcoins on your computer and play them here' and 'ultimate free play poker site.' Therefore, play would be legal in the US, as this is just fake money.Â  Of course, we would all know that anyone could buy bitcoins and then cash them out at MtGox, as producing bitcoins is a problem for most.I thought gambling in japan had a format like this. It is illegal to gamble, but you can buy those pachinko balls for x yen, play, then another store across the street buys them back from you.  I would suggest doing something different than rake. Maybe a much smaller time charge or even a monthly fee option. i.e. can pay X.99 BTC per mo or have my pots raked. don't even know if possible.  How about its free to change your pick, just not retract it. 20 blocks to go until I'm stinkin' rich. if current block is 76602, say 'bet will become active block 76608 forward' And if someone hits block 76605, don't pay out that bet. I remember my statistics professor starting off with this well known problem now (before internet):Â A car is behind 1 of 3 doors. the other 2 doors contain goats. You select a door at random, say door #2. The host (who knows where the car is) shows you a goat behind door #1. He gives you the chance to switch. Is it to your advantage to switch if you want a car? Answer: yes, 2/3 chance car is behind door #3. At the time, I couldn't believe that was true, now I get it.I am assuming that the draws are completely random, and that over time, my gains will overcome my losses by betting every number. This is a no-lose *long term* bet, given enough tries, I'll come out, at worst, break even if everyone employs the same strategy. As soon as someone 'takes a shot', I gain edge from him. a) 1) Maybe only allow 5 bets at a time, so no 'whoopsies I bet 500 coins'. b) 1) Don't allow duplicate bets? If its crowded, up to 4 chars.c) 2) No unclaimed prizes.d) 1) 1 btce) Every X draws, 1k seems about right. Or, wait until the pot gets to 500 btc, then announce a draw in 150 blocks (can still bet until 6 blocks)again, great work. I'm not suggesting that there is a no-lose scenario, but there is a positive expectation solution. Much like getting 3:1 on a coin toss, you might lose $10, but it is still a good bet when you make $30 50% of the time.Take the simplest of lotteries, a coin toss. You bet 10 BTC on heads and 10 BTC on tails. No matter what someone else does, your EV can not go down. if someone bets 10 btc on heads (total purse 30btc), you now have a 50% chance to return all 30 and a 50% chance at splitting the pot and getting 15 coins. 50% of +10Â  and 50% of -5 = 2.5 btc edge.Now take nelisky's lottery:You bet all 4096 spaces in the lottery, 4096btc.Your opponents bet only half of the lottery, 2048 btc.Total purse: 6144btc50% chance you win all btc = 6144 (3072 Expected value)50% chance you split and only receive 3072 (1536 Expected value)Combine is 3072+1536 = 4608 expected coins on a 4096 bet, a 512 btc expected profit..or.50% you win the 2048 put in by others (+1024) and 50% you lose 1024 because of the split (-512) = +512You do lose value by sharing a bet, but that value is more than made up when transferred to other bets.I think my math works out.  While thanking nelisky in a private message, a little math broke out. I'm not a math professor, and would like everyone's opinion.nelisky is running The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery (TAABL), and can be found here: http://taabl.datlatec.com/It is a lottery where people bet on the outcome of a hash from certain blocks. Last 3 characters. Meaning 16^3 possibilities or 4096. 1 btc per ticket.My strategy: Bet on every outcome, in fact, it is positive expectation to do so (ignore the 2% charity).Is this a crazy strategy or smart strategy? I'll try to backup my statement that it is a smart strategy, but wanted to get opinions first. yes. retracting bets stinks. But I think you'll run into the problem of people being upset if they find out there are 4 bets on their number, and can't retract. If retraction is out, consider a blind draw, just make all picks public 6 blocks before the pick.  question:If I betÂ  'ABC' and it hits, I win the 1st place prize. But do I also get a cut of 2nd and 3rd? Same thing if I bet 'FBC' and the winner is 'ABC', I get 2nd and 3rd or just 2nd?I vote 1 ticket 1 prize if easy to implement. Yeah, i'm back to leaving as-is I think. This is fun and charitable for me, not hoarding my precious coins. A large jackpot would grow the bitcoin community much faster. 360 to go![need signature of lottery details] Now that I'm sending and receiving payments, my address book is a mess. I'd like to suggest an address book where I can create folders for all my different payments and collections.i.e. RECIEVEBiddingPondÂ Auction 123 16Hsoekms.......Â Auction 124 1A7SKdsfu......MtGoxÂ Merchant 1Rtsij24021q....Â  OtherÂ TAABL 1Rsk42kn43....Â Porn 1F3ijsjiusq....Â Faucet 1U4aiSjiaj4....DonationsÂ email 1Es9490jsf...These things will be big someday. Accumulate! Maybe if there is no 1st place winner, the 1st place win pool goes into the 2nd place win pool. If no 2nd place winner, down to 3rd place, etc. This might get more people in invest in the lottery in the early stages, rather than just wait until there are thousands of btc up for grabs, and not such a losing proposition.  Tricky questionsI'm kinda anxious to get to the next difficulty levels. Bets on the 2016 and 1008 would mean an extra something for me - and an extra couple bets. 1-2 weeks seems to pique my interests. It is perfectly fine as is. Maybe a special lottery for block 100,000 then 125,000 then 150,000, etc.If it was a 10% bounty for charity, I would bet less. Personally, I will donate more in bets if its 0%-2%, as I feel more in control of who's getting what.Introduce a 'bet for the site' address, or let me check by each bet if I want that bet to go to the house / charity?The site is great as-is, I feel awkward giving my opinions on what I'd do with your site. Just shoot for the most bets and adjust accordingly.I strongly agree with MtGox as a charity - I see that site as a major breakthrough.   I just made a 5 bitcoin bet for the charity. All proceeds from these bets go to the faucet:fffffeffdffcffbIf you created a charity acct with random picks, I'll do that in the future. What he said If I deposit 1btc 4 blocks before the draw, and have a ticket pending, will there be an issue? Not sure of when tickets become final. Yeah, I'm not holding my breath. I suggested bitcoin as a means of currency to pokerstars.com. They have 5 million free tables, why not have a couple bitcoin tables?Here was the response, probably nothing comes of it:----Dear Valued Player,Thank you for your email.We always strive to make PokerStars the best poker site on the web.
