Hello,well the title says it all. I want to set up multiple bitcoin machines behind NAT.For this it reason would be nice, if one could choose an other port than 8333, which I guess would have other nice side effects. Maybe someone uses this port for something else or maybe it isn't possible to set up port forwarding to this port for one reason or another.Or is there an other way one should go?Greetings,foobar
