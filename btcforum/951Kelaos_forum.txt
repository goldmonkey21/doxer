Thank you!  I've just started to use this system and wondered if anyone would be willing to donate a few BTC to me?1EWjpXbaPx7pcZXBugZNZPj76bHEmqD4KCJust so I can get started!Many thanks if you do~ ^^ Just checked and nope you can't un-flattr something as far as I can see. I don't really have anything to offer for BTC yet... though I realized I have a Flattr account, so if you have anything you want Flattr'd I'll do it for a few BTCSend BTC to: 16iZMVPeqwH51Q4igQByMCicE33k7D8GPY
