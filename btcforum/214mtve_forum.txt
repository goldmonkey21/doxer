Yes, you're right.   From metadata we can of course guess the country and maybe even the place, from hashrate and other sessions we can guess the hardware and power consumption, from reconnects we can guess some operations on site etc. Nope      Moreover, some pools have some small differences in protocol, with specially tweaked miners software.   But generally the doc is ok.Miner id (in some pools it's just an address, so payments can be tracked), miner password in this pool, pool current time, how many submissions miner does (its performance and thus its revenue), that's basically all of interesting information.Nope.   The miner build mutual trust with the pool by having flow of payments.    Other than that, you can not be sure on anything in the internet except blockchains   Just a wild idea - wouldn't it be easier to start one more altcoin and see market reaction? just of curiosity, small performance test here:sun fire v120 (sun4u), sparcv9 650 MHz - 109.6 Khash/ssun netra t2000 (sun4v), sparcv9 1.2 GHz - 117.4 Khash/s (strange)second box has 32 virtual cpus, so supposedly it can do 3.7 Mhash/s total.yes, cryptopp speed is around 82% of c's.i've managed to compile only 32bit binary of cpuminer, hope it does not beat performance too much.There is ncp crypto provider in UltraSPARC T1, but it accelerates only RSA (really good).UltraSPARC T2 with n2cp should help to SHA256.Would somebody with T2 play with http://frox25.no-ip.org/~mtve/tmp/sun_pkcs11_sha256.c please?   On T1 it's around 58 Khash/s.Update: from http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/projects/10S2/Reports/Cody%20Christopher.pdf it can be concluded that for 32 bytes (one block of SHA256) and for 64 bytes (full bitcoin block) without special efforts it will be slower than CPU. My perl implementation can download all chain with verifications and ecdsa: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=231.msg5906#msg5906I still didn't get the consensus - are alt clients good or bad?Update: here it is http://frox25.no-ip.org/~mtve/wiki/BitcoinPl.html Thanks, triple speed up here at intel core 2 T9550 2.66GHz Update: weird, Lenovo T500 laptop goes 90 degrees centigrade CPU and switches off, twice in a hour.   Getting back to cpu miner, temperature stays at 80 degrees and it worked for weeks.--mtve I see all comments are "pro" changes, so let me say "con".Bitcoin was not designed for a big volume of small payments, neither in local data storage nor in network cloud.All Satoshi's constants were considered very well.Any changes should be deliberated quite deep.Anybody could set up its own Bitcoin-backed micropayment service, it will not have all of BitCoin's advantages, but there could be a few players on this market.--mtve http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=221.0 etc Hi!I had almost working pure perl client, but since I've heard alt clients are not welcomed, i've abandoned that project.-- mtve
