When I started bitcoin (windows) It started adding blocks, everything was going well.  Then i went and port forwarded (I don't knwo if that's related) and around then, probably a bit after, it stuck at 513 blocks.  I left it on overnight, and generated 11 more (to be precise, the 513 is from today, idk if it was that before or not, it was low 500s though) They all say Generated (50.00 matures in [118-108] more blocks).  Also, I did the 5 free bitcoins website thing, and it hasn't given me them.  I currently have 10 connections, 11 transactions, 513 blocks, and 0.00 balance.  What should I do?
