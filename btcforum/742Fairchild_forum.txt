This is a great idea. Not only does it raise interest within the EFF ranks, but it also has the ability to bring more attention to Bitcoin if EFF does happen to really enjoy the idea.I'll pledge 50 BTC if EFF mentions Bitcoin in public. Whether it be their website, twitter, donation button...whatever.
