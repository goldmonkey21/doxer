Bah.I don't know why I didn't think of that. :| I've been here for a while, but never really cared much for Bitcoin until now.I don't get how I can anonymously transfer money if all transactions are public and can be looked up.If I post my Bitcoin address on a public-anonymous area asking for donations, couldn't someone just search up my address and see my transactions? E.g. if a generous donor wants to send me 5BTC, how could I convert it to USD and still stay anonymous?
