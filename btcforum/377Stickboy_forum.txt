How about Facebook gifts?  Or alternatively, a Facebook "app" exchange. I'm new here so forgive me if I say something stupid.Under normal circumstances there might be no advantage not to include all transactions but what about pure malicious motivations?  If this is an avenue for disrupting the currency I certainly would think twice about "keeping my money there", so to speak.
