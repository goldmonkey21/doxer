Interesting... I've tried that before and Bitcoin gave me an error on startup. Must be the new update?Thanks!Garrett My block count is stuck at 70708. Clearing my AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin folder allows Bitcoin to work properly, so something must be corrupt.I need my addresses because I have 750 BC coming. Is there anything I can try? Points go to: Bitcoininto, Mt. Gox, knightmb The service was absolutely fantastic! He sent me a second souvenir too!  I placed another order.Here be the pretty souvenir I requested: click. And a nice touch to it: click.Cheers!--I've been using Vekja for a while now, and everything has been great.I'm currently waiting for stuff to come from Bitcoininto, and I'm currently waiting for a second thing to come from knightmb. Updates to come. Cheers! See PM! Seconded. +1 knightmbI just finished the transaction and all was great. I'm currently waiting for mail to come from The MadHatter/Bitcoin4Cash. A follow up to come! And with a picture of a nice souvenir.  Many thanks!No, the question was mainly out of curiosity. :P Could we please change that to an attribution license?
