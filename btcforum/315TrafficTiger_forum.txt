If you're a decent writer, there's a good market for original articles on all kinds of subjects. People like me who build websites for advertising income can use content for their sites.Of course, right now the problem is finding website builders who have bitcoins to spend. I guess I'm generating some by running the program, and then I could pay for some articles.I would be willing to install Wordpress blogs and even host them for bitcoins, if I had any clue how much to charge.TT That seems to be doing the trick. Thanks for the suggestion.Somewhere I got the suggestion I should use -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 in the command line, but it looks like it won't run with that setting.TT Thanks. I think I got up to 15 connections a couple of days ago when I first installed bitcoin.TT I was attracted to Bitcoin by many things, and included was the statement about its running in the background when the CPU was idle. I installed 0.3.0 in Ubuntu 64-bit Maverick Meerkat (10.10), and for long periods of time it pins the CPU at 100%, according to the Conky monitor.As the original poster noted, it is impossible to do anything else while the CPU is captured.My CPU is an AMD Athlon 64-bit 7550 Dual Core 2511 MHz 512 KB cache.TT I'd like to use this feature, but I'm not sure what to set in my Linksys WRT54G router. I think it's the Applications and Gaming section I want, and the following is what I entered. But I don't know about the "Port In" and "Dest. Port" difference. Should they both be 8333 like I have them here?Â  Name: BitcoinPort In: 8333Dest. IP Address: 192.168.1.3Dest. Port: 8333Protocol: tcpTT
