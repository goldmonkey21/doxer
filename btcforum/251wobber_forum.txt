It's sad to see the bubble exploding again and crashing violently. As it's sad to see so much speculation, ICO scams and all. But is part of the game. Seen many bubbles, lost a lot, won a lot, and I'm not impressed anymore. I've seen what Bitcoin can do and I still trust it. No alt-coins, no ICOs, no stocks. Just Bitcoin.Every new price surge has 2 features: goes high as fuck, goes down abruptly and after some stagnation period, goes even higher.A price of more than $10,000 might be even closer than you possibly imagine. That's not hard to reach and will be reached eventually, and then even higher. Hard is to play the game without sweaty palms.https://imgur.com/JMAuPJN Somehow it doesn't. Thanks for all who said good words for me. It helped me a lot. Thank you.I need to disclose something:Romanian Intelligente Service is actively pursuing many bitcoin users. Check my older posts to see when they got knowledge on bitcoin. Sad thing is that there is no LEGAL case against bitcoin phenomenon. It's not regulated. Romanian Fiscal Authority cannot do anything. But Romanian Intelligence Service can. And they fucking document any user they can from localbitcoins.comSad. These were nice years, but unfortunately all things come to an end. It is time to say "Goodbye". I still think bitcoin is a brilliant invention which brings immense power to the masses but the human element was more agile and found ways to almost destroy it. It's wounded, but not by a security flaw, not by a design flaw, just by misuse and abuse. Nobody can tell what will happen in the future but one thing is certain: nothing goes up indefinitely and all markets are cyclic. Bitcoin was a chance to learn on economics, markets, psychology and technology. A great ROI. I would recommend anyone here to buy whatever amount one can loose in  the next 5 minutes and put it aside until 2017-01-17, along with the same amount in USD. I am very curious which will have more value then. Good bye. Bitcoin is as safe as it's user is tech-savvy. It's pretty hard for the masses to understand how to secure them properly and what NOT to do and why (ie, not keeping them on a freakin website) Killed by the 90% of the stupid day-trading sheeps that had their coins at centralized exchanges for years, in Mtgox, Bitstamp, etc. And by the over-the-night CEO/COO, C-my-ass dragqueens like Ver, Karples and other scammers. At no point in the whole history there was a system subjected to such scams, thefts, sheer incompetence and stupidity. And think well, just the recent 19k btc is a big portion of whats currently in existence. Otherwise bitcoin is good to go. I wouldn't say it's over yet but yes sir, you made a brilliant point. People fucked up the whole system. I still hope those will flee away soon. Check your language young man! Bitcoin is far superior than bank-enabled transfer. Decentralized. YES. No, really.Smells like MtGox all over. I hope Bitstamp and all shitty exchanges die ASAP. I hope Karpeles gets a long term in the jail. Anyhow, breaking this low brings a huge opportunity which many will fail to see. The only problem is one buy's now and price gets to $80, there will be more time involved until it gets back to 190 and again to over 500. But it will.Many will fail to see that. And please stop the 'free market' bullshit. When you have an 'audience' of 90% sheeps and a few shitty exchanges, with no transparency, you cannot call it free market. This is bullshit.PS: I was terribly wrong, I was thinking that 250-270 would be the bottom.  Rally... oh god.. The daytraders have now lost most of their wealth. It's the way it works. If one was too greedy, kept too much coins in an exchange, didn't bothered to put them in the wallet or at least spend $ on blow and hookers, one lost.I saw the same thing on MtGox. Fat accounts from 'successful' daytraders didn't withdrew even a penny. So, where is that success now? In Kapeles' pockets.Anyway, this should be the final warning. Keep your coins in YOUR wallets and use localbitcoins or any other decentralized system to trade. By doing this, you'll have your success. Less risk, more money.I, today, January 6th 2014 give the middle finger to AML, KYC, banks, Bitcoin exchanges and daytraders-speculator, 90% of the Bitcoin scambusinesses that know shit about security and bitcoin inner-workings, I give the finger to governments around the world and most of their institutions, especially to those oppressive organizations.Even though I am impressed with the Bitstamp heist, I will give the finger to retarder hacker or hackers because he/they struck with such a violence in people and a fragile system. I bet you're proud of yourself and happy about the earnings but listen what. Most of your life you'll live in some kind of fear because justice will be on your tracks. And if justice finds you, you will spend most of your life in a lonely place, a place where nobody should be, a place that will make you miss every drop of rain, breath of fresh air or sight of flowers. But because some people tread over flowers, we as a society put them in that lonely place for some time.You're in such a misery that even remorse gets you and want to give the money back, most likely you'll still face criminal charges. And I don't think you have the guts to do jailtime with no money. It's better for your twisted soul to to spend some now and live in fear or in jail but thinking of your little treasure.  What are these??https://blockchain.info/tx/4e2310ee5f5d95ea17878f558406e24d10e6234a614fd960bbcddcb2ccd25dd4 Hacks on exchanges are complicated. A hack on Bitstamp, which takes security seriously, it's extremely complicated.So, if this happened, I would assume the hacker would have acquired access at least few days earlier. I would also assume code has been tampered with someway, and some audit has to be made. Even if they use strict change management policies, a full code audit is a must. What if the hacker sells the 18k BTC on Bitstamp? (if they're stolen) ... Don't you have the account on Bitstamp? Many were optimistic in the dawn of MtGox fuckpucinno. Centralized exchanges as we know them will die or change. This is a good thing. Exchanges along with their by-product, the 'speculator', shall die now. RIP.Decentralized systems or multisig operations will take over.  Speculators are again burnt by using a centralized exchange for a decentralized payment system.I know Bitstamp's security and Ibelieve it's hard to compromise cold wallets but still, a big minus on the image of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will never take off unless ALL centralized exchanges die. Current time: April 2013. Lol. LOOOL
right...the guy can buy all back with a profit. what a dumbass That's modern bullshit. Mental stability has nothing to do will suicide. Samurais killed themselves too. Also lot of people choose to kill themselves for a cause. Next high of bitcoin will be higher than last one in 2013. Logic. I own a revolver and not much to loose. If bitcoin will 'rocket', go 'to the moon',  or go at least 500 in the next 30 days I'll play Russian roulette live on youtube in february. Overtaking fiat is the hardest battle humanity will fight. All goverments' power is based on fiat and banks so for them, fiat is high-stakes. But that doesn't make fiat superior.Most people obey their goverments because are programmed to do so. And if they disobey, they won't be labeled as 'free' but as traitors, liabilities and so on. Goverments keep people under control, not vice-versa (the way it should be) Exactly. Almost everyone is in for fiat. Speculators, traders, 'investors', miners. Awesome! But bitcoin is still superior to gold. Anyway, at the moment, gold is the best option! Maybe you will convert back to btc sometime. No bulltard here. People are free? Don't they fall for most of the FUD? Not free. Show me a currency that suffered such massive image loss and I'll call bitcoin a currency. Until I'm calling bitcoin 'bitcoin'. Not a currency, not a stock, not a commodity. We just failed the price. Which is very important. The rest are somewhat a success. Are you calling yourself free when I could drive the price down lower to 240 just because am an early bird? And wait for those fat wallets to dump, that would be mayhem.Are you calling yourself free and a GOVERNMENT has one of the biggest wallets ARE YOU CALLING YOURSELF FREE WHEN  YOU DIDN'T FOUGHT FOR ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET? There's no such thing.  Not sorry for being so blunt...You trusted your bitcoins to any other 3rd party? You lost. You kept your coins in any other place than your wallet? You risked your money for nothing.You daytraded? You helped the price to go down. I for one, sold only when I needed cash, only because I could not pay for much in BTC. Because if I could... I would had 0 fiat currency.Remember that when you see the price so low it hurts. We had full power as a community to make bitcoin the 8th wonder of the world. But kinda failed.  This is big event. We just began 2015 with a massive down movement. And it seems is not gonna change soon.I really wonder where the price will stop. 255? 200? 100?5 times lower... is a shame.  My belief is that people overestimate Bitcoin and almost every time they think of it as the stock market, they fail. Bitcoin is technlogy and technology is changing fast. You don't need to hold 10 years as the price can double within a few months and drop within days (or viceversa). The long term thinking timeframe is now changed, as we live in the century of speed.Things change fast. Hold for 10 years and you might loose everything. If you still use 10 year old tech you're doing something wrong, as newer tech is more powerful, consumes less energy and is overall better than old tech.Again, you shouldn't think of holding for 10 years. as you'd do with stock. Treat bitcoin as technology not as stock. Compared to Apple, Bitcoin is not Apple shares, is Apple iPhone.  Just don't scam me please... Yes, I need to do Paypal. I can send you in half bitcoin so I can minimize risk. It's not. Thank you for the heads-up. Been scammed before with paypal tx's Any idea how I could sell some btc fast and get cash in my Paypal account (in the next 2 hrs)? I want to go to a place i love. I'll be there for you, to listen and give you some advice, as much as I can.During our conversations you'll be the most important thing. If you have any personal troubles and feel deserted, lonely and hopeless I'll be there for you. Just PM me and remember that if you feel alone, you're not alone.
0.3 Not all, but maybe a bit so you can drink for me... Doctors visited, no chance. none.AND I HAVE TO MAKE A POINT: Bitcoin's price is not my main problem.  What is wrong with the people on this board? NO I'm invested 100% in Bitcoin, not really investment because never bought any, all generated in the early days. I saw this drop coming but never sold because I really trust the system. And because I really hate banks and current fiat system, I'd rather die poor with a few bitcoins in my pocket than selling my soul to the paper money scammers.But now the price is really low and I can't survive much longer like this. Not just because of the money but because my health deteriorated fast in the last 2 years. Smoking and drinking put a definitive mark on me.  Then depression came. I've hurt some people and now I pay the price. I've hurt my ex-wife, who was dedicated entirely to me, took care of me and was so in-love with me that she'd suffer great pain if I suffered anything. She had access to my cold wallet but never took anything. And after I lost her, when she was left with about nothing to eat, I just gave back some. Since my lungs are fucked up big time, I don't have much time. I guess I won't see the 10,000 per coin. But bitcoin was one of the best things ever in my life. Aside from the baby I'm waiting. I have used a big chunk of my bitcoins to give to others, mainly family and friends and if you never had the chance feed someone with bitcoin, I think you're doing something wrong. Of course, I saved some for the child, maybe he/she will use it someday. But remember this: when you go, you don't take anything with you.  No real volume? It's amongst last 30d highest volume.  Panic sell in the making. That's the reason I don't think we'll go lower than 270, but very close it it. I'm still optimistic.   Once we get past 329, price will fall down pretty rapidly. Oh man, you're NOT right. I never said or implied that all those big companies did a mistake. But you can't understand that I was just saying, even those big players came, price is still going down and it will go down (or at least not up to 10,000) 60 dollars to go until 270. Just saying.Microsoft, ETF, Time, Dell, USMS... NOTHING HELPED. DO YOU THINK SANTA WILL???Ship is going down and I was too much of a rat, hoping it will recover. Bitcoin was fun but fun days are over. wait, fewcoins is bullish?? That's my bet. We're going to revisit 270s on what it should be a double-bottom. The real double bottom. Afterwards I think price will increase again. Doesn't matter how much, there's some bucks to be made selling now, buying lower and then selling again when price goes up. Altcoins suck mostly.If country X were to dump it's gold and create a mass of:0.5% silver10% sheep's wool cut only on 29th of february5% iron extracted from the sea only on full-moon nights0.5% rabbit tails from virgin rabbitsand the rest of the recipe being other weird, hard-to-do stuff, that require lots energy, wouldn't mean that they are creating an 'alt-storeofvalue'? If you'd want to recreate that stuff, it would cost you a lot to do so. But you can change the formula anytime.That's what altcoins do. They bring nothing. If Bitcoin's gonna die, all of the altcoins will die because none brings anything of real innovation. Same Mary, different hat. THIS IS CONFIRMED:If you send a coin to yourself and back to that sending address, repeating the process a thousand times, blockchain will show TOTAL received 1000 BTC. Do it and you can be rich! Even my grandma it's doing it and her life is so much happier now. Nothing will happen. Bitcoin is dead. Even USMS is getting out of it.  Sell! Show me an ATH before I dieTake me out of this stag-cryTeach me again on how to flyLead me so that I can buy US Gvt thanks all the losers that put their Bitcoins into centralized sites like MtGox and SilkRoad 1, Silkroad2 and Silkroad 9000.All those losers enabled the USG to have the largest wallet in their possession. 
I might be crazy for thinking this but given the sentiment in the market, declining interest in Bitcoin due to declining prices and the low volume we have, it think that if we were to enter another rally many will miss the train. Or I should say that very few will be on board.And things get nasty when you have a desperate mob running to catch a high-speed train where the few passengers ride drinking soft wines and eating caviar. Just thinking... yes, 100 usd above. And 800 usd below the last ATH. Just thinking... We are in a bearish market for almost a year now. Can we sustain another 10x price increase in 2015? Or are those days gone forever?I can't see anything good in the market right now. All good news have no effect on the price, which stagnates for about 2 weeks. I had never, ever understood the ETFs, derivatives, stocks and anything else in Bitcoin. I'm not mocking anything, I sincerely never understood why would someone need something like that.  ... Do you plan to get out of bitcoin in the next 3 months with at least 70% of your holdings if you see no price increase? No, I'll wait to sell them in 2 weeks at 1000000x the price....... No moon. Only down to 360s again.... Not exactly trollish but I think we'll see something like this. First 2 plots seem similar but nothing points to a third one happening in the same manner you rally guys are nuts. Everybody screamRALLYMOON10,000 USD per BTCand post traniz, rockets and other spaceships God grace!Please all stop it giving him/her advices on how to trade or not to invest more than he/she can afford to loose. Damage is already done.For OP, I hope you read this. I suggest you to take out a very small part of bitcoins, buy a cheap whiskey and pack of cigarettes , good music and watch alone some good old photos of you in the past, ones that you were happy in. If that's too lame, take out some more money and get the most dearest persons next to you and DO SOMETHING NICE. That way, you'll put your Bitcoin investment to something good, and you'll always remember.  I for one will always remember the trip I got to the seaside by using about 25 btc a few years ago. And I don't regret a thing!After that, put your stash offline, in the wallet and come back in a year. Be strong and don't let money affect you too much. You'll have eventually even worse problems in your life. By the way, my father committed suicide. He asked me to go out before that (maybe he wanted to see me for the last time) for a beer and I declined it. Even if I get 100,000 BTC I can't turn back time. So think well. Is money really worth it? 360 breached down on Bitstamp.Do people still think we're going higher? Because facts tell otherwise. Funny part is that if everyone would buy just using their funds in the exchanges, without coming with new money, price will skyrocket. And also taking the coins out, securely in their wallets. But it won't, because every time the price increases a bit, people sell to buy lower. And once the price gets lower, everybody waits to buy even lower. Doesn't matter when the next rally will be, 2015, 2017 or 2020, it's almost a certainty there will be one.  I don't know if I'm thinking correctly but my main problem is not the price, I'm pretty happy with it. My issue is with all the speculators that use centralized exchanges and platform, basically putting their coins into the hands of a single entity.USMS coins are in the govt hands because of them. Gox coins are lost because of them.I moved all my coins 1 month before Gox closed and now using only P2P trading on localbitcoins. Cheap bitcoin prices. Let's assume for the moment that Bitstamp was breached by hackers and at least all hot storage coins are lost. What do you think it would happen to the price? What do you think it will happen with all those sad fellows that lost the coins? And what do you think it will happen to the Bitcoin image?I guess the price won't be affected too much at least few days.I guess most of those that lost their coins will never come back to bitcoin again.And I guess the media will be all over the bad news and Bitcoin's image will suffer the most.Anyway, it happened before, it will happen again. That's the price for using CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES.  Say what?? Historical highs for last 24 hrs maybe. MeanwhileWat? 90 USD to 300, 700 USD to 1000... No, just realistic. Extremism is not encouraged 
Funny quotes I suggest we hang out in here and leave the guys with rockets, spaceships and trains play alone. So far everybody that said we're NOT GOING to the moon and WE'RE NOT GOING TO RALLY but just downwards with some bounces, was right.Delusional permabulls were wrong. Back into the 380s area soon.Just make sure not to post in bullish treads to give arguments on why we won't go higher anytime soon. It's futile, they won't understand. Oh boy, stupid weak-hands selling. I really do hope somebody hacks the shit out of 2 exchanges and steals every single coin in hot wallets. That should be a lesson for all to:1. not use a centralized system2. long-term hold. Investors? You are thinking that some lamers doing DDoS and trying to profit from every single price increase we saw this year are investors???Dunno why but it seems to me that bitcoin showed what's worst in people: greed, scams, hacking, get-rich-quick schemes.  I'm calling it. Pump and dump. Still in the pumping part. dumping starts at 450. 414. Falllling was right! Exactly. Too many altcoins. I mean, I like 3-4 of them, maybe is room for a bunch but not hunderds of them. Quick boys, dump those altcoins and come to play men! 450. IT WILL STOP AT 450 MARK MY WORD/  410. this is insane. I am skeptical. I guess we can say that this is at least a small RULLY.Can't wait to see if we get past 420 Suspicious on how this topic is not being replied at...LE: Fair to assume that everybody has a hidden agenda besides me. We can loose it in 2 hrs. It's Bitcoin, remember? So all shorters were killed by now? What about those shorting with leverage? Is there any service that provides that? We're not even half way to 1000. When we're at least 95% there I'd give it a few chances to go to 1000.  Oh, yes. Trains, rockets and other ships.  Seems too strange for me. I don't trust this rully until it goes to 500. 
What if price really takes off and in the next 30 day's we'll see:- new ATH on 26th of november- 28 nov: surpasses Gold. Media covers this incident extensively.- 30 nov: even more obscure media covers bitcoin almost daily, regular people hear the 'bitcoin' word almost daily both in negative and positive news.- 1 dec: by this time Bitcoin is heavly criticized in talk shows as not being money and trustworthy because 'nobody controls it'.- 9 dec: temporary stabilization at about 2300 USD. CNN makes special reports daily on the price of Bitcoin.- 10 dec: Russia and China are confronted with huge demand from the people and oligarchs, lifting all bans (if any) on BTC. Some regulation will be enforced though.- 11 dec: price continues to climb towards 3000. - 12 dec: 3000 is reached, small crash to 2700. - 13 dec: we see a recovery.- 18 dec: price has gone up again and it's even more aggressive. As EUR and USD are dropping, people flee to this safe heaven.- 22 dec: WMF and other goverments ask people to be careful trading bitcoin and try to stop buying as this affects stock markets.- 24 dec: DJIA and other stock market crashes, gold is at low 1163. Bitcoin is at a staggering 7813.- 2 jan: price surpasses 9999.99.- 3 jan: big crash to ~3000 USD. Then crash to 800.- 5 jan: we get close to 250 USD. People jump off buildings.  Meh, it will stop at 400. Haven't shorted yet though.  Ok, maybe not a bulltrap but what if will top out at 400-420 and stay in that area for a few months again? I have stopped caring even if I still check the price hourly. I don't know why I do it because I have stopped caring if I'm poor or rich. I guess this depression eats me alive.. 400? It will reach 4000! We had a minor price increase and everyone believes this is it. What do you say?

I bet the train stops at 380 at most.   I will give you 3 propositions and you can choose one:For the first, I have chosen a retro logo:3rd i'm still working on. Same old me. I don't actually need 0.1 BTC, but trying to see if random people would even think of sending anything to a stranger. Simple question:Would you trust me to send me 0.1 BTC if I'd say I'd pay it back immediately to the address that sent it?Post 'Yes' or 'No', and if you feel brave, send 0.1 BTC and see what happens.19CpjPLBB1YYhtjXwNpVJJyEi2eQtdV6wD Oh, the speculator in it's purest form. I wish you luck but there's not many big fish left. Why? How can anyone be here (Speculation) and don't care about the price? So now, officially, no uber-bull can counterargument that even if price is higher than 1,3,6,8 months ago, overall BTC is doing great.No, it's not doing great. It's actually doing very badly. Lots of people lost money with it and lots of bad publicity was cast over Bitcoin (deep web use, FBI's arrests, miner scandals). PS> Don't sell because of bearish posts also. You will just push the price lower.  I dedicated some full days to look on the Project Development subforum. My impressions so far:There are lots of talented people that can do amazing stuff.  Saw many ideas that haven't got the chance to go more than a draft. Guys, a failed idea is one that is not implemented! If you have the skills to do something, try it! You don't need much money to start and you shouldn't invest much at the beginning. I bet we're going to break 330 in a few hours like it happened all the time! Nothing will happen. Price will continue to degrade as usual. For me it seems too predictable to have a rally in november again so it won't happen. Preparing to sell at 370 and buy back lower (even 320 would do it). Yes. rockets... I have this magic globe and I can see it too.
I am very pessimistic about this. It's heading back to sub 300s because everyone will sell even more now with this small rise. Yes. This is a dead cat bounce. As soon it reaches 349 big sell orders will suffocate the rise and it might even go lower than 250!!! But you won't see any. Almost everyone still thinks 10,000 per BTC by the end of the year. Good news but I don't think that will help the price. Saw to many good news this year to believe that. Remember when in May I said that there won't be any rally in the next few months? Now, seeing the price going down so much, I am CONFIDENT we won't see anything more than $400 in the next 6-8 months, even more. Bitcoin is simply not traded anymore. Maybe it's used as currency, I don't know. But trading volume is insanely low. Nothing, but nothing is gonna happen. Thing is, I know people sell at a loss to get out but that's only going to put even more downward pressure on the price  I have found it. The Pattern. Everytime the price goes up a little, it goes even more down! Note that there was no true increase, when it went up more, it went down even more. Just a speculative pattern. Everytime the price goes a little up, it will go even more down. Selling pressure. So no rally anytime soon.Bears were right, the one's that people mocked and accused of being just trolls (like falllling) and delusional bulls were wrong. Yea, bears tend to be more trollish but that's just part of the game, same as bulls are delusional. I don't know about you, but I stopped reading here. Because he's right. See my post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=834453.0 Yes. Stupidity. And greed. Stupid 'traders' that once again (like always) crash the price. Of course, greed also took us to 1200 but, but, if it was controlled greed, we'd now be at 5000.And now you think that after we saw last 10 months, we'll go back to even 500? No. Not this year, maybe not the next one either. And what about BadUSB exploitation? I have a question for everyone that would be interested to start up something:What is the best approach to team up, given the fact is very hard to meet face to face? I am interested how we can trust each other and what kind of system we could set up so none of us could run away with the business, it's assets or profits? The website is beautiful. What are your plans with it and what kind of help do you need? What media hype? As price increases smaller and smaller walls are needed to confine the price. See those walls at Bitstamp of not even 3k coins that are now in place that are doing a good job at keeping price lower than 385. Show me the biggest rally of all times, show me that you can increase 10% daily for a month or so! Of course it should be turnkey.  I will be very happy if we get past 420. 680 is a loooooooong way. Count each 'o' for a month and you'll get it. You have to measure in USD, because that is what is needed yo buy. So we need about 10 mil USD.If we were at 3740 and had 18k BTC up to 10,000 we would need a shitload of money to get there. I have very solid linux experience and have a small team I can put to work.The target would be to create a minimalistic, security-focused linux distro to be used only for bitcoin clients on dedicated hardware (such as cheap laptops).Things like wifi, bluetooth etc will be not included in the kernel and the distro will install with full disk encryption by default. The user can also configure which Bitcoin client will use.There will be some wallet backup techniques (maybe on a SD-card) and the user will find it very very difficult to install unrelated software.What do you think? Would this we welcomed in the community? I can do sysadmin work for peanuts and references. Very important aspect as I want to fill my resume with bitcoin-related jobs.
It's a little too much for me right now. I mean, risk is kind high to pump that much money without meeting the owner. I have no idea if we can make contracts and anything, so I'm looking for trust and small amounts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uX_bB_4VJk&feature=youtu.beI can see in the vid that Bitstamp starts with 2500 BTC volume and ends with 15,000. The wall was about 26k? So the wall was pulled before all coins we're sold...

So nobody really bought his 30,000 btc.  The bottom might be really but there's nothing pointing to a trend reversal. Price can hover to 320-360 for a loooong time now.I have 0 faith that we will see >450 this year. Will we go lower than 275? I guess not... So far  $275 on Bitstamp!  This is nice. I do want profits but more importantly I want to work on something. What can we (I) do to improve afterwards? Good bye for today. See you 270 tomorrow. I am living in a country that experiences a boom with mobile apps and I want to create presentation apps forhotels restaurantsbarsetcAll of these might need either presentation apps or menu apps (for restaurants, bars etc)How much would cost to have someone program them (I''ll do graphics)? I plan to resell them. You mean like an exchange?? If you have any idea of starting a small bitcoin business but lack finances or expertise to build it, post its and let's discuss. Maybe we can start something.Profit and work is split 50-50.  Ya know what time it is? It's RALLY TIME! show a chart. oversold. If they buy even 3mil BTC that means 1/5 of the supply is controlled by a single entity. Wait for price to climb to 31, sell, profit huge.  $13 more USD and we change the prefix from 3 to 2. And along with it, new panic sell will pave the way to 250s! Wait, are your trying to tell me you can earn 100 BTC in a game?? You already have 10k USD more. I would buy part now, part at 270-290 and keep those 10k to see if you can buy at 150s. We're about $35 to that target. Give it a few days and we're there. We'll see who wins and who loses. 
Bubble retrace from 1.1 to 0.55 ~=Bubble retrace from 32 to 7 =~80%Bubble retrace from 266 to 50 =~80%If bubble retrace from 1160 is also ~80% that would mean prices of about 233. WE ARE VERY NEAR THE BOTTOM. Strong possibility? What if this time is different and bitcoin is dying for sure? 336, going down to 320 within 2 hours! Hahahha (excuse my trolling), the gay-ETF-Messiah that everyone hoped to save the price is not going to appear in 2014. LAME! What if... I told you that... you need to sell 5000BTC to get the price to 341 and only need to buy 5000 BTC to push it abovce 405? 3. Very high chances to go under 349 within 24 hrs. And if we do, expect 2xx next week. Do you still HODL?  YES, too much sell pressure and no new money coming in. Of course price can go to near or above 10,000 USD. But the question is when. Many cannot wait 5 years for that to happen. Because I can't see any. Price is only declining declining and declining. Until near the next halving, I suspect the price will only be at most $500. But if there's someone that has good TA skills, I'd like to see a chart.WARNING: self-moderated topic. troll posts will be deleted. 3 months to the end of the year. I still think that January 1st 2014 will be significantly lower than January 1st 2014. At about 1/4 of the price... It's inverted! Good news just pushed the price lower, let's hope for bad news, ie:- US and EU banning bitcoin as of October 15th- Overstock, Paypal, Alibaba, Dell, Google, Yahoo, Apple declaring that bitcoin will never be used by them (simultaneous press releases on October 16th)- Mark Karpeles being acquitted- SilkRoad operators acquitted but the bitcoins being hold by USMS and wallets deleted. Besides the miners that HODL since the early CPU and GPU days and besides a lucky few that bought and cashed out before the any of the last bubbles had burst, the majority only lost money.I was looking on the MtGox leaked transaction data, it seems most accounts that traded, traded to accumulate more coins and very very few realized their gains into fiat. That's pretty bad because if you had invested and you HODLed until the >$1000 peak but didn't took out the gains, you lost twice because either 1) MtGox ran away with most of your coins or 2)Your coins devalued to about $385 (today's price) 3) BOTH optionsFor the technology geeks that love BTC for what it is and use it to run away from govts fiat, it's a pretty instrument. But for the majority of the speculators it's a piss-poor instrument. See the guys that sold their homes to buy and now lost at least 50%.Given this fact I believe most speculators are out so we're left with BTC being used only as money to buy and sell things. This might be the reason I cannot see any new adoption or 'new money' coming in. And without no new money, no new rallies and ATHs. So, we're doomed, we might see prices lower than 250 this year. My counterargument for a rally is that too many people expect a massive one, but nobody really buys. at around 200s give or take. If we'd go to even 199.99 there would lots of buys, so I doubt it will go to 1xx. I have graduated arts school. I have never understood why people would park their money into art (being it contemporary or classical). Why would someone put money in art as investment?I cannot see why a Rembrant is more valuable than a good copy or how can you measure the price of a painting. For someone it might worth 10,000 for someone it wouldn't worth 100.  rpietilla, what's your price projection for the end of the year? is btc going further into bear market or we will see a recovery? I'll give to the OP 1 whole BTC if price will be even $56,000 in the next 14 months. Just remind me because I'll be on a yacht busy with booze and women. Seems all hope is lost, price is going down down down. Maybe people expect $250 prices by the end of the year?I would love to see 200, I would buy INSTANLY at least 50.
For me it's more like October 2013. But I make no prophecies. I do not really think that, but since the Speculation subforum turned into a trollbear factory, I created this thread to bring some optimism in.RSI shows we're a little undervalued right now. Check it: Why would it be nice to see another man's misfortune? Prices dropped to 371. This is a big event in terms of bitcoin's image. Nobody will want to trade it anymore, for a while. This is not a sane market, where you can loose or gain 20% in a day. I presume we'll eventually hit 266 mark and stay low for the next months, maybe a full year. I'm confident in BTC as a technology but the speculation shit has come to an end. I feel sorry for the folks that bought with dreams of get rich quick and lost a shitload of money.It feels painful to see what happened last 8 months. Prove me I'm an idiot, prove me I'm wrong but I think the bottom is much much lower and a trend reversal is at least a year away. During those times it was so much fun. I remember the forum frenzy and the thrills everybody got when price was going up insanely. Was pretty counterproductive as I was staring too long at the price and working at least 20% less. But nevertheless, IT WAS FUN. Oh, the good old times.What kind of memories do you have with the rallies? I can't see how. Everyday we're going lower. But of course, in 1-2 years price will almost certainly be higher than today. This proves that there's less demand than supply for bitcoin. Nobody wants to deal with it, miners sell for profit, nobody wants it for any other purpose than speculation. I guess it's time for bears to hibernate with their coins in cold storage for the next 6 months. I left out that option because I'm interested only in opinions within that timeframe. You being a longterm investor are looking at maybe at least 6+ months. I for one, don't. I know we'll laugh at this topic in 2 years or so, but I can't see anything big happening with the price in the next few months.Price cold go very easily to 550 but beyond that we need lots of newcomers and adoption.  It doesn't really matter. Poor africans for example know about USD or EUR but they don't own any. They might find out about BTC soon too, but... doesn't mean they'll buy.I don't think there's much room for unforced adoption. But, if some govt makes it the only way to pay, that would be a different story. My bet: USA will be the first, after USD crashes. I think everyone should check the facts. Yes, price per unit is more than last year same time, but with all the news and adoption, we haven't made a significant move for months now.I'm calling it: no more bubbles, rallies or rapid price increases. TA applied on bitcoin is just tea reading. I see nothing notable happening soon (ie next 12-18 months)  The end of such low prices I mean. It seems that we bottomed out, price is low and if we get to have a few more weeks of low (or lower) prices, then we might go ballistic soon.You can't deny it, if you had fiat sitting in exchanges, this drop was amazing if you wanted to consolidate your BTC positions. With the summer getting to an end and ETF launching soon, many bears will gradually turn into bulls. If we go lower than 500s, I believe we will get to 440 very quickly. But that's your game, I already bought in. Sold since 650s down to 600s. Bought once again at 515 because I feel I took my share. Even if it goes to 400s, I'll still be happy. If you do the same and buy now, we could evade the 450s and go back to 600s and more. Otherwise, there will be much lower prices.  Please stop giving high hopes to people. There's no upgoing for a few months at least. Maybe some price increase with the ETF but considering we got lots of good news recently and only went down... I dunno... Sadly I think we're done with bitcoin for this year. Expecting 450s or lower. And yes, no bubble. Somewhere in 2018-2020. I don't think we'll go past 700 this year again. Remember the emotions during daily price increase? Remember the goosebumps and the activity? Rememeber?? Great, great! Also expecting this for August 18th-21st? It seems the bubbelievers never stop hoping. Here's a graph on tradeview, credit goes to emanace.https://www.tradingview.com/v/NRS4U5CA/LE, quote from emanace: "I think Bitcoin is soon going to move into it's next parabolic phase."What do you think about that? Are we cooking something? Is the rocket being fueled?
Can we please sing that song when we get past 700? And then after 1300. There is no bubble starting. Speculators gonna sell until we head back 580 in no time. This is a special day for me and I'd like to wish you all many many bitcoins and health. Cheers. Remember the people that said "bubble" in July? They moved to August when July ended. Now they think November will bring price increase. Somehow, all good news moved price down it seems. Argentina just defaulted, big economic event in the world. Also ebola made more casualties this year than in the last 25 years. If they fail to contain the virus, we'll see polynomial growth of victim numbers and the world could be devastated as no cure exists for ebola.Then the world economy will turn shitty. Nobody would really care about bitocin for a while. While I respect the work you have done, I cannot help to say that we have too few data to say that bitcoin follows a certain cycle. The only path I see now is downwards, and not because bitcoin is overvalued or because it has not so many uses, but because our speculator friends freak out and sell.1 Bitcoin should be, as of now, because of the economic set the world is in, at over 2000, more than gold. Actually I say gibberish, bitcoin should be used everywhere where people want freedom from the goverments, making the USD price irrelevant. Stop using banks, VISA, Mastercard and Paypal and we'll have a new world. No, not turning bull but I have to say, I'm impressed with the recent drop and support at 591. It seems it's very hard to crash the market as it was in the past. Somehow we managed to float at 600s. Seems that the next week might decide the new trend. I see higher chances for bitcoin to rally, at least to the major resistance at >670.Here's is a nice Fibonacci chart on TradingView, made by user ChartArthttps://www.tradingview.com/v/8CGBJXFm/ We won't have any bubble soon. Keep ignoring this and start to loose. Everyone predicts this bubble or major price increase but signs are just not there. What happened in 2008 is nothing. I'm talking about a global event that will change the world completely, as in new financial system. I think I can explain what's happening with the price.Some over-greedy people with low IQ moved almost all of their coins to places called MtGox and SilkRoad, where they could speculate freely and buy illegal stuff. Doing that, they ignored and defeated the most important part of bitcoin: decentralization and put into the hands of a few entities hundreds of thousands of coins (Mark, USMS etc)The Silk Road and MtGox events are very important milestones in Bitcoin's history and personally I do hope that both Mark Karpeles and Ross William Ulbricht face at least 20+ years of jail time for their deeds. Their 'businesses' had good parts also and if we were in an ideal world, I would oppose jail time and put their asses to hard work, but since this is not possible, jail it is.Their actions brought immense bad news over Bitcoin as a whole and stopped much of the adoption phase. We have also the 'speculators', which buy and sell bitcoins only for fiat profit (never ever forget that, it's all about $) - they help a lot to crash the price, which in turn brings bad bad news. There is a small fraction of speculators which try to make their BTC holdings bigger, but that's another matter. While I do not wish for it to happen, because too many people would suffer, a global financial crysis would put Bitcoin right next to gold and silver and potentially make it a New World Currency. But that would be a forced adoption in my opinion and I'm pretty sure we'll see lots of tears from the people that heard, used, speculated, mined or stolen bitcoin and never understood what's it's purpose. I'm sure that each one of us will regret of having even 1 BTC and not putting it to storage for a long time. I think we take goverments way to serious. If chinese will want bitcoins, they'll find a way to get them. Goverment bans are meaningless. But I want 1000$ at the end of July... Can you please wish for that? 22 newly minded bitcoins? Will donate 5 BTC to OP if BTC hits 5k$ before 1 August 2014  Short-live frenzy due to Dell might take us to near 640 but some people will dump nevertheless. How cool would it be otherwise to have a new bubble started a few hours after Dell's anouncement? slightly above 630 but I guess we'll see some dumpers soon. I would love to be wrong. Because I would win by all my bitcoins value. I can see all the excellent news but cannot see the price going up so high soon.LE: price will soon be irrelevant if we see some more big companies accepting bitcoins. As soon as I'll be able to buy at least McDonalds food I'll be able to live off pretty much solely on bitcoin. We saw good news for months now but price barely changed. I think it become positive news tolerant and won't move much. Seems that DJIA had on 17/7 the biggest crash in single day this month. I think it will enter into a multi-day bearish mode, target of 15,500/ I don't think I can come soon. I was thinking of shipping something like 100oz. If silver is now a big part of your portfolio, does it mean you have mostly sold your bitcoins?
Question: do you still own that physical silver? I remember talking to you some time ago, I'm was not decided 100% but now I think I should buy some. What was the price you were selling at? Coming when? Crashing up 10 USD, crashing down 20. Repeat. So price got up some 10 USD and everyone thinks it will go to the moon again?I would be impressed if 650 within the hour. 'Dat would be something Is there any way to see how many bitcoins were bought in an specific interval? What the hell did I said yesterday? Anyway, a very sad moment in my life and I needed fiat to pay for things, so an exception forced me to sell some more at 618. If price will crash up or down, depends pretty much of the number of winners AND batch sizes. And batch sizes surely depend on price before the auction, they can't sell 10,000 BTC batches if the price is 10,000 USD. So I'd say that the destination of the auctioned coins depends on the price. Now and then, every 6-8 months I do also sell 1-3 coins for basic needs (medical care, food if I have fiat problems etc). Strange thing is that, historically, whenever I sell those, price goes up. And it's not that price goes up for a few days but it starts up bigtime.For example, sold 2.5 today at 620 and price seems to go up. I remember I sold some when it was at 5 then rally to 32. I don't own a castle, I live in a small studio. But still have more bitcoins than you'll be ever able to count.And you know what? I won't sell until the last fiat currency in the world would have failed, I now have the character to hold. I have the sole purpose to see bitcoin (and no other gay altcoin) the money of the 21st century. And then maybe I'll buy a beer and burger. Actually it was stable since mid February to start of June.  Like this? https://www.tradingview.com/v/vfJQwL48/ Agree.  I don't really get it. If we pass 1000 again, the price should go much migher than 2000. Once we surpass the ATH and a big milestone, gold price, news will hit the press and people will panic buy like crazy. But I really don't think we can pass 1000 that easy. Bitcoin surpassing price of gold will be BIG in terms of press coverage and this will bring loads and loads of new buyers. However, once speculators do what they do, the crash will be also big. While I don't believe the price can go so high, I know that it wouldn't take 72 billion to go there. If we would get 20-30 million on each exchange today, price would go up like hell. I've changed my view on bitcoin and I do find it a good investment for a niche clientele. Those anarchistic, fiat-scared, goverment-hater people. Wall Street and other mainstream guys will only get on board when the stock crashes. And by then, it will be too late for them to buy a bitcoin. Or too expensive.Anyway, there's also physical gold and silver on the market and people trust these more.  Actually my question is: will the bubble happen because most people expect it or will it not happen also because too many people take it as a certainty? If he said July 24th, how come the prediction was wrong? Not exactly trolling, but I like to make fun on the uber-bulls sometimes.  Time will pass, August will come and go, September will come and go and the price won't even be 1000 again. I can't see that. Care to point it out please?
Amazing! How low do you think it will go? What about silver? ongame7: https://www.tradingview.com/v/tBecsTcW/Both have similar outcomes. If we get past 680 and stay there a few days, then *maybe* we'll have 1% chances to rally. I cannot possibly see what catalyst would bring price increases right now.Past weeks we had uber-bullish news, positive news, USMS auction and lots of independent TAs doing megabubble graphs. But nothing happened. Just some price swings. Exactly. I could bet nothing will happen until everybody turns bearish. Seems that all TAs show that a bubble is emerging soon. But I ask, if everybody expects a bubble, could it not happen only because of that? +1 So July's mega-rally has been delayed to August-September or even October oh sweet November? We cannot go to the moon. For example, Apollo program required 24 billion USD in 1969 to land people on the moon.quote from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_programLanding men on the Moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity, and the largest commitment of resources (USD$24 billion) ever made by any nation in peacetime. Adjusting 1969 USD to 2014 USD, we get:$157,554,253,521.12Annual Inflation: 4.27%Total Inflation: 556.48%Source: http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.phpWe have 13M BTC mined (including lost ones) so we would get a price of 12,119 USD per coin. Not exactly moon... Dat would be awesome I would be very very happy if price gets to 3000 soon. Like in about 2 months. Check this graph on Tradeview, made by levi.granthttps://www.tradingview.com/v/TaXhiCbu/He basically sais:We are running into strong support at about 610, and possibly a double bottom on BTC-E and Bitfinex. If it makes it past these levels, watch out because that would indicate to me that the bull run has turned bear and would threaten the sanctity of the long-term log trend line.There's a short-term bear trend developing, which comes to a point at the long-term log trendline. If it breaks that trend line, I'm expecting all hell to break lose. If it breaks up, then I believe that is an indication it is ready to break resistance at 680.---610 on Bitstamp as we speak. So according to this graph, I buy $200 worth of bitcoin today and wait to the end of 2015 to get at least 30,000 in return. Nice. Why isn't everyone rushing into this?Poor people should buy $6 worth of Bitcoin, at the end of 2015 they'll have 1,000Below-average income people should buy $60 worth of bicoin, return of 10,000Good-income people should buy a Bitcoin, return of 100,000 by 2015.Carlos Slim should buy 6000 BTC, he'll have 600,000,000Satoshi could have 1,000,000,000,000.  Source? Is FEMA even allowed to use weapons?I mean, in my country there is a FEMA-equivalent and they coordinate emergencies situations but are not allowed to use weapons are definetly are not allowed to intervene in any social uprests. For example, they do prepare for dirty bombs scenarios but only to clean up the mess, they have no authority to shoot anyone. I guess the work closely with the CBRN teams within the Army. Even though I know that a crumbling USA and a dying USD would be great for bitcoin, I can't help to think the impact it will have on the average American. There will surely be a great increase in poverty and many people will suffer badly.  Never. Maybe 1000 someday.

I just need to convince at least 70% of the sellers on major exchanges to put asks at more than $1100.Very interesting, if all would do the same we'd have this price in a few days. Maybe I should make a nice website www.sell-at-1100.com and make it popular for people that don't read the Speculation subforum.What do you say guys? But either are bullish. Many people said that we're in the 'calm before the storm' phase already but we should check barometric pressure and look for thunders first.
It may be the case that we're now slowly go up to 630 and start accelerating to 650 with an immediate target of >700. If this happens, we might get interesting prices by August. guyinanutshell: https://www.tradingview.com/v/EsSdwOZW/chrisdunttv: https://www.tradingview.com/v/6m3YoK6x/lowstrife: https://www.tradingview.com/v/ozwXpYBi/Tin.Foil: https://www.tradingview.com/v/FVUT5s2i/Enjoy! Optmistic, because US sold bitcoin as an confiscated good. Price doesn't matter much. But I don't think we'll have a rally because of that. Kudos to all uberbulls that said '5000 by August'. I was wrong, they are not blind, they're stupid. This is becoming annoying. Crash, after crash after crash. I wonder how many days such event put us back from 'the next big rally'. Nice charts. So based on your analysis, how long should the stability period be and when should the top be expected? And lower than 30 days ago.  Nice characterization but the price is still lower than 2 days ago. I guess you're even more annoyed. Green candles, ok, but we still dropped $25. I can't see anything so far. Can someone please give some good reasons (explanation or charts, no trolls pls) that can enlighten me? I have the feeling we'll see months passing and nothing notable will happen, only 100 USD ups or downs. This is bullish, but long-term. Most millionaires are not remotely interested in bitcoin yet. I loled. We won't go beyond 666. Not this year. If you buy 10k BTC on Bitstamp the price would $1050. You'd pay about 7.9M USD. But would the price stay there? No...  700-710 might be, if we get that high this year. Rally time? 500 will be, once we drop below 480. Bitcoin investors = scoped tomahawk Seems that the price doesn't want to go higher. Contrary to what people expect (a steady rise) I think a successful rally has to be consisted of rapid price increase like we saw last year. This is the only way buyers can flow in.So far, I see nothing notable happening. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! We're not at the beginning of a rally! I don't think we will have any rally this year. Just maybe 100-150 USD of ups and downs.
Seems that rally is going back to rallydown mode. but 30,000 BTC is. In 20 years, maybe. This price increase due to NewEgg is an illusion. Coins made from selling stuff will be sold immediately. So more sell pressure.I doubt grandma and grandpa will buy BTC only to use at NewEgg, Amazon and Ebay. Crazy as in? Adoption and usage is the important thing but what about people that heard about bitcoin? I'd say even 20 out 100 heard about it. But don't use it. Seriously now, August might see 680. But anything more is insane.  And even stronger resistance at above 670. I rest my case. Great insight, but you're talking years there... Bitcoin looses 40% in a few days... Scary that those were leaked as well. But I was 99% it was done. Thanks for sharing! Agree. But holding into bitcoin should be looked at a method of preserving wealth. What wealth do you preserve when it drops 30%?  Let me understand correctly, without my trollish-bearish general attitude: Everybody thinks that we'll see 4-digit prices based solely on last weeks rise? We are lower than January guys!Good traders might have got the chance to make money out of these $100 price changes (up or down, doesn't matter) but holders have lost much of their wealth.And yes, we had tons of good news but price wasn't much affected. They are the reason bitcoin succeeded. Smart thing is to always have some BTC, not cash out entirely. I'm not convinced 100% that bitcoin will succeed but 100% convinced that the US dollar will fail. Decide. 2500 to 2800. Reasoning: 5% of daily increase last 24 hrs. LOL.Future_price = Current_price * (1 + y)^nwhere y = decimal growth rate per dayn = number of periods (days) It will trade at 666 forever again. So a bunch of people placed bids at 403, 405 and up to 500. A smart guy placed a bid at 600 and he won. Wow, what a surprise! Isn't NewEgg accepting BTC for months now? LE: Oh, it was Overstock. How soonish? 2015?
I'm on the same level of idiocy with the people that shout '10k by August'. _|_ Suckers. My IQ is pretty high, way above average. Was tested in a 10hour long battery test at a LEA. Price is tanking. Deal with it. HAHAHA, 1000 BTC sell wall on stamp at 650!!! SR COINS ARE BEING SOLD FOR PROFIT! Bitstamp needs a sell of about 6500 coins to get to 100s. Do you think that's a lot? Even if you multiply that by 5 (more exchanges), that's nothing. A few whales and that's all It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, if I was to wake up and see BTC = $40 tomorrow morning on all exchanges, I wouldn't be surprised. I have buy orders opened for a long time at 50 (about 100 BTC) because I believe someday we will go there. Yea, I was wrong. But it will only last shortly. Soon, when price gets back to 580, I'll be right again.  It doesn't mean anything if you just scratch 650-660s. If price stays that way for a week, now that's nice.What I see the last 8 months is just up 2 days, down 10 days, sideways 20 days. If Starbucks, Amazon and eBay altogether start to accept bitcoin, this means almost nothing. Just a small fraction of BTC owners will use to buy goods, rest holds and speculates.Also, all bitcoins will be sold on exchanges, neither Amazon or Starbucks will hold a single BTC for more than 30days.So this would mean nothing. Maybe some good publicity and bigger sell volumes on exchanges.  Ok, yea. Wrong. But no way 670s again. It's 620. Not exactly a rebound. It seems it mostly goes sideways or down. Anyway, too many people wait for a big bubble and that's the reason I'm reluctant to believe that we can go beyond $700. At least this year. This movement is so insignificant it's not even funny to watch. Wake me up when we go beyond 670. I mean, next year. Salvia? Is that think smokable? I make tea out of it and no effects.  Because Bitcoin cares about numerology and astrology? I have some questions that I cannot answer myself so I invite you to post your opinions1. Are we in a situation that needs only a spark to ignite a new rally? If so, what could it be? Buttefly effect?2. If there will be rally, could it start by let's say August (~250 days after the last big one)?3. Will the rally be less powerful (ie 2-3x price increase) than the last one, because not so many newcomers and also because many think it will be a huge rally?4. Could the rally be bigger because now it's even more exposure of Bitcoin (USMS auction, press) and people know it's the best way to make some easy money?5. Could we be at the saturation point of bitcoin usage by masses (my personal argument is that many people heard of bitcoin but very few afford or are interested to own)  Oh, yea, that thing. ThanksLE: But that applies only to Armory right? I mean, if you backup your wallet.dat you're safe. What do you mean? Care to explain pls?
We'll see... Not convinced we're going to have a rally this year yet. Money do work as a store of value. Fiat doesn't.  1 word: "ACCURATE" ? That chart didn't showed any 'buy' signals at 450s... Image sais it all. Seems like no ATH this year, folks. But it seems it's exploding downward for the time being. We're in a bear market, not a bear trap. I was right. Absolutely brilliant! Waiting for more! Thanks! What everything?? Because I can only see price slowly declining or sitting at the same level for weeks. Care to explain? I'm worried that the dollar will fail by the time we're at $20,000 per coin. Afterwards BTC might be the new monetary system. Like it or not, apart from gold, it's the only candidate. Ok, I'm switching to oligarch mode: If I were any Goverment in this world, I would ban bitcoin. Govts don't like people having power over their money. All govt fiat is printed by the govt. So yes, many countries will ban or discredit bitcoin. Doesn't matter if it's Russia or Congo. For me at least.  If I were to buy 25,000 coins in one day, like today, on a single exchange (Bitstamp) I'd push the price too high. Bitstamp has sell orders of about 15k BTC up to $1250, for example.I presume someone could buy 25k if one uses at least 3 exchanges (Bitstamp, daily volume 4000 BTC; Bitfinex, daily volume 4800 BTC; btc-e, daily volume 3000 BTC souirce: http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/). If you were to use just 10% of total volume daily (12800 BTC), which means 1280 BTC bought per day, would mean that you need 20 days to accomplish your goal without moving the market that much. And during that time the price could go up up up.So, I'm asking myself: would the bidders offer $650 per coin? That would be a nice dollar cost average, since you cannot really buy 29k in a batch.Anyhow, 2 questions:1. can anyone confirm that the US Marshalls won't sell a batch of 29k BTC to a single bidder, but smaller batches to multiple bidders? I can't really tell from the auction listing.2. would the auction act like a primer of a panic rally? Next stop 580 in 1 hr. Hi,I have an MtGox Yubikey that I'd like to use in other projects. Anyone knows if MtGox will provide the decription key for it or I'll have to bruteforce it? True. 3 years sentiment is something like 50,000 USD... No.  I've been reading threads in the speculation forum and so many people think we're going to more than $3000 this summer. It seems now everyone knows the future but the future will change only because of that. So we're going nowhere.Yeah, good news on the companies accepting bitcoin lately but every company will sell the bitcoins almost instantly. So nothing really changes, no new hoarders. Price might really drop because of this.Nice to see Yahoo charts with Bitcoin but... almost everyone who knows how to use the internet has heard of bitcoin. This doesn't mean they''ll buy though. $600 for one unit is pretty high for most people in the world. $300 (0.5 BTC) also is. So basically everyone awaits big pockets to enter but I'm not very convinced they will. I don't think price will move too much for a loooong time. Since last bubble went up 9x, could we go about the same magnitude this summer? Something like $6000 per coin?I'm not too optimistic about that but it sure doesn't seem impossible. However, wouldn't that price be too high? I mean, what stock/commodity costs $6000 per unit? Everyone is excited by cheap coins but nobody buys...
$574 on Bitstamp... And gets lower and lower I admit, good point. Nobody can buy 29k coins withound market impact. Guys, I think we have to prepare for some rough times ahead. This will be a shit storm. If the auction winner will buy them 20% cheaper, HE WILL SELL SOME ON EXCHANGES.Anyway, can someone lend me $18 mil? Shit $300 pe BTC if the buyer sells on exchanges! I suspect auction buying price will be 70-80%, right? It's clear for me that there won't be any rebound to 620s or more, for at least few weeks if not even months.2-months, daily candles graph:So, 400s here we come. SELL SELL SELL! I really really hope that the pussyhands didn't panicked on the FBI coins today. It would really show how fragile the bitcoin economy is. lower $300s the biggest L.O.L. ever. 597 again. How do you comment? These "guilds" are the biggest threat to bitcoin. The problem is you cannot really stop them.  LOL. Based on what? What announcement ? We started going up 2 weeks ago and we're just about 50% higher. It's good, it's nice but look at the charts. February 1st was way higher. So we're lower than where we were at 2014's start. Of course money can be made on price swings or bubbles but looking at the bigger picture, seems nothing fundamental changed. Not that many new people buy bitcoin. If we were to repeat last bubble, a 9x increase in 2-months timeframe, we should be at 4500 this summer. But I think chances for this to happen are very slim. Too much new money have to be poured into and not that many newcomers into bitcoin yet.I am very curious where the price will be on July 2nd. I'll have to do a big decision then and a powerful Bitcoin might help me. A good price will be 1000 zone. Based only on last bubble, where price double first time in about 1mo, we could be there by my due date. But this might be also the end of a mini-bubble, deflating from 680s to 400s again. If a new bubble starts this year and price surpasses ATH, I'm going to send you beer money in bitcoin. A few 6packs fro you and your buddies. Just remind me. You mean higher? I saw it would be easier to go to 1500-1700 if price was 800 than from 400 to 1700. Very very few are going to pour fiat into Bitcoin. Many people know about it, few people own them or want them. Bitcoin seems to a niche. It will make a call that we are saturated. No newcomers. I agree that if some of world USD millionaires would get in, we might see another bubble. But nothing is gonna happen... Thank you for the postings. Yes, this market is sad. And boring.  Exactly. But I cannot see the price going up soon. Maybe the whole year will suck.  Awesome points. I heard that FEMA concentration camp and plastic coffin theory. Actually, FEMA has tens thousands of plastic coffins for shit-hits-the-fan scenarios when you don't want corpses everywhere. And also have modular camps that can be set up in a few hours, to provide emergency shelter in those cases.In regards to revolutions... revolutions now are changed. We need only 2-3 victims to be outraged. Back in the history, the regimes would massacre thousands nobody would lift a finger (see Rwanda). Now, with mass communications, nobody would even think of that. Too many cameras even in Africa now. This technology can make us witnesses and nobody wants to witness that.  Money was lost the moment you sold. Not when price was going down. I hope you'll be happy with your decision. It's all that matters.You can see the price in 2 years going to 1500 and still be happy, if you know you're not that risky persons. But the sad part would be if you'd be even more sad than now.Or you can see it at 1500 and be miserable AND with a loss.  Why do you guys keep talking about market cap?? And I'm not mocking anyone, it's just I can't see this term's utility in Bitcoin. We can trade 100 coins for 1000 USD daily, that doesn't mean the market cap is 12 Billion.
We're pretty running out of time. As months pass we get less and less chances to go higher. For me, it seem price makes lower highs, and lower lows... Bearish for the next 6 months at least (which goes to end of 2014) Random lines on Ronan's graph (yellow). A currency that wasn't supposed to exist, get banned by World Financial Institutions? Oh wow... This thread is needed. Speculators, overall harmed most of bitcoin economy, but none of them on the same level day-traders did. They are mostly interested in fiat or if interested to gain more BTC is only to have more leverage in terms of fiat. They think in fiat, feel in fiat, want fiat. Bitcoin is just an instrument. They do not care what happens with bitcoin tomorrow if they gain money now.The problem is this kind of behavior is taking up a big portion of the community (nobody expects it to be 0, but lower would be better).So the warning is this: stop day trading. Soon we'll have a nice tragedy of the commons if people continue to sell again, when Somalia bans bitcoin again for the 100th time. Everybody is here to make money, but more money are to be made if we keep in mind only 10 mil of BTC exist. (If taken out 2 mil as lost forever)If I could afford to buy 100 coins, the only thing I'd do is keep it in offline storage. Risk of trading them in exchanges is too high. See MtGox case. Lots of successful traders lost almost all because all the gains were kept in the exchange. There was this guy trading from 2010 and tripled his coins. Where are his coins now? In his wallet or into Mtgox Nirvana? Think of it.You are the key. Price is the measurement of your holding patience. Nothing changed for you to sell. Still 10 million bitcoins exists and a max of 21 mil. So if 10 or 21 mil people want it, they can only have 1. If you have 10, you're 10 times better. Nobody stocks more coins at 200 because they'll all want 100. And might even get 100. On the same way, if everybody wanted 5000 usd coins... you get my point. Something nice and true : I'm not aware of the new ban. First heard it from you. I only check Bitcoin forum to see if they found a major flaw in the protocol. The OpenSSL news was the best I saw. Rest is just speculation. Best 2 quotes ever! So, seems being bearish pays off. Where are the people screaming 'to da moon' 1 week ago? I hope they didn't trust too much money (again) by panic-buying. I won't make any prediction but I think we can see last 12-month low soon.Also I'm starting to be very very suspicios of BTC being able to go beyond 700 this year. And the key as within everyone: don't freaking sell unless you need money for the things at the base of Maslow's pyramid. Do that, and we'll have a supply shortage getting us to everywhere you want. Hell, with only 10mil coins or so in circulation (very optimistic assumption), a guy with one coin has a fair share of power. The bright future of bitcoin is possible only when we have enough people caring for that. Right now, 99% of the community is speculation-based. You see what's happening. First sign of rally and everybody rushes to sell.This is why I want to see it at 100 for many months now. Price would be still high not to allow buying many, but also low, making the greediest in a loose position. I want to see grinding of expectations, hopes and characters. Only after the weakest are weeded out we can resume. Slow and steady grinding you mean. I only see down last 10 days. Kudos to the guys screaming "To the moon". Price is the same as last week. And will be the same next week. And the week after.A $50 price increase would be welcomed just after most " investors' " bones and mind have been grind down. I take it as ride on a boat in stormy weathers. Noobs that jump off at first signs of wind, deserve to drown. Those who hold on tight, and jump off just to take a bath, then prepare for more storms are the one's who prevail.I for one won't go out of this at $10 or $10,000. I'm waiting us to reach the New World and spend it there. Bitstamp is not Bitcoin. The surge would be temporary, but no one would sell 200k on exchanges. 480...Lame! Been a while since I haven't seen all the noobs cheering with the usual "to the moon", "10000 by July" and other forms of insanity. Great expectations bring only great disappointments. And reality seems to confirm my sayings: no rally this time kids.Nothing fundamental changed. No new adopters, no new money, no nothing. So anything more than 1000 is a wet dream or illusion. It won't happen.And advice to the newcomers: Holding is easy. Don't try to prove me contrary. It's easy to buy now and hope for a 100-fold price and get rich only by watching the price. But trading, that's hard, that's what's the real shit. That's where most people loose. So, advice, don't sell your houses or take loans for bitcoin. You'll get the same price for the rest of the year at least. Last 3 hrs we climbed about $30. This means $10 per hour. So in the next 24 hrs, we go 760. After that, 1000. 1240. By Saturday we're looking at 1500 at least. We should not fall for this and scrutinize the facts thoroughly. Many await to deceive us. What do you think the velocity of this will be? $3 per hour? $5?  $10? Oh, wow. I think they started already. 
[1] yea, I'll loose some but win more if we go that high.[2] end of the year.[3] Don't show me this! I might reconsider  Sorry, I was ambigous. Maddone said once that "even bad publicity is good in the end". Might help bitcoin after all. Was talking with a friend today and he kept saying that. Our conversation turned more into a fight.He was saying that we will have a huge rally this year and arguments for that were: - bitcoin gets more adoption - mentioned me about Maddona (even bad publicity is good in the end) - ETF launching - possible economic crises and stock market problems - even tech-illiterate people learn faster to use the technologies (exampled Africans using cell phones and 2 yr old babies playing on Iphone)I was against it so we ended betting 1 coin and 50 beers that price will or will not go beyond 1500. We're angry when price climbs because we will fall even deeper and with more casualties. Otherwise, only a fool wold be angry that bitcoin is going up. Can the mun just come to us instead? Bitcoin will go down. No. Maybe at 100 we will. Meanwhile, top addresses continue to gain more coins. Weak hands are shaken. Wealth concentration continues.It's a grinding of averages joe's character. Only strong hands survive. Wait. how many hours before the crash have you predicted it? You're right, what I said is not what I meant. 99.9% are not interested how tech works (thus don't want to know why bitcoin is secure, etc) and are not interested how money works (banks, fractionary reserve etc) Dunno much TA, but if we break 400 now, brimstone is upon traders. It will be like the Dark Ages of the bitcoin world. With the plagues and all. No you won't. Because either 1) we will only get to 50 or 2) because if we're at 10, you'll want at 2. It's amusing when someone is off with his predictions a bit but this one is fucking hilarious.  Has been a while since I last saw a bullish prediction for the next months. Guess everybody is a bear now, ha?Where are the people screaming that 450 is cheap and "to da moon"? Where are those 10,000 predictions and charts?Fact is, I saw this masterpiece investigative series in my country (superbly filmed and documented) presenting Bitcoin. Major audience, Sunday 8pm.Made me wonder. I think many, many people know about bitcoin. They just don't use it. And never will as 99.9% of the world is not interested in tech, money, economics, revolution, anti-bank, libertarian movement (and bitcoins sums all up). So we might be finished already with the bitcoin adoption. Nothing will happen. If we get more than double bitcoin users, it will be just fine.99.9% of the world doesn't understand tech, economics, money, revolutions (which basically what bitcoin is). Bitcoin is never a buy. Whoever wanted bitcoin, has it. Speculators now think 450 is expensive. They say today 350 is cheap. But at 350 they'll wait for 200.Nobody cares about BTC, but about fiat. And even the long term bulls want more BTC because they have more leverage in terms of fiat.But every now and then we get MyBitcoin and MtGox incidents that level off things. So, don't worry, even if you profit today by buying low, you have all the chances of the exchange being hacked, run off, your wallet stolen somehow etc. Nu inteleg la ce te referi. I understand this is what you want, but not going to happen. Or, to be explicit, we can have a few bubbles, maybe some ATHs but all less than 2000. No price change for a long time. Might as well quit everything and sell now if you don't plan to hold 2yrs or more. Same thought. Would be too easy for some people to get multimillionaires. And Satoshi would have what, greatest wealth all-time? But that's not a an argument for which BTC can never be 10,000 usd. It will never be because we already are saturated. Many many people learn about bitcoin each day but very very few buy. Bitcoin is niche.I don't know what ETF/ SecondMarket is. But I do know that there is no place of "financial businesses" in Bitcoin world. No investments, no derivatives, nothing else than buyers and sellers of good or services. No even exchanges.So 2000 = never. I don't understand what you're saying there. Care to explain?
I hope it does, but very very slowly so people won't feel it. It would be awesome to have a multiyear bear market, seasoned with more exchanges going down. Gradually loosing interest by mainstream media will be good, and only then we will have a stable underground payment system for the libertarian freaks.Bitcoin is bitcoin regardless it's price and we need a an event that weeds out speculators and get-rich-quick jerkies. There is no need for Wall Street to come in. Please, no Wall street. Keep those assholes out of this. Bitcoin != bitcoin price.Price is irrelevant.  La facultate se invata limba romana??User din 2010. Yes, yes, chinese buy buy buy! Good thing we have this FiatLike site, otherwise we wouldn't be able to see that and have informational advantage. Good exchanges won't make much.Rogue exchanges and wallet services (which mostly steal) will make tons of money. Even dickhead Mark Karpeles had 500mil USD This is the shit. Bitcoin is the new shit in making money out of thin air. Let stupid noobs pay. I will have a service like this also! I'am a great guru. Aaaan this thread gets the same noob trolling, no other constructive dialogue other than Anu's posts. It might not be the truth and only but the truth but my speculation is that he became disgusted with the community since Gavin showed it off to CIA, and become even more disgusted when he saw how twisted we are with our overly speculative, wanna-get-rich-quick-while-jerking-off mentalities and such.My impression is that he doesn't give a single shit on any of us and more tragically even about Bitcoin. If not a prank, his recent post on not being Dorian, clearly shows he stepped forward to defend a man that was in REAL danger of being killed for his supposed wealth/ worshiped to death by the bitcoin fanatics.Moreover, Sathoshi gave everybody the instrument, a decentralized currency but we somehow started to do it wrong (see MyBitcoin, Bitcoinica, MtGox etc)But don't worry, Bitcoin will not burn in hell, only we will! (in a max of 90 years or so, and even less for some of us). And lets a keep a toast for for MtGox - Bitcoinica incidents as we love people being scammed of off their life savings.PS: Haven't lost any bitcoin with the Mtgox fiasco but I have lost faith in the community. Protocol still works though.  Yea, but now I feel I have to hibernate few years. So, we get a another rumor and price gets down again because some idiots still think bitcoin is stock and act like it.This only shows how fragile we are, and we are fragile because dumb idiots are part of the community. It's their fault that bitcoin is overspeculated, used only in get-rich-quick schemes and with almost no other uses.We also got the Gox event, which I really hope learned people that they're doing it wrong. Stop fucking use centralized exchanges. I get the feeling that bitcoin is a freaking giant joint, everyone wants to puff some if it but nobody wants to go out and buy it from the dealer. Same here, everyone mines it, speculates it (buy low sell high) but nobody does any good to this economy.If we weren't so greedy, I believe today we'd had more purchasing power and more services/goods to trade. Instead, we have these retarted events and prices.What is this shit anyway? By design, no, it cannot be banned. Right now? Yes. Imposing banking restriction would destroy 70% of the community, because 70% fuckers agreed to used CENTRALIZED exchanged. This might be good actually. I'm ready for $10 bitcoin and no speculation whatsoever, but a nice payment method for VPNs and other services. This is timing nicely with the new NSA espionage on the Chinese Snowden released. I assume at this point that the Chinese believe (wrongfully or not) that NSA is behind bitcoin.  If you tend to be conservative in your thinking you will not be able to see progress. Bitcoin is money. It has inherent value (will ever be, electricity is used to mine them, this gives it value and we cannot clone them). Authority that backs bitcoin up is the community.  I only laugh when a "successful" trader doubles, triples, quadruples his money but looses all when exchange decides it's time to retire.See the MtGox historical trading graphs for individual accounts.  So, another exchange bites the dust and runs away with people's money?Niiiice!When will people will stop trusting these scamchanges and stop fucking bitcoin? Because that's what they do, fuck it. Decentralized protocol with centralized wallets. You deserve it. Your coins will belong to somebody else. Everyone who wants USD or other currency to crash so their bitcoin stash gets more powerful, it's simply retarded.USD crash would bring much turmoil and might make bitcoin seem a joke (that consumes too many resources)So stop saying / wanting that.  I disagree. Greed grinds this economy. Because of it, we deceived ourselves we have 900k coins more than we thought we have (see MtGox). Greed brought this insane price without a solid base of commerce and transactions. Bitcoin is shady. 64% of Americans think it's a scam.51% protection is almost a joke when we have centralized pools. Also, a decentralized protocol is a big no-no with all exchanges' centralized wallets. Then let's get to 10,000 so any 1 BTC holder can make thousands of times his investment. I've been here since bitcoin was nothing and I was so passionate on speaking and spreading it in the past, that people we're just dumb smiling at me. I really wanted to gain adoption but not to make more wealth for myself but because I was seeing it as an amazing thing.But now things are different, we want it at 10k so we can make more $$. That's what's killing BTC at it's core. I am deeply saddened that we have still these exchanges and not using bitcoin enough, in the street. I understand your need to get numbers. I can only give this example: guy sitting on 10,000 BTC gets 100 MIL USD THAT HE CAN COPY ON A USB STICK. With BTC you can move shitload of money without banks, LEAs etc to know about. That's huge power in hands of one man. You can't get this much power if you have 100 MIL USD in assets or even 100 mil USD CASH. You'd need a truck to move 100 USD cash. Magnificent graphs ahead:http://bitcoin.stamen.comNot my work. Just found it. It's really impressive.Check #117 for example. Sold a bunch at the top but, as we know, MtGox didn't had much fiat withdrawal activity.So my take is that people mostly just lost money with Gox. They played, they speculated, some were really lucky and got more coins but in the end all went back into the box 
Too many people will be too rich after speculating.  Nope. I'm a young bitcoin holder. I trust bitcoin, I like bitcoin. But I can't see it there. I don't think bitcoin will reach 10,000. EVER. Bitcoin more than 1500 is too insane to think of. Maybe, just maybe, for a brief period of time there could be gigantic bubble to 2000-3000. A very big maybe. This is more a media / psychological battle. There's no war yet. Wars today are different. Not even 100 years ago, a soldier killed would mean WAR. Nowadays we get more diplomatic.WW3 has to be something different. I can't imagine big battle field WW1 style. But I can imagine use of nuclear force. MtGox was, incontestably first biggest trading platform and for a big period, the one with the most volume. It became, for the outsiders at least, homonymous with Bitcoin. Lots of people had their life savings in there and I saw accounts of desperate people that lost everything. Accounting the huge loss this case is a scandal that has to get direct scrutiny from LEAs, financial, academic and media institudions. This has to go sooner or later in economics textbooks as the biggest (scam, heist, incompetence, you name it) case in internet's history. Also legal action needs to be taken and all facts investigated professionally. Thus being said, we need to analyze what impact it had on the bitcoin ecosystem. I can name a few:a big PR hit, mostly for people that never invested and now have lower confidence in Bitcoinmore scrutiny from big financial institutions (banks especially) who have direct ties to exchangesless coins available to trade, as 900k are missing from their ownersbelievers in bitcoin, mostly those that didn't have all eggs in one basket are going through the acceptance phase and might be ready to buy some againBut what about long term, residual effects? I only can think of one:With 0.9 mil coins less than we thought, confidence into centralized wallets / exchanges and lesson learned, whoever wants to buy, buys or bought already and stores into cold storage. There is no way were going to see that kind of speculation from the past and this will translate into less volatility. 1. Learn some PHP and MySQL2. Buy domain mtgox.com3. Create trading platform and name it Magic the Gathering Online Exchange4. Let sheeple come (according to http://www.mtgoxrecovery.com/ about 3000 people lost 180mil USD, or about 60k USD each - savings?)5. Be incompetent, be biznisman in Japan, play God for a few years and effectively fuck bitcoin's image (April crash 2013, lots of other examples)6. Runaway7. ProfitHaven't lost with this fiasco but I suggest people who did to accept bitcoins, USD, blood or any combination of these from Mark.And then, I really hope we will see exchanges going down, or at leas not being the center of BTC economy. I bet nobody will ever see their money again (maybe except if Gox sells those 200k coins). Can you please post proof so we can independently verify this?It's a big breakthrough if these are gox coins. I suspected they were other's people. Don't listen to him, listen to me. I do have in my possession a pretty reliable TA. It involves a single step and when you finish counting to 10, you'll be richer.  i  wish we see a priced of 1.1 ever again. More proof on how damaged most people involved in bitcoin are, actually. Why? Because driven of get-rich-quick desires, most fucked up bitcoin's image. And pricks like Mark and Zhoutong did most of the harm.However, I do not care. It's a certainty that MtGox won't be the last and frankly, it's just karma as long as we're using a decentralized protocol in a centralized way. Do not forget: many early adopters are just random looser geeks. Myself included. Bitcoin taught many about economy, pshycology, money etc. Myself included. I have started recently to have serious doubts that we will go higher than 1200, ever, or even ever again.It seems 600 wil be forever. I haven't saw much TA around with this non-volatile period. So boring to stay at around 600... No insane rally, no flash crash, nothing.Come on guys, predict something, draw some charts, anything. You too? Everyone wants to get rich with bitcoin in 2014. But I'm affraid we can only have 400-800. Which is great for the freakin speculators who harmed bitcoin to it's core (glad that some lost with Gox though).Anyway, we need no exchanges! Bitcoin in the street! LOL! Won't happen. I am too skeptical to believe it will grow up to $800 by the end of 2014. Why so boring in here?? Do you have any other examples of Satoshi's measures to remain anonymous? Can anyone please start a new post with some proofs of the anonimity measures Satoshi took? I know he mentioned Tor but... that's not evidence he wanted to be that really anonymous. Maybe it's that train collector that started the project only as concept but it really took off. That would be very interesting to find out, he have worked under some NDA and the wallets were not his. Or really lost them with all that health problems. Anyway, it's just an assumption he has 1M. He might have way less, even just a few cashed out already.I find it hard to believe The Satoshi haven't enjoyed at least beer off of bitcoin yet.
Hi Bob, you're pretty trusted here so you cold help out. I do not have his address yet, and I would need someone to verify it. Again, I think it's better to give some time for the news to cool off. MODERATORS DO NOT DELETE PLEASE:I have a big collection of model trains that I want to send it over to Satoshi, even if there's a chance of not being THE SATOSHI. It will make him happy if he likes train models and I will be happy to give something back. The value of those train models belonged to my father which passed away and I am not made to cherish them as I should.I need community support, maybe someone to receive the boxes in California and send them to him, after things get more peacefully. I do not live in US, thus it might be an awfully wrong idea to drive them there by someone. Waiting for some ideas. Thanks Where do you see that momentum because I can't see anything? The thing is, FBI sits on 144k coins seized from SilkRoad (even more if we count DPRs). Bad thing. Bitcoin itself was derailed from it's intended purpose of a e-cash system to an insane speculative instrument. People that do that do not care about bitcoin they care about USD. Even if they want more coins, in the end they do that to have more leverage when the price goes up.Serious issue here guys: If Gox coins are in hands of goverment, any goverment, hell, even in hands of a group of dudes, then bitcoin is fucked. A big percent of all coins in goverment hands is a disaster. Even if now price is ok, what the hell will happen when we find out that US gov is selling? This is not a dude from early years selling 144k. It's the US! Major publicity around BEFORE the actual sell off.People used bitcoin in a centralized manner, letting sites like MtGox and SilkRoad to keep their bitcoins.I really really hope we all learned from this and I make an appeal to you guys: don't keep more than a few coins anywhere than your cold wallet.  Using a centralized entity to hold bitcoins, like online wallets and exchanges is a serious threat to bitcoin.People are plain stupid to do that and now, lesson learned with Gox. Don't get me wrong, I myself kept coins there too long.  What's Gua?LE: NVM got it. 'Dude you made me laugh! Not because of your explanation, which is brilliant, but because lots of people entrusted their coins to some incompetent, PHP-does-it-all fatso. I would assume these wallets are being encrypted with different keys. If you do this, I think you're not stupid enough to put the encryption keys in the same place. This makes me to believe access is possible but unavailable. Maybe he put them in safes in banks but cannot access them.Otherwise, fuck yea... 200k coins lost forever if he lost the keys. nope. What do you mean lost keys? Isn't Gox using some kind of cold wallet encryption? Maybe they lost that, but not the wallet priv key itself. +1.And a decentralized exchange is a must. I really want to see one soon. Was reading these local newspapers and news sources. Something very small. Guess what, all were talking about bitcoin. Nothing too bad, they were saying biggest website for trading is closed and "investors panicked and sold". Price went down.My point is, these newspaper had 3 or 4 articles altogether about bitcoin and only when it's price was over 1000. Seems like a lot of publicity went these days and people hear more and more of it.Also, a good thing it's that MtGox went finally down. (at least trading halted, those prices were really bad). I don't really care if it comes back, zombies are not grandpa I used to play with.So, new rally upcoming? TRUE: if I send my coins to a random address, they;re not lost. Just temporarily unavailable (until I manage do crack the private key) You're a hater. This time is different, can't you see? Large rally while we're on a stong downtrend? How? Where? I want to keep a track of those losses Lots of threads regarding MtGox's death. OMG! What.a.surprise.!It's time to move on. Bitcoin still has life left in it and I'm not very sure it will be impacted too much because of this gox fiasco. Anyway, let's move on. You can reply here if you're ready to.  Your gonna destroy the beautiful lawn with that pavement up to the gate.I suggest having the road some 50m near the gate and then a red carpet, having guests to walk barefoot on it. 530. Pleease, let it be 12,234 by tomorrow...540. wow 524 on Bitstamp, 12-hour high. Where are we going to ?
Roughly 312,204,000 USD. Nice! We have regulators: exchanges and partner banks.KYC, AML, limited withdrawal, forms, IDs, frozen accounts, frozen bank accounts etc.Regards. Who the hell wrote that?Part 2: switch off exchange temporarely (1month) --???What? It's been 12 hours and people are freaking out already. Mark Karpeles NEWS:Another exchange bites the dust letting a bunch of people without their funds. Sorry, this is the price we pay for playing with exchanges in bitcoin economy. Exchanges have no place. But again, people being sheep, when they are promised get-rich-quick schemes, they jump off the cliff.PEOPLE: Assuming ALL exchanges from now on will be solvent and all, what the fuck do you do if your bank freezes your funds ?Here's my proposal: trading bitcoin on the street. Either for cash or goods. This is key. This is the true freedom you can get with BTC.  Protests do nothing but making protestors loose more money.LE: Sorry, I don't understand. Guy steals money and all people do is protest? Considering I was expecting price to really pop to 200s... i'm still amazed.  I think the sourcecode is just put there by Mark to buy more time. Smoke and mirrors my friends... There were many days when we saw poor performance on stage from this guy's part. For how long you'll still believe it's MAGIC? It's a scam. I will offer them 0.5 BTC for the domain name so I can put a photoshopped image of Mark Kaperles peeing on bitcoin. By no means I want to make people feel stupid, but there's almost no reason for the Gox-Scam-Incompetence to affect the bitcoin price. I'm satisfied of what I saw last 3 weeks, Bitcoin did really well ignoring MtGox. And still does.But, trend is trend so we'll see lower also. MtGox was aquired by Mircea Popescu. It won't be much of ATH if it goes to 1330 or so, and down to 500s again. Still, I don't think we can see new ATH this year.LE: I mean, who's gonna buy all those 3600 btc/day? I don't think so... Seems people are really panicked about what happened. Maybe a 600 at max, but also lowers into 200s? I wonder, if this is maybe the MOST important one?MtGox, leader exchange and first big exchange is now offline. Maybe not for good but when you are that big you cannot simply display a blank page. So, could this be the day we should start removing gox from online charts?There were many wake up calls, I myself spread some last year regarding keeping bitcoins in the freaking wallet, not in the wallet of Karpeles.I am very curious on how much money people lost using MtGox the past 6 months... Nothing new?  People got insane? Or is there something I'm not aware?I see both Gox and Stamp rallying a bit. Answer is: NO.Do you think MtGox will be here next week? Bought you a beer bro. That's amazing. You're willing to risk all that money?  120 breached, 102-107 coming within next couple of hours.
Do you have any proof of sending 50k to mtgox? This is not speculation is throwing money off the window. You might win, but still it's stupid to do. I would fight them for every single bitcoin. Do it. One bitcoin is more valuable than you think.  Very hard to choose... I wonder how many people are stuck with Gox. $130 support breached, now sitting at 125 at Gox.There's no way to keep the price from falling to 100s but I really wonder if we will see double-digits (ever).So much fun! It's so exciting watching gox now. I wonder if it will go under 100... Hey MtGox users,Why panick? Bitcoin price is where it was 6 months ago. I think he has Asian female bodyguards guarding his balls. When I saw this thread I rushed to the window looking for it, but had to come inside... no sign of BTC above 5000... Question is, why Bitstamp should go down?Think of this: Me buys hillgox.com, do some design with Bootstrap, some PHP/MySQL and presto! New exchange. You cannot withdraw, cause no bank will work with me but you can put all the money you want. Me also engineers the price to be low or just let the wolves kill each other will I get blown by Asian girls and drinking frappucino. Would your trades, your bitcoins and the bitcoin price be real? No. The only thing real is me getting rich. Is that guy protesting wearing Google Glass? 100 USD is  0.16 BTC. Nobody has the right to steal from you, even 1 cent. Justice should be blind, remember? Hi James,Mark is doing exactly what an instant millionaire would do at night: hookers, party, clubs, landing home with a helicopter, drugs. I mean, wouldn't you do it too if you'd had all those coins AND fiat sitting there on a website you pulled out your ass?Smart people left MtGox a year ago. It's nice to see all those class action suits and protests. But listen to this: by the time people will get their USD back, all will be worthless And while I don't give a shit on people's USD, I do care about their bitcoins. I never thought they we're hacked. Just that they we're targeted physically, dunno. Maybe their previous offices didn't have much security. They state that had to relocate offices due to security issues. I believe someone attempted and maybe succeeded to breach them. I also believe some their coins are lost (not stolen but lost due to incompetence and speculation done by MtGox staff). I might be wrong but one think I know for sure: I'd be really pissed off if I had coins and / or fiat there and not able to withdraw WHEN I WANT.And what's the 157 usd price? MtGox, u serious? eMpTyGox has no place in the bitcoin economy. Mark my words: gox will fail. Gox crashes again. Now I also want Bitstamp to die. Didn't had many coins there but left only 5 there. Anything more is a liability.DEATH TO BITCOIN EXCHANGES! I won't be surprised if Gox uses much of it's funds and comes up with a fix for the withdrawal ahead of everybody else. Every single person that still had bitcoin on Gox, I'm not sorry to say, it's PLAIN STUPID.If they had USD or other fiat, there were some chances to get out. Now, Mark has no power by his own. But with all this stupid, extra greedy and now fearful people, he will bring the price to 200. And what's even sad, while all his customers unwillingly and unknowingly help him, in the end they will all be sacrificed. I think the bubble from $800 to 10,000 is the most rediculous 
I have no explanation... Maybe someone more smarter can shed some light on this? Holy crap, MtGox is almost 200 bucks less than bitstamp. What the hell happened guys?I'm bear but this can shoot us to 200s! Fixed! I have ignored him and Walsoraj Which makes me wonder is there's a method to compute that ratio... I was just making an assumption with 90% but I gues you're right, 95-99%.Anyway, death to bitcoin exchanges. I'll be a bad boy and tell to everyone:"No everybody is a HODLER. In Bitstamp, MtGox, Vircurex"Now, I prefer to hold in offline wallets but hey, if some people like their money in other people hands that's cool with me. I won't stop them from achieving happiness. Exactly. Major exchanges halted bitcoin withdrawal. But price is not affected by some hard faith in the bitcoin protocol or hardening of the people that use it. Oh no... It is because nobody really want's to withdraw bitcoins, everybody wants to be able to pour in fiat, pour in bitcoins and SPECULATE.Check what happened to Gox. 9+ month of inability to withdraw cash? If that was your bank you'd set it on fire and and pee on it just to show you're unable to fight the flames. And still, people used it nevertheless. This is a solid proof that we're 90% based on speculation. Death to bitcoin exchanges! Oh SHIT! Fixed. This kind of crashes show how weak the whole ecosystem is. I agree with OP, what happened on BTC-E should be written in the damn history books of bitcoin.The market is unstable. And while I don't advocate for 'SELL AND RUN', I'd say that only the ones that have the guts to watch falling to 100s to HOLD. Other's should sell portions now and diversify. There is absolutely no point for me that bitcoin have triple-digit value for a few weeks. Why? Because you can't do anything with the money, other than going back to banks (which I hate more than seeing everything I own going to 0).On the other hand, if prices are stable, everybody's happy. Anyone still thinking we will go UP UP UP??LOL. So people that ignore Bible are doomed to burn in hell and we should warn them in every thread? some will. I was thinking... we all speak of the 21 million coins but in our lifetime, it will never be 21 mil. So, instead, I think we should speculate for the next 20-30 years.  I understand that % theory but from 1000 to 10,000 we have 9000 bucks to go. That's a lot, and people don't get raises in %.  No choo-choo this year.  I hope you guys are aware that this is a scandal. What happened today on BTC-E is so big that it should be written in history books. There are some people that would not sell because they don't have what to do with fiat. 
Whoever withholds the bitcoins of another user is nothing but a thief. But also, bitcoins were never meant to be kept in 'exchanges' but in one's wallet, so user's are at fault also.You heard it here first, Mark made a shitload of money (I mean, BTC) on other's people stupidity (including me) in form of fees. All in exchange for a shitty service.Bitcoin will move to new paradigms just if exchanges will be no longer be used. Again, there's no up today! Please don't hope. modern financial games that I do not understand. fonzie got ignored. Lol... it will never happen girl... I sais: Date Registered:    June 12, 2010, 08:27:53 PM When somebody scams me for $100 I usually put $500 to make him suffer.  You were playing with fire. Withdrew mine in April-May. Oh wow, I guess it's over now, all is safe. wheew! RECENT UPDATE:After my dog barked that he thinks 300s is a certainty, also neighbor's cat started selling. Price is tanking boys, each for it's own! Run! Even my dog thinks we're gonna see 300s. Of course not! Sub 300s! Not exactly. Oh noes,Gox faltering on the brink  = exchanges should never had a place in bitcoin economyApple bans blockchain app = apple is good only for bondage fanboys, men like to be freeRussians planning on outlawing BTC = Russia doesn't ban anything, they simply kill.Huge orchestrated dumping across exchanges = of course, that what's happening when you have too much coins in just a few handsGox finally shutting down BTC withdrawal = Gox is dead for a year now, only stupid (aka greedy) people use it. Not that I wasn't expecting this but I think we have in front of our eyes another proof of bitcoin's "reliability" as e-cash, gold 2.0 and other callsigns. 150 dollars drop in a day is insane. Congratulations 2014, now all investors are running away. Or people here still think that big money (only money that can buy 3600 bitcoins a day at prices above 200) will get into bitcoin after this?We now have some massive sell walls, strategically put in place at 700-720. Whoever thinks this 'crash' is not staged, is a baby. Bitcoin is nothing more, and probably will never be anything more than a purely speculative instrument.  There is an old saying that for better understand other people, one should look at himself.It's interesting and if you do it, you have nothing but to gain. Here's what:I have no formal education in economics but I am very interested in it, although I'm a bit lefty and have some things that I don't understand. I also don't understand stocks and other modern investments.I would never buy state bonds, paper silver or gold or stocks in companies. My view on the world is rather simplistic and paradoxically, it seems old. I tend to see good investments in physical precious metals, land, houses, real estate (only for what I call habitable homes, not 100-rooms mansions that cost $5000/mo to clean up). I would do investments in agriculture and energy. I run like hell from stocks in all companies as I do not feel anything owning 0.0001% of Coca-Cola. I would be in for 33-100% in any other small company. Also it's my personal view that stocks destroy companies. Now, what I want to ask: Is it just me, or more and more people run away from stocks, bonds and all? Am I just an ignorant economic illiterate or what? Nice and true. It's breaking down. High prices makes idiots think they're part of some elite. I don't take em seriously either. But now nobody will buy because bitcoin is known and wanted for it's insane daily fluctuations. It's like an easy woman that now won't accept one night stands for money anymore but wants a 'stable' relationship
MtGox was the same in 2011. Nice. I hope I see bitcoin on the streets. Enough with the "exchange" phase. I want to really use it. I never understood stock market and never tried to, more than a few weeks. I find Wall Street and stock markets producing nothing so I'm not into it. However, I can see lot's of people loosing money out of it, which is sad.Regarding housing, I do think GLOBAL prices will go down. Starting with US/Canada and Asia. I think people wish for too much. So many news in the media but price still stagnates. Bloomberg ticker is here for a while, no influence.And Gox, Gox is a shithole, a zero-sum game. I'm serious when it comes to money. Gox dollars have no more value than Second Life dollars. I can't see it going more than 1200 (on Bitstamp). And current stagnation makes me really think we could drop lower. Volume is crappy low. No. That's when the end starts. It will be finished on February 32nd New resistance on Bitstamp at precisely 824.4. We have 2hrs and still nobody managed to pass that. My TA shows that it's also a support, effectively blocking the price for another few hrs. anyway, my time's up.no cold stash, hot wallet or exchange USD helped me. major drawback for BTC: the inability to get cash quickly. How about 0.08? I'm doomed. Title sais all. I don't have any idea on how to sell $50 worth of Bitcoin that fast. Any help is welcome.Have Paypal, but I don't know how fast money can arrive. Yes, fail. I wrote the post for 10k holders but then modified it. Anyway, you got my point. It can't reach 10,000. 800 is too high, 10,000 would be insane. Rigid rules get broken. You can instate something like having a few exceptions per day, a limit or so, with a penalty. Ie, while driving, one can skip the duty for 20 minutes (10 times) but has to do 30 jumps consecutively. No downfall today. Maybe on 31st of February? Let's play then  Actually there is... A sports bracelet and one could upload the data at the end of each day. Brilliant!Anyone feel the need to pay for this? For 5 coins, I'd jump every 5 minutes for a month. It would be a healthy habit also. Sadly there's no way to validate that I'd jump so nobody will pay. Do you like to play strange games OP? It was my understanding that we already had a housing crash since the 2008.
I don't find it a good advice for someone to quit his job UNLESS he can do more things than working for sombebody else.I've seen lots of cases when people quit their job to work for themselves and started getting up at 1pm, sipping coffee and reading press until 2pm and then working a bit (just a bit, 'cause hey, if you're your own boss, who can say something to you?).They failed miserably. I find working for somebody else more relaxing, 9-18. When I'm working for myself, each day is a Syberian marathon. And my biggest problem is that when I'm working for myself, nobody's there to help. I'm a whole football team.So, noobs, don't quit your job unless you can and want to do more. Is our friend here, indeed Richard Branson - that Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic? Yes. If anyone would offer me $5000 per bitcoin, and would buy all I have, I'd do it today.Heck, if is anyone that would offer me $3000 I'd also do it. Unfortunately bitcoin is concentrated in just a few hands... So the panic sell only does worse checking bitcoinrichlist.com/top100 positions 80 (also maybe 79) to 98 have the same last transaction in on Dec 25, 2013 11:26:40 PM. Each address holds about 10,000 coins.So somebody owns about 180,000 coins = $145,800,000 Is a no-brainer to put bitcoin at 8M USD, when it's clear (using TA-ROT ASSTROLOGY) that will be valued at most at 5,613,059.37 USD I'm assuming that newcomers that get involved into bitcoin, eventually will integrate into their beliefs some (more or less) of the community's cultsm, including hoarding.So, even if a newcomer buys bitcoins, we could assume he hoars at least 10% for the very long term (+20 years, for nephews or for when they're old). The rest of it can be actively traded, gambled, etc. But some will almost for sure be hoarded, because most bitcoin users are young and can risk 800 bucks for a "my precious" coin.This is a very important aspect as more and more users get into bitcoin, making less and less coins available. I expect that as price get's higher, hoarding is expressed in more decimal points and by less users. My point exactly. How do we know Bitcoin is not an illuminati project, a wolf dressed as sheep? Sorry, no new ATH. Sorry. TRADING IDEA (REFLECT BEFORE ACTING)- if you own 0.1-1 BTC = BUY!- if you own 1-100 BTC = HOLD!- if you own 100-1000 = SELL 2%- if you own 1000-10000 = SELL 5%- if you own 10k or more = SELL 10% True, only stupid or gambler Chinese would wait until the last day. Whoever wanted to sell did so already.  I would say the contrary. Since we broke 750 support, is all the way down to 700 and even 600 if people panic more. And a recovery will be so slow, you'd grow old watching it. Today, January 27th we crossed some lines:- highest sell volume this year- lowest price this yearWhat do you think? Do you know that forecasters, in ancient world, we're entitled to choose their death method if the forecast didn't came true? Just a satire to most of TAs out there... No. I'll hold until I need ALL the money. Even if everything it's $100 USD or 1M. It's nice when bitcoin is going up, but it's even nicer when it goes down. I get to see all those people that think of 10,000 USD, becoming lucid and realizing that  we're 'only' 9300 USD away. And more near to $100. Why an apartment?
Like most experienced cryptocurrency technical analysts, I have used Elliot Wave (EW) theory to pull out of my ass the new target of $960-980 (Bitstamp) by February 1st. Shall this target not be reached, I have a contingency second target of $10-800. This being said, my personal view is that bitcoin is headed to much lower lows. It's a new reminder that TA won't work when there's the real, persistent threat of somebody to unload a few thousand bitcoins. Holders of old BTC will still have a huge amount of fiat in that old BTC. And replace 1M with 1000. And so on? So, we currently are at $800. We need 9200 more dollars to reach $10,000 pe coin.Given the current stagnation, last year's boom and overall bitcoin's performance, how much longer do you think it will take to reach 10,000? I am skeptical it will ever go to that amount. I would be very happy if we get again to 1000 and stay there for quarter.There are some cases of people that preach 100k USD for one BTC, and even 300k. I think it's just delusional. Just think of this: Too many coins are in the hands of just a few people. A price of let's say, even 10,000 will make the 1k BTC holder worth 100 million USD.But, a current BTC holder of 10 BTC will have what? 1 MIL USD? That's nothing. Good money of course, but much more are being made with hardworking companies. I know a small cheap jewelry store chain, (average price 20 USD, 5 stores) that's worth about that.So, we can conclude that even if the price will be 10,000 all those 1 BTC holders will have only some money for a nice trip, 10 BTC holders can pay their debt, and those 100 (which are even rarer) can buy a home, a car, and do some diversification.Mathematically, a price of 300,000 would pay off quite good even for the 1 BTC holder, but the market cap would be immense, almost unreachable. And those current rich guys will be even richer.  So you generate thousands of key pairs to win one with bitcoins inside? Erdogan, great image with that entrance, eye of the needle.Makes you think how you really need to learn Greek and Hebrew if you want to study Bible. As well as some history. Too many words get interpreted. I knew that phrase for a long time and made me thinking since I first read it.The fact is, that sentence with the rich guy is showing something impossible: for a camel to go through the eye of a (sewing) needle.Logically, that's not only not restrictive but impossible. And by saying that rich people are denied to enter His Kingdom, Jesus would contradict himself with all the preaches saying everybody can be saved.So, we could go with something more likeIt would be easier for a/the (alone?) camel to enter the eye of the needle (gate) than the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.I might be wrong but we also need to see if the original word for camel has the same form for plural, we need to check history to see if camels were allowed through those entrances and many things. Lot's of work. I was ironic. I don't trust them.  What are colored coins and coinjoin / stealth addresses? Don't want to hijack your thread but I'm very curious, and asked you on pm also (but no answer*):Don't you feel unsafe with that amount of money in banks? And by real estate, you want one property or a whole building of apartments / condos (investing so you can take rent)*Also don't want to step the line If 1 mBTC will ever be 10, I will do a naked skydive with a huge Bitcoin logo on my parachute and a small Bitcoin logo on my dick.Guys... be realistic. Bitcoin is fun but going at 300,000 will make some people own what? 3,000,000,000!!? And that's just in Bitcoins.Nobody has access to that kind of liquidity. Nobody. Bill Gates is rich, but he has buildings, jets, computers, wallpapers. Everthing is added and sum = his wealth. The problem is that on that website granularity is very bad... I'd like to see more granularity options. Then, we all could make a more in-depth view of btc distribution. I get the incapsula message. Anyone else? It seems it's best to start alone and then have some lessons if needed. Thank you all for advices / suggestions / offers. Isn't this kind of shady? To sue them after you used their products? I smell that's just taking advantage from their mistake / inability to be FFC-compliant.On the other hand, you can sue them if you had damages, let's say your rack burnt down because the miners were faulty. Where can you see that money? High volume in USD is because of the high price. I don't see why could it matter. It seems to me we have the lowest volume in 2 years. January 2014.Any idea what this could mean? Can't see any sign of 10,000. Or of 5000. Or of 2500. OR OF 1250.Not going to happen. 2014 will be a slow year for bitcoin with price of 500-1100.  Right now market is walking cautiously on ice. What until first crack shows up, we'll see then a big explosion, running, fear. 
With 100,000 bitcoins I'd deliver the most advanced business idea ever. But I don't have 100,000 so it's gonna stay as a draft project on my laptop. I understand convenience but what about EUR, CNY and others ?nd what USD price should it use (what exchange)? If this happens it will defeat the purpose of bitcoin. I don't want to see that feature. Why do you need it pegged to USD? Interesting indeed.It goes well with that idea that people do good things, altruistic, for example someone saving a dog stranded on a piece of ice, because one could not bear the pain of not doing anything. So to avoid this pain, he comes to the rescue. Out of egocentricity I have a hunch that the price won't go anywhere soon. Was wondering what people would charge (in BTC) for tutoring in computer programming and if it's feasible to do that by VoIP, Skype etc.PerlPythonRubyPHPC/C++ I need to parse the whole block chain and I don't know how. I need to search for all addresses that have a certain amount of bitcoins (or satoshis).I need someone's help because I have found a very interesting pattern in the blockchain. Having a few million dollars (2-5), a nice home, garden and all is more than one can want. The issue is, what do you do with the excess? How do you use it?That's the good aspect of greed. One could also be greedy to make more money so to have more leverage / power for his projects. If you are implicated in medical research, you'd need shitload of money to continue so you have to want more. I agree, but it's not exactly scamming. You work because you need to. Millions of people would like to work for somebody at this point.Anyway, I just turned communist. No. A global goverment won't be pushed by war but by peace. They don't need to control the free market, they need to make you want use bitcoin. It's like the wolf disguised as sheep. You think you are free, but you aren't.Bitcoin's creator(s) still nowhere to be find, so we don't really know who designed it. All this mass hysteria could lead to so many issues, including a forced adoption of bitcoin as global currency and acceleration towards a global goverment. What was designed for freedom can be changed for enslavement.It could be the case in a few years that nobody could buy or sell without bitcoin. I got what' your saying. I was actually thinking: price is too high to have small transactions because we have to use too many decimals.Anyway, dunno if it's some kind of disorders but sometimes I'm thinking a whole book but write or say only 2 words. I'm in here for quite a while, both in this forum and this planet so I got the chance to study some persons, including myself. I have studied the behavior, beliefs and needs both in pleasant and unpleasant situations. And I have found out that we're ultimately driven by greed. And that's very difficult to control.Now, to be short. My issue is that greed wasn't in the bitcoin ecosystem from the begging. No. First people here, the early adopters (including CPU miners), we're regular people, most of them with no significant wealth. They, we, were here because wanted and needed a change, needed freedom. At those times people would trade 10,000 BTC for a pizza and be happy. But now, things have changed, most early adopters are now rich and they are rich even if they have been scammed for some, lost some while speculating or spent some. They are rich because this thing, greed, came into this system and new people wanted also to be part of this new thing. This made price to go up, and while it goes up, the very early and early users are now filthy rich.But things don't stop here... The first ones or the ones that had lots of fiat and were able to buy thousands, are now the most richest 500 owners, controlling about 35% of all bitcoins. Let's leave the ones that bought many coins just recently, they were already rich. Let's focus on the first ones, the ones that "traded" in the single digits, the early adopters and miners. Most of them have been corrupted in such way they forgot that they found about bitcoin because of passion and desire for better and not for money, they forgot that they were poor (or at least not wealthy) when they started. And the problem with that, is that we have lost good men in favor of speculative business and fade businesses that bring nothing in the world, but only take. And now, new people, driven out of greed, hope prices of 10,000 dollars this year, because they own a few coins and thus would have more dollars. But, think of the few-tens-of-thousands owners. They'll be even richer but without any direction, because most of their wealth is won not worked. They now started businesses (exchanges, precious metals, shops) to gather more wealth. Some of them got into mind-twisting schemes, taking advantage from other people, manipulating markets and doing such maneuvers.I'm not being philosophical about the taste of the bread you worked in the mine for but I'm trying to point out that with great power, really comes great responsibility. And not the responsibility of feeding children of Africa but the responsibility of not feeding your ego.In the end, my opinion is that wealth distribution in this ecosystem is too concentrated in a few hands and needs more dispersion before we move to higher levels. We need a solid economy, based on goods and services and not on speculation. Speculation is pure greed and brings nothing. Bitcoin can't hit more than 2000 because there are too many bitcoin hoarded (not hoarders). Simply put, going to 10,000, will make some people that own 10k to have more than 100 million dollars overnight. And the FBI to have 1.4 bln. USD. Do you want that? Because I don't. Volume does gets lower and lower but I really don't see any price increase. It might at one point, but not for long. I suspect we have in circulation have 1/4 or even 1/5 of the coins (exchanges, trading etc.) I think you over-evaluate the effects of negative news. Their power is not enough to push price to $1-2. But 100s is definitely a target for 2014. Hopers... Of course, a multi-month stagnation would be very good for the economy. And for some people's health, they won't loose nights to watch bitcoinity anymore. Given the huge price increase in 2013 and the way 2014 started, with a sharp rise to ~1000 and long rest time in the 800s, I'm speculating that we'll see more price stabilization and less ups/downs for a looong time.Anyway, price is too high for regular people to buy, too high to be used in small transaction like pizza and distribution of majority is in the hands of just a few people.Check this:http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top500You'll see positions 33-36 (4 addresses) and 38, 40, 43, 44, 45 each one with ~30,000 coins, all wallets with last transaction in on Dec 20, 2013 9:07:23 PM. This means about 250,000 coins held by a single entity.You'll also see positions 79-98 (20 addresses) with about 10,000 coins each, last tx in on Dec 25, 2013 11:26:40 PM. Total is about 200,000 coins.If we sum first 500 address, that means 4,364,182 BTC. I'm assuming less than 50 people control these 4 million coins.This mean scarcity and scarcity means high price. High price means less buyers and less buyers mean less volatility. Welcome to 2014, year of bitcoin stagnation.
So you can loose 8 BTC if you're not careful to sent those back to yourself?? Check to see if your password manager somehow updates the password db automatically in the cloud. How many coins did you had in there?I would suggest to mirror the entire drive and check maybe for previous versions of the wallet, without a password. If you had any.Good luck! Seems that is already broken. Great initiative! checking bitcoinrichlist.com/top100 positions 80 (also maybe 79) to 98 have the same last transaction in on Dec 25, 2013 11:26:40 PM. Each address holds about 10,000 coins.So somebody owns about 180,000 coins = $145,800,000 It's a very good project Andrew and it looks nice. Kudos to your coding.I have been thinking and it would be great to further develop this:1. user input wallet range for better granularity in Bitcoin Distribution by Address (ie search % of address that have 20-30 BTC).2. even more user input ranges, to create custom tables (ie 10-12, 12.01-15, 15.01-20)3. Search for an address position4. Order by last transaction in or out time5. Some algo I can't think of, to sort addresses by similar content (ie 30.3) and with last transaction in/out in the same day (I have noticed many addresses with the same exact last tx in/ou time, up to seconds)6. open source. Great job! It's ok. Next step, slow death of exchanges while local bitcoin markets grow in every city, further penetrating societies. This will be a good thing. You'll see there some good price stabilization.  What did Blitz say? What's about? Yes. There is a saying (actually a solid business principle):When all the people search for gold, sell hammers and pans. Do you guys believe me that if bitcoin reaches 100, i'll buy 10?If it reaches 10, I'll buy 100If it reaches 1 I'll buy 1000 and take loan for $9000 so I can buy 9000? Just for historical purposes.  What do you mean? I don't understand, sorry. Miners have been too profitable for too long. It's ok for them to have smaller revenues. Too many just became wealthy out of this.Also, mining in current setup harms BTC, because they mine in pools. Let the solo mining begin (again)! His words, condensed: bitcoin is very very over-speculated Holding is double-edged sword. It can be good, creating scarcity BUT the rest of the still traders decide the path, up or down. And then, some of the holders (even if it's just 5%) will rush to sell as price goes down.It's the same like holding cash. I'm a cash holder now. Multumesc, dar cred ca e cam devreme.

Reviving this thread because it suits well today. Price is taaanking boys. Sell now! it's gonna blooow![imagine this with a pirate accent] No. Bitcoin will never be 300k Breaking news. About 5 minutes ago a major selloff occured, effectively taking out 10% of the market cap. Could this be the moment of a market turn? Will the market get into a prolonged bear stage? Will we discuss with one of the most prolific technical analyst, Sato ShinakaStay tuned for more, on BTCTV, after commercials.[commercials][even more commercials]Reporter: Mr. Sato Shinaka, we all saw the rapid growth of bitcoin in 2013. Do you think that it will make new highs in 2014 as well?Mr. Shinka: No. ... Bet me 1 coin I could show you how to live with exact 1M? April is so last year and 3 bubbles behind. I guess too many ppl have 100 coins and wait for 10,000 so they call themselves millionaires.If you guys reach 1M, think of this: that kind of money is JUST ENOUGH for a great life for you and your loved ones. I can go into details but I'm not sure anyone will listen. But that "market cap" is meaningless.Imagine what would happen if 50% of all bitcoins currently in exchanges go to cold wallets. Suddenly, supply is halved.On the same reasoning, if only me, Johnny and another 8 guys trade coins and everybody else waits for a bigger price (let's say 1M USD / coin), then we could make the price 8000 USD / BTC and say the market cap is 100 B. Which is not true.  Up again! What kind of rollercoaster is this? CRASH! On uptrend "market forecasters" and "TA analysts" appear like mushrooms after rain.And they get lots of sheepfollowers CRASH! IMPORTANT MILESTONE AHEAD: 30day high is about to be attacked on both Stamp and Gox. too insane to last. Hi. I want a glass of red wine. You guys realize that this is INSANE again right? Huge correction waits...
You mean this:resembles this? Panic buy has started.Train is leaving the station.Bitcoin gains +100 USD in 3 days.People are screaming "to the moon!" (aka "+10,000 in Q1")But where is the non-speculative part of this economy? Let me get this right... OP wants other people to loose part of their wealth because and then have bitcoin rise again just because he doesn't have balls to buy at current price?Wouldn't OP be better off if he would just buy in now and want only the price to rise? just asking: So, when's the crash? I'd say, priti impressive rally for the start of 2014.I hope it will last a few days... Gox is stupid. Why would I want to pay more for a BTC and never be able to withdraw my money? I wonder how many coins does Proudhon has and what's his real reason for saying bearish.Because sometimes I also write bearish posts just because I need bulls to counter me and tell me what I need to hear: bitcoin = quazzilion!Note: Sometimes The network as a whole is consuming too much electricity to mine and the hashing provides nothing (but bitcoins) See http://bitcarbon.orgMost mining equipment won't serve any purpose after their hashrate is obsolete.The Pareto Principle is even worse than in fiat currencies as only a handful of people control a large chunk of the bitcoins.Bitcoin is overspeculated and very little used as a currency (it's intended purpose).Bitcoin is hard to undestand and use even for 60 years old iPad-capable grandma.Bitcoin is even harder to trade for non-tech people (also due to high price, satoshis and mBTC).This and previous statement might throw bitcoin to a niche that is almost fullfilled.Trading in centralized exchanges almost entirely defeats the purpose of Bitcoin (also by using banks).Market cap is irrelevant as that money is not the real money in the bitcoin ecosystem.----The whole bitcoin thing blows my mind.It is both value-less (because it cannot be used at anything) and valuable (because everybody wants it)Everybody wants it because it's the best speculative instrument but nobody really wants to spend it (hodl for 1000 years).Hoarding it makes it even more valuable as very few early adopters really exit it (unlike pyramid schemes)Because nobody really exits bitcoin and nobody uses it at anything makes it valuable and makes everybody want it. in what way is the market cap relevant? no way 1 BLN USD got into BTC during last week. It's based purely on speculative price rise. C'mon guys, be realistic... No way we can go beyond 2000 this year...I do not understand why people think logarithmic. From 100 to 1000 it's a ten-fold increase but just 900 usd growth. 900 usd growth from here would bring us at ... 1600. And gold parity will be a major battle. "Parents can restrict kids from buying alcohol or tobacco""LEAs can restrict certain persons from buying chemicals"etc..But then, kids still smoke and drink, terrorist still make bombs.  It should be interesting to discuss also those second-generation cryptocoins that the whole world speaks of. Would they dethrone Bitcoin? I want to create an altcoin for economic studies and some testing (51% attack etc). It will be used in a closed environment, by me and friends but anyone can join freely. I want it to help introducing bitcoin to others, like a test coin.I want it to be CPU-mined only, 1 million max. If anyone can program and wants to help me, please post your price here.  you mean you sat on too much fiat too long  Let's get past 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 etc and I'll start to believe. I think one would be checking it letter by letter. Not sure if it helps, but I'd do it. I think we're doing it wrong. I think there will be a time when paper won't be able to buy bitcoin, thus making Bitcoin a global currency. And if we have a global currency, I bet we'll have a global government. And, what if, what if, this global goverment would endorse bitcoin in such way buying or selling is permitted only with bitcoins? Romanians trying to earn free money. I the bitcoin world, crashes and trends that took years in the stock market, now take at most a few weeks. Quote my words, bitcoin is superluminal.  Wrong. Stabilize to 600 - dump. Stabilize to 300 - dump. Stabilize to 150 - dump. Nothing else to dump - Buy Buy Buy! - Price at insane levels again.
January 2015 right? So, since nobody knows how many coins are lost, the market cap we see in the media is irrelevant.One could also count cold storage wallets as lost. Those wallet don't bring anything to the bitcoin economy / ecosystem. Therefore, bitcoin's ecosystem is unique, never seen before and I think lots of surprises are in for us... Amcoin therefore CRASH! the problem is that I wasn't strong. I sold at 50s or so because of fear. And then it went back up so I rebought at 100s or so.I lost because I was a weak hand. Should I have been strong, nothing would have affected me.  Oh my, it's so vivid. I remember how my bitcoin stash went to a fourth. Anyway, since then I played only 10% and the rest I'll hold until I need them. And as long as I can work, I won't sell. Sell just 50% goddamit... Short term memo: price going down. Next stop 600-610 Let's keep a moment of silence in advance for Mtgox death. It will no longer be with us this time next year...Done! I'll buy them from you at 300, ok? not Wait more. Ok, what's up with China??? Fiatleak shows massive transactions there. Exactly. When was that? True, but one doesn't really loose until they sell. I for one have a clear target and won't sell even if it goes 100 lol. I wouldn't sell this time even if it went to $2000. Why? Because of the high volatility. Too many loose scenarios:A few of them.1. I sell at 2000, it rallies more up and I buy like a piglet only to crash down to 200.2. I sell at 2000, it crashes to 200, and I buy like a piglet becase it's "cheap"3. I sell at 2000 and swings like a hog adding uncertainty. I hodl. If price goes anywhere near $100, hundreds of people will rush to buy tens of coins each.If price goes anywhere near $10, thousands of people will rush to buy hundreds of coins each.If price goes anywhere near $1, tens of thousands of people will rush to buy thousands of coins each.if price goes anywhere near $0.1, hundreds of thousands of people will rush to buy tens of thousands coins each.See my point? I think I don't care about btcchina or it's fate. They acted too much as a star and did too much harm with their 0 fee policy.  magic
China is out. Bitcoin is not for pussies that listen to their government.  But when is the first worst time to buy? This dump brought me 4 shiny coins and I am now putting them in another cold wallet.  Bitcoin needs lots of rest now on hospital bed after it was raped by greedy "speculators" and "investors". The price has almost 0 chances to go up again so better prepare for some halving in price again.Merry xmas. How does it feel to be mocked by the masses just before xmas? What? But what happened in china exactly?  Holding too and reinforcing positions. I also suggest a holder's party. But what if one was a piglet and bought all at 1000+ and now has no cash to buy? Bye-buy cost averaging. But it won't be. Too much speculation. How many times can you re-inflate the same used condom? For me it's ok. But some people really lost it all. I guess we're about to stay at some bottom for a period of time. What do you say? Well, let's thank to all the fuckheads that speculated in such a way they played bitcoin like a videogame. I hope all die painfully. Meanwhile, holding. But these bubbles are not sane for the economy and some people should be executed and put to pay for the bullet. And if their cranium is too hard and the bullet won't terminate them, they should be let to agonize because it's recession and no money for more bullets. Actually we should count unused coins too. Yes, bitcoin is too hot to trade right now and too expensive to buy (one, but you can go with 0.1 as well) and too volatile to be called an investment.Too speculated to be reliable and with uncertain creators. This puzzles me most and makes me seriously consider SELLING ALL. What if bitcoin is a damn socioeconomic experiment made by some occult group with the main agenda of creating the mark of the beast (666 and stuff).Makes me think I was played. Was fleeing out of govt. control and microchips and now... So we're about to see a nice new drop with these news? I just regained my inside peace and sleep with the recent boring period in bitcoin. Thanks! Chinese want cheap coins I guess. I have bought at 755. But only because I sold yesterday at 850. Fortunately didn't bought some at 1100... If one is stupid enough to sell for cash, at least sell for something that is very important (food, shelter, health). And I understand Christmas, good family time etc, but at least don't screw it with cheap Chinese products or expensive American iphones. Bitcoin is stupid enough to be driven to 10k with no more than 50M USD
Day trading is gonna help you to loose your coins and it's gonna help me buy more, cheaper. Win-win scenario, Somebody bought to many bitcoins, eh? I don't trust this growth, therefore bull trap.  Bitcoin = best drug ever. Show us! Actually, lol... I meant BELOW. Check the graph... I have read your post and was thinking that you might be right and I might loose all sticking with Bitcoin... And went to eMunie http://emunie.com/how-it-worksLOL. It's just another for-get-rich coin. Bring something better to the bitcoin protocol and I'll switch. Meanwhile, if people don't like, please don't use it.  I saw this image perhaps 1000 times but only now, after I drank a bottle of wine it struck me: there is a "mean" line there... upwards! Problem is that 2012-2013 was well above the mean... Damn speculators... Oh well, what comes easy, goes easy. This is what one of my friends said yesterday. He had 10,000 litecoins from the early days but failed to copy his wallet before reinstalling Windows. Gladly he saved all the DLLs from Program Files...  You need money / wealth / silver / gold etc if you want to help other. For yourself, I bet a good knife will do anything: food, shelter, security etc Actually no true prophet should shit on themselves if they know the outcome. Just stand steady in the breeze, watching the same movie played in their minds before.. Sold 5%. Am I still balls of steel? Going to revisit 600s soon. If we go lower, we will also retest 551. If it fails, more downside.Fear! What do you mean by purrfect? I panicked so I'm out 5% and already have too much fiat zeros in my exchange account. Now I'm panicked about the fiat.50% is good, but yields some risks. Piglets usually go out 90-100% Damn, we're up at $700 This crash goes well in hand with my favorite song:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw I know BTC is not banned. But what's the point trying to illuminate the piglets? You can't. So let there be blood. I don't have any single idea. I'll wait for the pigs to get tired and in the small rest timeframe I'll look too see if the slautherhause has enough meat or just stopped to sharpen the blades.
I want to tell a bedtime story to those little piglets out there:it was $16 in January. You were thinking that $1200 is "reasonable". What if there's boogie man that made the price climb over the months, helped by you piglets buying of course? And the dumped all coins?boo! I'm not speaking of lost coins in the last 2 days. Any single lost coin EVERAnyway, I sense the smell of fear in the air. It's the fear of the piglets going to slaughter. They are all over, screaming and crying because they lost their "investment" which had the potential of making them quazillionaires with just 0.1 coins! By New Year's Eve.And now, they're unloading their coins so we can buy them cheaper. Truly piglets! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!For everyone who lost a single coin, this is the price we pay for being naughty and speculating. Santa won't bring to 2000s this year for sure. Wouldn't it be nice if kids stopped acting like "investors" and "traders" and really got a job, buying just a few coins (not in such mindless manner, with loans) and just let bitcoin do the job?Bitcoin is overspeculated right now. Sure, we can make some money. But its fiat. And I'm not here for fiat. It's interesting to see how much wealth evaporated in the last 48 hours. Tragedy of the commons anyone?I'll just stick to this thread because it has a silly name and nobody will read it. So I'm gonna post interesting stuff here and I invite others to do the same  620 to be tested in the next hour or so, leading way to 600s. I wonder where this line stops. If you put it on the graph to include the upward movement it will look like /\Maybe it tries do draw something?                                     ______________________________                  /                 /                //\/\/\/\/\/\/ $646 is gonna be tested soon. The next World War won't be like 1st and 2nd. It's gonna either be nuclear either is gonna be economical, cyber OR a combination of those. I can see 50, but anything lower than $20 will stigmate bitcoin forever. You cannot go down to 20 from 1200 and then rise up again like a little flower in the rays of sunshine, smiling and waving your fragile leafs in the breeze, with multicolored butterflies around you.You can't. I must say, I'm amazed with the speed bitcoin has. It's somewhat understandable, it's one of it's kind in the speed and technology era. So, of course crashes happen faster than what we saw at stock market and of course there's a grain of normality in prices climbing so fast.Also, since more and more people hear the word bitcoin (even if in bad news) this means even more speed for bitcoin. So I presume this crash / correction / bear market won't be long term.I mean, you can't have omelet without breaking some eggs right? Eggs (balls) are being broken all over since the rise from 130, ups and downs. "investors" - i LOL at this word.2/3 of the investors and speculators are loosing their money right now, because they bought frenetically at over 800 (most at over 1000) People just try to buy back lower. But it's a shitty experience for some, cause they loose. Anyway, bitcoin went from 100 to 1000 and it's all i need. It proved it's power to me (speculated or not, doesn't matter) I just hope people with too much coins offloaded some and they will enjoy cocktails on a beach. We need wealth redistribution more than ever. This crash is good, we need it. Also, I hope weak hands are shaken out. I'm referring here on weak hands of those guys that took loans, sold their homes, their wifes etc. They don't deserve to be here. There are some buyers that risked, but still holding.Third, bitcoin looks bad with these crashes, but is also bad with price doubling weekly. Monday morning, media WILL crucify bitcoin so prepare for more. I know there will be a day when those mainstream fuckers won't have any impact on bitcoin. Until then, holding. I want to enjoy bitcoin at it's maximum, when it's used as currency (skip exchanges and banks), when the network it's so big that even if they ban it we can work. Even if i'll be 100 yrs old Yes, the speculators, the "traders" and all... The rest, who sold calmly for profit, or bought by faith are safe.The ones that were frenetic, making loans to buy coins are burned. Not being to sorry for them, everyone has to learn the lesson. I did also learned it.Today, many lost their coins. Let's keep a moment of silence for our fallen playground comrades. Anyone willing to lobby against MtGox, with me? They should have faced some jail already. They are so incompetent it's illegal. Did that long time ago.  Please don't spread this. We need weak hands do sell. Sorry, I want to buy lower. No intention to panic. I hope you guys can catch the bottom. Nope, I don't want out.
100% out? +1 If I haven't sold at 1242 what's the point on selling now? Or at $500. or at $100? or at $1? I will bet him a full round coin if he wants. And if I win, I'll send you the equivalent of 2 beers in bitcoin. It's never a bad thing to have the price at 500. We can buy more. I think you talk about something you don't know and spreading  FUD. OMG! Please forgive my ignorance, but why does it have do go so much down? This chart implies sub $10 prices. I doubt this will happen.  Because you know, you researched, right? Well, I hope the devs will make a PR stunt and pull Bitcoin out of beta soon. That will make some hair to grow on some arses. I am very focused on being the last strong hand. Even if it takes 0 profit, 50+ years. You will see that bitcoin is tough, is the tank of economy. It will survive. Actually, I'd be very surprised if we will enter a bear market from now. There's an influx of emotional noobs lately and I find it futile to communicate with them. If you're in since $30, you've been here enough to understand. As for your concern, I do not think they'll slowly sell. They are gonna make an auction after the trial. Also, even if they ban it, prohibit it, etc, the value will go down temporarily, as a consequence. But then the price will go massively up. Wrong! didn't bought.And you keep thinking of speculation, while I was talking about payment methods and all How much BTC do you have? Because it seem you're new to it. Very interesting. This will have negative implications on the bitcoin ecosystem BUT, rest assured, the weak ones are being shaken.For the rest of us, $1 BTC is fine. Or even litecoin, but I don't see it gaining that much traction to be recognized and accepted. What strikes me is that at a certain time in 2010 I told some people to buy $10 worth of bitcoin and they weren't so optimistic. I guess sheep have to see price increase in order to believe. DISCLOSURE: The only reason I didn't buy that pizza (I was there when the offer was made) is because I didn't have $20 Awfully wrong. Bitcoin price has been manipulated and is manipulated even today so price DOESN'T MATTER! What matters is you taking your own decisions w/o emotions. And right now you're biased by the price-effect emotions, you hope and want it to go 10,000 a btc.I recommend investing just $100,000. It's more than you can afford right now. Yes, now because you asked, I will share the secret: bitcoin will rise to 42,000. It's actually 42,802, a number which is hardcoded cryptographyally in the first blocks ever mined. The message satoshi left. Today is the best example on how people are uninformed and uniformable sheep, retweeting erraticaly everything and panicking with thousands of dollars invested "in the new paradigm" I just banned OP. 
Getting tired of morons that think China banned anything today. I never trusted anyone that goes full in the water without dipping their toe first. China did this with bitcoin, they went fanatic and all. If their destiny is to sell, then SELL (to me and my fellow friends on this forum) Knife or Sword,Mark my word:Cash won't holdCoin will work.Right now I do not care about the price, it's the best time to increase bitcoin holdings. So, for all you guys giving advice to others to "sell": Rest away. If you have anything to sell, I will buy. I will take those burden of coins off of you. Sorry, can't type too much, I'm busy here selling and buying back lower. My only goal: profit on this turmoil and increase bitcoin stash. When we're back at 1000s and sideways, I'll be back posting. Last 1 week I did an analysis of this forum. I have never seen such sentiment in the market It's bullish, but not unreasonable bullish. I would call it realistic.Most of the people here agree crashes will be with us for a long time, but a steady decline to lower 200s has a very tiny probability. And also nobody wants 10-fold increases monthly. So mass conscience is speaking, we just have to listen it.  With all this media negative hype in China, I'll buy more. Bitcoin belongs to the people. We, all, each one of us has the power over bitcoin. Not fucking central banks, US senate, RT, or Bloomberg. OMG! So Chinese Bank did what any sane governmental entity would do : Say that bitcoin can have negative uses too.Oh, wow, better sell all our coins for this.  I actually started reading ALL your posts 2 days ago. And doing some background checks on you. Care to explain? I have some counter arguments I think bitcoin will go down but will very quickly recover. Very hort term is bearish in this case, but medium term == strongly bullish. Actually stock market going down is bullish for bitcoin. So all the weak hands lost to strong hands I like the pharmaceutical-like comments on that website! I think you're susceptible to loosing most of your bitcoins if you daytrade them. What do you mean a strong sell is 30%? That's loosing more! If you live in 1st world country, I'd say 5 mil USD are more than enough.  Bitcoin is revolutionary. It could go to 0.1 USD and I'm sure some geeks (like me) would still use it. Altcoins do suck and are created only for profit, but I'd still use bitcoin if it would reach 0.01 USD. Id have to buy 10,000 for the VPN service, but I'd still use BTC What makes you think bitcoin is a scam? so, have you sold some BTC, rpietilla? I can see the Greed right there, wanted to sell a coin for fiat at 1243 but we went only at 1242. Greed! Massive energy has been released. The market is relieved, I can feel it. More ATH very probable. 
What's wrong with being a weak hand? They will either learn the lesson, or go with their money in fiat. Just one question: Has anyone of our forecasters, technical analysts etc been able to see the move from 100s to 1000s? Thank you, but I could argue here that I'm very selfish. I cannot withstand knowing that people near me live without basic conditions. I know that quote even in latin, but I don't get why you put it... OMG! Nice. Bitcoin took scamming to the next level. So 1300 will have lots of meanings:1. More than gold2. About 1000 3. 10 times bigger than the start of the rally.I think it's a milestone. It has begun What business do you have? If I may ask.Ideal business is one that you take from 0. Like having a small rented apartment, learn, make money, learn more, move to regular office, hire etc. I do not trust business started with large capitals and lot's of employees. I mean, it's like a baby. You coinceve it, but it cannot be 10. Has to grow organically. Didn't Bitcoin started as a new paradigm? So those things may not apply. The 8hr a day worked for somebody else is a form of slavery, but many people need it. And you cannot simply want to run a business without working first.I recently saw a man, with a pretty big business who told me he has to sell a part of it, because it's so big he cannot manage it alone. He need know-how on modern corporations and he lacks that because he didn't worked a single day. Actually this thread is interesting and needs more input. Makes you think "What is enough?" and "What do I need to be happy?"I read a psychological survey, which I agree with, that states that after a certain wealth level money do not impact happiness. I think it's true, once you have a home, stashed money, car and maybe a self-sustainable life, business. After this level it's only greed or altruism can be your partners. Either you spend on hookers, yachts and fast cars, either you save every penny, literally, and use it for some great project.There are lots of things that can be done: cancer research, industry, ecology etc. You need solid money and solid money politics for that. I think a man should work at 8hrs a day for somebody else or more than 8hr a day for himself. Retiring on a beach is not a good thing to do. It can have serious consequences on one's mind and body. Saw some cases with people with lots of money who lost it... What happens if you get ignored an you cannot open new stupid threads every day? I was thinking some time ago that bitcoin is a must have for tech-junkies. Maybe not trade and all, but definitely many of them will want to have something like 0.1-0.5 on their Iphone for "emergency" or in a secret stash, on an encrypted card along with a few hundred bucks, a silver bullion or two, and whatever they saw in James Bond. And I'm not making fun, I think it's a good thing for everyone to have some. My experience tells me I shouldn't look at the bid/asks. They can change anytime. I have this theory one doesn't need much to live happy: a home, a car, some emergency money, silver and BTC of course. I'd never quit work and I would start a business BUT I am on my own. I have nobody that could help me. Yes, right now I am a bear but long term I'm bull. And I'm a pig also because I do not want to sell until 10,000. And also I'm stupid because I plan to help some poor friends / relatives with most of my bitcoin.If I'd stop now, my life would have a great advantage. But no, my brain decided I'm not good/knowledgeable/mature/experienced enough to play with big money. It said that I have to differentiate between "needs" and "wants" and live a modest life. I wonder if I'm doing it right or I'll epically fail.  If it does go beyond 1300 it will surely go higher. If not, correction will come- Make it more interesting. Put it 2014 I subscribe. Awesome!
I recently saw people comparing Bitcoin with stocks and I think it's a huge mistake, bitcoin is money actually and right now in a massive speculative bubble. Also, we tend to forget bitcoin is exclusively created in the era of the internet, exclusively for internet and that means only one thing: SPEED. Speed in adoption, Sped in growth and Sped in crashing. Now, what about the mass hysteria? Bitcoin it's innovation, it's genius, it's freedom. There will be a moment in the next few years when everybody will hear about it and want it, at least 0.001, regardless the price. I sincerely think that in a medium term future we will witness mass hysteria in 2 waves: 1st will buy the average traders/investors (I think right now most of them are the top ones, with some experience and money to spare) and 2nd, most powerful, when average peasant will buy.That will be a hella of a ride. It will be almost the same as average people own gold today. Not as 99.99 1-oz bullion, but as necklaces and jewelries of 5-gram. I expect these people won't afford to spend more than $200-1000, so lots of digits after the decimal in their wallet.0.005 or something At least you sold LTC at the top. Abount 270 dollars to go! Let's see if it breaks it this (week)end. I too heard some TV stations mentioning bitcoin without being ever a subject on their news.  Yet another noob that knows all but spells "bit coin" Hard-forked?  LOL Thank you for this my friend. Litecoin is clearly in the bubble stage and I don't think litecoin holders are mostly strong hands. I should buy us some beer when it pops. Good point notme. Thanks.  LTC will be soon be in an epic MF bubble. When all the smart lads get their money, they'll rush to their first love: Bitcoin.I do not expect a LTC crash to be followed by a BTC crash. Since history tends to repeat itself, I think you know what I expect. Also from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 it's a 100% increase but to get there price would have to go like what, about $5 per minute non-stop for 4 months. Interesting... 60 views and no post. Has this market turned bear? Because I will know what to do: buy! and then buy more! What about bitstamp? or btce? why only coinbase counts? I hope they won't do that until the next major milestone, ounce of gold.  I'm no bull but I'm wondering if we could get into such massive speculative bubble and new money that will make a gigantic leap in price.I'm taking $1,300 as a starting point because it's more than the next major milestone, an ounce of gold. This will certainly make media buzz and the frenzy could begin. Very rapidly for me would mean somewhere between 1 to 4 months.  I expect and wish a top at about 1200. It's mind blowing how much it did go up.  We should keep track of these kind of stories. 700s I'd say. Yes it is unsustainable. Think of 4k coins daily and the money needed to buy all of those. Actually, the price could go up some more or sideways for a few weeks. But bubblepop's time will come... Sadly... I wish I'd have your optimism, kid.
I was your age. You weren't mine yet. So I know how you think and I can tell you this:Open up your computer, open your exchange and put a sell order at spot price that would equal your withdrew school funds BUT DON'T EXECUTE IT YET. Bring your parents, explain them what you did and if they feel uncomfortably at any time execute the order and get the money back. Keep the rest in an offline wallet. Maybe you'll loose half of the coins but you'll win your parents. Move 3.1 BTC from there, anywhere. Yes, good advice. They might not be able to understand bitcoin as you did so cash out and keep the rest. Don't be fooled by the recent price inflation. It can go down. Doubletop and then Bubblepop? Exactly what we needed! More speculation! Wall Shit morons That's not a bit, that's a lot! I don't understand why people sell and then are bears. Can't you just be bear without selling? Without hoping it will go down? And just expecting to go down? Pay me 0.15 BTC to write a script that filters out everything with "bitcoin" on the webbrowser and then a 0.1 BTC fee for unlocking for like 15 mins. Wannabe millionaires... Why it lags? DDoS? Somewhat true. Is what I thought when it went from 1 to 31.   I think we're somewhere at the middle of the S curve, almost to the top. Interesting analysis but can't believe in prices more than let's say 1500 (a top followed by bubblepop at about 500-600)But if price goes there, I'll buy that website. Careful with this. Doesn't matter how much money you have. You should never stop working / learning. This is what defines a character. What happened? Is somebody arbing? Hey OP. I think that would be me. Contrary to popular belief I never sold to buy lower (when I did, I used the fun-money, not funds I wouldn't afford to loose)I don't trust these high prices but I do profit on them.  Yes, and this happened many times. Even if the price then just went down further, people did panic buy before. 500k?? Insane... Who is gonna sell at 750? Me! Me! If price soars 750 on bitstamp people should sell a kidney, do 2-3 mortgages, take some loans, sell their car and buy Bitcoins!
Bull trap? Strange how the gap between MtGox and Bitstamp narrows. I noticed this happens before a rally. Before a crash the gaps are bigger. I'm not prepared for the new influx of buyers!!! What do I do? What do I do?   Too good to be true. My paranoia says they have some hidden agenda.  Exactly. How many do hold gold? Or silver. PS: Why am i using critical mass wrong?  I don't know if this was discussed but I am not joking. With the current 10 minutes or so waiting time, blockchain size increasing, there's no way bitcoin will be use for microtransactions (although the crowd decided how much money sends and for what purpose).What if bitcoin will be a niche, serving cryptogeeks, nerds, libertarians and maybe some "speculators". We could see a critical mass achieved soon, maybe even this year with all the media hype, US senate debate etc. Once critical mass is there, price will flat-line. Won't matter who gets in and out, it will be some kind of equilibrium. Not all people would want bitcoin or know what to do with it. OP, you long pressed your "0" too much and have 2 0s more. Still, price is insane. Dropping and climbing like that is not healthy.  12M USD! let me open the fiat faucet! I'm pouring into gox! All bubble's burst and then recovered quickly. But only to be followed by a bearish trend. What country? USA? I don't think so, CSPAN is kinda niche. Not everyone watches it. I'd say critical mass is here for bitcoin. And 21,000,000 BTC should be sufficient for all of us. (don't tie this to Bill Gates) What island? Can I visit you?? For 2 yrs? You are the true bitcoin user, supporter and contributor. Like the guy with 10,000 BTC pizza. Cheers! No, I got back in up to 400s and sold at 700s.   Somebody bought the coins I sold at 750? I was screaming the last 2 weeks "bubble" and nobody listened. People were delusional, thinking of new paradigms, prices of 10,000 USD and so on. But history repeated, bubble popped and lots of people are now at a loss. Sadly, that's the name of the overspeculation game. I believe prices of more than 250 are unsustainable and we will eventually get even lower. China is not buying, it's speculating. It's playing. Chinese are mostly gamblers, not investors. So, see ya at 300s Chinese always used things in other ways than intended. See gunpowder for example, they were using it for fireworks until the rest of the world started to use it for guns. LOL    AAAND THE CRASH WILL BE HARD!
Could this be it? Investors and lots of money getting in? Maybe after lurking and stagnating on the exchanges?Or a fucking insane bubble? I am becoming more and more convinced that a crash won't happen anytime soon.  INSANE/ LOOOOOOOOOL. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? I just cashed out for capital repairs of my home. Damn, if this was all the crash we get and all bearish sentiment is relieved now, guess what... More upside! With capital MORE I have sold at 600 on MtGox and all my buy orders went full in at 550. Nice. Thank you noobs for tha coins. Bubblepop! HAAHAHAHAHA! TOLD YA! Gox is insane. Don't assume event for 1 second the price is real. They have 2-mo waiting periods for withdrawal of fiat. I am here. I wonder how you'd do that because I was thinking this myself. You know, secure the wallet, training for family members and how the official document would look like. This bubble keep inflating and inflating. I wonder how it will pop. Oh, I know. Hard and violent! 573 lol. People still follow Gox? That exchange is f-ed up! Historic moment lads. Congrats and please don't let it crash! Ussain Bolt fast I don't think it's a pyramid-scheme because early adopters can sell anytime thus newcomers become the new early adopters. No more pyramid than gold. I think both are too high prices for one coin. And I also think dividing bitcoin will not catch. People want one bitcoin, not satoshis or mBTC. And a 'satoshi' is a serious denomination?  Waiting for Bitstamp to erode or vanish that wall so we can breach 450. After this, 500. BIG milestone and to be honest I don't care if it retraces to 250, it's has proven it's power to me.
+480 Aren't there some 250,000 users of bitcoin? You only fuckup if you sell cheaper. Don't blame yourself for being critical and not risk money. EVER. 350 I do not trust those guys, or their fund. I want bitcoin in people's wallets, not exchanges, ETFs, IFNs, FUDs, MILFs or anything, For me it's 4.7 coins FUD. Why you guys keep feeding this kid so much bullishitness? It's a good investment, but don't tell him he will be some Bill Gates.At most I'd say he can have 25,000 USD out of this. AT MOST. Still good. Hello Billy! I love it when I'm right! Isn't that news from 2 years ago? And I haven't saw many Chinese buying. I presume there a handful of rich speculators on bttchina. offtopic; Does anyone have an estimate on how many bitcoin users are out there? at least traders on Gox / stamp / china This frugality is to admire. It's clear he enjoyes doing business and money are a side-effect of winning. But he could surely invest some more into tech, his offices are full of CRT monitors. Use LCD goddamit, they're more power efficient. And he could also change his old car. By any means I'm not attacking you, but everyone thinks the same. The ultimate goal is fiat. Hello there Would be nice to compute what's the average sum he invested so far in any given stock and apply that to bitcoin, to see how much he would have. Source? Do you think this will happen? I'd love the guy to own some 10,000 coins. Or is he too old for this thing?Does anyone knows if he publicly mentioned anything about bitcoins?mod edit to correct misleading title 266 to 60 is not big? I don't know where it could crash to, but I think it will top at about 500-520. I was thinking of the possibility of a new crash to come this weekend. Seems to me that the recent growth is too big to be sustained, it's really exponential! 
Holding is damn hard when you have to pay in fiat to live. Bitcoin can't be used for that so far. Until somebody manages to make a killer app or implement it so I can buy things, it's just a very good speculative instrument. And for me that is like taking your wobber out and pissing on bitcoin's ideology.Bitcoin is gonna crash soon as everybody cares either for more fiat either for more fiat (you can see screamers saying they want more coins but in fact they want more coins to have more fiat)Game over. This is where I see the problem. Nobody from the masses will afford 1 BTC. Maybe not even half btc. Fucking speculators. They destroyed bitcoin.  I am so confident that price will stop at 600, I'll sell 70-80%And buy back at 400 or less Price is going down! I do think that the price is INFLATED Bitstamp is closing in to the price of Mtgox. This means CRASH! 533... It's psychological, double last top of 266 when we bubbled.I'm bear but something smells funny... I think there's a slight chance this is not a bubble and bears are misled. Huge gap between bid and asks on Gox! price is 416 then is 425! +1 I am taking your hand and gently and kindly telling you: "This is fucking INSANE!" My coins are worth 145,232,764,126,758,649,443 USD and I am not selling OR spending until then! Oh my, I hardly wait for this madness to stop or crashcorrect because I don't do anything other than posting and watching the price. China still is below the point of last correction? When I see pictures of rockets, people screaming "BUY", "to the moon" and "10,000 usd by the end of the year" I know it's time to SELL I actually tend to find a divisibility a good argument. However, one can find very difficult to own an atom of gold, whereas you can own 0.0000001 btc.So, I do believe can crash because of this. I just hope it will return to a niche. I think you're wrong. It will crashcorrect.I coined a new term, crashcorrect to satisfy all. When this crashes, it will crash hardcore. It's insane! Why would you dump lots in seconds when you can keep the price higher by dumping small portions? Of course 24hrs seems a lot reasonable if you want to cash out.  It's too much! 1000 is ok, but 10,000?? Let's be serious. But maybe today's different and China won't go to bed, helping us to go to the moon.!
Sorry to break this but it seems we're gonna crash... upwards On the other hand there are too many asks. What do you mean? I'm skeptic about this new trip to the moon. It seems to me that the rocket doesn't want to take off. It's too much. Nobody will pay that amount for 1 coin. Not even 10,000 for 0.1 or 1000 for 0.01. It's insane.1000-3000? Maybe... After buying at more or less than 35? If I'd buy at 5 and short at 35 I'd be happy and never came back online. By the way, I hope you keep them in a wallet across multiple SD cards! Not in Goxx Pretty strong balls. Hold them.  We already had a signifiant drop from ATH and a very strong slowdown. Even if we get another drop, who will be scared? Cause I ain't What? How? Sell me at 14? What historical data? How many accidents can you prevent with knowledge and research (seat belt saves lives you know)Diseases - see what i said about research.Violence - is mainly because of the poor distribution of wealth. Thefts and robberies. Actually one needs very few limited resources to have a sane, wealthy, healthy and happy life.- Good home, not too big but not small either, maybe with some self-sustainable features like green energy, garden- Technology; TV, cellphone, computers, etc- Cars. one or two, for the family- Some physical silver and gold- A few bitcoins (10 I'd say)- Cash / bank account for emergencies, including medicalI'd say that for US 400,000 would be enough. For EU, 150,000 euros are great.Everything people have above this and do not use to make things happen in this world (medical research would be at the top - check how many die each second without basic health services) is just greed. And greed for power, which is the worst, changes one's character in such twisted ways that you are reluctant to call that person human. I saw some cases... Rival, let's hijack your thread and make a poll. I am very curious how many people have 5,10,50,100 or more BTC. Some have thousands. A hundred coins in nothing. It's too little to be anything. I think you're right, "crash" was not the best word to use at it might imply very long periods of low prices. When I say crash I mean an important correction from which we recover after a week or so. Would be safe to say that the crash is over and we can continue the rally? Anyway, I am more and more convinced that if we can break 400, 500 will be easy.  What is a securities exchange? It seems we are due to a larger leg up. Maybe starting this monday or tuesday, after some rest time for our athlete here. LOOLLL Only good thing coming from these bubbles is a flow of new souls willing to depart with their money.Poor sools
If this crash we have in progress won't breach 280-290, I think we're up to a very big upward movement. Bigger than this. If bitcoin recuperates so fast, people will hear. Media will roar. Snowball effect, media writes, people read, media sells, media writes some more and voila, bitcoin is == with 1oz of gold. See some roar then! The thing is, if I cannot count bodies and all after this crash is over, and we are not going to at least 280, I have the feeling bitcoin will make a massive leg upwards.  yes, my only goal is more BTC. And I play fun and safe. Oh noes...We're back. Good thing I didn't panicked and sold at 300! By the way, THIS proved to me that this market is too volatile to be in it other than with long bitcoins. There's too much speculation and I am affraid bitcoin is just that: a purely speculative instrument, and a very profitable one. Nothing else. Scattered poker games, transactions but no real economy. Wake me up from my hibernation when we have some killer app or interest in BTC as store of value.  Of course, it's my master skill. Good thing is I have more coins. Bad news, could have even more. Crash is over. Double bottom short term. Now buy.EDIT: Bought in at 346. This is not a crash, it's a downward growth. We're close to a retest of 340. Hold your finger crossed, if that helps. If this selloff breaches 340 we're doomed. 340 is 24hrs low. So, what's next? About 1.5M USD per day just to sustain these prices. Just a few. It's like inbreeding. Some groups buy buy buy but they all have to sell at some point. I wonder if this bottom will be prolonged or just a flash crash. Should I buy back now? Sold at the price of 394 out of 395. what do you mean? Really? 4 months?? I really hope we can go to 500 but... who knows...  You CAN withdraw money from Gox, but it takes more than a month and a half! Oh noes... I sold some more here at 394. (also bought back at 370 those I sold at 350, cause I needed to buy a nice restaurant dinner).I see two possible scenarios: 1. going up more, in which case people are happy cause they got my coins, I am happy cause I was poor on paper2. crash, in which case people will be sad and I will be sad cause I'm gonna loose again fiat.
You can take each point on that graph and apply it anywhere. In 5 yrs, I'm sure April's crash would be regarded as bear trap Oh noes, I sold more (voluntarily this time) and guess what. Price will boom now! Up to the skies! But can be speculated on.  I wouldn't be scared if it went like the other times, harsh and hard down. I'd be scared if we get to 120s back in the same time it got up Exciting times. What if we'll reach a point from which will go down like with the same velocity of going down? Not really hoping, I can buy anytime if this goes up in a steady pace. I was thinking of the possibility of a new crash to come this weekend. Seems to me that the recent growth is too big to be sustained, it's really exponential!  The order was  put at 350 since 120s... So should I buy back? I don't want this rocket take off without me! That'd be nice. Top at 358 would be great! I don't plan to buy back coins as I need cash for Xmas and with gox lagging 2 months... one never knows...I am reserved on the outcome of this as I am biased right now. The piglet inside me wants price drops so he can buy more. Top was touched for me at 350. My order autosold there today. My sell order went automatic at 350 and just sold all my coins in Gox...Profit taken. I think 90% of his (and other's analysts) customers come when we're in an uptrend, because of the bullish sentiment.Everyone want's to hear how high we go, not how low we go. No big selloff until 500s. I actually suspect 666 will be a milestone, triggering a big selloff. People withdrew the other days coins from Gox but due to a technical glitch even after 10 hrs no transactions in the blockchain.So, they asked to be cancelled and now are selling. Check #mtgox IRC Some guys in #mtgox IRC channel complain of some technical issues with MtGox and transactions. Dunno if they mean orders or withdrawals/deposits. Any idea? Myth busted! Sent to all my friends. Let it be known. Cash can enter Gox easily. Bids are irrelevant. 
Big crash incoming to MtGox. If we manage to go to 320, the "crash" would be about 35 USD! LOL! Why they would not be able to withdraw? MtGox sais it takes about 2 months. I find this rally very different from the last one in April. Doesn't mean our athlete here, bitcoin, can't be exhausted soon from this one too.It seems to me that it's like it's training. Periods of sprints alternating with slow pace walks to allow cooldown. Which is pretty awesome for me. But makes me think: Is it training for some 41k(m) marathon soon to happen?Time will tell. BTW, $300 and I'll get drunk. If it goes to $10 it's not a bubble? Or to $50? Or to $100?It'd say everything retracing more than 33% is a bubble.  ATH 290! Congratulations bitcoin. Impressive! My paranoia tells me that there is some manipulation, maybe people realized the self-healing power of bitcoin regarding the price? Hmm.. I might turn bull now... I find a top at 300 to be very unlikely, too close of 266 or 272. I just made it out, but it could be 340-360. I am not sure we can go to 400 soon. So, new ATH is in place and no massive movements so far. If tomorrow will rest at ~260, I bet it will go to 320 in no time. My only fear is that it will go too fast and then pop. Bitstamp is the new MtGox. If SilkRoad == down and Bitcoin price == up does it mean that SilkRoad == up, Bitcoin price == down? And at at what USDistance is the Moon exactly? I guess some 13-20 people ignored me as soon as BitcoinAshley called it. Amazing how forumers can act like sheeple. Anyway, I'm very eager to see how this ends. I guess I can scream bubblepop if we go to 500 and then back to 200.  We'll see... Actually, long term I'm very bullish BUT I DO NOT LIKE RAPID GROWTH. I FEEL IT. My hands sweat when I see price going up like crazy, and I'm being serious.  Bitcoin is like a hot babe. You don't get to fuck her, she gets to fuck you. Old US senate men don't know anything. Bitcoin is too great to be stopped. They're afraid they won't see this price again  I presume that with the recent correction and recoup, after we surpass ATH, price will be into violent upward shootings. I find it difficult to believe we can go higher than 350 anytime soon. Maybe a target for next 12+ months. I never implied I know anything about markets. I'll just go back in my cave again, for some time.  Yes they are. +258.88
Oh, sorry... Then let the price be 750, cause 3 mil USD per day would be nothing, equal to peanuts. Seems China doesn't buy anymore this morning.  It popped. Doesn't mean it can reinflate but... This growth is unsustainable. Who does sustain it? Hordes of hungry "investors" coming in with cash? You? Me? Because I don't sustain this growth. I didn't bought and don't plan to into this parabolic rise.How many millions USD do we need each day just to keep the price floating?Let it bubblepop! I hope OP did bought at 205 but sold by now or stashed it for years. This bubblepop will go down hard. I am not saying that we're not gonna go up some more but I saw today's "correction". It was a bubblepop. Numbers were going backwards like a watch on a time bomb  Copy what I said and paste it in notepad. or the search bar of your browser. Who sold everything at 230?  How can we see the amount sold? BUBBLEPOP!!! TOLD YA! Panic seeds! Never trust a person named Eyal. I'm not talking about last weeks. April. 2011. etc. THIS MADNESS CAN'T LAST LONG. PEOPLE ARE DELUSIONAL, DRUNKEN RIGHT NOW. Maybe not yet crashing but this will make some poor guys jump off cliffs. I liked that. Nice. Exactly, bitcoin is controlled now by some wealthy elites and sheeps are getting to slaughter. I like it so much when people enter the trading frenzy and see only "buy buy".  What is about to happen? Going to 350 and back, that's all. Yes. Ready.  Retracement we call it. No. Seems that MtGox is stuck at about $234 while Bitstamp closes in. I'd give anything to see Bitstamp leading.
If it inflates more than 350, that's no bubble. That's a miracle. Actually if it stays above 300 is a miracle. Speculation Yes, false alarm. Rpietilla, can I pm you? Oh no! Bubblepop! 228 and tanking. In less than 5 hrs you'll witness a BIG correction. I'm a carnivore bull that eats fish until hunting season's over. The I hibernate like a furry bear.I avoid to be a pig. I could bet 1 BTC if price is $10,000 (+- 5%) by 31.12.2015 only if you bet $10,000 (+-5%) Hey, look. Every other rally I saw only bullish people screaming "to da moon" and being delusional with new highs. Only for the price to get down really hard.I do not trust anyone. I do not trust TA, mutual funds, shares and other similar crap. I do trust bitcoin because it uses cryptography. I do believe in it but not in bubbles. Not exactly, 250-300 range would be an average of 270-280. I'd say that after 320 up to 350 we'll see fucking LOTS of dumps. People will scream, cry etc. As usual. Everyone keep dreaming of $10,000, $100,000 or $300,000 per coin. I'll be prepared for $10-30. It think the same. Soon, bubble will pop If we get same growth in the next few days I suspect Bubblepop will be here by the middle of the month. 234.95! In the next 10 hours the walls will get eroded and 233.4 will be tested.  Sometimes until Xmas: Or why is MtGox volume going down??One word: Bubblepop The irony would be if bubble pops starting December 24th, depressing everyone until January 2nd. But you could also meet my friend Bubblepop and loose 1/2 to 2/3 of every dollar you have. I like it how the same guys will scream "going to bite the dust!!" when bubblepop time will come. Bitstamp is at most high since April.
Funny. I am not whining. I don't have money to buy coins even if they go to $50 USD. Nuclear holocaust.Quantum computing. Actually no. Why? This is a good point also. I was thinking about it too. But if people have 50,000 coins, that would mean 250,000,000 just for one major player to cash out. If find it too much money. It lasted for a few months dude. I said years. What if we would still be in the 70es now? Would you feel the same optimism? I was thinking:Many people hold tens of thousands of coins (see rpietillas TOP 500 for some info). That means lots of coins are in the hands of some wealthy elite that are already rich and have not immediate need to cash out anything. That's not wealth, that's power. Having 1% of the total coins is purely power. What if we would have a prolonged downtrend (not violent) to $5-10 for let's say 2 years? May of them will cash out, even partially. We need a good distribution of the coins and I do not think that stronghands can be shaken otherwise. Neo, what if I am an intelligent person but talk about a bubble so it's less likely it is actually one? Furystart! 216! Big activity, low volume! 215.08 killed. Some more upside before bubblepop. So far Goxians are fighting with 215 mark, which is opposing some resistance. But shall be down soon. Afterwards, 233 is the new conquest they have to make.Meanwhile, Bitstampians are rebounding to 202-203, struggling to kill 206. $215 is being tested. Surpassing soon. At the current growth rate in about 100 days.EDIT: if no bubblepops appear What's topic covered? $20 to surpass last high of $233 on MtGox AND ONLY $5 to surpass last high of 206 on Bitstamp. Such a discrepancy... Seems the bubble is inflating again. But the bids are so thin... Even lower this time I presume. Operation Bubblepop in progress. What happens then? You're a happy guy, aren't ya? This time I think the bubble will pop harder, lower. When this will happen? Why doesn't DIFFICULTY affects price? Any TL;DR?
Exactly. Good point. Mine to spend the coins...  add those 29k coins from first weeks of October. that's about 174k coins Shit! I hope they destroy them! Interesting and pertinent argument. Thank you! Nope. Popping! Another stupid thread. $1,000,000,000,000 per coin?? I'm kinda tired by this kind of questions:When will ... ?What do you think ... ?Can bitcoin ... ?Is bitcoin ... ?Are we ... ? Pops, drops, downslides. "Price and difficulty do not follow each other"you mean nobody found a relationship between them yet, doesn't really mean it doesn't exist So, given all this data, how could we compute the best price for a BTC in current mining conditions? What? But you'll mine more than 1! maybe 30~ I have applied a patch to your text.  For all the people that we're saying "this is different now": - THE BUBBLE POPPED! What other proof do you need? It will go lower. Mark my words.  Fuckin congratulations. I was 100% sure it will pop. After my argue with a respected member on this forum, he convinced me that price can recover (see low 150 and recoup to 200) BUT i do think more downward will happen.So rally is over, go home! 267.1 What if no price drop?
Preparing to challenge 230 and go higher. I feel like sports comment person   Good question to ask is what happens when 21,000,001 people want 1 BTC each. Not less. 37 dollars to the ATH on GOX. Maybe we'll challenge ATH by Friday. Weren't you saying the same in April? I can agree price can recover quickly. But what do you mean by: "The fact is, all those coins bought were gone for at least a couple of year" ? ONE CANNOT WITHDRAW! WHY SO LOYAL? 204.5, very overbought 204, going up once, going up twice. Wouldn't it be funny if people screaming "Bubble!", including me, will see $500-$700 bitcoin in the next month or so?Imagine the ridicule. Not dumps... BIG dumps. Whaaat? I miss two minutes from Gox and it goes up about 230?? 203.85 surpassed after about 4 hrs of playing a little bit downward. Rally resumes, with new targets of 215-220 for the next 24 hrs. Gimme ! Gimme! Gimme! If you take only 10% of the coins transactioned today on MtGox and short them, you'd push price into the 160-170 area. And if you do that, others will short short as well. Boom Bubble! Boom! surpassing 205.85 in: ~350 bitcoins. I'll think of you when Bubble explodes I waiting for a crash! I subscribe. So price has to go up because of that?? Why would you play like that with money?? I don't think we can end with double digits easily. But this craziness will stop, will explode and will go down.
WHAT? If BTCCHINA is based in China, I think any kind of scam or mistake leading to people loosing money will be treated with bullets by the government.This makes me think that BTCCHINA might have the most secure platform.  GOX!Unsable USD there. Well, STOP using eMpTyGOX as a reference! Does this mean GOX has no coins there? We're in a bubble. When it pops, it gets us to 150. 48 to 100 hrs from now. And not all of them are for sale. Some of them are just showing off their boobs. You can't touch them. Sell! But what do I do with all GoxUSD? $1 growth in 1 minute! I'm starting to doubt that this is bubble. It's.. NORMAL! I see walls building up. And makes me feel we'll never go beyond 205.5. About 600 coins to surpass 205.5  Or are we experiencing the fist signs of a bubble popping? I do say we're in bubble. But nobody seems to listen or care. Too much frenzy here.Yes, we might go up to 300 but only to pop much lower.  I am kinda worried that we're gonna go parabolic again and then CRASH. My idea exactly. I think we might be at the top. Or near it. Why am I being censored??? My "bubble pops" post has been deleted and no notifications! BUBBLE POPSSSS!  If in the last 5 days we had $50 growth, will this mean in the next 14 days will be over 300? 
Would be nice to see double or even single digits again. ¥1,235.00WHAAT?? Surpassing 197.39 in less than 4 minutes. We are $20 until you can say hitting 200.If it is a bubble, it is just when first molecules of air are entering it. Explain please? Dude, think seriously. With debd you're on minus. It's better a thousand times to be at 0 and have nothing.Debt the chain every man should struggle to break. Then you can go back gathering, hunting or whatever our ancestors did.I hate debt.  What's PM? I have too agree that this is so fun and exciting I was jumping around the house. And my gf asked if I have a date or something... I wonder whyif Wobber buys more == price declineand notif price decline == Wobber buys more Bought all in at 194 so prepare for a sharp and violent decline anytime from now and 20 minutes from now. Why do I have the feeling that price is gonna stagnate for the rest of the weekend and then go down hard?? Breaking news:Couldn't resist  QUESTION: can you use MtGox USD redeem codes in Bitstamp?I am waiting for transfer to an European bank for 2 weeks now and thinking to cancel. Being selfishly up to the lower sociopaths limit is a trait of character upon most bitcoiners. And most "rich" guys.I do not own it, thus I'm poor. Let me rephrase: if we go beyond 200, there are slight chances to go down. Everyone wants it up in the sky, miners had almost no profit at current prices, MtGox is not the monopoly anymore. This is just the spark, wait until it really ignites. it won't go back. Got this message from the future dating November 1st 2013 THE SAME! INSANE People deserve this for not keeping their coins in the wallet. Why the fuck would YOU want to keep coins in SOMEBODY's ELSE wallet? Might be, rally is only on Gox.
170.09200 coins bought The most fun part of the roller coaster is when it gets down. Weak hands might slip away from the wagon.Also, be cautious, climbing up with your eyes closed makes you not see when it goes downhill. BUY BUY BUY! Thank you! Going to sleep, and want to see 200 in the morning.Your master. Such a fun-breaker, you hater. My humble rodents, I command you to take that wall down! Helloooo! Life taught me that whenever masses do something, I should do the opposite. When Gox had power, I moved out from them. Now, I would go with them. You're a hater! 964 on btcchina freaks me out. Guys, let's step back a bit and calmly analyze this price climb thoroughly and not jump to conclusions.I would say that such prince swings are solid evidence that indeed, we are going to the moon and land there. By no circumstances we will be back, ever, into the triple digits again, after the next few hours. Never had so much fun since I was with those four Playboy blonde models on the beach. 169.72Going to sleep only after surpasses 170! Whooohoooo!!! 169.98 within the hour. 168.15168.04 was surpassed. Babysteps. Let's surpass 168.04 in the next hours. Then ~180 in a few days. Hug or handhold? Never underestimate the power of greed. (i don't say that there won't be a bubble burst) That's on MtGox.It's exciting, I like it but somehow doesn't seem right.Moreover, the price on Gox is too high related to Bitstamp and others... 
2 months to withdraw cash from Gox? Proof or it didn't happened!GOX says they have backlog but only 2-3 weeks. Questions Marks:- any indication that millions are lost? - any indication that Satoshi hold a million?- DPR/FED is 29k- large businesses? point a few.I am asking because I try to find this article where mathematicians where implying the same, that BTC supply is much much less. I see in my inbox other ppl PM to (of course) other persons than myself.Since the forum had issues. Anyone else with the same problems? I really have no idea... Something really bad is gonna happen to MtGox soon. They are going to loose all their customers. And a heck load of money. That's why the world is fucked up. Because many are willing to trade their fellow for profit.Oh really? Hoping that some diabetic dude living in a trailer in US gets even poorer so bitcoin price will rise. What a waste of brain matter on economics and all since a 10 yr old kid can see that we have sufficient resources for everyone but egocentrically managed. Some too poor, some too rich.Careful what you wish for and what toys you play with. Given the fact that price chart is very similar with:Google searchesWikipedia article readsNew MTGox accounts / backlogI would say that the last bubble was exploding because too many people bought, secured some 25-50% profit and got out. So I imply that actually there very few pigs but kinda BIG that got slaughtered. The majority made profit. If banking system would fail, that means bank from all over the world will go into a domino effect right? And I presume there might be wars / civil wars /huge riotsCan someone detail how this might happen? It's not very clear what would happen... bank runs, riots soon you'll have to change the thread to BITSTAMP eXchange wall Observer. biggest and best exchange  New target is 300s. But I think we'll stay in high liqudity for the year. 2 days since we have about 2.19% growth rate daily. You can do the math also. I hope we can sustain that, with minor upside and downside bubbles Thinking and talking in mBTC it a nice psychological trick to think you're even richer and maybe value 1 coin even more. But I don't think we'll ever use mBTC... Sorry, I don't get it. You mean they could earn more in IT than in day trading? People need to overtake printing of money in order to have bitcoin overtake printed money. Great! but what are the targets? Bitcoin at $10,000 or more (ie $50,000) sounds improbable. Not all people in the world will use bitcoin if it's main use is for speculation.1 Coin at this price would have big psychological effect and I am unsure that mBTC will catch. BTC at 300,000 is delusional. Nevermind, I double checked and volume on BTC china is about 600... Way smaller then mtgox. my bad. Just saw that volume on BTC China is equal to the volume on Mtgox... I think we are not in a bubble. I might change my mind if in about 2 months the downtrend will continue and no new highs are in place.I really do think that Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular. I don't know how this affects the price given that 3600 btc are mined daily and we need about 400k usd to sustain that. DAILY. But I do know that everyone should own one bitcoin. If I were in the place of those people in Cyprus, Greece, Spain, and EU in general, I'd keep a fair portion of my savings in BTC. Think of this: the weakest link in our whole civilization is fiat. There are many 0s in total amount of fiat but so many poor people. In a world that 1% controls 95% of wealth I find it unfair to play by moneymaker's rules. Yes, hard to use bitcoin for groceries but that's just momentarily. Too much energy is invested in speculating rather than developing.  He would have to sell everything he has to do so. Rich people might own lots of land, businesses, condos but... liquidity is the secret.
I was thinking the same thing. I see too many people waiting to buy lower and just can't stop thinking.. what if they won't be able to do so.But also, when so many people think the same, a new low might happen. And by the way, I still don't think we're in a bubble. Just huge correction. If another 6 weeks will pass and stil downtrend, I'll accept the bubble theory. Until then, no way. Interesting opinion. But if Spain enters crisis, so will the rest of PIGS. I think Greece will be first... 140 to 160. Maybe some price swings in this area. If we surpass 170 it will be extremely bullish with a target of 290-300. Where can you see that? I suspect website issues. mtogx.com/login works! https://mtgox.com/login works Who laughed? I just proposed something to him. I have a server but I'd have to set up PHPmyadmin and all. You could pay me monthy if you'd want. Thank you again. I enjoyed your posts. Let me know your positions went. and good luck making some money. I think I know some things about bitcoin and exchanges. Yes. Correct. But he would have some value stored there and he could sell like in 2 days. If you're gonna counter argument that BTC might fail, pls don't use it.  Save 2 coins at least. Hell, 10 if you afford it right now. If you ever need money urgently, you'll have some there. I have nor had any coins with Coinbase. Never used them. Just read about them and made an assumption. Cash out? Why? - Investing 5-f*** million dollars in a company dealing with bitcoin? Purely speculative? LOL. I wouldn't do that. Bitcoin's future is not entirely speculative. You'll see.- 1% trading fee? I won't pay that. Actually, I'm so against exchanges right now, I will sell only on OTC. -  24 yrs old Goldman Sachs "trader"?  I don't trust Goldman Sachs. And no offence, not trusting 24yrs old sausages also.- Trying to make money on the back of bitcoin posing a simple business as "revolutionary"? Bitcoin is revolutionary, same as 10,000 BTC pizza. The rest is just hard work. Thank you for sharing. But how do you quatinfy Fundamental indicators? I wonder also. Let's hold hands. I wonder what effect China will have.
over 500 until July Don't sell. Put them away for 1 year. In 10 yrs there will be more than 11 mil BTC. 1000-1500 dollars seems doable. I could tolerate spikes to maybe 3000. But 300k.. Insane. Nothing worth that much. And yes, we could split into many 0s. But think to gold also. 1g is 45 bucks. Not much right? But not much gold either. My concern is that once a massive buying sets in, price is going exponential and exponential is nothing but bad. We need ~30 mil USD to go to 4 digits. Or less if panic buy really sets in. and both shit downwards I reiterate: 300-350 by August, or at least this target ill be reached by then. I made the assumption/prediction of 300. BUT, my TA (very very basic and possibly incorrect) shows that there might be another dip before a new rally. But the 300 price could be by August. 300. soon. I have the strong feeling the price is gonna rise to about 350. It's my personal assumption based some very basic and noobish TA (thanks Arepo for pointing me to learn).To stay on the safe side, I'd say 300. And not related to the China effect. I think China, overall, won't rush to jump into bitcoins.They'll do what the do for millennia: gain intelligence on this new asset (ask mathematicians to answer questions like "are there only 2 mil BTC transacted and the rest stashed?", analyze code, open exchanges, start hacking (God help us).Then they'll buy little by little.  This summer will be spectacular. Big money will get in, some will get out, price is gonna swing wild and mostly upwards.Just wait for it. No.  How come? Being one of the maybe first 10,000 btc users, I am also assuming that many, MANY btc are lost forever. How? Deleted, when people got bored with mining. My assumption? somewhere from 2 to 4 mil coins 78% of coins not moved paper? I don't know about that. 97 falling. 100 is neglijable. Also 1000. Not all the people in the world would use BTC, as not all would use gold.Also, the lost BTC will be felt, as in not being traded, not having any value Scammer will always be in every community. Bitcoin is the best thing for paying (anonymously) over the web. This is fundamental fact #1 Bold enough...
Does anyone knows or can smart guess:1. How many accounts Mtgox has2. Daily/Weekly money getting in Mtgox3. Daily/Weekly money getting out of Mtgox4. Newcomers rate?I'm trying to find out but have a hard time. Why not? In 6 months, bitcoin will be more than 500. ElectricMucus - what is your opinion on BTC and it's price in general. I'm asking because you're the most efervescent here and I really want to know. In 2013 bitcoin has more mainstream attention than ever before. With good and bad sides. Cyprus crisis had a major role in the price change. Cyprus being just a small island. What can happen if Greece has the same issues?Also, what will happen this year with all the exposure? People do forget fast, but that's why we have internet. Bitcoin will sooner or later reappear on their screens. And then what?It seems we are in the very beginning and people think it's already over. One single major exchange, one major btc-only business, a few people controlling large amounts of coins.Just wait for the next little economic shock. People will run away from banks and fiat. Now they have options. We are here to enjoy life. Point me one that takes something with him when he dies, other than maybe life's experiences. I have no problem with that. Cold as arctic ice. If I had all the coins at their most highest value, yes I would have had about 1 mil. But I sold, I fucked up, I profit.Generated all and not feeling sorry for selling when needed at 2. Now I have very very few, maybe 10%. That's life, all goes back in the box.If I recall correctly, at best time I had 50,000 and at the worst 10,000.That's my story.LE: If one day I will still have coins and their value will be higher than I need, I will use the surplus to do things. I think of helping some children in Africa /Asia or poor countries. Having tons of plans (detailed, on paper, dreams) but lacking funds and other's help. I have new play tool: report to moderator Define rich Oh, I did sell. I did also at 160. But I bought back at 120 Need to pay bills I said I needed to sell. Not panic. But if I had waited like 10 more minutes I'd have 500 more lol. Just sold some at 97. Not because I wanted, cause I needed. But I do this for a long time and just keep loosing! aaaaaah Thank's for the tip, didn't knew about that. And just reported it. Please ban a few days the user ElectricMucus. I feel very disturbed by the image he posted.Only a frustrated skunk would do that.  Yeah, not exactly speculation-related.I guess people here aren't very interested in this, just topics like "Price up or down?".Having some personal issues so I'll take a break a few years - going offline. Not checking email, facebook, mtgox or speculation forum Best part: writing a bot on Raspberry Pi to do ifup eth0 last day of each month, check mtgox price, calculate how many coins are necessary for $500, move coins to Mtgox, sell, transfer funds to bank account. Then ifdown eth0Surely I'll have to troubleshoot a few times... I'm coming back with my weird ideas.I am thinking of quitting current job and search for one to be paid only in Bitcoins. How I would do it:- paid on the last days of each month. - salary of 600-1000 dollars payable in BTC- remote work in IT and telecom (GSM, UMTS, VoIP, sys admin security-focused)- 2 weeks notice on each side I am also curious:Is there any approximation on the number of bitcoin users?Is there any approximation on the average quantity of BTC those users have? I mean, i can see 11 million but for me it seem just 2-3M are traded and transactioned. Also I assume 1M is lost in the days back.And how can I see top 100 wallets? What is this??
Thank you all, both participating and non-participating.See this.http://imgur.com/PLx9w8p Yes, I am aware of that. I am not expecting great results.  how can you see that? Isn't that a bit too high? I mean, yea, 1000 would be great but 100k.... Not so soon. Worth as in stocks? Next time when you hear that X company is worth Y millions or kazillions don't make the mistake to think that the company has that amount of money in their pockets or bank accounts. He's tired not seeing CRASH. I think this summer will be mindblowing... All the mainstream media news, Cyprus bank issues (remember Cyprus is just a little island) Hey smoothieLet's make our own movement with people that own 1 to 10000 BTC.And what incident with 13 BTC? 0 generated. 0 bought because of the joy of tech innovation. I admire more one that buys 1 BTC because want's to play with it, explore, than a speculator with thousands. The wealthy elite thing made my keyboard sick.adsfohe9q0ejwd And something for the big guys with big money and many 000 of BTC:"You paid milions for bitcoins in your wallet. We generated them with old computers. Go and whine." I do not understand that meeting in Finland. I think I do not understand it because I didn't read  the full post about it.But I am ignorant and do not want to be an early adopter in something I have to pay.  Just a reminder for this.I have already put a bot. I will buy at exactly 13:00:13, will let others to buy lower than me. I will sell that coin only when price doubles. Just 2 occurences? Wait for more to call controlled demolition. But the similarities are intriguing Do you really think it will go lower? I think natural growth is following bitcoin generation curve. Growth is less in the final years.Same with plants, animals etc. It thing BTC Guild also experiences this... fast growth in the start then decresing. I would have told you if you wouldn't mock me with "magical places"...Nothing magical, just a country. I was thinking more than writing. I wanted to say that stocks can go down really hard, even more in an event of economical collapse. I don't trust stocks. Sorry for the confusion and for not trusting stocks. Only live stocks. 200,000 each YEAR? I can tell you a place where 200,000 ONCE will assure you for the rest of your life. And no, not living in huts. And a place with absolutely gorgeous women. I think I said multiple times:1. A secure home: having a nice not-too-big, not-too-small home, self-sufficient, at least 2 redundant water supplies, small garden, tools to work it (maybe some motorized cause if you spent your life as an adult in front of a laptop you won't have what it takes to work the land), some animals and of course, internet access, a nice archive with books (e-format also)2. Some investments in precious metals and bitcoin (just because it's awesome). Anything else (like stocks) has 0 value over time. You need something proven over time.3. Frugal life, with thing you need, not things you want. Nobody said to discard mobile phones and technology, just don't depend on it. AAA powered walkie-talkies are nice for example4. An emergency fund, can be cash and bank account. Use this only for health, medical, financial issues. No fun, travelling etc5. Work and enjoy life with loved ones.
How can you draw that curve? How bearish? 50? You would end up with almost everyone following #1 and #2. Trading is meant to be personal, intimate. Like sex. cooldinate a plice dlop? Bring it on!Counter-Op: don't sell a single coin! I sense lots of bullish sentiment. I think we will see 140-160 next week. Anyone with me? Eat more! Photoshop? Next time edit the source page. It's easier.Or try to make that amount and buy BRAIN BRAIN BRAIN! Don't ask money from rich people dude... they don't have any... Exactly. Oh,Was is das? 120 dollaretten = eintz Bitcoinen? Shitten Do it and see... The lamest thing one man could ever do is showing the content of his wallet in public.It's like that guy wearing solid gold shirt! Wait us there, ok? NO. NO DISCOUNT TODAY. What if...and what if we will really have series of rallies, then plateaus of consolidation with continuous interest in BTC and more buyers...500 until july is nothing.It takes 113.57k BTC to be bought or some 23 mil $. According to the wall.And not necessary being a bubble. At 500 I would sell everything except 5 or 10. If people would just take as they need, it can be sustainable. Let's say i sell all at 500. What i would do, I would start some little shop/business etc, make money and then reinvest at 1000. Maybe I'll have money to buy just 5 coins, which I'll sel at 1500.  Fixed it. No. It could be the same at 31 or 50. Given limited supply, prices will eventually be astronomical. It will matter how many coins you'll have. Oh, damn! I'm using this calendar for US, it end with Saturday! Changed it!
Time is 1pm GMT. What do you think are the chances for each ? Great. Please popularize, if you know others interested.I also think we could have competition, organized groups that will sell maybe 2 BTC to distrupt us  A million? What do you do with it?My advice: take as much as you need, not as much as you want.1. Home. Most important asset. If you can customize it near perfection, do it. A garden to work when retired is awesome. Just make sure you have everything you need, from nails and hammer to some redundant power, heating and water supply. Buy water filters and yes, survival gear also. Not in the event of zombie apocalypse but for natural disasters.2. Car. Buy a decent car, one that doesn't consume much fuel. You don't need an Audi TT. But you may want it...3. Health money. Do regular, yearly checks of your health and family's4. Emergency. Keep some money for emergency. Silver, bitcoin and cash, bank accounts. Think carefully of the proportions.5. Start a small business or project. One does not simply retires without doing anything. You have to work to maintain physical and mental health. Even if you do pro bono work. It's a great idea. Individuals fail. Teams prevail. It was a mistake for my part to ask for tomorrow so will remain for next week.My advice is not to buy for this experiment, only if you really want to participate. Otherwise just buy if you really plan to trade on that day.I will disclose the hour of that day after I get 10 people in. You can PM me if you want to be anonymous or something. AGREED! Yes, it was funny. Nice, but you are making me look the man selling the bitcoin...I'm just asking the people that are willing to buy regardless... Thanks Kazu, no, please don't sell, maybe you'll have to buy higher. I'll wait for others. Is anyone willing to buy just one coin, at the same time with me, just to experiment?The only rule is 1 btc. Not 0.1 increments. I want to see that little butterfly triggering a hurrincane I do not ask anyone to join, I just want to know if there is any trader that might want to make a coalition. You then can sell any time (yea, even next second).If 7 more people are in, I'll disclose the hour for Sunday April 27th. So far myself and 2 friends. Thank you! Cool. But if we go down to 50 again I'm screwed! Internet power consumption is how much % of total world? 10%? Or 15%?Please consider that many phone carriers, TV, mobile also use internet for data transport. A soap bubble pops when you touch it, or when it rises higher right?Tulip bubble popped because of the rumors of bubonic plague.Last 2 bitcoin bubbles popped because of Mtgox. Exactly. I'd add, slowly, sanely recover. Then maybe rally to 500s Bitcoin at any lower than $5 will trigger the geeks to buy. Now it's more widespread than ever so it won't be like 2011. Any geek wants at least 2 coins By the way, seems silver will go really down, maybe to 15$ an ounce... this year. Which might shake the stocks as well.  I remember in 2011 many said that bitcoin is doomed. As long as my friend Toby from US will still mine (he said he will do it just to his heat home and give me coins for a beer if price drops lower than parity) and as long as me and my other friend Mike will use BTC as whatever price to settle debt or pay each other, you can crash bitcoin hard, cause we will crawl. I really like people that take data, interpret it to their best and then share without saying THIS WILL HAPPEN. Just present what THEY think the outcome is.Did lucif said anywhere: "follow me, sheeps, 'cause this will happen next!" ?
56 days until then. What kind of power, action or event would be needed for that?- more European economic problems, Cyprus-like: Spain, Portugal, Greece.- more mainstream news about bitcoin- more big "investors"- more options to buy with, exchanges, apps, games etc My calculations show that some 200,000 dollars are needed to buy happiness. The rest is excess and not need. But if your dream is to have a 24 karat solid gold shirt...The rest can easily be donated That's why I'm all in. But even so, I don't think in a few months will be much... Not really.. in has to go to like 500 to help me... hm... i have only 2 options... sell or hold... How? I got a 502 Bad Gateway message. Ha ha! It's starting! Going down!Use me as indicator. Give me one coin to do it and observe me.15mjeXRKNGrH8GVZfzoakzggGUQxeN14oC You're giving hope to me... I bought at 120. Dunno why, felt so Just posted earlier but no so clear: RELIEF. I'm speaking for me and for me only. After a week of crashes and swings, in which i made (some small) profits, thinking how much I could have owned if sold at 250, thinking I'm a piglet, I just bought in at 120. Not all, I have put aside 200 bucks for a nice dinner, cigars and wine.And feeling great. I am pretty sure with my luck the price will fall to 50 by monday. But will still fell great. I really don't like the way you brag. QUOTE:"It's a bubble which unfortunately pops and pops and pops until one day it either loses credibility or the supply reaches the total maximum they predicted, which is 21 million," he said. Predicted 21 million?? How I like when dumb economist don't understand anything. Fire him ! Fire him with ice! Everybody want's it at 10,000 but no hope for 12 months. If we have a good consumer base, I'm roughly saying 1 in 5 people that have internet, and by consumer base add everyone that knows about bitcoin and could buy it, we eventually need no more banks. We could use OTC with fellows in the same city or even barter. When people will barter with bitcoins, that will be an amazing time... The it would be more than triple digits. But by then, hope that the system is good and we can support that masses getting in. 3 major exchanges with one being FuckGox? And what about those that buy coins ad let's say 2421 dollars to pay their employees and next day coins are 2634? profit right? what about the stupid employess that will hold a few days more? with these price swings I don't want to be paid in bitcoins. What goes but cand go down. Many sold ad 50-70. And sold lots of coins. Don't jump so quick. We will eventually go very low but so far it seems market has some momentul. We'll see the next days. http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg120zigDailyztgSzm1g10zm2g25zlThis. For me it seems we're back on the "we're fiiine, was just a correction". I presume next 3 candles will be green and start going down HARDCORE.NB: Also for me, the bear trap was at about March 12, at the red candle. Notice the next greend candles, very very small changes. True. But it could be also a signal for more prolonged downtrend.My questions is: what is the average cost to produce a coin now? add a 10%, hell, add 20% more and you get a absolely great price for BTC
And is this sane??Pigs get slaughtered on the way down alsoe. Anyone who thinks "OMG OMG 70 is cheap, gets his nose burnt when it goes to 50. and 40. and 30 What's going on? Missed a day and we got from 80 to 130? Or start using it, not speculating. Close the bank accounts and price WILL skyrocket.  Interesting. Why are candles green or red? Do the same on Mtgox.If nobody can withdraw usd anymore, they'll buy btc resulting in the wackiest, most powerful rally ever. Better take serious riding lessons for that. Up AND down is better... yea... Simple. Forum based.I will give 48 hours for the contest. I see there are many technical analysts that are pretty good, other people just spread FUD. If you're in, just post how to you thing the market will go. For each 48hrs correct prediction you get 1 point. 1 bonus point for giving TA with graphs.However I understand some do not want to disclose their positions so half a point wil be awarded for giving a correct vague prediction and then provide a TA after the 48 hrs time frame. I just want to see who's the best. If the winner wants, I'll make a website for subscription services. And of course, subscribe.Round 1 ends on April 19th 4:35 pm UTC Can you please check your PMAnd please continue to analysis. Maybe start a service. And what does this indicates? I see you pointed just the last candle...  Bitcoin is dead...Like what? Those antiquities people pay thousands for? Like the old Z80 games? I'm sure they'll write hundreds of books about Bitcoin if it crashes. They will study it in economy classes. But it won't happen. Gold didn't died. Yes.  But sooner we get low, the better. 100 IS TOO LOW! And after that what? Can you detail why? You think 2011 is repeating? I think you're right, 0.00001% chances to go to 4-5. BUT, 10-30 is very broad area for me... Let's hope it will. Sooner this shit ends better for all. 
A few months is too much... He knows because his momma made him with Nostradamus. I want this month a trend reversal. From playing in the broad area of 50-100s to playing into 500-1000. I wanna see crashez like that daily. I'm not very good with that... Since the drop today was ~50 usd, coud it drop 20 more? Or get up 50 again, even 120? I think it can... No. It's just spreading bearish sentiments so they can profit. The bitcoins want my money and I'm too weak to fight them.  What? I think you're spreading bullish propaganda, saw many of your posts with uber-bearish sentiments. But I might be wrong abnd you might be correct, in which case I'll present you my apologies. Cause I'm not ashamed to do that. That's a backlog.. 28000 customers. You're not thinkig they are gonna process all at once right?Some will loose interest in MtgoxSome will put BTC to sellSome will put USD to buy.For me is not a bullish/bearish indicator. Meanwhile the price is going down. And let me ask.. How many people BUY BUY BUY? If they see that price is going down they'll wait. What money? Thank you guys for the help! I really thank you! Paid Arepo 1 BTC068c2c72cd7b3fb219752e75045879e1866e7567bb2a06dd39e5b943bccd221cHe will trade it and provide me the outcome. More like an experiment. I wasn't clear it seems. I need buy/sell signals as long as Mtgox has no fees. I am all usd at the moment. NO, I DID NOT. I said in that post that some people had affected the price for profit. I DID NOT SAY that 200$ was healty. Thank you, but no. I don't know about bitfinex and won'd start doing it. I want someone to help me with doing a trade until Mtgox put's back fees.I would like to share 1/4 of the earnings if someone is really helpful. Is anyone available to tutor me the next 28 or so hours? I don't want to discolose publicly the amount of USD I have but it's about 4 months salaries in US.I will pay only bitcoins and will provide mtgox CSV values. I also put it in the title but you still checked my post. I'm a very poor trader. I made this calculation I want people discuss.2011 high, $31.91 then a minimum of $2 (don't really know the exact prices). So, the retracement is 625% ?2013 high, $266 aplied with a retracement of 625% would mean a price of 39? and if we apply then a growth from 2 to 266 (about 133 times) that would mean price would rise from 39*133?? I was one of the early adopters, mined lots of coins with an old CPU. I had those ideas of botnets, GPU, viruses to mine stealthy, but lacked skills to implement it. You might wonder how I found bitcoin in it's early stage. I found it because I needed it. I searched for a method of online payment without banks involvement, which I very deeply hate. I played at casinos with 50 BTC, I asked people to give me 2 coins and I made logos for 30 BTC. I tried to make some businesses, had ideas but lacked skills (programming and such)At Bitcoins most high price, I would have had millions. But my greed made me not sell at 32 to be happy, but sell at 2 out of need. I was about to sell at 280 all of my coins and buy a home, car, and get rid of debt.Yesterday during the fall I was so desperate I got out of the office and had a little walk in the rain. And I stopped by this small park. Was thinking... to sell? Or maybe not, maybe it will go up again and can sell. Then I got it. I was doing it wrong. I was negatively contributing to a thing I SEARCHED for. I was speculating, I was greedy, I was seeing myself an "investor", "trader", "early-adopter". I was thinking how I could have owned a fucking jet and now have like nothing. It seems bitcoin taught more about myself and people than economy and technology. I showed me how is to go in 3 hours from pure happiness to depresses, how to be excited or don't give a fuck. Then again, got it. Was doing it wrong. What the fuck are my coins doing in MtGox, simply poisoning Bitcoin's decentralized design with a centralized solution? Bulls and bears, traders and investors, businesses and customers. I was all of these. You also were. And almost everyone never was a contributor. Almost no one ever really did something good for and with bitcoin. So, my coins are heading back were they should have been the past 3 (THREE) years: wallet.dat.We cannot deny that some people joined forces, spread some FUD, some bullish ops, hacked, stolen, scammed. We seen them many times. Their method of action was simple: "oh... let me hold those coins for ya, no worries"So, speculators, Mtgox, russians, hackers, day-traders, operatives in April Foolcoin, uber-mega rich bankers: go and *** @# #@$@# 3## ## #1!Guy-that-bought-a-pizza-with-10,000: I remember you and deeply thank you. Mister with alpaca-socks! Forgot about you lately.Satoshi, whoever and whatever you are, I really thank you. Even if tomorrow bitcoin will be 1 dollar, I'll be on profit. Even if it goes at 0.1, I will still be winning: a great experience, a change to know myself and destructive power of greed. Those coins I sold when I was l needy brought me more than anyone could ever destroy.So, bulls and bears. Play with the price, bring it up, bring it down... Profit and loose. But we're doing it wrong. Bitcoins are like cash. And nobody uses them for that. Until then, the few coins I have are staying in my wallet, and if they can buy a house, they'll buy a house. If not, a pizza.8cd062767bc66009cc2cc60ddf60e39430e3e6dea674098159f3622d48038c47
Will you use that nice-looking features Bitcoinica has? The one developed by Twitter The service is great! I can profit a lot by using your charts. Thank you!Suggestions: be transparent. if you'll have a website, post there that you have issued an update or alert and current member pool. It's a bird! It's an airplane! It's a... superspeculatedkryptocurrency,man! Update: It seems I have 58 coins stuck in my account that couldn't be transferred. A second attempt said "Insufficient funds". and what if I'm just FUDing?PS. The first thing I tried to do was to contact CX but live support online is offline. But that's not an excuse right? What if his 2 instances we're charging you the same time? What? I am very mad. This shouldn't have happened. I moved 326 USD from MtGox to CryptoXchange in order to withdraw them all. Wanted to see how fast is CX. A week after (today), after some chats with CX's staff I simply canceled the transfer and got 324 (2 usd were fees). So, started to use the interface to buy coins. Offtopic: The platform is a PITASo, I put some buy orders in, canceled some, got mad, canceled all, put them again and when I check my account... Exactly 100 BTC more than I should have had. Because I am disappointed, I'll let CX staff to work hard and find out who I am.Once they do, I expect a PUBLIC report on their website on why it happened and how they will stop this from happening. And want my 2 dollars back.Meanwhile, the ALL BTC rest in one of my wallets. The problem is that I need an idea on how to manage this situation. I want transparency and if transparency does not exist, I will charge CX 100 BTC. I know they have low volume, struggling to survive and this is a hard kick for CX but they need to be fucking secure! Low:$3.87800People want cheap coins bet remember. Cheap is not $2. Cheap is relative. If bitcoin will trade at 1.5, cheap will be 0.5. Just sayin' Ok. Here's what I learned so far since I found bitcoin in it's beggining: it was designed decentralized as a currency (a purpose) but being decentralized it gave the power to the mass and the mass chose to use it as a commodity. Also learned a lot about myself and how I cope with all those emotions. Learned some trading, some economy. Learned that I can make profit by going down too, not just by hoarding.I am trying to find out now, if bitcoin will go above it's all-time high this year. We all believe that due to the limited supply of 21 million coins, price for one will be high. But can this happen soon? Did you sent any memos yet? When do I pay? OP, what's your position on what Oldminer sais in another thread, about we'll eventually get to 2 again, with ups and downs? He's the Mad Speculator And why are you so aggressive with your language?  Why do you play with assets if you can't manage loosing some money? Can we make some sort of club and back each other up, moving the market for profit? When and how do we pay? I'm in too. Charts? And why do you call it a negative sum game?
4.53 seems pretty cheap to me. Big time above 5. We will do that by the end of the day.  I don't panic or thrill. I buy und sell. Me do trading. Depends. I don't find 4.2 expensive compared to 4.05 Sorry. And this means what? More downside? Why aren't rallies so aggressive too? Sold exactly 1000 at 5.7. 5700 - fees.Bought at 4.22, returend 1337. LOLPS. No TA, just luck. I am a big fan of the 33% retracement, I don't fully understand it but it seems  very real to me.When we get to 4.81, how can we see the up "retracement"?  And we're still going down, to a bottom that has yet to come. If you have, sell. Ride down!If you don't have, buy buy buy! I like the Bitcoinica-like look. How is this made? Hello. What do you think will be this year's high? Will be surpass $30 and what will happen then? A new drop or a rocket-rally to 50 or 100? Could bitcoin really go there? Broken up, but when? for the last 3-4 days we're going down. Hello. Is any well-disciplined player who would like to explain how bitcoinica works, in detail? It seems it changed a lot from the last time I checked it so...Questions: What are the order types?What do the terms mean: Margin Balance, Tradable Balance   , Leverage, Unrealized P/L, Net Value?, Maintenance?What's the diff between orders and positions?What means to be zhouanfenged?Why the price has small last digits?What's the *?What are Margin Call and Liquidation?Tips and triks for playing smart. I don't really care much about rallies. I am very interested on what methods to use to forecast a new drop. Like, where is the top, where the bottom might be etc..?For me, rallies seem erratic, with no algorithm. But falls, falls I think follow a pattern. Can you help? OMG, OMG, bitcoin is used! Seriously? I don't care how many people use bitcoin. I just care for the few dozen people that know WHAT is Bitcoin, have LOTS of money at their disposal, and CAN MOVE the market. So you think retracement means the 5.1 that S is talking about? Exactly. Going doooown! At least for at least 5.1 Blitzboom is talking nonsence. How could he know that? He just want's cheap coins

My hypothesis is that asks could follow the bids. Anyway, for the result to be relevant this experiment should be repeated for a number of times.  Define large. Also, why against their benefit? That was my thought. Thank you! Let's see if others will follow and what impact it will have. You all know the saying. By ourselves we're weak. Together we're strong. I wonder if anyone would like to participate in this experiment: Put your bids to 2.4. I chose this mark so we'll be in the lower limit of the support line.At first I was thinking to ask the askers to put prices at about 3.6, but once the price would be there, we could see major sell-offs.So, join me with every bid you want (even $1), I want to see if we can move the market.I have a bid of 1000 at 2.40123 Let's show to this Manipulator who's in charge. Go get him speculators! We will hit 4 by tomorrow. Sell Sell Sell! Yes, i think that also! Breaking the $3 resistance will be very important and tough but I think we might see a reversal after this. Also if we break above 8-10 I'll reconsider Bitcoin as a currency. It will be more and more a commodity/investment. No major business will accept it as money if today it's 102 and tomorrow 106. Only if they cash out everything every evening. The best thing you can invest in is INDEPENDENCE. In knowledge, growing your own food, producing own energy, thinking without ait, being prepared for the worse.I don't wanna sound like a conspiracy-guy but I also believe there is a possibility that someday some powers will stage a false-flage alien attack. The frame is already in place, greyish aliens that kidnap people and cows, lot's of alien invasion movies. They need just some fancy technology and some casualties. Actually there is a fear-frame for everything: economic collapse, nuclear wars, pandemics, running low on resources. And since most are already afraid and framed-in, the only thing I need is to wait for sunset and flashlight my face to scare the shit out of people.On the other hand, if one is independent and thinks for it's own, how hard will be to scare him with "OMG, NO FOOD THIS YEAR". He'll just work harder to produce more. See the tribes people. What fears do they have, other than their gods and Earth's creatures? 350k usd in bid? What the hell is that? Oh, and beware. If euro fails there will be a war. If Euro melts down now (as in 2011) Bitcoin might be rallied in by some freedom-survivalist-dudes. It could make another high as people *think* they have an alternative. But will fall down hard because we have no economy to sustain it. But, if in 2012-2013 I can buy food, groceries, pay bills with bitcoin, when Euro falls, I see a huge rally, SF-style, with $50 today, 100 tomorrow and 500 the day after. Just sain' If the breakout is to $50 I'm in. I dreamed many times that I was watching Mtgox Live and the price was $6, then 10, then 100, then 2000 or so. In matter of seconds. I think a lot of normal people, and by "normal" I mean "not rich" people earned a lot of money (read: unrealized profit) by being an early adopter. Many had hundreds of thousands. Nowadays, very few hav these amounts because we witness a wealth redistribution. This makes me think that major sell-off and buy-off will be less and less happening, thus making price manipulation harder and harder. Assuming it will recover, do you think it will a slow-paced increase over years or we'll see prices doubling every week?I strongly feel that the next year will be decisive. Once global economy goes in the second wave of crisis, people will move away from fiat and stocks. Also next year is the halving to 25 BTC per block.
It seems the manipulator wants cheap coins and the price to fall under 2. Look at that bidwalls! It will be very hard to go under 2 I am curious to see if bitcoin supply will suffocate demand too much, making the never to recover.  is this titanic sinking in fireworks? how did you produce this image? i what wallet? Traded 300. Hard lesson.100 is max one should use. I am writing in here because I only speculate on exchanges not having funds.Bitcoin was intended to be a currency, not a commodity. Exchanges centralize bitcoins and practically kill the decentralized trading idea.While trying to get some funds out of MtGox for the past week (about $200 so no big deal) it struck me the following idea: What if they don't have money? One week is unacceptable and the lack of funds it is the best explanation I can get. So, where all the money went? I cannot simply see other reason to have Mtgox/Tradehill etc accounts if I cannot withdraw my money when I need it. Ahem... Other reason than speculating.So, I'm converting all my money into bitcoins minus $1000. Fucking stupid, while bitcoin goes down, right? Not really. I'm still short with a great amount on Bitcoinica and will use the 1k usd to buy at mtgox if bitcoin goes to $1. And yea, I could keep like $5000 in mtgox to buy at $1, but what the hell I'm gonna do with lots and lots of coins? Hoard them to be billionaire at 80? I need to eat today and tomorrow. I have my share of coins and I'm fine with it. And all my coins go out of MtGox, because I was stupid enough to keep there a great amount without thinking. I'm going to hibernation mode until economy is big enough to provide me things I want. LE: For the people that will compare me with the "I move all my savings to btc"-guy---- All my money are made selling coins. Not a single dollar bought. So even if BTC crashes to -1, i still had my share of profit. Sadly, down... Holy bit, we're going into the Dark Ages. What the hell will happen to bitcoin? Will it go underground? I think I've got it all wrong. I was thinking that the Manipulator is a guy with lots and lots of funds but never crossed my mind that it could be some kind of organization with pocket change. But the bidwall is HUGE. he could loose a ton of money if another dumps thousands of coins. Who the hell is this guy? And more important, what does he wants?I would assume he tries to win money either by: 1. stopping bitcoin going under $2 and make it successful, starting a rally2. long-term invest in cheap bitcoins You have so much money. Can you give me 1000 coins pls? To Obama-address  Difficulty is now 199569.39467 and will be 472334.32184  (136.68% growth) in about   1d 0hr 21m  according to allchains.infoWhat will happen to the price?And what will happen to the price when the diff gets equal with bitcoin?I suspect that namecoin will rally again to it's 0.07 BTC price again. Found it: http://bit.ly/aQCkLR I am very curious to see if it will go lower than 2.00. I'm pretty sure it will go lower than 2.04 but can't really tell if we can break the 1.xx psychological barrier. Yes. I introduced some friends that have years of trading experience and they had the same feeling on bitcoin. And while talking about this bitcoin thing they said "well, many stocks gone from $100 to $1 in matter of weeks, no need to panic. When stocks go really bottom, scavengers come and buy massively, reviving the stocks" It can it be a deliberate rise in the price, to sell at high price and then to buyback at a lower price. It seems that the guy(s) really know how to trade and use bots, want to profit A LOT (maybe driving prices lower than 2) and also they LIKE to play with the market. I feel a lot of ego. One of the best things lately. And that's why the Elliot Wave Theory that netrin and others placed here is real. Holy crap, I'm right again! I think a lot in the couple of days about litecoin. Can it be a success? Or it's just another scamcoin?84 million coins should be enough for an internet currency. Currency, not comodity, as Bitcoin tends to be. People could use it on SilkRoad, Alpaca Socks and other websites.One argument for it's success would be that once bitcoin takes off, many will look at it as an opportunity of buying lots of coins cheaply, and thus likely starting a rally. But if will have no economy, and will be purely speculative, it will soon die as the rest of alternate chains. 
Dear Santa,Going to bed now. Can I have my obama bitcoin address credited with 100 btc? Dear Santa,Can you pleaaaase drive the price to $4 by Monday? I wanna go long on bitcoinica after loosing some money there.PS: prepared cookies and milkThank you. I don't believe we're in a rally. Rally for me sounds like last summer's acceleration. We're more into a steady-paced climbing, with lots of mass that will be very hard to stop (high inertia). How do you use those bitcoins? 1 is gold? 2 How do I use the generated data? How do I use the address and privkey? Great app. But what do I do with the generated data? How do I get to use it? Yes. And bought a some thousand coins at 2.1 Interesting. Is this app generating thousands of addresses to find one that matches the searched string? if so, then there is collision possibility right? Offtopic: how do you generate those addresses with names in them? And then down? Dear Santa Manipulator,Can you please buy 1000 coins so we can get over 3.25 mark? Thank you. REASON:  RealSolid acts like a dictator, telling his followers when to buy, how much, what closed-source software to use and bans those who talk or ask questions. Intel estimates that tens are persecuted after asking him to be open-source. He is also acting like a religious leader, making prophecies and promising wealth and financial salvation. BELLIGERENTS: Between 1200 and 2000 Solidcoin adepts and miners and the Free Cryptocoalition (bitcoin, namecoin, litecoin and hopefully ixcoin, i0coin, tenebrix miners and users). Pay attention to the Solidcoin supernodes that own 12,000,000 coins and enforce their leader's ideas.METHODS OF ATTACK: First, we should stop speaking of Solidcoin on Bitcoin's forum. Nothing to see here, move away. Secondly, please stop mining. Please stop purchasing solidcoins. This is an unreasonable request since the solidcoins seem to be a good speculative currency. But be careful, you can get burned. Thirdly: find a way to attack their network.Let's make it so the madman cannot get himself rich by centralizing people's wealth and cast him away in the Australian outback. God bless cryptography! Dear Santa Manipulator. The legend said that the digital space of the bitcoin economy is controlled by a man whose wisdom and powers are great. He has cash and coins at his disposal and can make people get rich or poor quickly. I am now convinced that you exist because I've seen footsteps of your coindeers on the charts. So, can you please make the price pass $3.1 in the next 12 hours?I will tell all other fellow members of the forum to write you letters, each day. The thing is almost always the price rallied a bit, someone dumped a few thousand coins killing the rally. This cannot be predicted by any technical analysis . So no new lower lows? Can you please explain? I'm amazed how many babysteps the price makes. Are we going to $4? +1 for the price part-1 for the get out cash part. I don't think Mtgox will runaway with our money. Bitcoins can be stored in one's wallet and move them when needed. But cash takes a 2 days at least.
I like namecoin, is the alt currency that tried to give something. I hope it will be adopted on large scale.Once it gets to 1 NMC per domain, I'm gonna open up some businesses How much do you want to sell? Go to the trade page of the wiki to find stores. 12 millions premined?? Experimentally Solidcoin is an interesting phenomena. People mine and buy in the snowball effect and the guy who let the snowball away owns the snow, the slope and gets to change temperature. So far Solidcoin with all it's silliness it's more valuable than litecoin. Also, don't you think enforcing control will make it last a little longer? Longer than litecoin for example. Lines on graph or it won't happen. So you guys think we're at the start of a rally?  [/quote]Clearly you are an experienced investor, since you've quickly seen through the facade of Bitcoinica and Zhoutong's posts. Also clearly, you must rely on somebody's else opinions about the actual underlying technology.[/quote]What Bitcoinica facade? You call it a scam? How did you make this graph? 27k is not enough to sustain the $3 price IMO. You transfer money w/o syncing the wallets? Exactly how the most experienced people said! It's fun to watch but until bitcoin will have a solid economy, high prices can't be sustainable. We really need a more services and shops accepting BTC. Price going dowwn! ?? I get application error.Cool isn't it? N00bs playing with money again. The from where do the money come?If I know bitcoin will be 4, and I buy at 3.10 (with breakeven at 3.20) and I put in 100 dollars (500, with 1:5 leverage) then I'll ear a lot! Never used Bitcoinica and I don't understand how it works. If the prices are on a clear trend, can Bitcoinica make profit? Because if it's clear for even the most outsider that bitcoin price rises, he buys and waits. Profit comes. Then stop, and redo.How does this works?  Looks like the market gives second chances. Someone dump 20,000 coins and get some good money.@netrin: but what if we were at C-5-II? @netrin: are we going to point 4 now? Actually he informed in his subscriptions about the possibility of a recovery, at least short-term. And he was bullish before the lower low, but gave it only 60% chances to rally. 
Maybe I'm wrong but aren't we climbing slowly? Even if it's too soon to say please discuss this. I remember those times. But this one is a bit larger. Also you'd need about 4000 coins to touch the big vertical line. http://imagebin.org/179615Someone set a ~$39,000 bidwall. Could be even larger, I counted only what's at 2.5. What impact can this have? Could be. But if they saw this decline, won't do big moves. Big moves will do people that want to move funds. Easily, securely and maybe anonymously. LOWEST POINT SO FAR SINCE 32. I'm not a moron that thinks bitcoin traded first for $10. Hi. Can we find out or corroborate data to compute the world-wide price to generate 1 BTC? Also per-country reports would be nice. You are right, but value cannot simply drop forever. If it goes to 0.5 many people will buy. And it's up to $1 again. If it goes to $1.5, fewer than "many" will buy, but still the price can stabilize or rise to 1.7. Anyway, we need stability after this decline. Today, 17th October 2011 Bitcoin went to a $2.20 per unit low. Lowest point so far. Lower than the average price needed to produce a coin. On the way down, almost all of the speculators sold. I know lots of people lost money and I'm sorry for them. Some made profit, but nothing to blame.  Now there is a real change, and people will start to use bitcoin as a currency and buy things otherwise not available easily or anonymously.Rally? Dunno, don't care. I do care about shopping for Christmas with some coins. EDIT: Oh, and try to differentiate us from bitcoin. Bitcoin is still a success, has a great price and now major flaws were discovered. It was just speculators (in all their forms: traders, miners, hoarder) got screwd. Including I. Never sold a coin until $6. And generated some with CPU... What's this reversal about? Rally? How can we rally when there is a massive input of coins from mining each day? People will be deceived one more time?Does reversal mean no more decline and a stable price? When I started I had $0 and thousands of coins. How could I have bought? We will see. Bitcoin is great for what it was intended, a decentralized secure digital currency not a speculative currencomodity.Prices go down, and as S3052 sais, weak hands sell, weak people that bought up to 32 believing it will be 100 by the end of the year. Bitcoin's price is irrelevant, it matters what we can do with it. Sure, it will worth a lot in the future but now it's a weapon to fight globalization an mass-control. That's why I won't sell more than I need to.Also, I do this thing, and bet others do it too. Sell, then buy-back more at a lower price. Just to earn more. So people trust and want to use bitcoin but not (yet) at over than $4. Got them. Sent 8 more also. Nice to do business. Post when you have confirmations on all 16. You can reuse this LTC address: LRdfubTGj7D8NMW9Eh6PBiF9rJTbEtGbdsSent 8 BTC for the first 1000 to make it faster. 8ed88c05c2a9183666c14c1a038957b868f908954018a0cca309b2fdc58cd46b Buying 2000 up to 10000 for 0.008 per coin. Make offers. I will buy them all 4600 for 34.5 bitcoin (rate 0.0075). We should do this in chunks of 2300. Send 2300 to LTKcRybcn3tTENPgLvk2fdghMZgXBQHBpdand wait for the first payment of 17.25. After we get a fair enough no. of confirmations we can proceed to the second chunk. Stop talking about solidcoin and it will die away. Your thinking is far too precious to waste on a delusional aussie that proclaim himself God of the Cryptocoins and gather a massive number of brainwashed followers to praise his every keystroke.  If you sell precious metals at a price a little higher than spot you're the best!!! Looking forward to buy maple leafs! 0,006 now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyTWMnGaU7U&feature=relatedCoinHunter is delusional. I didn't take the bet!!
Manipulate yourself. Someone set up a huge buy wall. ~45,000 dollars. I think that will hold. I want them Awkward moment. Math problems also. Drooling.000d4386e531d4b1f277f03c1e89cf720f70724f552c6a373b16f3a176c28972 Actually it was bragging. I wanted people to see bullishness. I bought a day later about 2000 coins. Why do you want that? AFAIK you killed i0coin, ixcoin solidcoin et al. Generating when you could do that with CPU and back when people gave for free 300 coins just because you were new. Didn't you have an EC or something that could mine thousands? Don't really follow you. Would you invest more in litecoin? 25b73458d438fa7b22befaa2c11a09d2256ce26549fe544d0f769554eedc2623send litecoins to: LTKcRybcn3tTENPgLvk2fdghMZgXBQHBpd Ok. I want 5000.LE: Daaamn! 500! Five hundred! Yes, but even 1 bitcoin for 2000 was overevaluated. Sorry, first transaction 1 btc = 5000  ltc I want to buy Litecoins! I will offer 1 bitcoin for 5000 coins. Let's be the first to trade! Oh, no, please don't. We need your faith! What stuff? I have some guidelines I follow and wish to share, so the current decline in bitcoin prices can reverse.I know everybody dreams to get rich by owning bitcoins but we have to concentrate more on the track and less on the finish line. While running, consider doing some or all of these:1. Aquire some Bitcoins, I would say minimum 50 as an investement, hoarding and for the black day that will come. Bitcoin is a revolutionary currency and worth owning. Imagine it like buying 50 ounces or silver and storing them. Store them offline not in some payment processor because bitcoin is decentralize by nature.2. Purchase some coins monthly and spend them for goods and services in Bitcoin's economy. 10 coins are enough for this. Buy some alpaca socks or make some bets. If could also use them to buy things from Amazon, there is a great website that helps you to do so.3. If you have resources, time and knowledge consider setting up a small website. Services are the easiest thing you can do. Anything from coaching to teaching languages and computer skills.4. Speak about it. Bitcoin equals freedom and you should speak about it to your friends and relatives. Many won't care and few will be interested. But "bitcoin" is not a hard word to remember and they will hear it again. Help them buy some and spend them. Give them advice and warn them NOT to be emotional enough to buy 1000 hoping they'll be billionares.5. Speculate less. Profit is good, is nice to sell 1000 coins at 4.5 and buy them back at 4. But most people buy-back 1125 and that means they are interested in bitcoins not money, thus being bullish long-term.6. Imagine this is the first time YOU have total control of your money. It requires some skills to master them but the effect is great. Of course, one person wishing bitcoin to be successful won't help. It requires great many people.  And there will be more, attracted by the low price. Now lot's of people afford to have 20 coins. it's like buying silver. You don't need to buy tons. Buy some ounces, store them and if enough people buy a few, everybody will be rich. Wealth exists in the world, but if it's distributed to 5% of the people this means POORNESS. If you redistribute it (of course, not equally), everybody's standard's rise. Based on the previous experience of bitcoin going from 1 to 32, and provided a RALLY would start now, is there a way to determine how fast it could go to that point again and even higher?I am currently being bullish on bitcoin because I see that it won't dip below 3.80.  Difficulty raised from 8 to 6. Hilarious. False positives. $2.5 might be the lower point ever and be might be on our way to a rally with points as $50, $80 and even $101.And we don't need a good economy for that, we don't need to use bitcoin as currency.. We just have to wish. "The Secret"
Not crashing but would impact to some extent. Are gonna keep the coins or dump them? This was it? Double bottom? I am watching lots of activity on mtgox. WE ARE SPARTA! Are we starting a rally after the double bottom? We had ixcoin and i0coin that are dead now. Many people lost money after they bought this coins with Bitcoin.  How this impacted bitcoin's price, if it did?Also we now have Tenebrix and Solidcoin 2.0 in a few days. Will people move their assets to a better coin, like SC2 claims to be, or they'll generate the CPU-friendly one?  It's a certainty that EVERYBODY, even the investors that bought at $14 think and want the price to be lower in order to buy more. But if it drops too low, can it recover? What if we're committing suicide? On the other had, if price sparks up to 4.7 MANY will sell, wanting to buyback at 3 I have faith in bitcoins. As freedom currency. Price matters less. Not least, less. I, like many others, was too bullish to see that it can go down. Actually I was hoping someone else would dump 50,000 in an older post. I know that it could be beneficial. Until this month I sold just about 100 coins. I wish I would have sold at 32, 24 or even 10. So far I set up a small bidwall, at 4.01 to have some gain from bitcoins if this goes really down.LE: 3.98  But you would risk in something else? Stocks? Forex? I can come up with 50,000. Me + 4 friends. What would that do? 'BUY BUY BUY" or "SELL SELL SELL" ?https://i.imgur.com/3xMUf.jpg Is there something that can be done to make bitcoin rally again? What should happen?Maybe more publicity? The early-adopters sell more so the price gets lower and more appealing?  60 or 30? Hoarding and speculating got us here. If people sell (some) of their tens of thousands, they will be evenly dispersed,. I would also suggest everyone to destroy 2% of their coins to raise up the value. Then I ask the mighty Gods that have power on their encrypted hard rives to pour some bulks of 10,000 on us mortals so the price goes lower.  I know there are some guys owning > 50,000 bitcoins? why they don't sell? PERSONAL VIEWS:Namecoin: has a technical usage, can be regarded as bitcoin's silver. TrustworthyIxcoin: lame and dead. Made about 50 bitcoins while speculating.i0coin: lame and dead also. Made about 15 bitcoins whule specilating.Solidcoin: the chain being shut down doesn't inspire me to buy some. So far i can see the effort put in the project but not the results.Tenebrix: Appreciated but will make 1 guy so rich. I never touched it.Fairbrix: mined 8 blocks and the coins vanished. shut down the miner and deleted the little prick while had a big grim. GeistgGeld: didn't tried it. Here is my work for your logo: https://imgur.com/uMOr7 Give it 2 hours. Everybody is excited right now. It will go down again, no need to struggle.  No. It has to be either up or down.
So what's next? further decline? Or he saved bitcoin? 4.20??? WTF? Hell with this. Bitcoin won't die. SELL SELL and bring down that wall! I want $2.9! then stop. Just 1000 What happens if I would sell 1500? So true. I would like anyone in the world have the chance to buy 1 bitcoin. It would be great. Dot ask how I came up with this: http://bit.ly/qKCavvIt's the finaaal countdooown... 3.99? Anyone? Do I hear a 4.01? They had like 8,000! This is panic selling coming from the big guys! 8,000 or less. B7 was small. The lowest low will be lower lol It's just a matter of days. I would expect 3.7. For now. +1 Indeed. I was hoping we're gona be at 5 like years. Not good! We're on our way to 3.5!! Ok. Can It go to 4.41?
Yes, but from which point? Can it go lower than 4.40? What do you think? Is the current low enough to say the support was broken? Are we heading to a new low? Or we will go about 4.20 and then rally very strong?Also does this bid wall help? What do you mean? You have a point here. But so far MtGog is not emptygoxed Lower than 4.18? Bluff? Too many noobs are playing with people's money. It is good to have more than 2 exchanges but not this way. Did they say how many bitcoins were stolen? damn! Price is DOWN! Please expand this. How do you see the precious market then? And why 2012? A Great Depression and WW3 (a 3rd generation war) are very likely to happen.  I was thrilled by the start of the rally the other week. Many people were also, "rally" was the most prominent word out here. But where is it? It was just a spike on our way to a new Low? It's $4.93 right now. What do you expect the price to do? Go up or down or sideways, how much and why? Gold, Silver and Stocks are DOWN. Why would bitcoin be different? And what would be the current price for creating a coin? The average of course. Did really Buffet said that? And he's a billionaire? Twisted world. I believe that the price will go near the 4.5 support line. But never breaking it. And what do you predict nex? I would like that before the rally bitcoin to be something about $2, and everybody have the chance to buy some. Also I say again, bitcoin should be used as MONEY more! A new speculative rally, even with "new highs up to $100" means nothing if 6 months after this 1 BTC = 4 USD. Banks were invented to help a handful of people control most of world's resources. Banks acting as third parties in transactions aren't the only thing banks do. Wake up Neo GPG signing works only in theory? Amazon will and should sign their payment address. You now have your proof. I wonder how many bitcoins has the richest bitcoin owner. 
Cosbycoin, on what did you based your prediction? So far you are right but if it doesn't get down and this is the start of a little rally? We saw a fall, then a stagnation at about $4.70. Will it go up to 6, maybe $7 again, then fall back to $4? Bitcoin has to weed out speculators before a new, huge rally. For 2 days volatility was less than 50c. Wow! I don't realize what happens. Can please someone explain? How he can save us? Isn't this bad for bitcoin? why is that? Lol. I can buy 1000. Anyone else? Yeah, I saw the moonco.in. Fabolous!@anu: price down for 3 days would be a crash for me, otherwise just a spike down.  What do you mean? I had a buy order at 5.1 and never got filled. Other had sell order at 9-10 usd, never filled also.MtGox feed incorrect info, or somebody hacked it to spread panic. I had a buy order at 5.1 and never filled. 4.85 never happen I mean, moving bitcoins to mtgox in order to sell? You mean large BTC sales? I bet on $100 that bitcoin will crash to $2. I am certain because everytime it crashed, it first went up 1-1.5 dollars. Today happened the same, from 4.7 to 6 or more.  This spike to 6 usd is not good. Same thing happened a few days ago. from 6.4 to 7.8 or so... Then crashed bigtime! I'm in.www.ayarikubazar.com Off topic: Di youd ran the e-commerce website on your own? How did it grow so much? I like bitcoin and I also support other cryptocurrencies. But bitcoin is currency and was RARELY used for that in the last year. Bitcoin was not designed to make me or you wealthy, was designed for us to get out from bank's control.Also please keep in mind that bitcoin is unique, the first of it's kind so its problems are unique. I believe that in year 1 bitcoin will be more than $100. But that will happen slowly and only after the economy is very flourishing.So, the solution I see is that people starts to buy and sell things using bitcoin. I would like to say that since I've opened my store in April, more than 150 people bought from me. But just 10 using bitcoins.I am not telling to buy from me, my shop is not very interesting for men, which are the most bitcoin users. But in order bitcoin to succed, you hav3e to buy.I will keep the exchange rate at +1$ even if 1 BTC = $1 and I hope I will be a good incentive. More than this, I can't see what I could do. I speak for myself.Shots to cash out were also at 10, 12, 20 , 31. Indefinite numbers of shots actually.Bitcoin is not a bubble and will not die. Not because I don't want to, because WE ALL NEED IT.  If the price must go down, so be it. Can't be, a lot of people would buy. So even if it goes, it has to go ver very slowly so people realize that is pure-bearness and move out of btc.
I so love the enthusiasts that see a rally in a turtle's walk! 7 is nothing. 8 is almost nothing. 8.5 would steal a smile from me. at 9, it's like a 70-year old having sex. again this month. 10 and 11 go hand in hand but I wouldn't jump out of my seat. 12 is what I want. But I won't get too soon. Do you guys see the way I'm seeing the recent price spikes from 6.12 to 7.59?I believe that these spikes will get smaller and smaller on the way to $5, even lower. I mean, hard to believe that there will be a low 4, and then a high 5.5. I, if price would be 0.666 The Hell is downways! How many parents do you think there are in here? I personally love bitcoin but can't see any incentive to buy, buy, buy as some people shout in here. I am still bearish and I invite other bears to a nice, argumented conversations. I would also invite bulls, if they can hold themselves with the "buy,buy,buy" thing. I understand that they have to manipulate psychologically, or at least to try but... Enough is enough.Here are my reasons for the lower price that will come:1. It's the middle of the week. Historically, people trade more actively.2. It's just a little spike from the low of $6.123. Bitcoin had a tremendous year but it's price will go low. Not very low, I expect 4-5 USD. Prices of $1-2 are insane, I'd buy 1000, so would others and well be at 30 in no time. Wow. 6.65! Prices might go up? Can you please explain with more details for a n00b? Phishing. Nothing new. lol, threads influencing prices?? Because of people that speculated them and used them as commodity. Bitcoin is a currency. Sure, we could it as a commodity in a few years whenaskk and offer ratio will be in the sky, but I believe most of us forgot to use it because of what it is. A good, bank-free method to buy things. And services. So, as a merchant, I'm waiting the prices to go around $5 (even lower, but lower than $2-3 would be not good) and people start shopping (again).I don't really care about the prices, I feel sad for people that loose speculating, also fell happy for the one that make some profit.  The solidcoin website has a bounty of 250 solidcoins for the first 9 shops that accept SDC. I went to IRC on #solidcoin and talked to RealSolid, who replied:RealSolid: its subjective whether or not your vendor bounty gets acceptedbecause i also accept IXcoin on my website, and that looks scammy to him. If i accept IXC it should be my business, I will loose if their value goes down. I wasn't granted the bounty and I didn't like his practice of trying me to drop off ixcoin. Make me think twice about accepting new currencies.Anway, do you think I should drop off solidcoin, ixcoin or both? dis-info, panic-spreading, rumor-planting = good money-making techniques since 10,000 BC I would like to know what would be the cost for ixcoin, solidcoin and namecoin payment modules for OpenCart version 1.5.1I want the simplest thing: it gives an predefined address for each currency and when I receive payment, I flag the transaction as Complete and deletes the address.I would like hear suggestions also. [/quote]It's because of two effects:1) The global economy is tanking and will crash really hard, into the biggest crash in the past 250 years, which means this will be bigger than 1929. Silver specifically will crash real hard because i) it is used as industrial metal much more than gold, and once industrials turn down even harder, demand for silver will collapse. ii) silver prices have also been largely driven up by speculators , and many of them will run to the exit once the economy gets worse.2) The charts are supporting the Silver decline. The last 2 months of advance is choppy and is best interpreted by a upward correction, which will be followed by a large decline below 30 $ in a swift move. Secondly, Silver is underperforming Gold, which is a leading indicator for most of the financial markets. The Silver / Gold ratio is down hard since spring 2011.When would I be wrong?Only if Silver makes a new high above 50$. But even if this happens, the crash is just postponed and Silver prices will eventually come back below 10 $ in the next 2-5 years.[/quote]Isn't silver better than fiat in times of distress? Aren't precious metals supposed to be a safe heaven for people during crisis?Silver and gold are "precious" for thousands of years. What if a new kind of crisis would come? Would their prices plummet to earth? So far you have to contact us prior to placing an order, no automated means of payment. But I would ship you a brooch or pair of earrings if you wanna do the modules Also I will post daily rates for both NMC and IXC. I can't keep track with all new currencies. I will look into solidcoins and maybe add them too. Other suggestions are also welcome!LE: SolidCoin accepted! AyarikuBazar.com accepts namecoins and ixcoins. The payment will be done manually as I have no automated payment module.To cut my losses I have set the rates (24.08.2011):1 NMC = 0.028 BTC1 IXC = 0.0008 BTC1 SDC = 0.0062 BTCI will wait and see how many of the early-adopters of Solidcoin, IXCOIN and NMC (that have tens of thousands) are willing to actually use it as currency and not only speculate. I can bet that the sells will be low or 0 but I'll wait and see.Feel free to comment.THIS TOPIC WILL BE UPDATED DAILY. I need money and I want to sell some bitcoins. I want to do it on the exchangers since I was scammed by freako77@hotmail.com on PayPal.I don't know how to sell. How long does it gets until I get paid by bank wire? Does it works on weekends? Should I wait for monday, maybe also get a better price? Do I have to have an USD bank account? I have only an EUR one.Thanks Ok. I've upgraded the PS too. Please give an address since I have not paid the pledge yet!
Thank you for the module. Please give me your address by pm so i can send you money. Thanks!PS. It won't install on PrestaShop 1.4.0.17. I get "An error occurred while copying archive to module directory."  Hi, I pledge 2 BTC if the module can use bitcoind and 1BTC if it uses an online wallet.Also I'll offer a gift from my shop (which is more for women, so the dev can give it to his mother/sister/wife/gf)PS: Also has to be 1.4.4 compatible. Updating would be nice and I'll also pledge for any updates. I remember that reading the info on their site I saw that they keep just one wallet and a database of each users amount and transactions. So, If there were a total of 50,000 BTC in there, from 5000 users it would be like the fractional reserve. Not all people would withdraw at the same time, so the MyBitcoin dudes could take little by little. It's just a presumption... Can you please pm me your e-mail address used to create an account with us? I would like to check your order status. Thank you for the suggestions. They will be met by the end of September. My service as in silver provider or as in accessories for women? 2 more days, then they'll definitely be on my blacklist with red strains I had some bitcoins there. All of my store's operational budget. Also I will admit we were scammed. How much time passed so far with mybitcoin down? Sorry for that. For me it works fine. Please don't pay anything until I confirm so, my website uses the mybitcoin interface and since there are some problems with theyr website is best to wait.Also, if you want to buy silver coins, please consider to buy at least 2. Would be to have 12 packages to be prepared instead of 25. Anyway, it's optional. I know a lot of people are concerned for their bitcoins. Some should really be, like Bruce, if he actually had 25,000 in mybitcoin.com. But let's be fair and wait, cast the stone after we have all the facts. The guys seemed so far very legit, did a lot of things so our BTC be safe. I might be wrong on that, be we should wait and see. They deserve the presumption of innocence.So, please wait a couple of days and accuse then. I personally had this issue some months ago when I said about someone he's a thief. Later I found out the lad was out of town and his server went down. I ship from Romania. And the site is working! Site is not down: http://www.ayarikubazar.com/en/Check my posts, I've did both artwork for bitcoins and some trades like selling silver for namecoins.  Wait more time, maybe it's just a server fault. For me would be something like 55 BTC, the entire operational budged of my website.  Hi,My shop, www.ayarikubazar.com, sells Silver Maple Leaf coins for customers worldwide with USD and EUR - please note that the price is . I only had a few clients using Bitcoins but everything worked out right. Now, I was thinking to get aggressive and do some real silver trading in bitcoins. The only thing is I have to sell at least 25 ounces at once to keep my risks low, as I buy 100 or more at a time. I can't afford do wait 6 months to sell a bulk of 25 ounces in Bitcoins. Today, I would sell them at 3.81 bitcoins without shipping (which can't possibly be more than .3 BTC for 1-5 ounces, and a max 1.8 BTC for all 25). So, if I have where to sell 25 ounces (you can buy 1, 2 or all 25) in the next 48 hours the price for each 3.8, the lowest price you'll ever see. You can subscribe on a waiting list and pay 3.81 + shipping. If in the next 48 hours the bulk of 25 is sold, I keep your Bitcoins and ship your package right away (yes, I do have silver in stock). After which I light myself a cigar and sell the coins on MtGox. If not, I'll have to refund you your bitcoins and try another time. Also, if this experiment works out, I could lower the price more.Please comment and subscribe. 6.7 BTC? Do you ship from the US? Do I have to pay customs for it? Hello. Are you willing to be a partner and post them in my store? You can be paid in bitcoin, euro or usd. We'll just negociate a small percent and that's about it. One of the sources is a Romanian journalist that found about bitcoin about 6 months ago. He also recently spoke about it on TV.They found about bitcoin from him - I bet you understand how.Also a lot of clients use Tor.  It's not a secret CIA dudes read this forum. I tried for long time to keep my nationality obscured but eventually I've blown it.I've also found out that Romanian Intelligence Service keeps noting on Romanians that use Bitcoin. Not for the security of the state but for personal reasons. Please note that in Romania, a country with 22.000.000 people there are officially 200.000 mobile phone taps.I would really like to know if they can access IP addresses or other data in this forum (chats, pms).Secondly, I will make appeal to all bitcoiners, in all countries to post in here ANY SUSPICIONS they have on being read, watched etc.We live in Romania and this ocuppies all of our time. Never got it how XMPP works. Can I use a client like Pidgin, and if I own mydommy.com to talk to people on Yahoo, Gtalk, MSN using an account like wobby@mydommy.com? I was reluctant to accept bitcoin since it's value went so high but here it is:http://www.ayarikubazar.com/en/16-model-railroading* What you see there is just a quarter of what I have. Since everything I will put in that category is less than 350 BTC, I wonder if someone with many bitcoins from the golden ages to come and buy all of it. Wait and see, wait and see...Or maybe you can buy everything with like 15 bitcoins when bitcoin will be $100. I see that people are not using bitcoin as money anymone. Nobody really buys things with them, most of trades are MtGox trades. Sad, because bitcoin, as well as gold, is intended to be money, not an object for speculation. Because almost everyone has some bitcoins used as a mean to store value.Anyway, look at this example. A chicken grower sells a chicken for $5. A bitcoin is also equal to $5. This means a chicken = 1 bitcoin. But since USD/BTC ratio is less constant than chicken/USD ratio, nobody will use that coin to buy chicken. They'll sell the coin for dollars, hoping for more than $5. If they'll get $6 for the coin, they can buy the chicken with 5 and also a coke for 1. So what do we do about that? 
I did a logo for: http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/What do you think of it? http://imgur.com/8f1OpIf I get positive feedback I might give them a mail, maybe they want it. Geek but he did a big DDoS. I wonder how. If we can get 12 more orders by the end of this weekend, all in bitcoins, we will drop PayPal. As loudly as we can, informing customers that PP is no longer supported and guiding them to buy with BTC. What if it's Grigori Perelman? Cryptography and programming wouldn't be hard to learn and he also fits the behavioral profile. Would it work on the Prestashop 1.4? I can create a logo for BitcoinKarma.com. Any elements you would like to see in the design? only bash. but learning python and php Satoshi bought all Chuck Norris facts. Satoshi fact: Bankers cry like babies when Satoshi touches a keyboard. I am willing to do community service, up to 1 hr per day. The only thing is I need to be told what to do. So, I will donate one hour per day to the Bitcoin project. I can also help others to launch, maintain, et al their services. I have some computer skills, I'm very well organized, and if I don't know how to do something I'll learn it. OFFTOPIC: how can i create a qr code like yours? with animation? How would it work offline? I mean, it would work, but it has to have some data to start with. And every transaction since you last updated the software won't be available. I need a little program, more like a game. Because it's an offense to your skills to pay you what you asked, I will pay you 5 BTC for this.So, the program must:1. Work on windows (not necessarily compiled, I can run it as a python script for example)2. Be commented so a n00b that's learning, to understand the codeProgram does this1. Takes from config.txt following data: $NUMBER_OF_IMAGES_TO_SHOW, $TIME_TO_SHOW, $MORE_IMAGES2. From a folder, it takes $NUMBER_OF_IMAGES_TO_SHOW (that are .JPEG files of the same dimensions) and presents to a user for $TIME_TO_SHOW each one.3. Then, it scrambles all these and adds $MORE_IMAGES so the user recognize the ones presented to him.4. Shows percentage and saves it to record.txt along with the date and hourIt's a memory program I want to play with (JPEGS will be photos of objects etc). So, possible scenarios:1. Satoshi is a group of people. Subscenario 1: Founded by some powerful entity, to create an experiment or destroy banking system. Or make drug trafficking easier.2. Satoshi is dead. He didn't really knew that bitcoin might have such success, he died before seeing it growing so much and that's all.Subcenario 1: Satoshi was killed because of Bitcoin.3. Satoshi is affraid of Bitcoin and how it turned up. 4. Satoshi is a person that has no life other than programming (21.000.000% nerd) and he creates things under different identities. Maybe was behind Napster too.5. Satoshi is ET or AI or GOD or S8TN I saw that too.. bogus.  WTF dude? I'm in here since this was like an uber-secret masonic club with a handful of members. Ok. Who is the owner of this website? How things are going? Someone HAS to know him.Who purchased bitcoin.org? If that's even his name. Just read the bitcoin wiki on him and I'm amazed. Nobody knows him.Long time passed since he last posted in here. Why? "Busy"? I don't think so. He was active when bitcoin needed support but since the slashdot...Also, it seems has knowledge in many areas, especially economy. He doesn't act like the average human. Not taking advantage out of his creation, leaving without telling anything. Is he even a single person or a group?How can someone create something so great and not stepping out to get the credit?  I'm interested in this. Why people trade? Are there just newcomers that want bitcoins to spend, experiment a little and they buy? Or most of traders speculate the prices?Or it's more like a game?  And it seems is going down again...
In order to stimulate the Bitcoin economy and expand the business, we're ready to do partnerships. AyarikuBazar.com being a bazaar, also accepts all kinds of stuff you might have for sale. You'll just have to describe, measure, weight and photograph the objects according to our standards and we can list it for as low as 5% of the price you're asking for. We also provide the documentation, how the items must be packed, shipped etc, since we can only list the item, confirm the payment and then send you the address and name of the buyer. It won't work on Prestashop 1.4 nobody? I was thinking of making Bitcoin Payments easier for people who don't have time or knowledge to use exchangers, wallets and so on.It should work like this:I negotiate to the merchants to accept my service. This should be free for both.The customer enters the website, sees some alpaca socks he likes and because he does not have any bitcoins he pays with bitpal.The transaction is carried on like this:Customers pays with his credit/debit card and fills in the data just like using PayPal OR, better, those credit card processors that you don't need an account with. Only thing is the site the client is in has to have registration. Then, once the payment is cleared, the system takes the bitcoins (from a pool of btc within BitPal) that are equal to the USD, EUR or whatever the customer payed with and transfers them to the sellers account. After that, BitPal should move the money to buy some more BTC and recirculate them.The biggest issue here are the prices. How much a Bitcoin at BitPal should cost, so BitPal would be covered and maybe make some profit but to also make the client interested.  S3052, do you really think bitcoin will value $10? 30 BTC bounty for whoever makes this work on PS 1.4. It won't save the orders, but procesesse payments correctly. Please also add: http://www.ayarikubazar.com to the Trade page. Silver and Gold will top in the next 4 weeks and then decline for months. Silver down to below 30, then to 20 $ and below 10$S, That's what you said on your twitter account. Why do you think that? The world's commodities are up in the sky and with the possible W global crisis I bet gold will be above $2000 by mid 2012 and silver somewhere to $100. Not to mention wars that are yet to come, civil unrests etc and US economy is F-ED up. By Ben.Also silver is very undervalued and gold is overvalued. The ratio is way off center and this is another supporting argument. Do you provide the contacts or the employers have to find them themselves?A weekly salary would be nice, like a part-time job. Added the Bitcoin logo fimo brooch. Will also add earrings and a knitted sweater with the Bitcoin logo.Future plans include metallic rings, molded as bitcoin logo.http://www.ayarikubazar.com/en/brooches/97-bitcoin-brooch.html Romania.UPDATE: I have a banner space for whoever wants to take it. We could do a barter, you put a banner to my website and I put one to yours. Haha, yes, I forgot to paste the code: PROMO2011Also, the mybitcoin module was deactivate. It should work now. Thanks for your interest. What about gold and silver? Silver is now almos $40 per ounce. Do you think this is a top? Yes, memvola, I changed some things at the back office. Sorry for that, was unintentional. For you and for others: I will wait some 6 to 8 hrs after I receive and order, so you'll have time to change your minds. If I don't ship the items, It doesn't cost me anything to cancel an order.Here is the code for a 25% percent discount coupon for any product that is not in Silver and Clothing categories. Minimum order: 15 euro or equivalent. Each person may use the voucher only once and there are 10 vouchers available. Expires on May 1st. Would like to give tip to Nick for the ball advice. PM me your address please  There's a problem with mybitcoin payment module. The correct price is shown during checkout. I sent you an e-mail with the btc address and your file. You now have full rights on the logos. http://www.ayarikubazar.comThis e-shop provides goods in 3 brands:1. Ayariku handmade: products created by hand (ie painted, pottery, crafted, 2. Ayariku handmade: products made in house (soaps, candles, beverages, cakes, food - in the future)3.

Also please notify me if you found bugs.FUTURE PLANS:1. Drop PayPal and bank wire and accept only bitcoin (when bitcoin purchases = the rest of purchases)2. Spanish, French, Chinese and German translations3. New CSS design (will be a pledge in btc) The balls were not perfectly round but now they are. I modified the 8 also.http://imgur.com/gCrqlPlease notify me when, where and what format you want the file in Thank you , thank you, thank you!
Are there sources for creating a market? Would be awesome for people not so good with coding and who want to relate bitcoin to other currencies. You want the second or the third one? is it okay a .CDR format? I'm not selling it anymore. But people can sell even .jpgs, if they created the content. oh, ok. auction closed then! that image I'm selling it. Please bid in 1 BTC increments. Bidding starts from 10 BTC and will end on April 6th, 22:00 CETI don't know if I'll have time to transform this into a comic book, but that was the idea. This is the one you liked, modified: And this is a new one: http://imgur.com/Rikq8 I don't like my fist creation. Here's another one:  http://imgur.com/PReuS I have to work more at the "P" element. http://imgur.com/Zm7VC Here you are. http://imgur.com/rjdlHFor any other changes, feel free to tell.And this is my bitcoin address: 19NVKU8GUaM27JhXsQWzkGs5Ht9BXb3J19Tell me where you want me to send your file. bitlotto, can you please answer to my question? I will change them as of today. Would you also like me to follow Nick's advice? Please tell me when this need updates. Yes. http://imgur.com/nRrUc This is one with the balls more like lotto balls (variation on the same theme) http://imgur.com/ytDq1 http://imgur.com/srWyAEDIT: and a ellegant 3-clour scheme for it: http://imgur.com/mRNei I will add political, comodities and and a few others. I do not have much time, so I won't put any other sports bets there. Maybe just F1 and boxing. Both gold and silver prices went down after the Japan incident. Bitcoin too. But this won't last. The money injection that Japan did will gave more momentum to the economic disaster that is yet to come.  Yes, I did mistakes but you should also check if the site works or not. I will work harder, so you don't have to repair my mistakes. I know that when you had to close the site for the first time you gave back what people had in their accounts. Still, we have to have better communication.As we share profit, I am willing to share guilt too.
Would you give classes? Over Skype and remote desktop? I believe so. Shame on him. They open every package that comes from outside of the EU, at the customs. If you have no invoice (not necessarily in the package, you can have it on you) you're f-ed. If the invoice has a very low price on it, they have a catalogue with products and the customs officer will apply VAT (24%) and customs tax on them. For silver I there are 0 taxes but 24% VAT. I'm the only one that believes in creationism?! As you maybe know, I wanted to buy BitBet.org. The seller wanted more, I wanted to pay less so I sais: "why don't I maintain the site and we'll split in half the profit". WARIus, bitbet's  developer and owner agreed and made me admin. I added bets, people lost and won. About a week ago, the webiste went down, WARIus doesn't respond to any of my messages. I had my own 12 BTC in there + my share of the profit.Judge for yourself what happened.Anyway, I don't know how many others had bitcoins in there, that I bet weren't refunded. Shame! Sorry, I checked and I have to pay VAT if you're outside EU. Not interested in silver if that's the case. But fractions of 1 ounce of gold sound terrific. What can I buy? Can you send 50 ounces of Silver Maple Leaf in Europe? What would be their price and shipping cost? Can you provide some expertise to inform me what other taxes, VAT, customs do I have to pay?Please tell me the prices in USD. Thank You. Anyone has trouble accessing bitbet.org? ExaTrust Ventures. Indicates greatness both by words "Exa" and "Trust". Also trustworthiness.Exa= 2^60. Your logo could be something like E-TRUSTAlso all domains are available. You mean how many people lost their wallets or deleted them?My personal assumption is that less than 2000 coins lost back when people could generate 50 fair easily. After that, they became too precious to waste. So the lost bitcoin can be neglected even now, at approx. 5 million. Can I do pentest on it? Like playing hackers? Their price right now would be 33 euro and I ship only to EU. I can accept bank wire or bitcoin. I would be interested in the Garmin GPS, but if you're in EU. Otherwise taxes are too high for me.No, sorry but no broken things. Can't afford to repair them.Oldies! How much for each?  What do you mean? You want to sell siver? Yes, EU and I'm pretty sure the seller payed VAT. I'm selling silver maple leaf coins, edition 2011, 99.99 purity in a plastic airtight capsule. I buy them at aprox 40 USD. What do you think about the price?I don't know if you are interested, since maybe the price will be lower in US and Canada. I'm doing it to see how much I should ask for these if I want to sell them as a bussiness.Also if any of you can supply them for less. pm me please Not that old or cheam. Used LCD tv, gps-es, digital cameras, maybe DSLR etc. Make me offers Hi, I would like to buy used but in good condition electronics. I buy with both PayPal and Bitcoins.Rules:1. Send me photos of the item, an accurate description and tell me if there are any defects.2. Use Clearcoin3. You calculate the price of the shipping (which I support) and mark the package as gift. Tracking number required.4. Tracking number required5. Have a little discussion with me on skype or IM.I could buy:1. Netbook/Laptop: min. 2GB of RAM, min. 1.6Ghz CPU, min. 60GB HDD, SD card reader, wifi, bluetooth mic and camera2. Smatphone (Android OS if possible): must have GPS (not aGPS), Europe maps/software (iGO or something better), triband, call/sms blacklisting option, code to protect the phone from unauthorized use, some SSH client (X11 forwarding would be great, if it exist), >1.3 Mpx camera, IrDA, Wifi, Bluetooth (would be great if FM radio or TV), microSD slot card (at least 8GB support), software solution for GPS road and off-road navigation. I saw this Iphone 4 augumented reality navigation. Awesome!3. iPhone 3GS or 4.4. old PDA with GPS (Fujitsu Pocket Loox n560 or something better). No need to have phone function. Better if I can have a linux on it.Some solution for GPS road and offroad navigation. I saw this Iphone 4 augmented reality navigation. Awesome!6. Any other old 'n cheap electronics you might have. Dudes.. I just found out what "wobber" means..............I'm a non-english person and when I signed on this just came into my mind... Why nobody said anything?? This might be one of those Freudian slips... Please don't laugh. I've found that I really can touch people up especially when they're in trouble and I'm thinking of earning some bitcoins on that. I have a vast life experience, had many big problems in my life and I'm pretty sure I can give you some good advices. You can private me if you have any problems that you might want to discuss. Opposes to traditional shrink sessions that charge you a lot of money for the effect, I'll charge none but I'll gladly accept any bitcoins donated. Anonimity will be preserved and all discussions are confidential.You don't really have to be in trouble to come to me. You might want to start a sports life for example, I can teach you on how to start that 1 mile running today. Or if you kinda want to quit smoking and read all those books on how to quit but always end up smoking 1 pack a day. Anything you want.
Do you know what's the name of that software? It's not maltego for sure. Nobody can argue that Bitcoin is a success now, today. If most of the people will have the same trust in bitcoin one year from now, bitcoin will still be a success. My response to that article is: i back bitcoin up. and kiba, and creighto and everybody else.  Do you think we will really touch 5-10$ soon? Isn't this a target for the next 5-10 years? Added some extreme bets at bitcoiners requests.Sports betting seems not so much fun. Anyway, I'll add all sports events for the following 2 months today, please wait for it! Is the video trustworthy? If not, the pimp failed in providing proofs so nobody will go anywhere, and nobody will get robbed or kidnapped.Anyway, criminology says that most of the criminals that do things against the person (like pimping, killing, raping) are statistically more interested in cash than gold or other commodities. Something triggers in their brain when they see paper money but not a bullion of silver, gold, etc. I guess because they are short-sighted and they tend to neutralize risks (like killing a man for something that looks like gold but it isn't). So, I strongly believe the first prostitution act with bitcoin will be one of some girl that wants some. Real pimps are more interested in euro dollars and pounds. They will first accept Chinese yuans before bitcoin. I guess we all knew it was an attempted scam but one thing is for sure: The guy is from Romania. A scammer. We should track him down and punish him consequently.EDIT: Rosalinda, next time don't answer any private message. Nice system configuration though. Go and play CS. Where in Romania? I suscribe, it would be great to have a bitcoin module. How do you integrate a bitcoin payment into a Prestashop shop?I'm in for this pledge with 15 BTC I propose this notation, with something like a dropdown menu "UNIT OF BTC TO SEND". It would be easier than counting zeros if someday 1 BTC = 1000 USD and I want to send 1 cent , 0.00001 BTC1 BTC = 10 dBTC (deci bitcoin) = 100 cBTC (centiBTC) = 1000 mBTC (miliBTC) = 10E-6 µBTC Can't find the thread. I'm in for the pledge Hi. I'm developing a website with payment in Bitcoin and I used PrestaShop 1.4. My problem is I have no idea on how to implement the automated payment in bitcoins. If any of you can provide me some guidelines and advices, I'll really appreciate it. Else, I guess the only option would be a single payment address with and e-mail order before. The bet on BitBet was for a 10 BTC game played on PROBIWON in the case one player would win 3500%.So, if someone played 0.01BTC on PROBIWON, the bitbet bet wouldn't apply. This was actually a bet that made a service to PROBIWON more than BitBet since it ecouraged people to play 10BTC games. For example, 5 friends could gather, place a bet of 20 BTC on BitBet and then each play a 10 BTC game on PROBIWON. Max. loss for each=11 BTC, possible wins with odds 5/1 =20BTC. if the lucky one shared with his friends We have to make the economy grow, not just ourselves. Indirectly, helping a "competitor" can cause me to be wealthier. Like the butterfly-effect principle applied to an emerging economy like ours. Cool abstraction! What if someone creates a malware, like a botnet, just to create Bitcoin addresses? Thousands per minute. How much would take to create all of the addresses? Also, what about collision risks? Can an address be generated twice? And what would happen if you send a bitcoin to that address if both are online? I use http://www.oil-price.net/ for the Crude Oil Price.For Gold: http://www.kitco.com/charts/livegold.htmlFor Silver: http://www.kitco.com/charts/livesilver.htmlExample this bet: http://www.bitbet.org/betting.php?action=viewform&formID=24The correct value will be the first price for that day since all commodities are subjected to slight changes in price through the day. Freemoney, oh, the title! yes, it's not true what it sais, but it's not up to me to change it.The IPROBWIN bet ends on 24th of January.The bet is for any person that plays 10BTC an once, and WINS 3500%, within the time interval (until 24th of January) I really don't understand. You're saying I want change things on bets? What? There is an elementary mistake in the Mt.Gox bets: http://www.bitbet.org/betting.php?action=viewform&formID=7As you see, I forgot to add the option for "Anything above 0.33" with some crazy odds of 1/1000 so I can cover all the possibilities in order to close the bet. This results the bet can't be closed, so I ask anyone that bet there to pm me.
It seems some people are really into statistics and numbers. I was asked if I could make an EXTREME BETS section with bets like "A piece of art of more than 100,000 euro being stolen/destroyed" , "A major earthquake in the Northen Hemisfere in the next 6 monts" or "Important politician getting shot". I quote.As far as I can see, many people would take this as a competition and try to find out the odds by using statistics. Can I add daily bets on BitBet for the probability of someone winning 3500% on PROBIWON?  So far, it seems that's the trend.On 31st of December 2010 it was 1420 USD/ounce and today it's 1342.If it's lower than 1000 people should buy at least 1 ounce. But how do you know when to buy? One could see it's at 1100 and say: "Oh, it's gonna go lower than that, I'll wait some more". And then it pops to 1500 or whatever. I hope I'm not ambigous in the Bet explanation area on the website. The Gold bet is about the price of gold when the bet ends, i.e. Jan 30 2011 0:00.The Mt.Gox bet for example is about the maximum/minimum value of 1 BTC until Jan 30 2011. So, if you bet on "under 0.35" and on Jan. 27 the price is 0.30 you win. Doesn't matter if on 28th of Jan. it will be back to 0.45.Everybody, please ask if anything is unclear. Ask before bet  You have to register and then go to the "Betting" section Please add BitBet to the Trade Page.http://www.bitbet.orgThe only BitCoin Bookmaker! I am maintaining BitBet.org, http://bitbet.orgFeel free to come with suggestion for bets. I can create entries for any kind of events.I also added bets for gold, bitcoin and oil price. If people want I'll add daily bets for FOREX too. This is what I'd like BitcoinBank to do:Services:People deposit their bitcoins into accounts (login by username and maybe software token, if possible - even hardware).Tax should be something 1% per year but i have no idea how to prevent people to add just 100 BTC when they open the account (tax 1BTC) and then add the next day another 10.000 BTC. One option could be to tax 1% per added bulk.The wallet.dat holds all clients' bitcoins and the database hold sthe amount each is entitled to.24-7 online banking for adding and withdrawing funds and payment intermediary.Selling gold, silver, USD, EUR, GBP and other currencies on demand. Selling virtual credit cards from multiple banks, in multiple currencies.Escrow services.Wallet-lock options. Allows transfer of less than the amount set up by the user per day/week etc. Also one idea i have is a amount-protected lock, you can't move funds from your account to another bitcoin address unless you remember the passsum, ie: 255.78 BTC (might be useful for paranoids that need more layers of security)Credits, based on trust. Dunno how to implement this yet.Investment fund. Dunno if to implement this and how.Also I dream of having the bank physically, with safe deposit boxes, maybe even microcip cards and all At least two servers on different, secure, locations. Encryption in case of theft.IDS and IPS with good sysadminsTor and I2P anonimity.Gold, silver, bitcoin, USD, EUR and GBP reserve (might add chinese Yuan too)at least these bitcoinbank domains: .eu, .com. org, .net, .biz to avoid scamsSSL certificate and GnuPGP keys WARIus, you said you want to sell BitBet because you don't have time to maintain it. Why don't you give it to me, I'll maintain it and will split the profit in half?  Yes, I have received offers for .eu and .org also. I'd buy both .com and .org, but so far I don't have project.  I never think about the license but I'm sure it will be Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported because it's free on distribution and remixing.Also should be the materials used such as 3D bitcoin animation, script, FinalCut effects (if new are created). Pretty much everything.Meanwhile, i have a question: How could I submit a draft of the script and everyone could modify it with somekind of tracking feature and also prevent vandalim? I don't have time to set up a website to do that and the forum will be messy, with lots of quotes and "It would be better without this" or "I'd skip that".   I won't start it with the Bible verse, nor anything like this. It seems it makes people to think of religious fanatics, lol.The infomercials are a very good idea, I'll discuss this too.A 45minute video is too much and would be more like a documentary.  And of course they disappeared. It's not ONE man's job, it's a whole team's job.One man, except the case he's has lots of skills and knowledge cannot create a professional video. It takes a team of at least three (script, graphics and voiceover).EDIT: by the way, the other members of my team never heard of bitcoin so I'm very curious what impact will this have.  I have some questions:1. Is the bounty still in place?2. Is anyone currently working at this project?3. Bitcoin is 0.4 USD today, the bounty is 13.622.05, right?I am setting up a team to discuss the script and animation details/effects of this animated movie that describes Bitcoin and it's economy. The team is consisted of graphic artists, video editors and professional photographers. We still need a voice that speaks fluently English (if someone wants to apply, a reading test will be required)Estimated production time: ~8 weeksEstimated lenght time: 10 minutesDetails: animated movie with voiceover (something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc )PLEASE COME WITH SUGGESTIONS BECAUSE WE WANT THE MOVIE TO BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE.--------------------------------EDIT: The FIRST plot draft1) How, why and when?- Revelation 13 No man shall buy or sell... - Bitcoin was created by a Japanese programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto in C++- It was created as a mean to transfer value ***INNACURATE.- The project was started in 2009 and had a small amount of followers2) How it works?- Explanation for: blocks, addresses, generation, alorithm *** NEEDS MORE DETAILS- Explanation for P2P anonymous decentralized system (your own mint) *** DETAILS- Cryptography and security3) Comparison with cash and gold- Gold: you mine bitcoin, limited supply, no intrisic value- Cash: irreversible transactions,  can be destroyed easily,  divided up to 8 decimals- Show that it was an economy-in-a-jar (you could and can learn a lot about economics by looking at the inception ad growth of bitcoin)4) Originality of Bitcoin- Show why it's nor gold, cash, a new PayPal or credit card. Explain it's a comodity,- digital or virtual explanation *** I NEED MORE INFO!- explain how loosing some bitcoins makes the others worth more (deflation)- 21 milion maximum BTC. Explain what happens if all the world uses BTC (how much a gram of gold worths 0.00004 I.e.- show why it' can't be counterfeit 5) Why does a bitcoin have any value?- it is free from government control unless they shut down the internet- shutting down internet will prevent most credit card systems from working too- it's internet first and only currency (PayPal is not currency,  it's a virtual dollar)***INNACU.- it enables "cash-like" transactions across the internet - it provides some degree of anonymity. (note: when used properly)- it enables micro-payments- it can be backed up- the slashdot effect. Value before and after. Also show growth of services and goods- other people are willing to trade goods/services for BTC *** SHOW TRADE PAGE.- little or no transaction fees-value today ( sum up daily transaction totals)6) How do I keep it safe or know that a transaction is legit? How long does it take?- compare risk to risk of a check bouncing or counterfeit cash7) - compare risk to risk of a check bouncing or counterfeit cash-if they steal your wallet.dat, if have no backup and realize too late, all bitcoins are lost. Show that with physical money is the same.-hacker has to spend (even if to another address of his) coins because otherwise you can restore the backup wallet and spend them to another address of yours *** EXPLAIN WHY- backup your wallet.dat file. It is hard to "backup" cash in your safe or wallet.- scams (paying and not receiving goods/services)  Future Direction- cell phone payment at merchants - inflation hedge vs government printing press- whole new types of start up businesses become possible by removing the- overhead associated with accepting payments.- explain how you could buy groceries, pay tickets ar bills with Bitcoin.  *** SHOW ANIMATION OF FICTIOUS CHAR PAYING WITH BITCOIN.- possible attacks on the network (govt. bans) *** WHAT OTHER ATTACKS?- bitcoin generation possiblities (clouds, farms, cryptohardware)CREDITS *** IF TEAM WANTS TO BE CREDITED. Yea, I planned on making a reverse-auction website, but you need a greater span of services/goods providers. So far only the hosting industry can reverse-auction. I perfectly understand. But could you at least say what's the minimum expected for the site? 5th of March is in almost 2 months, thus too much time will be lost. And also money. So this means that there is just 1 wallet.dat and all the guys that have bitcoins in there are just on somekind of list that sais how much each has?What a about a bitcoin bank? If it's purpose would be to secure people's wallets that means it should act like a bank values box. PGP encrypted and all. Or it would be better to have a single wallet.dat and a "list" that sais how much every person has?Also, there must be a fee. 1% per year, for storage for the bitcoins. Payable on the first day. But how do you stop people from adding 1 BTC and then 10,000 BTC so they would pay just 1% of 1BTC? Taxing them for both operations is kinda unethical. Satoshi said recently in an interview that Bitcoin was his biggest mistake, an useless project to which he devoted too much time. The creator also quoted the people using bitcoin as "geeks" and suggested them to "get a life"He now works as Ben Bernanke's Senior Programming Advisor for the new, 100000000 bills/sec. printing press. I have three more questions:1. Does this website works with those free hosting solutions, or it requires some linux-based server (bitcoind?)2. How much do I have to study, i mean bets websites, to add new bets? How much work does it needs per day? You said you discontinued the project because you lacked time, I hope not because it wasn't profitable. I just want to cover any expenses, if I also get a few bitcoins per week I don't mind.PS I know I sound very strange, but I did the mistake of bidding first and asking later. Anyway, I'll take it, I want it, but I need some support. Thanks! Bitcoin value had a more than 12% climb since I bid. What do I do now?
And if the exchange rate will be more than 10$/BTC how will we make payments? What if rate is 1000USD/BTC?If I want to buy a hotdog I'l just send 0.001 BTC? To much zeros... What is the resolution to this problem? Seems ok, but I'll have to learn PHP in order to further develop it. I also want to regain my 130 BTC (I'm pretty sure I'll win) and then giving a good, entertaining service with great odds to win. Do you have to have a couple thousands of bitcoin in order to run the bitbet?How do you maintain it (add new bets etc)Did it made any bitcoins as profit? I am. At your service sir.  No problem, but out of curiosity, do you sell gold at it's market price per ounce + profit or you include also some "numismatic value", like the design etc (as in gold coins).I ask because I thought one bullion of 1 oz. = only the price of pure gold and the price for manufacturing is pre-included in gold's price.PS. I miscalculated, I wanted to offer $44 in bitcoins. That means ~1460 BTC Grondilu, 500 BTC for the 10g bullion I could offer both fiat and BTC. I'm in EU, but I didn't knew there's VAT for silver. Also I don't want coins, just pure metal bullions. Hi there. I want to buy some bullions of gold (5g up to 1oz), silver (up to 10oz) and selenium or tellurium (a couple of pounds). I am waiting for you guys to make me an offer. Thank you. I don't know if this topic had any influence but on Mt.Gox the high price for today is 0.322. Might be, who knows... What if we all say: from today, one bitcoin is 1.3 PPUSD? Will it's value be that? I guess so, since it's worth what we all want it to. What stops us to do so? Can we call this "speculation"?I'm very curious about that. Hey, I asked for the screenshots on pm, but never got them. Whatever name you'll choose, make sure it has bitcoin in it.  I studied a little bit and seems gold and USD have a reverse relationship, when USD lowers, gold rises and viceversa. Also we all know gold is overpriced due to speculation. Next, assume that the world is headed to a major conflict, preceded by the fall of the USD. It means that the price of gold will rocket up to the sky. What do you think? Economics is a very interesting and vast discipline. Like Lorentz's butterfly effect, any little stimuli in the environment can lead to a very big change. I believe that the actual monetary system will fall to it's death and also I see evidence of a very big war coming (possibly NBC and/or using advanced weaponry such as EMP or HAARP) in order to create the prerequisites to achieve the NWO, with it's ultimate goal: the control of every human in the world. I don't know in what order and when these things will happen but that's just a matter of time. see Peter Schiff's blog: http://peterschiffblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/big-names-are-buying-gold-preparing-for.html Yes, I was present when the actual trad took place, on IRC (and this forum) but the guy payed th pizza for the "customer". Anyway it was the first food trade and among the first trades in the world. I'm speaking of "making" food. And OFFTOPIC: how did you found that website? I can't find many of them in the TRADE list. The most basic service is not present in our community: Food.We have lots of other things, sex toys, casinos but we lack food suppliers. If we want a selfsustainable community we must have raw food and even cooked food providers. But food alters quickly and it's not a good idea to transport it across long distances. So, we must establish a network of food dealers across the whole world. Because I've learned that someday we won't be able to buy or sell without the... Is this reward still on? I don't receive any payment. Grondilu, disrespect would be if I'd sell it on ebay. That's the name of a comic-book-like intro to economy and it's principles. It is very intelligent written, has nice handmade drawings and it's a must-read for all of you.After you guys read it, feel free to join me here for a discussion on the subject.http://ubitio.us/file/download/96 6-8 bitcoins using a GPU? or CPU? 130 btc
Actually it may be a better idea, the highest bid wins X% of bitcoins. I should see how much it costs to transform something into that logo, I hope not more than 100 usd. Being a project for all, i ask you all to tell how much the winner should receive and how much I should. Also, instead of destroying them I could encrypt them using each bidders PGP key signing with my key and then spreading the final resulted file to all  What do you think? Hmm... Even bet sites are not very popular among cryptodudes I'm going to bid. 70 BTC What do you mean by bigger players? And 100x value? Not too soon I bet... But seems you have some financial experience, could you please explain some more? Thanks Something hybrid, it's more like an auction because the higher bidder wins. Also there was a mistake, I meant 50 not 500.EDIT: my fee has to cover the melting cost of the hdd platters and their transformation into a bitcoin logo. No, but spending is better for the economy. Anyway, we ain't talking about hoarding here. Ok, not you, but I know 2 cases of people having more than 15000 and not spending a bitcent. I don't have many bitcoins and I want to make some profit, it them, to buy some things. Also, many of you are HOARDING bitcoins. Third, a lost Bitcoin makes the rest a little more valuable.I have a very very crazy idea to even things up. What if I'll set up a bitcoin accepting website where you "donate" any amount you want (nobody will send more than 500 I'm sure), be on the list of those who donated and can see the total amount gathered. Then, at a block number that we all agree on, I will draw a percentage of it, also a number we agree on and a winner is declared (the one who donated tho most). Finaly, I take that harddisk (on a live video feed or so), open it up, save all the platters and then i take all of those to a jewelry i know and make a bitcoin logo of it that I will send to the winner. I hope this thread doesn't exist yet. This is childish thread but I invite you all to speak up, I'm very interested of each opinion because a mass consciousness can tell and foretell many things.I am thinking of the cash-bitcoin (you loose wallet, loose money irreversibly etc) analogy that was explained to me when I first got in here. I also think of the bitcoin-gold analogy (you mine for them, it stores value). I think bitcoin is just bitcoin, it's something different but it's more similar to gold. Being so, this means someday 1 BTC will have a huge value. Like an ounce of gold now.What value could 1 BTC have? Well since the total amount of gold as of 2009 was 165.000 tons, worth 5 trillion dollars, could we estimate that 1 BTC could be 165000000 kgs of gold /2100000 total bitcoins => 1 BTC ~= 7kgs of gold?That is 246 ounces (rounded), 1 ounce being 1300 USD => 1 BTC could be equal 319.800 USD. That if all the people in the world think about bitcoin as being valuable.I know that by the time you will have almost 21 mil BTC, the total gold quantity will be greater but... doesn't really matter, i just want to know what YOU think a 1BTC will worth in 6 months; 1 year and 5 years. If you have arguments it's better if not, just make a prediction. On the global scale, each prediction is valuable since it is just the output of the processed input data by a human mind. Some of us have more correct input data, some have more, some have a better processing algo. I checked my posts and it seems I didn't ask that  Can I and how can I reserve the name BitcoinBank in this community?And how do I buy the .org or .com domain? Thank you! There is an amanzing amount of knowledge in this forum. And I thank you for that. Did anyone think at this? How would a bank work? How could you loan bitcoins and get interest for them in an economy with just 21 milion BTC limit? I have a question. Why do you think nobody made a variation on bitcoin, let's say bytecoin or something?Also, do you think it would be a good idea to have many cryptocurrencies? How would the cryptonomic environment behave with more than one currency? Hi. I want to buy more than 50.000 BTC but at the lowest price. I'd like to buy them in a bulk, but if you can offer a good prices for bulks of 10.000, 5000 or even 1000 I will consider buying.I am waiting for the best offer. Thank you and Merry Xmas! Hi. I want to make a request:I'd like to have a CSS design, a sober webpage with a simple menu that highlights.On one page there has to be a table, that anyone can edit (add/delete data to it's fields and add/delete rows and columns). Also please have this table to look as neat as possible, not the classic, ugly HTML table. If possible add comments so n00bs can understand.Keep up the good work! I have this idea: how could we start a bitcoin-over-GSM phonecall service? It should be possible to send bitcoins over a phonecall as a modulated audio stream. The only problem would be the storage, which has to be as a recording or binary data (transforme by some software in the smartphone) 1. What do you think, will the price of gold will go down? Argument as much as possible.2. How could the price of gold could go down? What could happen to do so?3. Would you buy gold today, now, at current the price?4. Not actually a question. I want to learn as much as possible about precious metals and why are they so valued for thousand of years.  You are right on the exchanges. That's the benefit of an open community.Tell me please about your project, how did you buy bitcoins? You invested from  your own wallet and now want to resell? I believe you bought them in large quantities so you'd pay less.  I believe it's free in all EU-member countries.  I'd like to start some services with Bitcoin for three east-European countries: Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.What do you think, is it a good idea to have an Mt.Gox-like exchange for these 3 currencies and euro?Also, i was thinking of having a service like the one that Madhatter provides (Bitcoin2CC) but only for the Bulgarian, Romanian and Hungarian currencies. For this, I am asking publicly for his expertise, if he's willing to share.I want to start a Bitcoin-selling webiste, where people can buy for SMS and/or debit card. How can I do this?My supreme goal would be to make Bitcoin popular in these 3 countries and implement this coin in other's people services (like some virtual shops, ebay-like auction websites).Any help is welcome!Thank you!
300 BTC 250 PayPal USD Thank you for the one who donated, it felt very good to see my work appreciated! Hi. I'm not a huge fan of software localization but I have finally translated Bitcoin into Romanian. I might also translate in Bulgarian an Hungarian, if I get positive feedback on this.It's my first one, I don't know where to put the .po file so I attached it here.Please donate if you feel my work worths it: 15bh4m8Ta641HN4U3rKazAXJYzXGQXYFcYCheers! 605 BTC 605 Grondilu: Let's assume a decease.BioMike: nobody sells coffins for BTC, yet.I'm trying to understand if someone should and could keep funds as bitcoin for non-internet use.Also, I want to see how fast could I sell my bitcoins in large amounts (let's say 10.000) for a good price. Hi. Let's assume someone has a sum of BTC which he keeps for emergency cases, as an alternative to USD being kept under the mattress  How can one use these funds, quick, painless and w/o worries?Can one rely on BTC? The only options is see are:1. Selling bitcoins on the market. The cons here are that it takes time, and you have to also convert from PayPal USD to real USD ( i don't know if you can use PP to pay for things outside the internet, like groceries or so)2. The over-counter alternatives, like forum, bitcoin 2 mail etc. Takes a lot of time and may be unreliable.3. The virtual VISA cards. Nice, but only for online use. If these cards could be converted somehow to real VISA cards it would be amazing! I made s very big mistake, I tought it was for buying, :| I have posted a biddingpond.com auction http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=160&mode=1 Anyone interested in this? I really want to sell them. Sorry, got excited and didn't saw the link with the biddingpond auction. I placed a bid but somehow it automatically placed a higher bid than mine. Why? Ricochet, no plans to haggle, sorry.$170. Since nobody placed another bid, i'll lower the price to $150. 503 and I'm in. 2 BTCMan, I want a Kindle this Christmas!!When will the bit stop? oh, ok.damn my ideas suck. What do you think, should Satoshi respond to this inquiry if enough people vote for it?Bitcoin 0.3.1337 - ELEETI'm basing this suggestion on bitcoin being for cryptojunkies and it would be kinda representative to have this version. Also it could be 3.1337, after 3.0, 3.1 or whatever.Please vote. huh? Project discontinued due to lack of positive feedback.

They look like in the attached photos.Also I'm selling Berliner TT electric railroad models, ~20m of rail, bridges, houses, trees about 40 wagons (different models) and some locomotives. These models are German and I very very roughly estimated them at about 1000 $. I have them from a very passionate collector and I know they are very valuable and valued. I'd like to pass them for bitcoins to somebody at least as passionate as he was.These are not mine, but are the same as I have: http://picasaweb.google.com/sorin.sbarnea/Diverse#This is just a teaser, I want to know if anyone's interested before taking photos and counting every item. If somebody is interested I will make a list with available items, photos of them and their defects (if any, I haven't opened the boxes yet) . I currently live in Europe so you will pay shipment too.  I don't really have a portofolio but you can hire me, I'll do the work, out of passion, and if you like it you can pay me. If not, you'll see what I can do but cannot use the logos since I'll post 'em as .jpgActually that's a rule in logo making. You won't get paid until the client is satisfied. Altrough I'm pretty sure nobody will be disappointed. Hi. I'm a fine arts graduate and very proficient with Corel and Adobe suites.I can draw any logo for any client!Also I can do photo retouching, montages, banners, flyers, ads, etc.A standard logo package includes 3 variants (vectorial) for the client to choose. Price is 150 BTC. I started a little project, a minimalistic install of slackware for people that use bitcoin and I need your feedback to know what software would you like in it.So far we have Tor, Privoxy and it's GUI, Vidalia and as a WM, XFCE.I'd like to know if Tor should be enabled system-wide by default too.PS. The project will be free. He hoards massive amounts of BTC only to create inflation later by putting them into circuit. So this guy has about 1000 cores generating bitcoins. About 10% of the total amount fo BTC.His name is William Pitock aka Nenolod http://twitter.com/nenolodWhat do you think? If he cannot prove the system isn't sustainable, he wins, because he will have lots of bitcoins.If he does, we all loose. I hope he will post here, as we discuss HIS ACTIONS and not HIS PERSON.Also, I hope he will pay me 31337 bitcoins at this address 1EZdM6HBRn4BQNa2Bqcyh47fQWYFS5Ujr3so I can prove him he's wrong.Please discuss the issue. Sorry lachesis, didn't logged in until now.if you won't trade with davidonpda, I'll do it!PS One of the reasons would be bitcoin's price going high  And how could you build a web-of-trust if nobody get's into that web?I'm gonna do some brainstorming to see what could be done and the project will remain up for 1 year to see what's happening.But, all you Bitcoin users keep in mind: As time goes by and BTC becomes more valuable, there will be people that will want to cheat and steal from you and me.Asume someone starts a new thread and sais: "Hey, look at this service WE provide World-wide 100 SMS for just 500 BTC. 10 people back that up and say it's awsome, altrough they had minor issues with, I don't know, non-Unicode charsets? You pay and boo, site goes down next day and it's untraceable cause it used some poor guy rooted machine or other means. So, it would be necessary that someone to verify that service (I don't imply Bitcoin Certify here, I'm just saing I'll be more and more reluctant to pay for services I don't know about). davidonpda, I researched a little, I can't find any Paypal giftcard store in my country.I'm not in UK, altrough I live in Europe and Paysafe seems expanding here. You could try to clean up your computer and but some thermal paste on the cooler. Arctic Silver 5 is a must. Careful no to put too much and to even it with a razor or so.Bitcoin is an intensive-processor app, so it does heat up your CPU, but shouldn't be very high. In my case, 65 degrees Celsius are reported by a quadcore CPU even in the hot days. You could do that in linux using a small script and lm-sensors. I can't find any store selling Amazon giftcards in my area but there are a lot that offers Paysafecard ones. http://www.paysafecard.comTell me if you're insterested. I'd like to learn some about making nice things with Bitcoins, as Niekie did with Bitthanks and Gavinandersen did with his Faucet. The problem is I lack coding skills.I don't know how to generate addresses for each payment, I don't know how to strip bitcoin (ie for headless use).Is anyone kind enough to point me to what to learn OR, better, teach me by letting me see how he does projectes (VNC maybe) That's why we need a sort of Trust System. I proposed that Bitcoin Certification Authority but now luck. Maybe someone has a better idea, i really want to start bussiness with bitcoins.And you're right, if only forum members use it, it will not be truly anonymous. Flash Pen Kingston Data Traveler 101, 4GB Cyan = 2200 BTC (shipment not included)http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-101-DT101Y-Yellow/dp/B001C9P5T4(in the picture is the yellow one. also, it's brand new, never used) I want to buy Bitcoins. How can I do it, i have no bank or PayPal account? SMS options is too expensive.I could mail a 5$ bill for each transaction in a nicely coloured envelope with a joke in ransom-style font.Don't be affraid to use mail. Indeed, we need a reputation system. Lacking coding skills, can't really help. Until then I have an idea: someone make a new post and if lachesis will buy the flash drive from me, will post his opinion. If I runaway with his bitcoins, people will know I'm not trustworthy. On the other hand, if we end the transaction successfully and he votes for me being trustwothy, I could open the roads for making bigger transactions. I was thinking of making a proxy to be paid in bitcoins, primarily to help the community and to earn some btcs. My idea is to run it inside a virtualized OS, and to give access only to Bitcoin's forum, for people that wish to keep themselves anonymous.What do you think? I need your feedback before starting. thanks! I am. But I don't use Paypal or banks. We could use mail. Or any other option you think of.
