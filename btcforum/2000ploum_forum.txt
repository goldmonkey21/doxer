DTekcqqgx3ihG8Ztsf1kdogCfgwkX8Y65CMuch fun   DTekcqqgx3ihG8Ztsf1kdogCfgwkX8Y65CThanks   Google is currently launching Google Play gift cards but only in some countries :https://play.google.com/intl/en-US_us/about/giftcards/Also, the cards are physical: you receive a piece of paper!But what about a service that would buy a bunch of those cards, that would encode all the numbers in a database and sell them for bitcoins?It means that you could buy Google Play credits with bitcoins from anywhere in the world, without the need for a paper or anything. Is there already something similar? In a parallel world, it seems that Ripple is still existing and got some funding :https://ripple.com/blog/ripple-labs-raises-3-5-million-in-new-investment-round/Is there any other activity on the Ripple front? Is there still people buying Ripple for bitcoins? You are lucky, I never had any answer at all! Or it could be a shorter way of saying "bitcoin service providers". Flattr is web service that allows to give micro donations to the content on the web ( you can read my description here: http://ploum.net/post/paying-web and a follow-up here: http://ploum.net/post/flattrs-biggest-problem ). Because of a popular request, they are actively looking into support bitcoin to:1. Allow people to fund their account in bitcoins2. Allow people to withdraw money earned as bitcoinsThey posted the following tweet: https://twitter.com/Flattr/status/350345129267175424 which seems to says that there is still a need for bitcoin services. Point 2 seems to not be offered by any provider so far.I will ask for more details about what is needed on the Flattr side but, in the meantime, what would be your advices? Exactly!I call that the XKCD's law: http://ploum.net/post/xkcds-law I'm in the exact same situation. It seems we are the unlucky few. If you have some success, please keep me informed. (I'm especially frustrated because I was a big tradehill advocate over mtgox)
Any news from Ripple? I haven't seen anything from them in a while. Most importantly, we use their currency code and symbol This text has been posted first on https://plus.google.com/102072273880684402148/posts/JRsC98Y3CtvGiven the quick rise of bitcoin (currently priced at $93 each), it may appear to be a bubble.A bubble happens when a lot of people, excited by the quick rise, buy with the hope to sell at a better price later. People don't really needs what they are buying. There's no fundamentals that justify a high price for the product. They buy because the price increase and they cause the increase themselves.Bitcoin proponents tend to say that there's still not a lot of business done with bitcoin (which is true). Most of business accept bitcoin as a publicity stunt, not because they believe that there's a huge market. As such, bitcoin has a relatively low value.And the fundamentals have not changed since the last crash to 2/3$, meaning that it is mostly a speculative bubble.But I disagree.Firstly, people now use bitcoin not only to trade but also to store value. As a  store of value, fiat money is the worst possible solution. All the bailouts and the crisis showed us that you can't trust a bank anymore. Bitcoin offers a completely unregulated and very liquid store for money. Bitcoin is then useful not only for trade but also as a saving. Those are not speculators. If you invest in bitcoins to store money (and sell bitcoins as you need money and not selling them all when you made enough profit), you are not a speculator. This means that Bitcoin is already useful. People buy it because they need it, not because of pure speculation.As for the fundamental, +Rick Falkvinge explained several times that if Bitcoin captures only 1% of the internet trades, each bitcoin should be valued around 10,000-100,000$.This fundamental is still there and is stronger than ever for two reasons:1. Despite the huge bitcoin crash in 2011, bitcoin value remained between $3 and $10 for nearly two years. It means that even when there's no hype, no interest, Bitcoin remains a quite secure store of value.2. With its increasing value, Bitcoin is more than ever a valuable target for hackers. The fact that nobody has been able to trick the system so far and to counterfeit bitcoins is a good indicator of the technical strenght. Bitcoin even has a glitch, a few weeks ago, because of a software bug in a new release: it barely affected the price because the Bitcoin community had an appropriate response. This builds trust. Something that fiat money is missing.But what makes Bitcoin different and is not taken into account by the "stock exchange experts" is that people are only discovering Bitcoin. MtGox has a huge queue of people wanting to send money and it takes weeks to have your account validated. In that regard, Bitcoin is exactly the opposite of a Ponzi scheme: it's hard to enter and easy to leave.But Bitcoin is not flawless. The biggest flaw so far is usability. Bitcoin is hard to use. It is extremely easy to be scammed or to lose all your bitcoins. It's completely impractical to use Bitcoin for day to day transactions (is the bitcoin address valid? How to add a comment?) and, in its current form, Bitcoin has no chance to become mainstream.It is a given that an electronic money like bitcoin will become mainstream in a not so distant future. I foresee three possible scenarios :1. Bitcoin becomes the backend of an easier system and most of the people don't see bitcoins and use them without knowing it. Nevertheless, bitcoins are very valuable. That's what happened with Linux where most people using Linux are, in fact, using a layer above it (Android). That's probably where Ripple may become useful. [1] 2. Bitcoin itself becomes easiers and some services above make it even more easy. That's what happened with Git and Github. Git itself became easier and Github made it usable by nearly anyone.3. A new solution appears that completely replace Bitcoin. Like social networks are killing RSS feeds. Bitcoin would become like Napster: an historical forerunner without any remaining value.If you believe that 1. or 2. are the most probable future, hold your bitcoins. Don't be scared because speculators are moving the price. Just hold and sell your bitcoins when you need money.But don't forget that 3. is also a possible scenario. So don't invest into bitcoin what you could afford to lose entirely.[1] http://ploum.net/post/ripple-making-bitcoin-easier-or-obsolete Simple introduction without any details :http://ploum.net/post/ripple-making-bitcoin-easier-or-obsolete It's in Barcelona so they won't accept the 100$ bill. And AmEx is not popular in Europe, most of merchants don't accept it (they prefer Visa and MasterCard). Of course, I don't know that particular hotel but you get the point. In most part of Europe, this would not be accepted. The point is that Bitcoin might have a value as it enable to transfer money over the internet. In fact, it is already used (just take the Silk Road example). So it has a value. Probably very low but it still has. It is obvious that, the more people use bitcoin, the more the real value is increased. (If it is not obvious to you, you have to start with the basis). Speculation is thinking that more people will use bitcoins in the future, hence increasing the value.There are two kind of scenarios. Either bitcoins is not used at all anymore for whatever reason and thus become a pure speculation tool (like the tulip bulb).Either it is mainly used as a speculation tool but still has some value. Example : gold. Gold is used in many technologies but its main application is speculation.Either it becomes widely used and speculation is only done by a minority (example: fiat currency).Your reasoning is that people only see the immediate use. But if it was the case, gold would be hundred times cheaper. The reason is simple : even if gold was completely useless, people trust that gold can be accepted anywhere against real money. It's only historical but this means that there are some trust in gold. People trust its value and thus accept it.With bitcoin, we are exactly in the same situation: we are building that history.Now, you can believe that we will fail. Right. Then sell your bitcoins if any. In my wallet, at Olivia Plaza, I have a 100$ bill and a American Express credit card. I also have one pound of pure gold. None of them are accepted by the Olivia Plaza Hotel to buy a pizza. I search through my other pocket : I find a diamond ring, a pound of pure silver and a some papers telling me that I own some parts in a company called Google.According to you, they are worthless and can be throwed away. I can't buy a pizza with them at the Olivia Plaza Hotel Indeed, just noticed that now. Thanks for the information. Hello,I've tried bitstamp today and saw that you can send XRPs there. I had some XRPs from the give-away so I send them to my Ripple address on bitstamp.Now, I can't see anywhere where the ripples are. Any ideas? 18Trqk3tKkF8vNoW6am5rx8K6wUSQAqo1q  :-) Very informative graphics. Indeed, we should expect a correction to 20-25 in the coming weeks/months and going below 17-18 would probably hurt the confidence in bitcoin I know it doesn't make sense to speak about a all-time low as it is basically 0 if we take bitcoins since the start.But seeing bitcoin raising since a few weeks, I'm wondering: could it be raising without ever falling again? Do you believe that we have now passed the 1$/10$/20$/30$ forever? What do you think will be an all-time low starting today?(Of course, I'm asking for predictions in the case where there's no major security problem found in bitcoin which seems, to me, the only way to really take bitcoin down) Which is exactly the main criticism against Ripple.I wonder if it would have been a good idea to make XRP different so it cannot be used as money. For example: by having continuous generation of XRPs and a validity: a XRP disappear after a given time. If this is the only problem, it's a technical one and we could imagine plenty of solutions. Let's assume that we have a faucet that prevent abuse (at least enough to make it anecdotical) I would be curious to hear about people from OpenCoin. Why are they so secret? I don't agree. One guy paid a pizza 15.000 BTC not further than 3 years ago. If he had keep them, he would now have 450k$, right? Not really. If he didn't spend those btc and nobody ever spent them, then the bitcoin we know today would not exist. The faucet was a *huge* helper and is not different at all from the giveaways of OpenCoin.What was subtle about the faucet was that the value given was decreasing. When I used the faucet, I received 0.5 BTC. Then it became 0.05, etc. (I think it was even 5BTC at the start). The faucet was taking its money from donations from rich bitcoiners.The situation is exactly the same here except that we have only one rich Rippler: OpenCoin. That's indeed a valid point that should be said more. In fact, would Ripple work without XRP at all? ProblemRipple aims to be a decentralized system. But as long as a significant portion of the XRPs is handled by a single entity, there's no way the system can work. Currently, on the 100 billions XRPs, 50% will be given through give away operations, 30% are kept by OpenCoin to fund itself and 20% are kept by Ripple's founder.There's no way a sustainable economy could grow if, at best, 50% of that economy is in the hand of the same people (OpenCoin and founders). Even 10% is completely crazy. Worst: even if, later, the founder and OpenCoin spend most of their XRP to try to bootstrap Ripple, there's no way they could prove it. Ripple will forever lives under the threat that someone might have 10% or 20% of the entire economy.If all the technical problems are solved (opensourcing the server, publication of mathematical demonstrations, etc), it would be a shame that Ripple never take off only because the founders were too gready. It is also in their best interest that Ripple becomes popular. It's better for them to hold 0.1% of a 100 mililons $ economy than 10% of a non-existent economy.Proposed SolutionBitcoin economy was, at the start, heavily boosted by the faucet. Such a faucet should be implemented for XRPs too. The faucet will give, for free, a given amount of XRPs but only once per IP and once per Ripple address. Sure, it is possible to cheat but I believe that it cannot be done on a large scale if protected by a captcha. This will allows everyone to try Ripple. Some will manage to get 10 or 100 times from the faucet. So what ?Another thing is that, once you've got your free dose from the faucet, you could still get XRPs by buying them for a fixed price or by giving a cupon code. This cupon code will enable OpenCoin to still make some giveaways. Instead of asking for a Ripple address, they will send cupon codes to people. The fixed price is very important: it ensures that, during the bootstraping, there's always a cheap way of buying XRPs and using the network. It also discourages early speculation.The faucet will also be transparent: the total money in it will be known and displayed publically. At the launch, the faucet will be loaded with 99% of all the ripples. It will be very easy to check at the start that there's well 9,900 millions of XRPs in the faucet. Transactions will be displayed publically so anybody can check for potential problem.Details1. Why 99%?The more goes on the faucet, the better. I would say that 99% is the bare minimal. Less than that leaves too much risks for a centralization. And, as said previously, the risk will *always* stay. Nobody would ever be able to proove that the risk fades away.2. What should be the fixed price of a XRPs?It could be a fixed price in bitcoins, strongly linking Ripple with the Bitcoin economy or a fixed price in any fiat currency. But then, the question is: which fiat currency to choose? [1]  Both solution should then be discussed openly. The price should be low enough so that it discourages cheating but high enough so nobody can buy a significant portion of the market.Having a low fixed price also discourage the use of XRPs as a hoarding money but reinforces the anti-spam goal. It is in the philosophy of XRPs (at least as described on the wiki).3. How much should the faucet gives?Currently, OpenCoin is sending 40,000XRPs to individuals. It means that the faucet will be able to make nearly 250,000 donations (minus the sales). If the price of XRPs should be fixed, the free faucet could decides to give less and less. This will encourage early adopters to try the system.Questions1. The faucet will ultimately dry out.That's the goal. When the faucet is dry, we can make the assumption that there's at least some distribution of XRPs accross a few ten thousands of players. At that point, the experiment may start.2. The price needs to be adjusted.A fixed price will introduce some stability and some trust in the system. It will reinforce the idea that XRP is a way to prevent spammy transactions, not a hoarding money.3. OpenCoin needs to make money.OpenCoin will receive the money from people buying from the faucet, will keep 1% of the XRPs (minus those already given) and will have its online/consultancy services. If that's not enough then OpenCoin is obviously too greedy to be trusted for launching something that big.4. Someone could buy a lot from us to control most of the economy. Firstly, it has to be noted that this power is already in the hand of OpenCoin. So why cannot we trust someone else who would do exactly the same: throwing early money at high risk to gain significant control of a future economy?Now, we have to think about what it means: the more one single player buy XRPs, the less the Ripple economy has a chance to become successful. Do you think that a bitcoin would worth 34$ if 10 players were keeping 1 million BTC each? I don't think so.The situation is then exactly the same for any rich player than for OpenCoin: finding a balance between earning money and not crashing the structure by controlling too much.5. OpenCoin has too keep some reserves, to reinject in the economy if needed.No. It would means that OpenCoin becomes the government of the completely centralized Ripple economy. There's only two solutions: the Ripple economy sustains itself and is able to survive through problems and crisis or it is not. In that case, Ripple is not the solution we need.Having OpenCoin as a Benevelent Dictator of the economy is the worst possible thing and is, by definition, the opposite of decentralization.6. OpenCoin could buy from itself.See question 4.[1] Another solution is to propose a fixed price for most currencies (like dollars, euros, ). It doesn't matter if the price is not the same in different currencies: it's a selling price but not a buying price. During that bootstraping phase, the market price of XRPs will never go above that fixed price. Say that the fixed price of an XRP is 1 and 1$ but that 1=1.5$. It is more interesting to buy your XRP with dollar but it doesn't mean you will find someone to sell your XRP at 1. What would be their interest to do that? They could also take themselves part in the give-away.  tl;dr : In this message, I formalize the proposal from Andrew Vorobyov to distribute XRPs but "forcing" Ripple creator to sell 99% of all the XRPs at a fixed price. It seems to only have advantages (including for them). The only remaining question: should the fixed price be in bitcoins or in dollars (or in euros)Andrew's idea appears to be quite sensible. Here's what you can do :1. Keep for you only 1% of all XRPs. Or 0.1%. The fewer you keep, the more people will trust Ripple to not be controlled by one big player. You currently decided to keep 10%, which is quite huge.2. With the 99% that left, give them through give-away when possible (such as on this forum) and also allow people to buy them from you for a fixed price. A price that will never vary until the faucet dries out.How do you fix that price? It's quite simple: make up the price you think the company should earn in the next 10 years. Say $100,000,000. Consider that you will give-away 49% and sell 50%. That values the XRP at 0.002$.a) But then we will ultimately dry out.That's the goal. As long as you keep a significant portion of the XRPs, there will be no trust in the system. The less you have, the more decentralized the system will be.b) But we need to adjust the price.No at the start. As said, this will introduce some stability and some trust in the system.c) But we need to make money.Remember that by doing that, you are already making 100 millions of dollars. Then you also have your services. And you keep 1% of all the XRPs in case the value increase. If it's not enough then, obviously, we cannot trust you to bootstrap Ripple to become a trully decentralized system.d) Someone could buy a lot from us to control most of the economy. In order to become as powerful as you, someone as to invest 2 millions of dollars in Ripple. That's already quite a lot. Why cannot we trust someone that invest 2 millions of dollars and should we trust you instead ?e) Why not link it to bitcoin instead of dollars ?This is an example. I would say that linking to dollars might be more appealing to those who are not familiar yet with bitcoins. It would also mean that XRP is as volatile as the bitcoin. On the other hand, as I guess you expect bitcoin's value to increase (like I do), this can only be good for you. But it can be "too good" and kill the Ripple economy. Let take the scenario where bitcoin suddenly rises to 1000$ and you still have more than 80% of all the XRPs. It means that an XRPs will be valued 100 times more. It might be a showstopper for newcomer wanting to enter the Ripple economy.All in all, I think it is a very good thing. It kills speculation during the bootstrap phase (speculators can still play with bitcoins) and it is completely in line with the "XRPs is not a money, only a spam prevention". It also means that, once the faucet dries out, 100 millions of dollars have been invested in the Ripple economy. Until that time, a transaction would still stay cheap.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9W7oc-BS5c I find this song particularly adequate:http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/On+My+Way+Up/4RHifq?src=5 Thanks for the answer. The reason why the server is not opensourced makes sense.I've another question: 5. Why was XRP developed while Bitcoin would have been enough to prevent transaction spam? (requires a tiny fraction of a bitcoin to send a transaction, take that from the value being sent, even if that value is not in bitcoin) All boils down to one question: Why inventing "XRPs" while bitcoins would have been enough? What are the properties of XRP that Bitcoin doesn't have? I think we should also provide possible solutions and ask why they don't choose to do it.For example, they could giveaway 99,9% of the XRPs. Why only 80%? And how can we prove that there are really doing that? Hello,I'm quite interested in Ripple (see http://ploum.net/post/ripple-making-bitcoin-easier-or-obsolete ) but, besides the technical questions, I would like to ask some non-technical questions:1. Why isn't the server opensourced yet.2. Do you really expect people to make a list of person they trust or person they don't?3. Paying still requires a user unfriendly address like: rKXFsg5EuG4BzLxdTBFXJq2a6iNfyx1hRX  Is there any plan to make it friendlier? (like allowing to send money to an email address by allowing people to make an alias?)4. XRP is a currency but XRP is not. Hum If XRP is working as well as advertized, what would be the reason to keep bitcoins?Thanks rKXFsg5EuG4BzLxdTBFXJq2a6iNfyx1hRX Could you send me, by PM, his email address ? Thanks I've tried to contact info@tradehill.com but this is an automic address who transform your email into some ticket on https://tradehill.zendesk.com  which means I doubt there will be any reply (but maybe, it just takes really long for them to do so).Anyway, I'm sad to see TradeHill disappearing. PS: thanks, I've changed my signature. Hello,I've been away from the Bitcoin community for a bit less than a year, to avoid temptation of short-term trading ;-)Unfortunately, in the meantime, I discovered that TradeHill shutdown. I still have bitcoins there. How can I retrieve them ?Thanks in advance for helping and sorry for being several trains late. réponse simple: j'ai écrit cet article en janvier (après avoir discuté de l'idée avec le webmaster framasoft en octobre/novembre), il m'est revenu quelques semaines plus tard avec des demandes de corrections et d'approfondissements et  j'ai traîné jusqu'à juillet avant de finalement faire les corrections demandées (+ une sérieuse mise à jour).Mais c'est clair que ce n'est plus vraiment nécessaire.C'est ça la procrastination ;-) Hello,Juste pour signaler que j'ai contribué un article pour présenter le bitcoin sur Framasoft:http://www.framablog.org/index.php/post/2011/08/08/bitcoinBonne lecture ! Isn't that what we call "economical science".  Indeed, I'm becoming pessimistic here. Who will buy all those cheap bitcoins? Those who believe in the longterm success of bitcoin and already own 10,000 btc. Which means that fewer people will share the whole bitcoin pie, making it less relevant and less interesting from an economical perspective.   What about Bitcoin7? The interface is quite nice and they are quite responsive. I described that as part of my bitcoin banking system (see my sig). It is called "market makers" Might be a big hoarder who decided to cash out at 17$, now instead of later. When the price was increasing, new people had an incentive to buy.Now, after red friday, MtGox hack and all the fuzz, if I were a newcome, I would certainly not buy any bitcoin right now. This lead me to the fact that, maybe, most of the buyer are currently hoarders who already have may coins and want more.As such, this might be a bad thing for the economy because it means that more and more bitcoins will be in the hand of less and less people, which is exactly what the system is trying to avoid.In your opinion, who is buying now and what should we do to encourage newcomers to buy? Posted it on my blog, if you are willing to share the link: http://ploum.net/post/bitcoin-banking And security is itself a problem of usability. How to build secure system that people can use and where they cannot break the security themselves?
That's just a name. I don't really care if it called a Zooblabla sytem. There are plenty of space where money could be done. The easiest one is a fee on any conversion. Let's imagine that the merchant wants 10, you are able to provide that for 0,76btc but you ask 0,77 or 0,78btc.This would be transparently included in the ticker sent by the bank to the merchant. There is also opportunities to make paying services, like guarantee on escrow.That's a question for a lawyer.  But I don't see any major difference with Paypal. Basically, it's a decentralized Paypal system, nothing more. How are merchants using Paypal handling that? I believe (I may be wrong) that they only have to care about that when the withdraw money from Paypal to their bank account.If it is indeed the case, it would be exactly the same here.Anyway, I don't really care about that at this stage because it is currently still a legal problem. Asking about laws at this stage is just like asking Bittorrent creator's about how they would fight piracy at a stage when nothing of their protocol is implemented. You are right. I purposedly ignored any legal implication.But I believe that, for a merchant, accepting payment from a Bitcoin bank would not be different than accepting Paypal. You have an trusted intermediary that tell you "ok, I've received the money, you can deliver". For the merchant, the Bitcoin Bank would not be different at all.Also, don't forget that this is distributed. If there's at least one country where such a bitcoin bank could exist, it is sufficient. And I will answer him before asking him exactly the same question  Unlike many people out there, I'm not doing secret plans, promising a lot. All the ideas are public, in this paper. And I'm willing to take my part in making this idea happen. If someone find the idea interesting enough to consider an investment, he might approach me.  I'm not saying "give me one million, I will make a startup, you will receive two in 2 years". I'm looking for real partnership, real trust and concommitment.If I don't get it, well, at least the ideas is public and someone might jump in. I took the time to do it: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=24256 Here you are: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=24256 Hello,I'm not an economist. I'm not a politician. I'm an usability engineer. What I care about is to make technology easy to use by everybody.In that aspect, Bitcoin fails in nearly every possible way.- It is impossible to grasp without spending hours on it.- It is very hard to use to pay or receive payments.- It is very hard to make it secure to avoid having your bitcoins stolen.- It is hard to understand how to buy bitcoin and even harder to ensure you buy at a good rate- It is also risky to accept it as a payment as you don't know what value it will have in the future.- Bitcoin transaction requires complex escrow mechanisms (which are handled by VISA or Paypal transparently, most people don't even know what an escrow is)- It is currently almost impossible to accept Bitcoins in a physical shop (to much hassle)I had ideas for all of those concerns and there was nothing impossible to solve.Then, I sat down, and decided to write my ideas, to imagine a solution for those problems. Then I realized that all the ideas were merging perfectly in only one concept: Bitcoin Banks. Then, I imagined this Bitcoin bank and realized that it would be a completely ground breaking technology. It would really put the whole banking/e-payment system in danger.Well, I believe that ideas are free so I want to share this Beta version of the paper with you:http://ploum.net/public/bitcoin/bitcoin_banking.pdfPlease accept apologies for the bad English. I'm willing to improve my writing. send me corrections and criticisms.I'm now looking for investors to build that Bitcoin bank of the future. Unfortunately, this is not a 10,000$ investment. It needs to be big and a lot of work is needed. But I really believe that this is an unavoidable breakthrough we will see in the next 15 years.And if you find that interesting, a few millies for the work are appreciated:15SCCTDK9xcZyKFWXsPRXYS9s1m3MikcxsUPDATE: if you want to share the link, please use this one : http://ploum.net/post/bitcoin-banking Well, I wanted to have an overview of the balance *now*. This could of course change in the future. The goal is to have a rough idea of where the money come from in the current Bitcoin economy. I've finished a 10 pages paper describing exactly that. If someone wants to invest (a lot of) money in the creation of a bitcoin bank, the plan is already there :-) It does a great job of making people believe that it works and allowing a few to gain lot of money. Well, you could have a Linux netbook for the sole purpose of running bitcoin. This doesn't even need to be run in the restaurant: the payment could be check on blockexplorer.Anyway, I agree that this is still very complicated and not suitable for everyday use. It doesn't make sense to make such a change before bitcoin reach a stable value above 100$.I like the method proposed in another thread (step by step). We could implement it and decide later if there's a need to change or not. Speaking in uBTC would be as acceptable to me. With the list of users and their email address having been made public, I'm astonished we are not receiving more of those   I received a mail from MtGox saying that I tried to reset my password.This was not me (this is obvious, the request is coming from a Windows PC   )But the strangest thing is that if you try to reply to the mail (as they told you to do if you haven't requested the reset), the mail is sent to :Mt.Gox@w001.mo.us.xta.net Do you smell that? So it means that the money doesn't exist anywhere. It is just a number sent between accounts on the Federal Reserve.What is still a bit unclear to me is the bootstraping. Imagine a bank that is just created. How is money sent to this bank. Then how could the same bank lend more than they have? Because what they really have is recorded in their central fed account, right? Not far. But missed, I'm from Belgium. I'm from Europe but it seems that things similar to ACH exist in Europe too. I'm trying to get more information about how the current banking system is working.The cash cycle is somewhat easy to figure out. Merchants bring huge quantities of cash to their bank so their are credited on their account. Banks put that cash in their ATM so when you retrieve money, it is charged on your account.The only remaining question is what if a bank has too much cash and the other not enough. Is there a market for cash? Or is everything regulated by the central bank?But now about the bank themselves. The money on your account is only a virtual value in some computer. When you pay someone from the same bank, nothing really happens except an addition and a soustraction in an internal database. In theory, if 10 people have an account with 1000 in a bank, this bank has 10,000 (we will ignore loans and debts for now).Now, what does happen when you send money to an account which is not in the same bank?It looks like an ACH is used. From what I understand, an ACH is mainly a bank for bank. So each bank should have an account to an ACH.Is that right?Who is controlling the ACH?How can a transfer between two ACH happens?How could it be controlled that the bank have well the money they pretend to have?I'm a complete n00b in that field and I'm really interested to know the answers. I was in my student appartment with other room mate, in Europe. A friend called me on my phone and told me:- Turn on CNN, now!- Why? Did you hit the front news on CNN? What did you do?- I tell you to turn on CNN, you will see.- I'm not really in a mood to watch CNN, tell me what is happening.- A plane just crashed on the pentagon!(At that point, I thought it was, you now, a small 2-3 passengers plane. Nothing really important)I laughed:- Ahah, those americans. They are so arrogants, so paranoid about security and they let a plane go through all the securities to crash on the pentagon!- Exactly, watch CNN, you will see!I hanged the phone and started to watch the news. Then I realize it was not the pentagon. There was something else. The same images were sent in loop on the tv. I was hyptonized. Then the second plane crashed in the tower. Then One tower collapsed. I immediately called my friend back.- Man, this is not funny anymore. I thought it was a small plane.- No, this is not funny at all. Then, for the whole day, we sat in front of the TV with my roommates, watching the endless loop of images.The one thing I've learn that day is how hypnotic it was, how easy it was to spend the whole day in front of a tv, hoping to see more where all we saw was the endless loop of the same 5 minutes footage.I learned the terrible power of medias.
I will fight will all my blood to ensure that a simple "lol" doesn't win this thread. How far can it goes? How greedy are people to do stupid things for 1BTC? I disagree. This is perfectly logic. Any life form is simply a tool used by genes to ensure the survival of the said gene. Humans thus want to be sure that their genes survive. That's why they have babies. But in order to ensure that your have as many babies as possible and you raise them until they are autonomous, you want to protect yourself and survive.This is so tight to our human nature that you feel that even when you don't have babies (because the genes don't accept the fact that you don't have babies). Morality is only a very logic survival instinct at the scale of a society.For example, killing is wrong because if you were allowed to kill others, others would be allowed to kill you and the society would not be a good society for your survival.This was not decided from nowhere: there were many try and guess during the human history and we are still living in a society not perfect for our survival. But we are improving (that's why we have a surpopulation problem).The way a society forces the so called "morality" is simply through education. I hope that most of you consider that killing a black man or a jude is wrong. But, not reall far from us, we've seen society where it was completely acceptable and there was nothing wrong in killing a black or a jude (or a witch or any enemy).Because education could be put into questions, most society developed a very efficient tool called "religion". That tool, which happened spontanously, used the non-understanding of the nature and superstitions to brain-wash people with a fixed morality.Of course, leaders immediately saw the benefit of exploiting such a tool and instead of teaching a morality for the good of the whole society, the perverted religion to teach a morality good for themselves alone.At some point, some leaders even reached the point where they believed in their own religion. Which is a direct downward spiral to madness. As a consequence, the society realized that religion was not a good tool anymore to teach morality. Currently, religion is fighting back in a desesperate attempt and will probably disappear in the following centuries. Optimistic people think that education will now teach the morality to people. If many people do the same, that might push the price up instead of the expected crash. At the same time, I realize that you could buy Bitcoins for 13.8$ on Bitcoin7 (disclaimer: the link contains my referral code). There is an easy arbitrage here for anybody able to send some dollars on Bitcoin7 (unfortunatly not me).Price is stable at 15.3$ on TH.Looks like the market doesn't care that much about what is happening on MtGox. The problem is that, if the order is queued but not displayed, it is unfair if you want to cancel your order after seeing how the market reacts. I'm wondering why is 32$ not reasonable and 17$ is.To me, either bitcoin will be a failure in the coming years and 17$ is still completely unreasonable, either bitcoin will become really popular and anything below 1000$ is nothing at all. Aren't church goergs all thinking that the earth is flat, that the universe was created in 6 days and that every people in the world live in their own country, in the same timezone and speak the same language? ;-) By definition, he doesn't trust people who are not attending church :-D I usually consider that under 1500BTC, it is still the current value of bitcoins. Breaking a 1000BTC wall in both direction was usually done in a matter of minutes on mtgox. I admit that it is a good one :-) Also, I miss the simple history with only the "funds added" and "funds withdrawn" lines. That allows me to know exactly how much I've spent (or earn). Whatever is on the account itself is play money. Thanks, I was really not happy with the "newbie should have 100 messages to post in the main forum" policy.Now, I'm convinced.Hint: http://tinyurl.com/5wm7d6c Some even manage to loose a bit more credibility each time they post   I agree. On the other hand, I don't think I will place any order. I just want some popcorn and watch. Typical reaction: if someone tried to break your door but finally stole your keys, you will want a more secure door.In a sense, it is logical because they realized that, next time, someone might be able to break the door. It is even useful to have unfairness, IMHO:http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/06/06/Unfairness-And-A-Pizza-The-Key-Of-Bitcoin-s-Success You can have fee free exchange on http://bitmarket.eu I'm willing to do it but:1) I need to polish everything to make it publishable. Currently, those are only note, most of them hand written. This is a somewhat important work.2) The plan itself has no real value. Only an implementation would. (I'm anti patent and I'm not seeking to protect ideas). What is the point of discussing that kind of plan? All we need is someone willing to invest (money or time) to make such plan happen. And I don't think I could do that alone.But, to be honnest, the main reason is 1) and my lazyness ;-)
I doubt. I told them that I had something between 200$ and 300$ and it appears that I've slightly more than 300$. (not the actual numbers, just to give you an idea).So I don't think that they want to play that game ;-) Well, I keep an history of all my transactions and it is embarrassing to see that I've bough a bunch of them at 0,72 and sold them at 0,94, thinking it was a huge opportunity, making 10 benefit in the mean time ;-) If you think that having a median close to the average is a sign of an healthy distribution, just wait for a few more bubble bursts like we have seen :-)(see http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/06/22/The-Bitcoin-Burst-A-Good-Thing ) You are a geek. You simply cannot understand. I know, I'm fighting this every single day since the last 10 years. Do you know the difference between the Ipod and all the other MP3 players that were on the market 2 years before the Ipod? The Ipod is more expansive. And is user friendly.Same goes for the Iphone and everything else.1% of the geek population care about effectiveness, security and stuffs like that. (they are using Linux for example). 99% want something easy. Or very cool. Paying will never be cool. As long as bitcoin is not usable by brain dead morons, no chance to seeing taking of.(And as I said somewhere else, I have the complete plan written to make Bitcoin user friendly. But I believe that developing everything I describe in that document will cost something like 20 or 30 man/months. I cannot afford that, unfortunately) There is more or less 7 millions of bitcoins currently in circulation. There is approximately 50,000-70,000 bitcoin users (if you take the number from mtgox and consider that people not on mtgox are balanced by the fake accounts).Which means, on the average, 100bitcoin per user.You are welcome, tips are appreciated: 18Trqk3tKkF8vNoW6am5rx8K6wUSQAqo1q What would you expect from a more than 1000 years book? Rules adapted to the current society? That's why you either "interpret the book" at your convenience (most christians do that) or you build a workaround which is purely artificial (like the muslim banking). Well, don't forget that a *very large* part of the current bitcoin economy is hold in hostage on MtGox.Also, a lot of people that wanted to invest money have their money currently frozen.It means that the current situation is somewhat artificial. Will the reopening of MtGox have any impact on the economy, we don't know.1. Some people want to leave the Bitcoin world and are waiting for their bitcoin on MtGox: price fall2. On the average, few people leaves : current situation3. Some people are waiting for their money and waiting for transfers to TradeHill to complete : rally!The three solutions are equally plausible. Square is the root of all evil "Not scared to be trendy""Not scared to be geekish""Not scared to wear Square²Wear""Dollars are for the tie-wearing mass"That gives me an idea for a tshirt. Do one with a tie printed on it and the slogan "Who said that bitcoiners never wear a tie?" or "I bought this tie with bitcoins in order to be taken seriously by my banker" :-D Well, I finally got accepted. Don't know what changed because I didn't provide more informations except saying I was not sure of my balance and giving a range instead of a number. Seems that it was enough. Don't forget to answer the pool afterward :http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19980It looks like Bitcoin 7 referral program is even more interesting and you can see the list of you referred people, thus allowing you to pay them if you want. I have exactly the same problem.But bank account infos are not something really private. And it might have been stored in the database. As such, there's no information I could give to MtGox that isn't public.Might also be that I've changed my password on MtGox before the hack. I was thinking about it and always assumed that I tried but that it didn't worked (bug on MtGox). What if it finally worked? How can I proove that I'm the one requesting the account? Well, it isn't as easy if the service you provide is a basic human right. If someone is dying in his blood in the street, is it acceptable to let him dying because he didn't pay?I don't think so. In most countries, this is not even legal to let someone die without trying to help him.Thus, you cannot really leave such service.What about services that are hurting everybody if you don't use them, like garbage collecting.You decide you don't pay the tax and burry all your garbage in your garden. This is hurting the whole neighborhood. As such, you cannot really leave such service.And last but not least: you are benefitting from some services like walking on roads. You cannot simply choose to not use any road. Anyway, my ISP upgraded the line last week and, as a consequence, I'm not sure I'm still the same IP range. Which means that I have no idea about the IP used previously to access MtGox. I got rejected too. Problem is that I already provided the name of the bank account used for deposit and my approximative balance. I have no more informations to provide than that. Maybe I was wrong about my balance? I don't know, I'm not sure at all if I sold all my BTC before the crash or not.All I can do now, is offering to send them a GPG signed email.I also don't understand why sending a PDF by postal paper would be a proof of anything at all? Really wondering what's the difference between the rejected and the accepted here. Also, can't MtGox simply assume that those with an email in the DB (like me) are fine ? No way? I mean, there are already exploits to crack phones. Also, it wouldn't be hard to steal a phone, copy its content and give it back to someone "sir, you lost your phone".For my Euros bank, I have a digicode, which is an unconnected physical device. This device is unique and protected by a pincode. It means that, in order to access to my bank account, the attacker would have to:- access my secret code (easy with a keylogger)- steal physically the digicode (for a device that always stay at home!)- know my PIN code (no keylogger possible)Not to mention the fact that, if it is stolen, I would immediately notice it, thus effectively blocking my account.Solutions on a phone are cheaper but they only mean that the attacker has to crack two devices instead of only one. I would definitely not trust such system if I had 1 million of  on a website. It is his job. If you refuse a package, for whatever reason, it will be sent back to the sender. Which means that the transaction has been cancelled.This is how it works and this is partly why such services are so expensive. As long as you didn't signed the receipt, they are responsible of the package.Of course, it is always possible to cheat. But your example of stealing the diamond in front of the guy is just the same as shoplifting. I'm a big fan of Bitmarket.eu. Unlike other exchanges, you don't send funds before hand. As such, bitmarket.eu only acts as an escrow. But it does it fairly well with a nice interface.The only problem is, of course, that everything is slower: if you buy 10BTC, you have to send the money by wire transfer and wait that it is confirmed (3-4 days) before you receive the coins. On the other hand, it allows you to buy very quickly :-) For delivery services, you have to put your signature to acknowledge you received it. By doing that, you agree that you received what you expected to receive. If it is done, there is no way to complain.That's why, when UPS/FedEx bell at your door, you should always open the box *before* signing. I did it a few times when expecting big packages which contain multiple pieces. I opened them and counted the pieces to be sure that everything was there.If you don't agree or whatever, just don't sign the package. The service is then forced to take it back. A good way to resolve disputes would be to simply give a link to the Fedex/DHL/UPS tracking page of the package. 1. User friendliness. (which is a *very* large topic, ranging from the banking system to the security built-in in the client). Just one random example: when you are on a website, how do you guarantee that the bitcoin address is valid and redirecting well to your seller? Answer, you don't know.Nobody seems to work on it.2. Real market.Nobody seems to work on it. Every single bitcoin webshop looks like it was designed in 1997 and tested on Netscape 3. Not to mention the fact that there's very few things to buy and that the process is really complicated, you have to understand a lot of things (including escrow) but this goes back to point 1. Well, let be honnes3. Professionnal lookBetween a "Bitcoin show" where you can see people trying to launch skype for 48 minutes or interviewer saying ah hum ah with a non-fonctionnal microphone to anarchists who advertize well that they use drugs and are proud of it, it is difficult to make something look less serious than that. ( http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/05/28/Welcome-To-The-Bitcoin-Community ;-) )The weusecoins.com was a very good try to tackle that problem.So, basically, people are very enthusiast because bitcoin *might* be the foundation of something very big. A lot of early bitcoiners are euphoric because of the quick money they did.But most of us are just uneducated, unexperienced new rich. The MtGox story is just one more example. We forgot that foundations are not enough. If you don't have the wall, the roof, the window and a shiny layer of paint, nobody want your house.We are now at one of the many turning point. Either nobody really invest in Bitcoin and it will die, either someone decide that it worths investing 1 million of $ in this and hire professionnals. He build a complete banking protocol on top of bitcoin, built a network of market maker to stabilize the price and build trust with the traditionnal online merchant, offering for example an API which allow them to accept bitcoin but converting them instantly, at a known rate, to dollars or euros.If I had 1 million of dollars,  I would do that. This is much needed. Just to give you an idea: I'm a professionnal web hosting maintainer. And I decided to not host any bitcoin related service long ago because, as a professionnal, I knew I was not good enough in security for such critical services. It looks like I was right but that nobody else was. I'm also an usability engineer and I can say that bitcoin is doing *everything* as wrong as it can be in that aspect.If you have 1 million of dollars to invest in a bitcoin startup that would foster definitely bitcoin, contact me. If not, like me, wait for someone to tackle the problem.We need walls, we need roof, we need shiny paint.
That's exactly why I believe that bubbles are good:http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/06/22/The-Bitcoin-Burst-A-Good-ThingA few more bubbles and the wealth should be distributed a bit more fairly.If you had 500,000BTC, it would have been really stupid to not sell at least some part of it at above 20$ each. I would have probably sold something like 10%, aka 1 million $. Like Nagie, most of reactions are:- The early adopters will be really rich if it works, which is unfair- I've let my computer generate coins for two days without result. It cannot work that way.- You cannot buy anything interesting with bitcoins- You are not sure if your bitcoin will keep its value in the future (yes, it contradicts number 1 but that's it). I registered and received my email in plain text!Please, change that immediately. This is completely insane. Is there any of the exchanges here with at least someone understanding basic security? The money they earn with the trade is because of their work. It is exactly the same as the money you earn with you own work. This is paid by the users and is well accepted. You know, when signing on MtGox, that you give 0,65% of you trade as a fee.How could they create artificial selloff? Every order is done by an user. The only thing that the owner could manipulate is to add fraundulently founds to his own balance. Let say that he add 10000$ without effectively sending those to the bank account. Then, indeed, he can do some transaction. Well, in that case, the money would have to be send anyway as soon as someone withdraw.Thus, there is no real fraud.Let say that MtGox owner create thousands of bitcoins to manipulate the market. This is a big risk because if there is a bank rush and everybody withdraw their bitcoins, they will not be able to pay.How are they supposed to change their bitcoin for dollars then? They probably have lot of providers who don't accept bitcoin. And how would you enforce such a rule anyway? Why would he have an advantage as an exchange? The guy running the exchange has no more information than we have, except maybe the black pool.Other than that, making money by buying low and selling high is more or less what every speculator is trying to do, isn't it? Not really. Some banks could allow anonymous account. All the bank have to do is to check that there is enough bitcoin on the account. There is no need for credit.The only part that requires trust between bank is when a bank says "I sent you the money, trust me, it's on its way". Which could be feasible through a web-of-trust. No need to reinvent the wheel, GPG does it already.For anonymity, you will have to choose either a bank that you access only through Tor, either a bank that you trust to protect your privacy, either you open your own bank (but then you have to work to ensure you are part of the web of trust).This would be only a layer on top of Bitcoin. Which means that good old bitcoin transactions are still available. If you want quick transaction and full anonymity, it might be harder.  A simple solution would be to have "Dark banks" with their own web-of-trust. The credit cards are not transfering your money quickly. They are agreeing to transfer the money and the merchant trust them.If you had BitBanking protocol (like I described here: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=1859.msg23094 ), you could simply agree on the transaction with a GPG signed agreement.The receiver could then choose to:1) trust it because he trusts a given bank and close the transaction immediately2) Do not trust it so much, thus waiting for the transaction to appear (even with 0 confirmations)3) wait for X confirmationsThe choice could be based on the importance of the transaction, the reputation of the bank, etc.Note: I'm using the term bank and a lot of people are telling me that there is no point to bitcoin if we have to create bank. But a bitbank would be completely different to what we know, just like a mail server has no comparison with a post office. Will you process manually all claims? Even those with an associated mail address?Also, is there any account with lost funds? How much do you offer for 150$ TH and 150$ on MtGox? Le Bitcoin, après une forte croissance de sa popularité, se trouve face aux critiques. L'actualité avec le piratage de MtGox n'aide pas à donner confiance envers le bitcoin.Ne nous y trompons pas: tous les projets populaires sont passés par là. J'ai personnellement connu cette période troublée pour Firefox, Linux et XMPP. Le Bitcoin ne fait pas exception et c'était très prévisible.Cependant, histoire de donner une petit défense au bitcoin, j'ai écrit un texte ou, pour une fois, je n'essaye pas de réfuter les arguments des anti-bitcoins. J'essaye juste de montrer pourquoi on peut croire au bitcoin:http://ploum.net/post/un-bitcoin-dans-la-tete Of course it is. Gmail requires at least 6 characters in the login. Easy to verify: just ask the guy to send me my own password hash so I can compare them. I use the same nickname on every website, should be easy. Just discovered that bitcoin7 is doing it too. They don't have so much spam although they are still open. What's the catch? The real question is: what kind of auditor has his own computer compromized.  But I think that this is true. Never underestimate stupidity. Do you mean episode 005 or an upcoming 006? Is there a way to have the information written somewhere? (I'm a really quick reader but I miss a lot of stuffs during a 48min show, especially because English is not my native language) sukrim > I just passed the 100 referred mark, just like you.I agree that the fact that it's in USD sucks. I even received a 0.015 LR. I have no idea on how to spend them. They just sit there, useless. You can see the exact number of users that put your referral link by going to your personnal info page (clicking your email address on the top of the page) I think that the TradeHill referral program is a really great idea. But there are a lot of criticism lately because of people spamming their referral links everywhere.Having my email address in the leaked MtGox database, I even received 3 personnal emails containing TradeHill referral code.Is it really TradeHill fault? What do you think about it? And, on a personnal scale, do you think you will make any money with that system? Statistically, if you have 100 referred users, that should cover your transaction fees, which is quite interesting.Do you sometimes think about the referral code you used yourself and wish you could change it? I personnally used Bruce's code, having registered after seeing his tweet. I just realized that you could make money by randomly exchanging the address of someone by yours. It could be unnoticed for a long time.How do you plan to build trust upon your tool? I like the idea, I created http://payb.tc/ploum !
A simple but effective measure could be to force email confirmation for any withdraw. In a longer term, I really hope to see GPG authentification required for big trades It means a lot of questions. I've asked some of them here:http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/06/19/Huge-crash-and-compromized-datas-on-MtGoxBut I don't have answers yet. (be welcome to comment on the article page) I would ask myself: why were you so dumb? You could simply send the bitcoins to one adress and, later, sell them slowly.Why was there a huge crash like that? I would bet on the success of bitcoin in the long term without betting on its future value. How? Simply by investing in a business that accept bitcoins or by creating a new business based on bitcoins or anything similar.  Hello,After 5 weeks and 5 edtions, we hope that the bitcoin community had the opportunity to discover The Bitcoin Sun. But, surely, we are far from perfect and we are trying to improve ourselves every week.What is your opinion about The Bitcoin Sun right now? Have you any comment you want to share? Why do you read (or don't read) our newspaper? What would you like to see improved?Another poll was also posted a few weeks ago and we were happy to discover than more than half of the respondants were reading The Bitcoin Sun: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=10798.0 N'oublions pas que, en dehors de l'aspect technique de la sécurité (où je trouve que les gens se déresponsabilisent beaucoup trop), il y a le simple bon sens.Si tu as 500.000$, tu ne les gardes pas en billets en dessous de ton matelas! Ni même dans une banque de quartier.Et bien bitcoin, c'est pareil: si tu en as beaucoup, tu diversifies. Tu en mets sur différents ordinateurs, tu en mets certains sur différents comptes en ligne (en fonction de la confiance que tu leur donne).Garder 25000btc sur ton ordinateur personnel que tu utilises tous les jours pour aller sur le web (et sous Windows qui plus est), je suis désolé mais c'est tendre le bâton pour se faire battre.Ce genre d'utilisateurs est déjà à la base de la majorité du spam qu'on reçoit mais là, ils s'en foutaient (pour info, un commentaire légitime sur vingt reçu sur mon blog provient d'une machine qui, d'après spamhaus, est reconnue pour avoir envoyé du spam dans les dernières 24h. Cela signifie que 1/20ème de mes commenteurs, sur un blog pourtant orienté geek/linux, a une machine infectée et reconnue comme telle). Et bien voilà, maintenant, les utilisateurs réalisent que c'est important de sécuriser sa machine. For porn, anonymity has not to be top notch. It is legal in most countries and people just need to avoid it being too visible.  I think it's a rather important point. I don't attack you. I say that faith is stupidity. Believing in something is a stupid act. But we all do stupid thing and good thing. I don't attack you, I attack the whole idea of faith. And the fact that you consider that, because of your faith, you are right over some people who have a phd, could be considered as a stupid act itself, which tends to agree with my vision of "faith is stupid".It doesn't mean that people who have faith are stupid (even if it is proven than, statistically, the IQ is inversely correlated with the religiousness of people). It only means that people who have faith are doing stupid. Loosing my time on this forum could also be considered as stupid, I admit, I'm also doing a lot of stupid things in my life ;-) Après l'euphorie des débuts (les gens enthousiastes joignant le projet), il est logique de rencontrer le scepticisme. C'est même une bonne chose qui va soit renforcer le bitcoin, soit le faire disparaitre à jamais et, dans ce cas, tant pis pour le bitcoin ;-) Je ne suis pas tout à fait d'accord. Certes, ils sont relativement critiques vis-à-vis du bitcoin mais c'est surtout parce qu'ils ont pris la peine d'interroger des personnes qui sont opposées au bitcoin, comme Stéphane Laborde (galuel).Et cela me semble pertinent de s'inscrire dans une position plus neutre en donnant de la voix aux opposants également. J'ai effectué un lobbying intensif auprès de certains journalistes d'OWNI et ça a marché: le bitcoin est devenu un sujet presque courant: http://owni.fr/tag/bitcoin/  I convinced some OWNI journalists to have a deeper look into bitcoin. OWNI is one of the most popular news website on the French speaking web.Now, they have plenty of articles about bitcoin: http://owni.fr/tag/bitcoin/If you want to thanks me for my lobbying work, donations are welcome on 139JxXLqvUzh77x3x49nbLLUTMgopfJE3k Rick Falkvinge is the founder of the first Pirate Party and recently decided to invest all of his money into Bitcoin.The Bitcoin Sun had an interview with him. You can read the first part here:http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/06/16/Interview-with-Rick-Falkvinge%2C-founder-of-the-first-Pirate-Party-%28part-1%29The second part is currently availble in the paying edition ( http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/edition_005 ) but should be available for free in something like a week or so.Since that interview, Rick published a lot of interesting articles about bitcoin. They really worth a read:http://falkvinge.net/category/infopolicy/ Bob is a miner. He now has 100.000 bitcoins and invested a lot of money in a mining rig. Difficulty increase and he realizes that mining is not profitable anymore for him. He decides to retire and to take his money back. He sell 50.000 bitcoins that very same day.Price fall.Funny, I just demonstrated that the difficulty increase might drive the price down as well. For those who don't want to spend 20 millies, don't hesitate to share it. It's a PDF file, there is no DRM or other dumb protection. Share, share, share :-) That's not really an excuse. I will take some english lessons this year. Much needed. Probably, yes. I explained the concept of bitcoin to my mother and she read a bit by herself on the net. She said, after that, that she would never buy a bitcoin more than 1. 20 is definitely too much.I think that this kind of reaction or misperception are really common and that's why we should move the decimal place. well, Bruce was wrong. His own referral code is also a 10% discount. Thanks for using my code anyway. Another great tool to foresee the trend is not the actual price but well the distance to a given goal.A few minutes ago, 17$ was somethings like 1300BTC away. Now, it's only 958BTC away on mtgox. It means that only the next 958BTC bought will be under 17$. 934! And it keeps decreasing. Of course, this is on mtgox only. You can still buy at 15.9 on tradehill!
I've sent you a PM If that 2000 years is important to you, I would recommend you to become a believer in the old Egyptian religion. We have 4000 years old document from them and those are really interesting too.As I said: a book cannot be entirely false. And love your neighbor is not something true or false, it's merely an opinion. But I don't understand how you came to the conclusion that the entire book is the truth because the message you extracted from the book is something you like. (some part of the bible could as well be summarized as "kill your son" but we will not enter in that debate)Point for me then?Wonderful! We finally agree. Exactly. What is the point of believing only a segment of it? Well, I don't believe anything, I use my judgement You consider that it is too hard so you choose to consider that the whole book is the truth.  That is awesome. Please read what you wrote again and again. "I don't have a Phd but I know from my non-education than those who have are wrong". That wowThat's why I always say that faith is a synonym for stupidity. You are convinced that you are right, no matter what. I like TradeHill but I think it could be a lot better than it is right now.(for those who are from planet Mars, clic here to join TradeHill with a permanent discount)1) Allow the users to choose in which currency they want their commission (and default it to Bitcoin!)2) Allow user to sell/buy/instant sell/instant buy based on a number of dollars, not only bitcoin. Currently, if you want to empty your account to buy bitcoins, you have to do the math yourself3) By the way, allow a quick function : sell everything or buy as much as I can in the instant buy/sell. That would be really helpful.Thanks and Love :-) Indeed, I would also like the option to have the commission paid in bitcoin. I'm from a non-dollar country and imagine one second that someone from sweden use my referral: I will end with Swedish kron on my account :-D If you go to your profile, you will see the Referral Program section:My question is: what is the difference between the referral benefit and the referral rate?  Use TH-R181 then :-) Wow, it's already down here! DDOS? no. The bible says that the world was created in 6 days. It is false. Thus, we know that there are mistakes in the bible. We know also that there should be some truth in the bible (because writing an entire book full of false stuffs looks improbable to me).Thus, the bible contains some good stuffs and some false stuffs. It also contains some stuffs that are neither good or bad, merely an opinion.Thus, the fact that something is in the bible has no logical value. You have to use your judgement anyway.Thus, you finally use your judgement, not the bible.The problem is that religious zealot use their judgement then try to fit this judgement into the bible by calling the "interpretation" magic.I did the experiment several times: give me a random book, give me a random sentence (like "you should eat babies for breakfast"). I will open that random book at a random page and proove you, with some interpretation, that this very same page order you to eat babies for breakfast. Then I will proove the opposite.For people who litteraly believe what's in the bible word by word, well, I'm not sure we cannot do anything for them anymore ;-) Exactly. I never understood that. And why having an expiration date for address? I mean, just have a deposit address per user is good. That's what they are doing on http://bitmarket.eu and it works well. Aha, go and read the first paragraph of http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/06/06/Unfairness-And-A-Pizza-The-Key-Of-Bitcoin-s-Success   I think we only have to wait a bit. Be patient ;-) I see no information regarding to that, indeed. At least, we can say that Bruce support the initiative. The site say that if you use the referal code TH-R181, you get a 10% discount, not 5% ! (see fees and commissions) Friday, I will receive some money from Flattr on Moneybookers. I'm interested but it will be euros. How many euros/bitcoin do you want? Alexa still thinks that http://ploum.net (my website) is a Dutch camping website. I own the domain since at least 2008 (might be 2007) and it was free at that time. I don't even remotely understand how it is possible.But I admit that there might be a problem somewhere with my domain as it stays at PR 3 in Google, despite having a lot of backlinks and despite the fact that my previous URL (which now redirect to ploum.net) was PR 6 at the time of the switch. It depends how much I'm paid to have it ;-) I don't remember that those details were there when I wrote my own post. In fact, reading your first post is like tap-dancing on quick-sand.  Did your post have a life on its own? It seems to grow, to evolve by itself. It's alive! It's aliiiiiiive! The fact that you claim there will be a 1000BTC bounty while, at the same time, you add The Bitcoin Sun to your sig in order to receive 0.1BTC   Oh, this thread is still alive. Astonishing!Will you announce the "winners"? You said that there was a 10 days limit, I think it is done now ;-)
I also propose the following way of making a shift:0) Make an informal board of all bitcoin clients developpers.1) Formal decision and announcements. From July 1st to July 31st. A special pag carrying a FAQ is done before this date. During one month, every bitcoin user could raise issues and send them to the board. That way, the board of client programmer might discuss potentially unforseen problems.2) On July 31st, that board of developpers decide wether or not they will go for a decimal change. This decision is made public and a target date is given. (Say September 1st).All the developers commit to make a release with the decimal change on that day. All bitcoin merchants and services have one month to adapt their software. I think that shifting from 6 decimals is better than 3 because it would avoid a lot of mistake. I mean, if you see something (say a ring) sold for 100BTC, you might hesitate: is it a very good ring, in gold, or is it just a crap and it is sold with the new BTC currency? Is it 3000$ or 3$?With a 6 digits move, there cannot be any doubt.I also realized that, since BTC is over 10$, I'm not buying anymore. Just because I find silly to spend so much money for so few bitcoins. I know that this is silly but, well, I cannot control it. I did one offer:http://forbitcoin.com/Advertising/59/put-a-link-to-your-website-in-my-bitcoin-forum-signature You might take inspiration from this website:https://www.odesk.com/ Why is that bullish? What could we fear from that? Why is a correction a good thing? The first Bitcoin Story has been published in The Bitcoin Sun nbr4 but we also published it online:http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/06/07/Your-Bitcoin-Story%2C-episode-1Don't forget to submit your stories before Thursday if you want to be published. (We currently pay 1BTC but it might change in the future)For those of you who want to be informed when the Bitcoin Sun is released, we put a newsletter in place:http://thebitcoinsun.com/newsletter/formWe know that everything is still a bit rough, we are working on all the little issues :-) The problem with christians is that they stick to one book. They proove everything by stating that "everything is true in the bible". If I do the same for any book (let's take the first harry potter), I can tell you a lot of thing.But there's no point to argue because the fact that the bible is the truth is so deeply engraved in christians brains that they can told you that "the bible is the truth because it is told in the bible" without even realizing how stupid it is.Why are the examples different? The Jihadist were, at the beginning, very normal people, with wifes and kids. At some point, they were so deeply convinced by someone that they wanted to give their life for that. It happens all the time in human history that some people are willing to die for ideas.That's for me when I consider people to be dangerous extremists : when they are considering their ideas more important than their own lives.I would die myself to protect other human beings. But, if someone point a gun at me and say "I kill all atheists", I will gladly reply that "I believe in God". It was requested by the readers themselves ;-)But we are not copyright whore: don't hesitate to share the PDF with others that cannot afford it! If he was still there, I could have evidence that he was there. As long as I don't have evidence, he's of course not there.   I haven't seen (nor heard) about that documentation. Would be really happy to hear about that.But for your point: how many US soldiers were killed in Irak because Irak had weapon of mass destruction? Do you think that people who committed 9/11 were right or did the sacrifice themselves for a lie? It's incredibly easy to find people ready to sacrifice themselves for whatever reason. Really. ;-)  I don't understand your point here. Seems interesting but I miss something. Analogy is not a justification. We are speaking about a universe here. Our universe is made of matter and energy. Matter and energy obey to some rules (we know some of them). If the god interact with the universe (thus the matter and the energy), it should obey to the rule of this matter.But let's agree for a while because you analogy is interesting anyway: you agree that the carpenter (the god) does not have any relationship with the house anymore! The only proof we have of a carpenter is that we see a house. If you leave in that house, would it make any sense to worship the carpenter or to follow rules that you believe were rules left by the carpenter? He's not there anymore anyway. It is very hard to find a neutral study that say if Jesus was an existing person or not. Most of the scientists I've heard of tend to agree that there was a multitude of preachers at that time and that the Jesus could be an impersonification of several of them. But, let's agree that someone called Jesus really existed 2000 years ago and was murdered on a cross (which was *very* common at that time).So what? What is your question? Is it an historical figure?Ramses II was living 1300 years before that Jesus. We still have his body, we know a shit load about him. This is also an historical figure. A lot of text say that Ramses 2 did some really magical stuffs. A lot of texts explains that he was a hero at the battle of Kadesh. We know that it is not true. Nobody would blindly trust something because it was written ;-) If the god is outside the universe, there is no possible interaction with it. Thus, it is not a god as we define it.If the god is able to communicate with us (observing us and/or listenning to prayer), then it has too be part of the universe. Then, it should respect the laws of that universe. (it could be laws that we still don't know). If it is the case, then, its existence could be easily proved.So, if there is a god of any kind, its existence should be proved.Easy, isn't it? Yep. It can be observed in a laboratory. If you have the hardware, you can try by yourself.Note: I never said that the casimir effect was what created the universe. I just gave an example. If there is any evidence supporting any religion, I would be glad to hear it and I might change my mind. No, everything that can be observed cannot be explained today. Just like thunderstorm were not explainable before the electricity was discovered. But the fact that we cannot explain it doesn't mean it is not explainable. Also, there are in fact very few things that cannot be explained from history or what we can observe. Could you give me one for example?PS: by definition of the word faith, every faith is blind faith. If you look for evidence, you are not applying your faith. If someone manage to proove the existence of god and that I can reproduce this demonstration, I will say that god exists but it is not a faith. When I was a kid, I had the faith that I could fly but, as I explained, not while my parents where watching (not a joke). As I never managed to proove that to myself afterward, I think that it is sane to say that I cannot fly by myself, even if my faith was really strong ;-) Logic. If you suppose that the universe was created by a god, then it means that the god himself has to be created. Which doesn't solve the problem. So, having a god of any kind is just worthless. Some say that their god always existed. Then, why not apply the same rule to the universe?Oh, by the way, yes, Sciences explain how to make something out of nothing : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effectI admit that it is not easy to understand. That's why so much people dismiss science: "gasp, not easy to understand, I prefer a big santa claus that create the universe in 6 days. That's something I can understand with my small mind. And if i can understand it, I must be true" No. Faith means being convinced of something without any evidence of it and sticking to it even if evidence of the opposite. Generally, it comes from believing something someone (or some book) told you. There is actually no difference between faith and synonym.Not believing in god is not a faith. If I told you that there's an invisible pink unicorn currently flying above your head, would you believe it? No because there's no evidence of it. There's no faith involved.If one thousand person told you that there's an invisible pink unicorn and that your parents told you the same since your childhood, you will start to believe it. Because there's no evidence of it, you will have to come to something else and call it "faith". And because it is so patently absurd, they will even reach a point where having the faith is seen as something good.Atheist are people like that: they stick to what they can observe. Currently, the world as we know it is easier to explain without any god than with some kind of god. Thus, logical people are atheists. It is not a faith, it is called logic and intelligence. But do you have any rights on those pictures? A tineye search show plenty of results for those pictures. I miss the Invisible Pink Unicorn in that list.
The fact that The Sun should cost some money was suggested by the readers themselves. I'm wondering: what do you think now? Is it a good move?Also, I'm curious to see how many people will download the PDF. doesn't work from Europa :-( Tu vas sur https://bitmarket.eu/market/EUR, tu crées un compte et tu attends qu'il soit confirmé.Là, tu postes une offre disant combien de BTC tu veux pour combien d'euros. A protocol above bitcoin would be needed. I suggested that kind of idea here:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=1859.msg23094 Hello,I'm looking for a webdesigner to make the theme for www.thebitcoinsun.comThis would be paid in Bitcoin, of course. There are a lot of existing themes for Dotclear ( http://dotclear.org/ ) and we think that a simple personnalization of an existing theme would be enough.If you are interested, contact me: ploum at thebitcoinsun.com and send me a price offer with a details of what you offer for that price. I've read all the comments here and it's very interesting. Do you think that articles should all be published on the website? Should it be done before or after the PDF release? Downloading copyrighted material is also banned. Oh my sweet invisible pink unicorn! I hope that Bitcoin will not suffer the same fate as file sharing, who completely disappeared after being banned.wait Indeed. That's exactly why I wrote that: http://thebitcoinsun.com/post/2011/05/31/Will-it-blendIf at least it was more in the form of a question. "But what if?", it would show some sense of modesty. Sent you a PM. Now, simple question: how can people possibly visit a .bit website? They have some trouble with the email verification process. Don't worry :-) http://bitmarket.eu is really great because:- You don't have to send the money to an account first, you can buy immediately- There's no fee involved at all. What we could do is make the PDF costs 50 millies and publish articles on the website, altough a bit later in the week.What do you think? Hi people,We have launche the third edition of The Bitcoin Sun together with our website: http://thebitcoinsun.com/We are quite proud of the work involved but, now that we have some foundations, we have to think about the future and how to evolve.As such, we would be really interested by knowing what you would expect from The Bitcoin Sun? Not only in the PDF edition but also on the website. What would convince you to subscribe to the RSS or the future announcement list? We are listenning for all the suggestions. We are full of enthousiasm and want to share it with the community :-) There is let to your own appreciation. If it is really short, it has to be really good to be selected, if it is really long, it also have to worth filling a lot of space. We want the writers to be creatives.   Starting next week, The Bitcoin Sun will publish your stories about Bitcoin. Each published story will received one full bitcoin.The rules are simple: we want your story. It could be a success story, it could be a bad story, it could be anything but it should be from you, The Bitcoin Sun readers.Simply send an email to editor@thebitcoinsun.com with your story before each. Thursday 23:59 UTC. Adding pictures of yourself or that illustrate the article would surely help your story to be selected but ensure that the image is under a Creative Commons license that allows commercial use.So, it's time for a keyboard warm up.Polish your best or worst Bitcoin story and send it to us. We want to laugh, to cry, to be surprised! In this edition, we also open a new section called "Bitcoin stories". Contribute your story and earn 1BTC, informations are in the PDF ;-) That's interesting. How can we choose between your system and youtipit? What are your strenght? I know that most of you don't like this sort of stuffs but some may appreciate it. That's why I created a linkedin group for Bitcoin professionals :http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=3934654 Hello,I would like to contact the admins of this forum but I haven't the slightest idea who they are. Any tips?Thanks
As I had no luck with biddingpond.com, I'm trying bitcoinHop:http://bitcoinhop.com/auction_details.php?auction_id=100086The interface is much cleaner and the process of adding an item is a lot more easier. Just to give some perspective: in order to run out of addresses, each human currently living on the planet (±6 billions) has to generate 500 million of addresses for each single nano-second (10⁻⁹s) during the entire age of the universe (15 billions of years).I think that, from that point of view, the system is pretty safe. Finalement, j'utilise Youtipit: http://www.youtipit.org/t/J2656J'aime bien leur service :-) D'après Rick Falvinge, le bitcoin aurait pour conséquence de forcer les états à trouver une solution similaire au revenu universel.Voir:http://blog.romainriviere.fr/2011/05/le-napster-de-la-banque-arrive-sortez-le-pop-corn/ (pour la traduction française) Only 90 points left, that's only 30 voters! We can reach it tonight. :-) Après les Facebook credits, Google aussi s'enfonce de plus en plus dans le paiement:http://www.lalibre.be/societe/cyber/article/663055/google-va-transformer-les-telephones-en-moyen-de-paiement.html I like the proposal but, I don't know why, I think that the gold color is needed and works fairly well on weusecoins.com My guess is that kind of users would not be able to use bitcoin in its current state anyway. Great but you need to cancel all your current offers to make it appear clearly. http://saintcarre.dyndns.org/saintcarre/content/blog/Lorigine-de-largent Hello,Today is Open Discussion Day:http://www.opendiscussionday.org/It means that, for one day, one should try to not use any closed/proprietary protocol. This includes centralized protocols.I thought that the concept of protocols might be extended to money. So, today, try to only pay with decentralized money :http://ploum.net/post/odd2011-enHappy Open Discussion Day ;-) Yes, it's really hard, I agree. Thanks for taking the time and welcome to our little community. If you have ideas on how to make things easier, please share that with us on http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8623.msg125174 Do you take for granted that he's guilty?I'm still unsure about this whole story, so I set a poll: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8796.0 That the four possible explanations I see for what happened to the president of IMF.Number 1 is what you can read in the newspaper but, because that guy has so many ennemies, it's impossible to not think about a trap.Number 2 stands for all the version where the girl actually agreed to have sex with him (for any reason, be it for money or because he convinced her) then, later, changed her mind (for whatever reason). This is then only a story between DSK and the girl.Number 3 stands for every possibility where someone set a trap and DSK was dumbe enough to fall into it.Number 4 is a version sometimes heard because, at first, it was said that the rape happened at 13h30 while it is believed that DSK was having a lunch with his daughter. Later, the hour of the rape was changed to 12h. Some people said that it was strange.Number 1 implies that DSK is a serious asshole and desserves jail. Number 2 and 3 imply that he's actually very dumb when it comes to his dick but doesn't desserve any punishment.What's your opinion on the story? Given the huge number of ennemies (at IMF and in France) that DSK has, it is hard to not think about a trap. Nice try to escape ;-)But you cannot just choose how you define stuffs and say "I simply don't agree, I believe differently". You gave yourself arguments from Dawkins. If you don't agree, you must explain why your position is different and why is Dawkins wrong.Opinions don't matter. We are not discussing wheter blue is a nice color or not. We are discussing: is the sky blue? This is non-sense. Strong agnosticism means that you cannot know if god exist. If you cannot know that god exists, it means that god doesn't have *any* influence at all in your universe. Then, by the definition of a god, it means that god doesn't exist.Agnosticism is an irrationnal position which is simply a form of politically correct and less aggressive atheism.If agnosticism was meant to be a real position, then you could also be agnostic for the invisible pink unicorn or for everything that could be imagined. Anyway, the term "believer" sums it up. The fact that people believe in something doesn't make it true. People believe in god? Fine, that doesn't make a god. Unlike what you are saying, atheists are not believers at all. Atheism is not a faith. I know that religious people like to point to atheists as "Believers in the non-existence of god". This is not true. I, and I think most atheists will agree, simply consider that something doesn't exist unless there's enough evidence of it. So far, the concept of a god violates nearly every natural rules I experienced in my life and the only evidence people have regarding the existence of a god is that "they have faith and lot of people have faith". This is not enough to convince me but if anybody could design an experiment demonstrating the existence of a god, I would be very happy to change my mind. At the same time, it is completely impossible to demonstrate that something doesn't exist. If I tell you that there's an Invisible Pink Unicorn above your head but you can't see it, you can't feel it, there's absolutely no way for you to proove that there's no Unicorn. 1. You have to trust MtGox and be willing to send money to them. (which is not the case for a lot of people according to reaction on twitter)2. You have to understand that you need to go through Dwolla (which isn't so famous). (Have you seen the number of people on IRC which don't even figure out how to get their BTC back from mtgox?)3. You have to trust Dwolla or be willing to have an account4. You've to live in the US. That's a lot of requirements for something "easy as it could be" This week, Bitcoin had some big coverages (including wired and a tweet by scobleizer). The twitter #bitcoin is updating at an insane rate.Nevertheless, we didn't see any price increase or ask increase.I think that entering the bitcoin world is way too hard for non-geeks.1)  Understanding that bitcoin is not mining.Lot of people still don't understand that you can use bitcoin without mining. They don't understand mining but the only thing they remember is "mining" because they see it as "receiving money for CPU time" (which is false). The fact that there's still a mining option in the official client doesn't help. We should really make mining less proeminent.I've received several mails following my blog posts about bitcoin: each one of them was to help them to mine. They activated "mining" in the official client and had no result after a few hours. I should insist more on that: I don't speak about mining in any of my article (not once) and *each one* of my reader that contacted me was too have information about mining. As soon as I told them what mining was and that mining was not profitable without huge hardware, they abandonned the idea to mine.2) Buying bitcoin.It's very hard to buy bitcoins when you think about it. On bitmarket.eu, you now have to be "trusted" (which newcomers will not have). I don't speak about otc, which is over geekish. And site like mtgox or btcex don't look professionnal at all (in the eyes of most people). They are not confident to send money to that kind of website. Also, sending the money is not straightforward. The wiki page (which is at the bottom of the result page when looking for "buying bitcoins") is not attractive and a list of providers.Conclusion:I believe that bitcoiners start to live in their own little island. Any more media coverage without solving those issue would be useless. I'm really concerned that this could be an issue for newcomers. I think you should read my article about unfairness and pizza in the BitcoinSun oui, mais ici on parle de la Belgique ;-)
Un service est une prestation facturée. Pour pouvoir facturer un service, tu dois avoir un numéro de TVA. Sur le prix facturé, tu vas devoir rembourser la TVA. Ce que tu gardes n'est pas nécessairement un revenu, c'est juste une entrée d'argent pour ta société/ton status d'indépendant.Le revenu est lui la somme gagnée à la fin de l'année par un individu et qui est imposé (±45%) à la fin de l'année fiscale.Aucune idée. Mais bon, pour 95btc, c'est une relativement petite somme, donc je te conseille de pas le déclarer. C'est un peu équivalent à revendre un vieux tableau au marché aux puces. why are you asking people to pay you 25% of the generated coins? I mean, why not keeping everything for yourself? What's your benefit? Mon comptable m'a dit que c'est comparable à changer de la monnaie. Tu peux donc acheter/vendre autant que tu veux mais, à la fin de l'année fiscale, tu dois déclarer ton bénéfice total (qui peut être négatif si tu as acheté plus que tu as vendu).Par contre, si tu imposes une taxe fixe par achat/vente (genre 1%), c'est considéré comme une prestation. Dans ce cas, cela doit être facturé et il faut compter la TVA.(infos provenant de mon comptable belge. Au fait, tu comptes vendre à quel taux? Je suis preneur et, comme je vais bientôt déménager, je vends pas mal de trucs contre des bitcoins: frigos, livres, ) That's what I tried to write here: http://ploum.net/post/bitcoin-bubble (for those who like to read)It's not about how it works, it's  just about the concept of an e-currency by itself. I'm curious to see if it will slow down transactions on bitmarket.eu or not. Exactly, I agree that Wirtland is really our target of choice. I also believe that more bitcoiners should join Wirtland.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtland_%28micronation%29 Thanks for pointing the thread about your patch. I missed it and it's really needed. See my answer and my proposed protocol. Hello,This is very interesting, please consider the following protocol:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1859.msg23094(which allows you to embed a message in your transaction)Also, instead of putting random .txt file at the root of your website, have a look at http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/ which is exactly what you need!Finally, you might be interested by the following read:http://ploum.net/post/building-your-web-identityYou are really addressing the biggest flaw of Bitcoin, keep on the good work. If you need help, don't hesitate to contact me. Also, most geeks are now aware of bitcoin. The vast majority of them don't care or believe it will fail so they don't want "yet another geeky news". The next target now should be broader audience publications (already started with Forbes) and more market opportunity. I think that we should try to concentrate on pessimistic scenarios instead. What could lead Bitcoin to a crash:1) Not enough market. At some point, investors star to realize that Bitcoin is only a speculative tool and that there are very few websites using it for real. They sell, the bubble crashes. I think that this scenario is very unlikely as all we have to do to avoid that is to make more and more businesses accepting bitcoin.2) A security flaw in the software. A small security concern might drive the prices down but a huge flaw might be the death of Bitcoin. I think that, the more the time passes, the less likely it is to happen. Indeed, with the price increase, there is more and more incentive to crack the system. 3) Another e-currency appears and offer everything bitcoin has to offer without the drawbacks. That's the real danger I see for bitcoin now. Bitcoin could be the Napster or the Betamax of E-money. The biggest flaw in Bitcoin right now is that it is not user friendly. Addresses are painful to use, the software is ugly (UI looks like a win95 UI), the need for backup of wallet.dat makes it dangerous to use, there's no way to send a message with you payment (which is something you want in most case), there's no way to send a payment to someone you know without asking for a bitcoin address first.All of those problems can be solved "easily", with online banks and an e-banking protocol on top of Bitcoin. But it remains to be done and, as long as it is not done, someone else could take the lead. Huge   Thanks for the 150 Millies, now maybe you could share a picture of your rig   High five!(the other hand, of course)1BvCciPwNqqkVq8DnRw4iGitPHZ8GkfTkW I'm interested.I love writing, according to the people around me, I've way too much imagination. So I think that I qualify for that kind of Bounty.Now, I have to understand what your spaghetti-adver-teasing-cryptic message means. After reading it a few times, I had to bring it to a specialist.It was a very old shop in a dirty street. The kind of shop that exists in every city but that you probably don't want to know. As soon as I opened the door, I was hit by the dusty sweet smell. A very old man was buried under the biggest glasses I have ever seen. Handing him your message, he looked at my face and smiled, discovering plenty of yellow tooth. That's a rough translation of the Voynich manuscript, he said. AhSurprised, I was unable to answer more. Is there anything else I could do for you, young man? But, how can I claim the 1000 bitcoins then?With one hand, he started to stroke his beard. Well, young man, are the rules clear? Not at all. It looks like there is no rules. Don't you think that rules are like barriers? They are there to prevent abuses. Maybe. So, like a horse in an empty field, you are asking me for barriers in order to know where to run? That's not the way I see it. When someone scream "Go!", you can observe two kind of persons. Those who run and those who ask "Where should I go?" And I'm the one asking? regretting immediately this obvious pun. When there is no rules, freedom is the rule. And only a few brave men can accept that rule. People invent other rules to protect themselves against the fear of freedom. Will I earn 1000bitcoins by listening to silly pseudo-philosophical quotes? You learn quickly young man. Go and don't tell our conversation to anyone. Is that a rule?He laughed, I went out of the shop and now, alone in front of my computer, I'm wondering: what is this 1000BTC bounty for? I don't want to discuss if this is right or not, I don't feel qualified, but I only want to point out that there's an obvious mix between bitcoins and dollars in the reasoning.You don't have any unit in you text but, when you start, we can assume you speak in BTC (transaction fees are in BTC) then, at the end, you talk about dollars (a government spending 2 billions is in dollars, as there will never be 2 billions BTC).Where happens the switch between btc and $? I don't know and, obviously, you don't too. That's why, independently of its truth value, this first post is completely illogical. (and thus, we cannot make any conclusion from it). (no, a simple translation from btc to dollars cannot be done as, if a government want to do that, they will start buying all bitcoins, raising the value of bitcoins in the process.) I don't have any trading experience but I was wondering if the fact that a BTC has so much value could impact the value itself.Would someone pay 100$ for "one bitcoin"? How you could you use it for payment then. Every price would be 0.01BTC or similar.I thought that, by the time BTC hit 10$ (or 100$), we could agree to switch to mBTC everywhere (clients, merchants, traders). That way, you would buy 10 mBTC for one $. It's physically the same but, psychologically, not at all. The advantage of switching to mBTC is that the old BTC values are still valid. It will also give us more space to the unfounded criticism that "there are only 21 million of btc". Now, it would be "21 billion of mBTC", which looks more realistic.So, what do you think? We hear a lot valid criticism about bitcoin. But, often, the people speaking simply have no clue and the more stupid it sounds, the more they are convinced.Let's keep those memorable quotes in this thread.I start: I foresee that most people will not have bitcoin installed. Instead, they will have an account in a bitcoin-bank. Thus, it is very easy to have a debit card. It would works the same way it is working today: tell your bank that you spend some money in favor of vendor X. Vendor X receives OK and trust the bank to have sent the money.For the most advanced scenario, I've written this (in french) in the following little story: http://ploum.net/post/futur-economieThe way it works is very simple:- The vendor gives you a QR code which embed a bitcoin address.- You scan the QR code with your phone and have to enter a pin code and confirm the amount- The bitcoin address is sent to your bitcoind, which could be either your bank account, your remote computer or a local wallet on your phone, it doesn't matter.- The vendor see a green "confirmed" as soon as the transaction have been confirmed enough (which depends on the price) Does it run on Linux? No? Next topic :-) They do. There's a very old and very efficient business model about that. Just ask, in a very polite way, people to give you all of their money. It generally doesn't work except if you have a gun in your hand at the same time. It's very efficient because you can re-use the gun as many time as you want.Unfortunately, this was a so easy business model that most government made it illegal. Damn government, they are really abusing their power. We should be allowed to conduct any business we want between consenting adults.
This is an idea I had to promote bitcoins and that could be tightly related to weusecoins.com. (well, it's not really my idea, I took it from Flattr)The basic idea is to allow you to give a bitcoin tip to any Twitter user. It works that way.- A page on weusecoins.com allows you to enter an arbitrary Twitter user name ( "ploum" for the example). The page returns you a bitcoin address. (weusecoins maintains a one-to-one db matching bitcoin addresses with twitter user names)- Each time a transaction is received to a given address, weusecoins.com send a public (or private) message. "@ploum: you received a 5btc tip. Claim your 5btc (25.34$) at http://weusecoins.com/login"  (the second number is the total of bitcoins sent to that person and still unclaimed)- http://weusecoins.com/login allows you to login with your Twitter account. Once logged, you can see the total of bitcoins received, you can enter a bitcoin address to withdraw the btc and optionally check a box "automatically send received tips on that address".- As soon as the user hit the "withdraw" button, the money is sent to his bitcoin address and a message is posted on his twitter account: " successfully claimed 5btc (30.45$) at http://weusecoins.com, thanks to all the donators".(see how the value of bitcoins increased ?)What do you think? I think it would be a good way to promote bitcoin to the people we like. We simply send them bitcoin through twitter. Even if they are not really interested, at some point, the sum of money will be enough to convince them to claim it. Yes. Just be sure to keep in your DB which addresses are attached to which users. In fact, you could have only one address per user. That's how bitmarket.eu works currently.How long depends on how many confirmations you want. I think there's a callback system, so you basically send to bitcoin a command and tell it: "run this command each time you receive money".So, when bitcoind receive 10btc on address XXXX, it tells you "received 10BTC for XXXX". In your internal DB, you know that XXXX is linked to ploum so you credit ploum with 10 more BTC.  Alexz: It's very easy. Bitcoin client use RPC ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29 ) so, basically, it goes like this:- You should have a bitcoind running on your server.- When an user want to send bitcoin to the server to credit his account, you ask bitcoind for a new address (you know, like 18Trqk3tKkF8vNoW6am5rx8K6wUSQAqo1q ).- When the address receive some bitcoins and there's enough confirmation, you credit the account of that user (minus a fee if you want).From that point, bitcoin is not used anymore. Each time an user "flatt" or "tip" another, you just change a number in database and change another one in the database of the receiving user.- When an user want to withdraw, you simply ask him for his bitcoin address. Once received, you send to bitcoind a command asking to send XX money to the given address.There's no rocket science involved at all. I was willing to develop this project with a Django website (and providing hosting and everything myself) but I have absolutely no CSS/JS/graphic skills, which make it very hard for me. Also, a client which encrypts by default the wallet.dat file. Each time the client is launched, a password is asked to decrypt the file.That way, an uncrypted version of the wallet.dat is *never* present on the filesystem. I've yet to find a laundry that accepts bitcoins   Not enough. You are talking about a "de facto" standard, which could be a bad thing (like .doc format). To have a real standard, you have to ensure that everyone can read the standard, that everyone can implement the standard without any barrier and that any change made to that standard are driven by a well-known body not related to any particular private interest.Standardization is an hard science, really. Bitcoin cited in an article about Flattr:http://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2011/05/09/09gigaom-can-flattr-plus-twitter-make-micropayments-a-real-63991.html?ref=technology Works for me right now (was down since one hour). Someone put a huge order to sell 10000 btc at 9,8$. The Depth graph is now completely flat (besides that order) Si ce n'est que sur les bénéfices, alors pas de problème. C'est même normal de payer les impôts sur les bénéfices.Pour infos, je suis moi-même en train de me renseigner pour faire de même en Belgique. Pas évident du tout. It's exactly like saying that you can spend now the average annual salary of your grand-grand parents for a video game. How stupid is that? And think about Satoshi himself! He could have generated the whole bitcoins alone in his basement and earn 21*6 millions of dollars! He was really stupid to not do that and to release his software before every coin was mined.If that guy didn't spend his money for a pizza, if every bitcoin holder was willing to hoard them, bitcoin would have never reached the 6 dollars mark. I don't at all. Either he's hoarding a lot more of bitcoin and he doesn't care, either he was a fool to spend all of his bitcoin.Also, don't forget that it is how economy works. If everybody seats on his money, the money is worthless. By buying this pizza, he increased the circulation of money, increased awareness about bitcoin. It was a really smart move. I would prefer to see a comic poking fun at bitcoin. Just imagine:box 1: someone is buried into huge computers producing insane it. A woman come: "what are you doing?"Box 2: guy: "I'm mining for bitcoins, which is a virtual money. I sell those virtual bitcoins for real dollars in order to pay for my hardware. At the end, I should make an huge profit."Box 3: woman "And what will you do with all this money ?". Guy : "Invest it in something very risky but cool. Like bitcoin. Lot of bitcoins!" Yes, he did :https://twitter.com/#!/brucewagner/status/67575981820485632Sorry Bruce ;-) Anyway, no sign of a Forbes rally due to the print version. Bruce, I'm still waiting for your 5$/btc predicted this morning   I did one here: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7712.msg112514#msg112514I'm really completely surprized that this article makes some fuss. There are plenty of bad stuffs to say about bitcoin. This guy completely miss them and fall into his own illogical fallacies. (the fact that it was retweeted so much confirm the fact that rhetoric is more important than logic. People don't use logic, they follow their feeling) Je vais essayer de regrouper ici les principaux inconvénients du bitcoin que j'ai entendu et y répondre.Les transactions en ligne sont ajourd'hui soumises à un oligopole de société privées qui ont chacune un système centralisé et non-intéropérable: VISA, Paypal. Les petits concurrents ne sont guère différents et doivent se battre pour se faire une place (Dwolla, moneybookers, etc).Ce sytème pose plusieurs problème:- Prix très élévé pour la mise en place par le vendeur. Accepter les paiements par carte VISA sur son site web coûte de l'ordre de 90€/mois. Autant dire qu'il faut un fameux volume pour rentabiliser.- Prix très élevé par transactions: charge pour l'envoi d'argent sur un compte, frais de transactions particulièrement élevés, frais de retrait de l'argent d'un compte. Paypal est connu pour ses frais prohibitifs.- Centralisation: votre argent ne vous appartient pas tant que vous ne l'avez pas retiré. Ainsi, beaucoup d'utilisateurs se plaignent d'avoir eu leur compte Paypal gelé de manière arbitraire, perdant de ce fait toute possibilité d'accéder à l'argent et sans recours face à Paypal.- Les sites de vente doivent mettre en place un support pour de multiples paiement: Paypal, Visa, ceux-ci n'étant pas intéropérables entre eux.- De la mème manière, un utilisateur voulant acheter sur un site ne supportant que Paypal ou Dwolla serait obligé de créer un compte chez un de ces prestataires et d'y verser une somme d'argent, argent qui dormira sans intérêt tant qu'il n'est pas vidé.- Vos transactions sont extrêmement révélatrices de votre vie privée. Avec la généralisation des achats en ligne, centraliser toutes ses informations au sein d'une ou quelques unes sociétés privées pose beaucoup de questions.On peut comparer la situation actuelle à la situation de la messagerie instantanée il y a quelques années: MSN, ICQ, Yahoo, Skype. Un client IM se devait de réimplémenter tous les protocoles, chacun devait avoir plusieurs comptes pour être sûr d'avoir tous ses amis, certains amis étaient en double (car eux aussi avaient plusieurs comptes), certains comptes étaient fermés arbitrairement, vos communications pouvaient également être utilisée (MSN, par exemple, indexait automatiquement dans son moteur de recherche les liens échangés lors de conversations privées).Pour reprendre l'analogie, Bitcoin est comparable à XMPP. C'est un protocole qui perment à chacun d'implémenter son propre prestataire de transactions. En décentralisant les transactions, on crée un environnement favorable à une compétition saine (et donc une baisse des prix), à un respect de la vie privée et à la simplification à long-terme.Ni le papier d'un billet ni les chiffres sur un compte en banque. La valeur vient du fait qu'on a confiance en ce que quelqu'un acceptera un bien contre notre billet. Cette confiance est garantie par l'état pour les monnaies usuelles. À la différence, la confiance en bitcoin est garantie par un réseau P2P. Accepter un bitcoin, c'est faire confiance au réseau tout comme accepter un billet c'est faire confiance à l'état qui a émis ce billet.Quelle est la proportion de votre salaire que vous voyez effectivement sous forme physique? Pas beaucoup. La majorité de votre argent n'est donc qu'un chiffre sur un ordinateur. Comme bitcoin. Vous faites simplement confiance à votre banque. Avec bitcoin, vous faites confiance au réseau.Le monde est inégal. Les gens biens nés ont plus que les autres. Bitcoin n'est pas vocation de réformer le monde et la société. Bitcoin est simplement une manière d'échanger de la valeur.De plus, la richesse des premiers arrivés ne se fait pas au détriment d'autres. Cette richesse vient du fait de leur clairvoyance/investissement/chance. La majorité des richesses sont créées sur une combinaison de ces 3 facteurs, il n'y donc rien de bien étonnant.Le "mining" n'est pas une manière de devenir riche. C'est une manière de distribuer les bitcoins au départ du système afin de "lancer la machine".Les transactions bitcoins sont régulées par des lois mathématiques. Effectivement, on peut imaginer y trouver une faille. Quelle serait les conséquences de cette faille?Les transactions du système "classiques" sont régulées par des lois et des humains faisant en sorte que les lois soient bien appliquées. On peut imaginer y trouver des failles. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui s'est passé en 2008. L'économie a failli s'écrouler.La chance de trouver des failles dans un système mathémathique est généralement plus faible que dans un système humain. Mais, néanmoins, c'est une possibilité, en effet.En effet. L'utilisation des fractions de bitcoins permet de s'arranger très bien d'un nombre fini de bitcoin. Quand aux avantages d'une société déflationnaire sur une société inflationnaire, c'est une question très large (à laquelle je n'ai pas de réponse).Il y a cependant peu de chances que le bitcoin deviennent la seule monnaie au monde, la question ne se pose donc pas vraiment.Le "mining", l'acte de génération des bitcoins, n'est qu'un procédé qui perment de répartir les bitcoins de manière un peu dispersée afin de "lancer la machine". Après tout, l'auteur original aurait pu garder tous les bitcoins pour lui. En inventant un système à croissance complexe, les bitcoins se répendent peu à peu. Mais l'électricité utilisée n'a rien à voir avec la valeur du bitcoin et je déconseille d'investir dans le mining sans savoir exactement ce que l'on fait.Le fait de faire du "mining" n'est pas seulement de la génération de bitcoin (qui devient d'ailleurs de plus en plus rare), c'est également une manière de vérifier les transactions bitcoins. L'électricité n'est donc pas gaspillée dans le vide: elle sert à faire tourner le système en vérifiant l'intégrité des transactions. Si vous pensez qu'il s'agit néanmoins d'un usage peu utile de l'électricité, rappelez-vous que l'électricité est aussi nécessaire pour faire tourner les banques, l'essence pour amener tous les matins votre banquier à son travail, etc.Non. Bitcoin ne promet rien à personne. Bitcoin est un moyen d'échanger des valeurs mathémathiques. Bitcoin ne base pas sa valeur sur les derniers entrants du système. Bref, cela n'a rien à voir avec Ponzi. Cependant, la valeur actuelle du bitcoin n'est pas basée sur sa valeur réelle dans le marché économique (=les biens/services que l'on peut acheter avec des bitcoins) mais est basée sur le fait que des gens achètent des bitcoins en espérant que la valeur réelle sera plus élevée dans le futur. Ce phénomène est appelé de la spéculation. On achète un bien à un prix supérieur en espérant faire un bénéfice futur mais, ce faisant, on augmente la demande et donc on enfle artificiellement le prix.Acheter des bitcoins est donc un investissement risqué. C'est pour cela que les gens y voint du Ponzi. Mais acheter Facebook 1 milliard de dollars est également risqué sans être pour autant du Ponzi.Si vous désirez acheter des bitcoins que vous ne dépenserez pas tout de suite, vous risquez de perdre votre argent. Mais vous risquez d'en gagner également.Tout comme l'argent. Bitcoin est un outil. Il est donc intrinsèquement amoral. Ni bon, ni mauvais.Actuellement, les gouvernements surveillent très fort les échanges d'argent pour éviter les fraudes. Si bitcoin venait vraiment à se généraliser, on verrait certainement apparaitre des banques bitcoin soumises à des contrôles de l'état.De toutes façons, les fraudeurs actuels utilisent déjà des comptes en Suisse ou au Bahamas, les vendeurs de drogue utilisent des grandes malettes pleines de billets (dans les films en tout cas). Les gens honnêtent, eux, remplissent leur déclaration même si ce serait très facile de cacher certains revenus. Il y a peu de chances que bitcoin change grand chose à tout cela.Tor permet l'anonymat à des terroristes, internet assouvit les passions des pédophiles. Faut-il condamner les outils pour autant ? Good, those are indeed the 3 main aspects I foresee.Let assume that for granted for nowIf you were able to produce those cards yourself, do you think it would be hard for anybody to produce the same? I don't think you invested thousands and thousands of money in that process. So, as long as you can do it, other people can. They only have to be able to do it for a value of less than the facial value.Also, introducing new security features that cannot be copied (looks hard) is worthless if you already have cards in circulation. People will simply use those cards.Let's take that for granted. After all, lotteries are doing that everyday.I hope I don't sound to harsh. I'm trying to be constructive. All I know is that I would gladly accept to be paid in BTC for anything but I'm still unsure about accepting a card like yours.By the way: what is your business model? How would you gain money from a 5BTC card that I buy 5BTC (presumably?). (I see one potential business: selling to an higher rate against dollars but I don't know which is yours). If I understand that well, it means that you hide a code behind a sticker. With the code, you can get the bitcoins on your virtual wallet.So, my questions are:1) How do you guarantee the holder of the card that the coins are still available? Currently, we have to trust you (the emitter) *and* the fact that the sticker has not been removed, which looks a bit gross (it shouldn't be that hard to replace a sticker with another one).2) How could the user be sure that the card was emitted by you? I mean, I could print a bunch of cards with QR code and stickers, sell them for 1 or 5btc. The holder will exchange them and a the time someone try to cash them, nobody will be able to trace the card to me.The idea is interesting but could you elaborate on those two points? Short and simple: you are applying linear interpolations to a bunch of highly non-linear stuffs.Which makes your prediction as reliable as a pure random guess. The guy starts very badly that, to him, asking why bitcoin will fail is like asking why the sky is red. It is funny because, during my first read, I though that he was referring to a dusk sky. Then I realized that he consider something I see every night during summer as the most impossible thing in the world. Which tells you a lot about how our vision of the world are different.This is also really lame to start an reflexion by stating your conclusion and by stating that, before thinking about it, everybody not agreeing with your conclusion is completely stupid. This is a very bad way of reasoning, writing or convincing.But let start with the arguments themselves:50% of his arguments are against "gold as money". * Gold is heavy* Gold is inconvenient* Gold is the reason why we had a crisis in the 1930'sAnd* Bitcoin is like goldthus, his conclusion is "Bitcoin is heavy and inconvenient".I don't even need to underline the flawed logic behind that. At some point, I thought that bitcoin was responsible for the 1930's crisis.It also makes me very skeptical about the rest of the post as I believe that someone doing so huge logical errors is very unlikely to come to any worthy conclusion (or is deliberately manipulative).Then, he makes the point that the ability to make money out of nothing is what makes a good economy. This is debatable but no compelling argument is made to support this statement.Finally, he point the danger of a bug/security hole in the bitcoin software.That argument is *very* important and indeed something that should be a concern of the whole bitcoin community. As he said, mixing known algorithm in an unproven way is not as strong as the strongest algorithm.He made a very good point there.But where he fails is when he write that the current economic system is verified and cannot fail. He also say that counterfeiting paper money is harder than counterfeiting virtual money and that counterfeiters of real money are arrested before taking too much advantage of the system (which we will grant as true, even if unproven).1) The current economic system is not using any mathematic algorithm. Instead, he's relying on a constant monitoring and supervision. Banks *are* creating money everyday. The states ensure, by regulations, that the bank don't create too much money out of nothing.2) The current system already had failure. What was the 2008 crisis if not a failure of the system? Someone saw a hole in the system (despite existing regulations and enforcements) and managed to put most of the world economy on its knees. If that's not a failure, I don't know what it is.3) Most of the money in the world right now *is* virtual. It's only numbers in the computer of your bank. What percentage of your monthly salary do you see in real paper money sooner or later? I would say less than 10%. Sometimes, it could even be less than 1%. So 90% of the money is already virtual. The only way we know it is not abused its because there are some regulations and because banks are under a sever monitoring.So his argument could be rewritten as:"Would you trust more a mathematical algorithm that could have flaws or would you trust more a system monitored by humans that already showed its flaws ?"Put in that way, the answer is less straightforward.
So you mean that there's also "hidden addresses". That's kind of annoying for backup purpose. As long as bitcoin is not mainstream, it doesn't make sense to have it mainstream anyway but having a Firefox/Chrome extension would be already a huge step. We could advertise those extensions on bitcoin.org. People downloading the client could then download the extension. People using online-wallet like mybitcoin could use another extension.Now, there's the security concern but I believe that it could be addressed. After all, mailto: was, AFAIK, never abused to make people send SPAM or Viruses. Which means it is secure enough. Offer something against bitcoins. Goods or services ;-) Which means that you don't have to backup at every transaction but only when you create a new address? For example, imagine that FSF created an account only to receive donations on their website. They generated an address and pasted it on their website.Then, they backuped their wallet.dat.2 years of donations later, they loose everything in a disk crash. Will the 2 years old backup be enough to recover every transaction?If yes, then it gives some room for efficient backup strategies (like generating enough addresses in advance before a backup). If no, what am I missing?Also, why is Grondilu not seeing anything at all? It's very unlikely that he generated *every* address he ever used after backuping. At least the first 100 addresses should be there. Wait, this would mean that the wallet.dat actually "stores" the bitcoin (I don't know how). This doesn't make sense.Also, it means that we are all forced to backup the wallet each time we receive a transaction! Which is highly impractical and even impossible if services like mybitcoin.com start to grow.Good luck man, I really hope you recover your bitcoins.EDIT: thanks bitlotto for the explanations. I didn't know that it was working that way. I understand better now. A very common use-case with bitcoin is to visit a website asking for payment or donation with a bitcoin address like 1QHRvXFt6gQuafYUVbfRRpocrkKcqT3Sby, to copy it, to paste it in your bitcoin client to make the payment.I propose to make a new protocol understood by browsers who would be payto:.(As example, we already have mailto: and, in Ubuntu, apt: )The proposed syntax is very simple:Code:<a href="payto:1QHRvXFt6gQuafYUVbfRRpocrkKcqT3Sby">Send me a donation of your choice</a>Would open a payment window in the bitcoin client, with the amount field left to blank. The user have to fill the amount and press OK to send the money.Code:<a href="payto:1QHRvXFt6gQuafYUVbfRRpocrkKcqT3Sby?25">Alpaga socks checkout: 25 bitcoins</a>The following link would open the payment window within the bitcoin client with the amount field set to 25.As you can see, it could make payments a lot more user-friendly.Things to consider:1) An extension adding support for payto: should be written for major browsers. The fact that Ubuntu added the support for apt: easily should give us some confidence.2a) The official bitcoin client might need to be modified to accept an external command opening a new payment window. It should be standardized to allow other clients to do the same.2b) Maybe there should be a big warning/confirmation/cancellation timeframe to avoid people clicking on a link then clicking on OK without realizing. The confirmation window should probably indicate the URL where you clicked, with the originators of the SSL certificate (biggest warning if it's not an https website), like:"The website fritalk.com asked you to pay 25 bitcoins. Fritalk.com is certified by "Fritalk corporation". Once agreed, this transaction could not be cancelled.   [Cancel the transaction] [Send 25btc to Fritalk.com now] "What do you think?  Why would it be needed? I read about people backuping their wallet after each transaction and I still don't understand why. anyway, if you have a backup of your wallet.dat, it's not a problem.If I understood well, even a very old backup should be enough to recover all the transactions that happened after the backup (because all transactions are saved on the network anyway). Hello,I would like to set up an online-shop.What are the current alternatives for :* A webshop that accepts paypal and bitcoins* A webshop that accepts only bitcoinsThe CMS should be either django or php. It should also be easy to use by non-technical people and be maintainable (no patching needed, upgradable, etc) Je dirais également que cette critique sur l'inégalité du système me semble typiquement européenne. Dans la conception Catholique/européenne, le fait de gagner de l'argent est considérer comme "mal". On critique toujours les riches et on défend toujours les pauvres à tout prix. Toute mesure économique favorisant les riches est perçue comme antisociale. Tout système pouvant créer une inégalité est, en fait, mal perçu.Dans le monde protestant (les US, mais aussi les Pays-Bas), la richesse est une marque de succès et est admirée comme une marque de succès (à l'excès. Un fils de riche n'ayant rien fait de sa vie pourra être admiré également pour sa richesse). Du coup, le système bitcoin est vu au contraire comme ultra-égalitaire: chacun avait la chance de miner des bitcoins avec son ordi portable en 2009/début 2010. Le fait que certains n'aie pas saisi cette chance ne regarde qu'eux.Fondamentalement, ceux qui ont commencé tôt dans les bitcoins ont pris un risque. Personnellement, je n'aime pas prendre des risques. Je connais le bitcoin depuis octobre 2010 mais je n'y ai investi ni argent ni temps car je voulais voir ce que ça allait donner. Le fait de décrier le système comme inégal est pour moi une manière de résoudre le conflit intérieur: « J'aurais pu le faire, j'ai été trop prudent, je n'ai pas pu en profiter ». Et, quand on ne peut pas profiter d'un système, on cherche à le détruire, même si cela ne nous apporte rien, par simple soucis que les autres ne puissent pas en profiter non plus. What is really disturbing is that you don't know why you have a minus or a plus.I think that anonymous ranking might be good (because it avoid the "friend factor") but, at least, you should know what messages were appreciated and what weren't. Quand on la remet dans un contexte plus large, l'inégalité apparente du système bitcoin est tout de même très minime.Pensez à l'euro. La majorité de votre vie et de votre fortune est déterminée par la fortune de vos parents. Les gens qui deviennent très riches en étant issus d'une famille pauvre et vice-versa sont l'exception plutôt que la règle.C'est un fait qu'on accepte. Très peu réclament que chaque enfant reçoivent, à la naissance, une quantité d'argent égale à tous les autres. Pourquoi bitcoin devrait-il être différent ? Un petit article sur un monde futur où le bitcoin serait généralisé:http://ploum.net/post/futur-economie C'est en effet une des premières remarques que tout le monde fait. Mais il faut mitigé cela:* C'est injuste mais personne n'est lésé. Il y a seulement des gagnants et pas de perdants. C'est quelque chose que l'on rencontre tous les jours. La majorité des nouvelles fortunes vient du fait que certains ont cru en des idées avant les autres. Ne parlons même pas des anciennes fortunes qui sont encore plus injuste: il suffit d'être bien né.En ce sens, bitcoin n'est pas plus inégal que la situation actuelle. Même moins.De plus, l'inégalité est ce qui permet de promouvoir bitcoin. Les "riches" investissent leur bitcoin et leur énergie pour faire en sorte que bitcoin décolle. Il y a quelques mois, qqn a acheté une pizza pour 10.000btc. Est-ce qu'il le regrette aujourd'hui? Non car si il ne l'avait pas fait et si tout le monde avait gardé ses bitcoins, le bitcoin aurait stagné.Ce marché noir existe déjà. Est-ce que bitcoin va l'accroitre? Je ne sais pas. Est-ce que le fait qu'un outil puisse être utiliser à des fins malveillantes doit condamner cet outil? Certainement pas! Les exemples sont légions (de la cryptographie aux couteaux de cuisine.)Tout comme il n'est pas possible de le contrôler pour les revenus sur la monnaie papier ni sur les comptes en suisse ou aux bahamas. De plus, de nouveau, cela n'empêche pas l'impôt sur le revenu. Rien n'empêche non plus d'avoir des comptes bitcoins nominatifs et contrôlables (voir http://ploum.net/post/building-your-web-identity ). Le bitcoin est l'équivalent de la monnaie papier.Enfin, on retombe également sur l'argument de l'outil et de ses possibles utilisations malveillantes. Indeed, great idea. Look for "bitcoin" on the flattr forum. In fact, Flattr told us that their would be interested to provides bitcoin as long as someone else offer them a service that automatically buy their bitcoin.I'm looking to develop one myself in order to allow that. If anybody programmer want to join me (preferably django or php programmer), please contact me. Do you have an idea on what represent 20% of a normal CPU mining bitcoins for a whole day? I guess it's something like 0,0001 BTC (today, not including future difficulty). Now, you don't run the whole day but only a few hours. Let say that you play 2,5hours/day and you play 3 days/week for 50weeks (nearly the whole year). That's 0,0015BTC/year.If you have 10.000 players playing at this rate (and that's fairly optimistic), it would be something like 15BTC/year.At this rate, do you think it worths the trouble? Maybe, it's a lot more useful for games developers to put a bitcoin donation address on their website. Battle of Wesnoth is already on Flattr (I subscribed to them) and I believe they are making more money that way:https://flattr.com/thing/56371/The-Battle-for-Wesnoth(But it would be a good idea to convince Battle of Wesnoth developers to accept donations) For most of the people, it will not really matter. The definition of money is pure rhetoric. But the whole point of bitcoin is to be used mostly online. Is there system that already exist to pay online? Yes: credit card, paypal, wire transfers. Are those system easy to use? More or less, at least there are quite easy for the sender. Do they guarantee who is the receiver, do they allow you to send messages with your payment? Yes. Wire transfer allows you to do that, paypal allows you to do that.In the online world, a money doesn't exist without a nice "transfer system" on top of it. The dollars or the euro doesn't have such system so some private companies built their own and are now competing against each other.Bitcoin, as a money, have a basic built-in system. That's really nice but if you want the people to use bitcoin instead of dollar+paypal or euro+IBAN, you have to provide at least the same level of features.History shown with Linux/XMPP/Firefox that people are not sensible to new features (as astonishing as they could be) as long as they don't have the same features they had in the old system. That's, IMHO, one of the weakest point of Bitcoin. It's really hard to use.People usually want to send money to someone/some organization and:- Trust it's the good person- Be identified as the sender- Add a message (like "Happy Birthday from your grandma")Bitcoin does not provide that and, IMHO, it will be a critical step to make bitcoin acceptance easier.Could we do it on top of bitcoin. Yes, I believe. But it means designing a *protocol* on top of bitcoin. The transport could be XMPP or HTTP, I've wrote some ideas about it there: http://ploum.net/post/building-your-web-identity I think that the topic is not whether or not the laws are good.The question is "If you want to respect the current law (regardless of its stupidity), what should you do?"So please, don't fall in the anti-government rhetoric as nearly every other topic here. The question is interesting by itself. Quel est le but de cette conférence?Si c'est faire connaitre bitcoin, la question est "Comment utiliser au mieux le budget le but donné". Si une conférence semble une bonne idée, la vraie question c'est : comment amener les gens à venir à la conférence ?
mtgox is working well for European people because they have an European bank account. The only problem is that they use dollars, which means that you will loose some money in the dollars->euro conversion.But it could worth the trouble. From my moral point of view, DDOS is always unethical because it causes harms to other's properties.But my moral is out of scope here: it is illegal and any illegal activity could hurt the whole community. So if you mix : it's illegal *and* it does hurt, I really don't see how anybody with common sense would see that as acceptable. I'm not fan of those "posts limit" (because some people post few and insightful messages when people like me post a lot of small and useless messages). But I agree that, at least, it draws a barrier which is definitely needed. Better than nothing I guess. Easy: http://bitmarket.euThat way, you can sell and buy bitcoins and be paid with IBAN transfers (which are legally not more expensive than any national wire transfer). Only warning: don't release the bitcoin as long as you don't see the money on your account.If you want to sell them quickly, I might buy them for euros. Tell me how much and at which price by PM. I don't want to sound moral but it looks like a very high risk to lend you money.- You registered only 3 days ago on this forum. You don't offer any reference for your reputation.- You don't offer any way to check your liability- Your avatar seems to say that you are a drug user (which is never a good sign from someone asking to loan money)- Begging for 40$ seems to be a very desperate situation (if you can't afford 40$ from your own pocket right now, you obviously have a long-term money problem)- If you promise to give back 15btc in 2 months and that the btc is around 10$ at this time, you will be a very big looser.- Making unrealistic promises is a usual sign of unreliability (promising 15btc for 12btc in 2months in a deflationary economy looks very unrealistic, unless you expect the prices to fall completely).So, I don't want to judge you because I don't know you nor anything about your situation. I just want to point that your request looks very risky and turn on a lot of red lights. So if you want to convince someone to lend you the money, I think you have to turn off some of those red lights, by offering guarantees or by explaining how you expect to get the money back in 2 months. What was decided? Do you need a certain number of posts to be able to applause someone else?Maybe we could say that if someone was applauded 10times, he can applaud others himself. That's absolutely not the experience I had. My complains are: 10 days between my IBAN payment and the money showing on my account (And they can't even blame the bank because they acknowledged receiving the money after 5 days), an insane fee to enter the system, a fee for each transaction proposed (even if canceled afterward) (*) and a fee for each transaction finally done.And of course this all happened to me the day before the DDOS so, when I heard about the DDOS, I bought all BTC I could (at a very bad rate) to quit btcex, figuring that nobody will do business with them anymore. I still have to recover from this lost.I must add, to be perfectly fair, that they replied to my mails (even if it takes some times) and that it looks like they operate that "honestly". Anyway, if it is proven that they are involved in the DDOS against mtgox and bitmarket, it means that they are ready to do illegal stuffs, which should make anybody highly uncomfortable about using their services.(*) the fee for each transaction proposed was removed after I left btcex because it was really insane. I was trying to understand their UI, adding proposals and canceling them when I realized that, each time, I was loosing money. bitmarket looks quite since a few days. Not that many exchange. Why do you want to do that? What is your benefit in this scheme?It means that you buy btc above price market now. Assuming the price goes above 4$, you will then sell beneath price market.The other question is how could you ensure that the other part will give you your 800$back? Let see what are the possible risks:- btc price goes above 4$. If the taker bought 800$ of btc and sell them, he has a nice benefit.- btc price remains more or less the same: taker earn 2btc.- btc price falls dramatically: the taker might loose money if he bought btc with your 800$- after the first transaction, you disappear. Taker has sell 200btc above market price. He wins.- after the first transaction, the taker disappear. Same scenario as above.So my question remains: what is your benefit? This poll has already been done, isn't it? And is it popular? Is it broadcasted in the whole country? (I assume that this is a US television show) I voted but I don't know that show. Is it popular? Why is bitcoin a good idea for that show? Which is not always possible. In Belgium, when buying without having the product in your hand first (internet, phone or postal shops), it is mandatory to have a 7 days return policy with no fee at all. The only fee that could be charged to the customer is the postal fee to send the good back (and it cannot be charged by the company itself, only by the postal service).Also, no reason should be given for that return.The solution I see is to allow the buyer to be reimbursed if the price falls in the next 7 days. If you buy your mixer for 10btc and, in the next week, price drops to 5btc, you will receive 5btc back.For the merchant:- it only means a 7 days window during which the sale is not considered as done and he should not spend the money (it's already the case anyway).- if 10.000 mixers are sold on a given day, the merchant could artificially keep is price high for at least 7 days (at the price of lost sales in those 7 days, of course)For the consumer:- In a deflationary economy, it encourages you to buy stuffs because you may even have an unexpected discount. Did you hear something? It's just like someone posted before me but wait we don't really care anyway. I think I've because I'm doing Yoga/relaxation lessons with a very good teacher. Nevertheless, I've no problem doing relaxation or even meditation alone. I only need a good background music and they are very hard to find (most yoga CD are crap).Also, english si not my native language and I appreciate relaxation in my own language ;-) Then I'm less interested. Thanks for the information. I'm interested. Is there a preview of the MP3? (because I like some kind of relaxation music but not others) or to have competitors. I really like bitmarket.eu because:* it's in euros* you can buy without waiting for you money to be transfered to them* the interface is nice and easy* there's no fee.So it's already decentralized. Exchange is still happening. We only need more of them I've the same problem as BioMike. Not being a gambler, I would like to see stuffs stabilizing a bit. I have some idea about that but, basically, I agree with BioMike here. I think that the idea is genius. I would kill to have such a feature for FLOSS softwares. (and please, don't move to java!)I see to possible voting system:- traditional with fixed price (one man, one vote, possibly enforced by cookies and IP)- the richest is right (which might make sense)
I would be more interested in the community aspect (with some market and technological bits). So previous articles I wrote about bitcoin:http://ploum.net/post/building-your-web-identityhttp://ploum.net/post/bitcoin-bubble So, basically, you pay 10BTC for between 1500 to 3000 words. Is it mandatory to write every week?Also, do you really believe that there's a market for that? That this is sustainable in the long term?What would be the license of the articles? Are the author allowed to use their article elsewhere else (maybe with a given exclusive right period)?I might be interested by writing (by I've no artistic skills at all). Well, I would advice him to believe his dad instead of a bunch of lifeless anonymous spending their time on a forum. Seriously, it's very very hard to tell the difference between foolish people and visionary people. We take the risk because we are adult, we have the right to do what we want with our money that we earn. He can't. He's 16 and, statistically, have less experience in life which means he could be fooled easily.(Some 16 people are obviously smarter than some 50 people but that's not the point here) I'm currently looking for a Django freelancer. I pay either in BTC or either in Euros if the freelancer as VAT. Contact me with your Django experience. Well, I would first congratulate you for asking your father. You are perfectly right: there are a lot of scam/illegal stuffs on the internet. At 16, you are not supposed to know them all and asking advice is the best way to do it.Also, BTC involves money, which might look like gambling. Even if it is legal, there's probably an age limit. Beyond 18, you probably cannot sell BTC so better don't do it or ask your father to do it for you.Last but not least: don't spend any money on BTC. Don't buy them. (you probably can't legally)The smarter thing you can probably do right now is keeping your bitcoin for a few years (or spending them on some services that accept them).All of this having been said, you can say to your father that bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme because you don't spend any money to enter it ;-) By the way, are you using Unity? What do you think of this new interface? "despite the fact that speculation has nothing to do with a ponzi scheme, it is now usual for any economy illiterate to call anything that involves risks a ponzi scheme. If you can lose money, it's ponzi. First, you have to explain them than Ponzi is not a pasta brand" (self-citation from http://ploum.net/post/bitcoin-bubble ) Could you give a link to that? Well, I've sent 105 to btex.com. I did an offer for BTC but inputted a wrong rate so I canceled it and make a new one before changing my mind and canceling once again. At that point, I had only 100 left on my account.So doing nothing costs me 5! It's huge! At that point, I consider it nearly a scam.Sorry guys, but this is very very bad. I advise everybody to avoid btcex at all costs. (not to mention that the interface is very hard to use and that the trade volume is very low, I should have checked that before.)I consider that I loose 105 just to see how btcex was (I didn't loose them completely but I bought BTC at a rate I would have never payed on another website just to get my money out of btcex. I had no choice, money was sent on April 25th, was received by them at least on April 27th but appeared on my btcex account only today)So avoid BTCEX at all cost. Use bitmarket.eu. Well, I've a really bad experience with btcex.com.It tooks 10 days between my bank transfer and the money actually arriving on my account. At which time, the interesting offers were all gone. The communication was really bad.I also realized that the commission was huge and that making an offer and canceling costs money! So, I immediately withdrawn everything and don't want having anything with btcex anymore.By comparison, http://bitmarket.eu is simply awesome and they are very quick to reply to any inquiry without taking any fee. The problem with fund deposit, as I discovered painfully on btcex.com, is the time it takes. I was really interested by buying some bitcoins there so I've sent money last week. My money is still not on my account! (they replied me that they received it yesterday but they still have to handle the thing). Which means that, of course, all the offers I was interested in are gone! Thanks for the reward :-)Next step will be to put some "We accept bitcoins" logo on our site. * secure online payment without relying on a privately owned company* Allows micro-payment and thus open the door to a lot of new business models* cheap online payment. For 3000$, I wouldn't mind too much about your esteem ;-) On the other hand, I'm pleased by the CIA proposal. It means that they keep an eye open and want to get more information. They do their job. A lot of people assume that they feel threatened by bitcoin but we have no idea. It might even be beneficial for bitcoin in the long-term!Dream-minute: "Hey, that's cool, it would allows us to regulate a bit the economy. Let's join the bitcoin economy!" Bitcoin is open and everybody can learn everything about it (given enough time).This is open-knowledge.Sometimes, people don't have the time to do that by themselves. But they have some money. So they pay someone who knows to teach them. It takes less time for them than having to learn by themselves.Galvin is being offered this kind of deal, which is, IMHO, really good (and sign of an healthy OSS project).Now, refusing that kind of deal because you think that the customer has evil ideas is presumptuous *and* totally stupid.- the knowledge is free so, anyway, they will learn. Money will go to someone else or they will just take the time.- Who are you to judge someone without even meeting them? If, in that first meeting, Gavin receives propositions that are don't agree with his own morality, he can say "I don't want to have more business with you anymore".- also stupid because it's always a good opportunity to understand what customers want and think about your knowledge.But judging a customer without knowing what they want is really presumptuous, about the customer need *and* about Gavin's morality. He's free to do whatever he wants. If his actions arm the community, he will just be rejected by the community (don't think that Bitcoin is the first open-source project with such debates). The tulip bubble is a good example as the tulip bulbs were overestimated (in the 10000 factor). What was worst was the fact that some bulbs were sold before existing at all. It could happen if people start to buy bitcoin that are not mined yet. But today, tulip bulbs still exist and they still have a value. You can buy them and sell them. Well, PR4 is above PR3, isn't it?Anyway, I understand that you prefer shop selling tangible goods. It makes sense. is there an Ubuntu PPA for 11.04? (Natty) Yes, only PR4 but we are offering small hosting solutions since 2007/2008. It's more on the local scale, though.BTC:  1DqADLzYsHhsHFa5caQNugBpMYfxk4J8MM Fritalk.com now accepting bitcoins: http://fritalk.com/post/btc-offerEven if I'm one of the person in charge, can I claim the bounty?
I consider a free software successful when some people start paying others to work on it/work with it (aka Free Software consultancy). Linux, in that regard, is highly successful. My day job is also related to successful free softwares (GTK+, libreoffice, ).For the record, this one seems to be the first paying contract for some bitcoin work. Which is really nice for the future of bitcoin :-)Congratulations! Just posted an article about the bitcoin bubble and its possible outcomes:http://ploum.net/post/bitcoin-bubbleThe article, that will be published on planet.gnome.org and planet.ubuntu.com, is under CC By license (but there's an address for donations if you appreciate it) Just go to http://bitmarket.eu This thread should be called "Confused by inquiry to Ashbury Images". Their answer is, at least, very clear. You know, a bubble always grows and grows. During the .com era, companies worth billions! Now, they don't worth anything at all.Bitcoin *might* be a bubble which is still in its inflation phase. Whether it's a bubble or not, nobody can really know, we can only have intuition.So you are both wrong.  http://witcoin.com/witizens/396 yes, that's the bad point about my auction: sending a fridge is, well, a bit expensive ;-) Still having the fridge so trying to sell it again one more time:http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=502&mode=1http://www.bitcoinclassifieds.net/ad/34/ I like to write so I will do it for you in exchange on some bitcoins. It could be an article, scientific vulgarization or fiction. In French or in English.Just make some offer. Price would depend on the length, the time needed for the research, the level of spelling needed and other biased estimations ;-)My reference is my blog: http://ploum.net/ Fritalk is now offering blog/mail/xmpp service for bitcoinshttp://fritalk.com/post/btc-offer Voilà, le service Fritalk est maintenant accessible en bitcoin:http://fritalk.com/post/btcfr It was just a poetic license ;-) Just wanted to try cooperative mining and opened an account at deepbit after installing the cpuminer.I've launched it and I nearly immediately received one share and the webinterface told me that I was mining at some rate (1Mhas/s which is more or less what I had in the client).But since then (it has been one hour), deepbit tells me that I mining at 0MH/s. I've added my other computers on my pool (as other worker), one of them being more powerful: everything stays at 0MH/s.Does deepbit shows something higher than 0MH/s only when you actually compute a share? Do I have a problem somewhere?(should I try some other website that deepbit?) Maybe I'm missing something but you can save your BTC in _ the vacuum of space.1) Install a client on a spare machine. Generate one bitcoin address and save the wallet.dat file. Put that wallet.dat somewhere safe (for example on a USB stick in a bank). You should of course have multiple safe copy.2) Send any money you want to save to the address. That's it.The day you will need that money, you will of course have to find back one of the copy of the wallet.dat file and run it through a client. All your savings should miraculously appear! The deb package done by tuxsoul for 10.10 still works for me (but with some error that popup during launch) What happens if bitcoin value drops behind 0,01 without any collusion. I mean, it could happen: if people loose interest on it, bitcoin would be worthless. For 1), maybe we can discuss about it in private.For 2), yes, it's exactly what mybitcoin provides. But it would allow people to not have account everywhere. It looks like it coul be very easy for you to implement. I just realized that you can easily use bitmarket.eu as a bitcoin bank. Use the withdrawal form to pay other people and send them money :-)Anyway, very very good looking website, easy to use.Some low hanging fruit that could make bitmarket.eu a big hit:1) Unconditional buy/sell: bitmarket acts as a real money exchanger and give a fixed rate for those who want immediate money/bitcoin. (this is of course a bit risky but risk can be mitigated with some simple rules).2) Bank features: allow users to generate different receiving address with a comment for each of them. And allow them to send money (it's already possible but called withdraw). What kind of hosting do you need? A complete dedicated server? Or only hosting space? Are you asking for an invitation or selling one?
Wanted to try and matched an existing offer. Now, I have to contact the seller to ask him is IBAN account.Question1: how can I trust the vendor that he will accept the transaction once I send the money?Question2: why can't bitmarket acts like a 3rd party. You have to credit your money account/btc account (with IBAN, it will works without fee in the whole EU). That way, transactions would happen immediately without any scam possibility. being a member of the GNOME foundation, I've asked several people what they were thinking about accepting Bitcoin donation.The answer is simple: the people handling the money have limited time. Having to handle a special software (including learning it and regular backup) then convert bitcoin into dollars or euros take time (especially the later). So, they might accept bitcoin if one of the following happens:- It worths the trouble (like receiving 1000BTC/month worths it. Receiving 3BTC/year don't).- It is possible to buy plane tickets with BTC (most of the budget of the GNOME foundation is used to buy plane ticket for hackfest).Quite logical, don't you think? Nanotropy Unfortunatly, it looks like nobody close enough is interested. Relisting it one more day. Hey biddingpond, could you let this offer open for more than a day?If it doesn't work before the end of the week, I will have to sell it for euros. Not really interesting   I recommend watching Inside Job : http://www.sonyclassics.com/insidejob/it's a nice documentary about the 2008 financial crisis.Good side: it explains well how the crisis was unavoidable and why the financial market is defective by design.Bad side: a good part of the movie is more sensationalism, taking a lot of time to underline that people in the financial sector spend their money in drug, whores and expensive yachts. (how they spend their money is, IMHO, completely irrelevant, the interesting question is how they earn that money) Trying my first real life sell with a fridge for bitcoin:http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=337Big problem: finding a potential buyer living close enough to come (sending a fridge via postal service is not an option).Let see if it works ;-) No. I don't have the goal to destroy anything. I only want to have an easy and decentralized way to buy stuffs online. No, we are not all against the system.On a forum where I posted a link to bitcoin.org, somebody explained to someone else that "After reading the forum, he understands that Bitcoin was made to allow drug selling on the internet". No irony there. I know a few people that were interested by the bitcoin stuff and, after visiting this forum, told me that "hey, this is just a project for junkie and anarchist retards that hope to defeat the governement".So, yes, the current forum has already turned away 2 people I know.And when I first read the "Heroin thread", I nearly gave up completely for the whole bitcoin thing.I find this forum definitely not friendly in that regard and I believe that Bitcoin reputation is already suffering because of this. I've an article for you. Please send me an email to ploum at ploum.net Maybe, members of the bitcoin community would accept to buy some stuffs for you in exchange for bitcoin (acting as an intermediary).This would be nice to have a bitcoin-couchsurfing website, where you could ask for your needs (foods, travel, sleeping location) and people could make some offers: (for 10BTC, I take you with my car at this place and bring you to the airport).This would add a lot of value to the bitcoin economy, for sure. According to my understanding of bitcoin and to gavin, you cannot infinitely divide a bitcoin. Thus, the maximum of possible BTC units is 2.1 quadrillion.I'm thus trying to think about what we could do if we want more units. (currently, it's a pure intellectual challenge for the sake of it). Thanks for confirming my understanding.Now, I'm playing devil's advocate here: why would I invest in a money that has a physical limit like this? See the year 2000 bug and the IPv4 story: the problem seems far far far away and, one day, we wake up and the problem is there.Now, one possible solution I foresee would be to run a second bitcoin network. The clients would operate on both networks in a way transparent to the user. If you have 10BTC, you could, in fact, have 8 on the old network and 2 on the new one. The "only" problem would be that BTC addresses would have to differentiate from one network to another. We could imagine adding "@2" at the end of the addresses. An BTC address without "@2" (or with "@1") would be considered as part of the first network, which allows backward compatibility. Is the network vulnerable to an botnet attack? What if a whole botnet network start to accept a false transaction? We all know here that there's a maximum number of bitcoin which is 21 million.The answer to "what if we need more" is : we can always divide bitcoin.Problem: bitcoin cannot be divided infinitely. It means that there's an absolut limit on the possible number of bitcoin. This number might look huge.But remember: 640k was enough memory for anyone.So, if it happens that we reach the maximum possible division of bitcoin, what will happen? Economicaly speaking and technically? What will we do? Thanks to putting a valid bitcoin adress in every article I write in order to advertize bitcoin everywhere, I made some profit. Today, thanks to http://www.youtipit.org/en/tip?junketId=J2656 , I became cyber-rich: I now own more than 10BTC and should change my answer to the poll. I also like that Google Trends :http://www.google.com/trends?q=flattr%2C+bitcoin&ctab=0&geo=all&date=ytd&sort=0 Moi je trouve que c'est une forme de repli et que, en pratique, cela doit souvent s'accompagner d'un repli identitaire.  What do you think of http://www.secondmarket.com/It looks like a way to buy parts in companies that are not on the stock exchange. Kinda like a decentralized independant stock exchange. http://owni.fr/2011/02/11/application-bd-monnaie-alternative-une-solution-cash/J'avoue que l'idée de monnaies locales ne m'enchante guère mais l'article est relativement intéressant. I think a more interesting question would be: how many BTC have you spent so far and how?(For example, my only spending so far was some donation to bitcoinme)
Indeed, hedging would be a great great service for people that would like to accept bitcoins but still cannot spend them. It looks like the vast majority of bitcoin is in the hands of a few tenth of people.I was always replying that Bitcoin might work, that it was not a bubble. When I see this poll, I really doubt. People like me that cannot/don't want to mine have really hard time trying to gain a few BTC from there and there. On the other hand, some have 10.000BTC and keep half of it as an investment.There should be a way to help more newcomer. The faucet is really nice. Maybe it should be increased a bit so it gives more than a symbolic value. People with more than 1000BTC should really consider donating 5% of their wealth to either the faucet or to people that actually sell goods for BTC (they are making the economy).All those actions would actually lower a bit the value of a bitcoin. Which is a sane thing to do in the current situation. It's an investement for the long term. It might help to make the bitcoin economy sustainable (I don't think that it is the case right now). Hey, nice! Thanks for the BTC and the Flatt. This is a so small world ;-)If I publish anything in English in that question format, I will let you know. Are you shipping to Europe? Being a tea fanatic, I would be really interested by buying my tea with BTC :-) If you are interested, here's the reply to "Do I have to protect my content with DRM?"http://ploum.net/post/145-do-i-have-to-protect-my-content-with-drm-the-drm-equationIt's under the CC By license. (so all you have to do is giving me some credit. A link to my blog is always appreciated)My btc address: 1BZTdoUgxRrLoJHKGSmr7wXe7z66TjfrjZ I didn't know that specific one but I know that such service exist. I don't see why it makes my point invalid.1) They provide an email because email is mandatory everywhere (which is what I'm trying to say there)2) They are not useful if you want to use a service in the long term. Say that you want to use Last.fm (or create an account on this forum). Most of the time, you just want to add that service to your existing web identity. Look at me: same avatar, same nickname. Sometimes, you want to hide. Let's take the stereotypical example: I want to register on a gay forum but don't want my girlfriend to know about it. I want to receive mails from that forum. What am I doing then? Creating a new web identity.I think that I should have insisted on the fact that a web identity is *not* linked to any real identity (unless you want it, for example with GPG). You can have 100 web identity, some identity might be bots and you could even share a common web identity with a group of person.This web identity is *already* existing. What you are pointing is a service that provides you with a false identity.What I'm discussing is to organize/add features to that identity. It doesn't change anything. I'm linking to it at the end of my post. I do not pretend I'm inventing anything. I'm just trying to discuss the idea. And yes, web finger might be part of the solution, it looks nice. markm > I do not agree with you because there's no need to link a virtual web identity with one real identity. Your avatar? Put any picture you want. It wouldn't be a problem to have multiple web identity (just like having multiple email address).Everything is already there. For most internet user, given his name and/or his email address, it tooks only a couple of minutes to find his blog, his facebook/twitter account, pictures of him.In the current situation, that web identity is spread around multiple services and that makes you lost control. For most user, they are not even aware how much of their life is public!By making it clear, standardized, it would greatly improve the way we control our web identity. It is also easier to communicate. When you meet a new friend, you now have to ask for email/XMPP/facebook/twitter account and, at each step, wondering if you should add him or not, what he would think if you don't add him, etc. I've asked if there was a way to get my Flattr money on bitcoin-central. That would be awesome :-) No need to bid. I'm selling invites for 0,75BTC. Just send me an email to ploum_at_ploum.net. I will reply you with a BTC address (and confirm you that I still have invitations left).As soon as 0,75 shows up on my Bitcoin, I will send the invite to your mail address.As for reputation, I've been on this forum for some time now, I've a public blog, a public profile. A bit more expensive, I know, but, at least, it is safer :-) Je suis aussi un linuxfrien et j'ai découvert l'article de grondilu dans un commentaire d'une autre news (parlant de Flattr je pense). Je promeus un peu bitcoin : http://ploum.net/tag/bitcoin Hello,I've written a (not short enough) article about the future of a decentralized web identity. This includes some bitcoin bits.I compare bitcoin to GPG as a perfect decentralized solution that needs some way to be linked to our email address. This doesn't mean that bitcoin should not be anonymous anymore. It means that it should be possible to not be anonymous if we want. If you want to gives me some money, you should only have to know my mail address, nothing more. I plan to write another post where I investigate this a bit further.Enjoy the read:http://ploum.net/post/building-your-web-identity It was caused, I think, because I had been using Ubuntu fonts in beta. When released, the name of the TTF changed but was still the old name in my preferences.It was still working everywhere but in bitcoin. Strange. Hello,I've earned some money on Flattr. This means that I now have Flattr Euros. In order to retrieve them, I've to transfer them to my Paypal or my Moneybookers account. Problem: I don't have any of them.Because this money is already virtual, I would like to get this money as Bitcoins. I've asked it there:http://forum.flattr.net/showthread.php?tid=662What would be the cheapest way to convert my Flattr  in Bitcoins? How would you do that?There was already a thread about funding you Flattr account with Bitcoins but the current problem is the opposite:http://forum.flattr.net/showthread.php?tid=550 Hello,This week-end, the FOSDEM will take place in Brussels. This is the biggest european open-source meeting (more than 5000 developers are expected). http://fosdem.org/2011/Will there be any bitcoin fanatics there? Anyone want to hold a bitcoin discussion in some room?It would be a good idea to propose a talk about bitcoin next year. Faudrait que je mette sur la page de Getting Things GNOME! qu'on accepte aussi les bitcoins. Bonne idée ça :-) La génération sur CPU est donc définitivement morte ?Le problème de la génération sur GPU c'est qu'elle n'est, si je ne me trompe pas, que possible sous Windows. Non ? It already exists and it's free. It's called Facebook. exactly my opinion. I also think that there should be more risk on the buyer side. The one year is not really incentive as, well, I might have enough money to wait for it. Also, the seller might have a proof : the delivery receipt. When you receive a delivery, you have to open it in front of the deliverer. Else, it is assumed that the content of the box is what is written on it.Anyway, thanks Gavin. I was thinking about doing such a service myself but I hadn't the time to do it yet. Now, I don't need it anymore ;-) De mon côté, je pense offrir des services payables en bitcoin. Par exemple, sur Fritalk.com, j'offre le service adresse mail IMAP 2Go + adresse XMPP correspondante + blog correspondant. Actuellement, je facture au cas par cas mais j'ai en projet de permettre le paiement par bitcoin (mais faut que je trouve le temps de programmer la routine qui fait tout ça)
Just one question : what's your business model ? As I understand it, you are currently spending dollars and receiving bitcoins. How would you make the reverse operation ? What about putting a page to get bitcoin behind an OpenID login page ?I mean, we are all about decentralization and I think that OpenID is way more interesting than a Google account. It is also impossible for you to steal anything as all you will have would be a nickname.PS: I have 2 Google accounts but only one OpenID, just to ensure I'm no trying to convince you in order to cheat the system. Can't agree more. I didn't know project wonderful. Seems interesting. But does advertizing really worth it ?  I mean : advertizing is now being everywhere all the time. Do you really believe that some ads on some website will have an impact that worth the money spent for that ? Hello,If I fully understand the need for anonymous transaction, there's *a lot* of cases when you do want to be authentified and to send a message with your transaction. With bitcoin, I imagine a system like the following:There's also a need for a bank account ID that you can easily remember.Let's say that my bitcoin bank is  ploum.net. My id could be ploum.net/ploumIf my friend "Joe" (which has an account on bitcoin.com)  want to pay me 5BTC for a party, in his banking software, he just put :Receiver : http://ploum.net/ploumAmount : 5Message : thanks for the party buddyWhat will happen then is the following :Bitcoin.com                                               http://ploum.net/ploum-------------                                               -----------New transactionFrom Joe Pal ( http://bitcoin.com/joe )Message : Thanks for the party buddy                                                       -------->                                                                Replying with new bitcoin adress                                                                15SCCTDK9xcZyKFWXsPRXYS9s1m3Mikcxs                                                     <---------Using the bitcoin adress to pay 5BTC                                                    This makes it at least as useful as the current banking system. Even more because account number are now a simple URL.Advantages:-------------+ Easy to use, easy to give your account ID to someone.+ Hide completely the ugly bitcoin adress from end user sight.+ Allow to transmit message+ Could also be used anonymously (for example, by going with a web browser to http://ploum.net/ploum, you can receive a bitcoin adress that you can use manually)+ Decentralized. Anyone with a http server can implement his own bitcoin bank compatible with the system.Disadvantages:----------------- No real authentification (anybody can fake Joe Pal and pay for him. But does it make sense to forbid that ?)- Someone using the bitcoin adress manually could use it multiple times and you will always see the same message. But the client might display only the total received by a bitcoin adress, not each transaction.Question :-----------Is there already discussions about doing that ? Is there any standardization on the communication between ploum.net and bitcoin.com ?Did I missed something ?  It's perhaps just me but I thought that everybody knew that. It seems trivial that what Bitcoin need is a way to convert bitcoin to euros and back. I realize now that, indeed, I've never saw a discussion about that on this forum.As far as I understand, MtGox is currently only making the link between bitcoin buyer and bitcoin seller. In order to become the BitPal, MtGox would have to :- establish a fixed rate for everybody- establish a stock of both BTC and . (it means taking a lot more risks)If MtGox would allow to pay directly for BTC and retrieve them, without any hassle and with a simple VISA card, that would be awesome.A lot more website would also accept BTC if they knew that they could easily convert BTC for good old euro on their VISA account in a few clicks. Just posted my answer and suggestion on the Flattr forum :http://forum.flattr.net/showthread.php?tid=550&pid=3495#pid3495Brucewagner > If I understand you well, all you want is a Flattr that you could pay with btc. It involves developing the whole software, it's not trivial IMHO. I'm exactly in the same situation here in Europe. I think that, if I had bitcoin, selling them would be straigthforward as long as I send an invoice to the customer (and that I apply the taxes on the price). In fact, the only thing stopping me to do that currently is the fact that I don't have many bitcoins so far :-) Buying bitcoin, on the other hand, is less straightforward. I was thinking asking my accountant about "refunding an unused service". (which is technically what it would be if I consider bitcoin as a "unit of service" for my business). The drawbacks are : I would probably not be able to refund more than what the customer bought from me and I'm not sure I could refund less by bitcoin than what I would sell them. (which is mandatory for a sustainable exchange business) If you buy pancakes and that they can be used in other unrelated places to "buy" goods or services, then those pancakes are money.The difference is that, at least, you can eat your pancake. With Euro, dollars or bitcoins, you can't. Hello,Is there a way to connect to the bitcoin network when you are in a network with only port 80 open.I have a server in the open world, so I thought that maybe I could set up an apache config that would redirect some calls to bitcoin.myserver.com:80 to something else.Or maybe any other solution ? Ben moi, j'ai tenté la génération sur mon vieux PC, mais ça va pas être possible (400khash/s). Vous louez des serveurs rien que pour ça ou quoi ?Sinon, en europe, on pourrait se les payer uniquement par simple virement banquaire, non ?  Ça reviendrait beaucoup moins cher.Question, quelle est votre motivation pour acheter des bitcoins ? Jeux boursiers ou autres ? I'm also wondering if this affects Flattr (which is EU based) It is if you are trading bitcoin for money.  The whole market of bitcoin is not affected by the definition but the real money/bitcoin interface will. As a consequence, bitcoin *is* electronic money as long as someone is willing to buy it for real money.They were quite clever in the definition. It's commodity only if the "issuer" accept it against goods or services. Meaning that pre-payed accound and stuffs like that are not affected.Not a big problem : how will they proove that you generated bitcoin ? Also, if I understood correctly, this would not be a problem anymore as soon as all bitcoin are generated, isn't it ?What are the other consequences of such a law ? For example, what does it imply for MtGox if they were in EU ? Your distinction between child porn and drug selling is based on your own moral. (and I personally agree with it). But it is not the distinction done by the laws. (both of them are crimes and punished by prison)You say that a lot of people are libertarian (I'm myself somewhat libertarian but I don't think it does matter). That doesn't mean that all of them are nor that bitcoin is a libertarian tool. It could be used by libertarian. So what ? Was it the intended goal at the beginning ?  It's just like saying Linux is anti-Windows. Linux is used by anti-microsoft people but it doesn't mean that it's the goal (and annoying anti-windows people are quickly banned from Linux forum, even if they don't say anything bad regarding the law. In your case, it's worse).Trust me : never try two revolutions at the same time, never mix revolutions. Either you choose bitcoin, either you choose libertarianism, but mixing both at the same time is a recipe for failure. Just like communist people in a free software community. So, I believe that bitcoin forum's moderator should choose :1) Bitcoin is an economic/software experiment only. Discussing related politcs is of course good thing but everything should respect the law : no money laundering, no drug, no child porn. Remember : it's the image you give to any external viewer seeking information about bitcoin !  Do you thing that average Joe would trust a bunch of anarchist Junkies to do anything related with their money ?2) Bitcoin is a libertarian/anarchist project. Your message then makes sense. The image you give also makes sense. But then, it should be advertized from the start so innocent people like me will know what to expect and assume that they are putting their foot in some trouble waters Still unable to login.I also discovered http://www.biddingpond.com  which, for no apparent reason, is not listed in the bitcoin trade page.Don't you think that bitswap and biddingpond are nearly the same ? Sending heroin to random people ?This is insane. If you are caught, you will end up with spending the rest of your life in prison (just imagine that some kids find your package).I've always said that drugs kill your brain. It seems I'm mostly right in your case. The fact that you seem proud of it says it all.As a side note, being brand new on this forum, I'm kind of uncomfortable with topics discussing how to use bitcoins to bypass the law. The fact that the law is good or not is debatable but completely unrelated with bitcoin. I really think that, in order to build a good image, bitcoin should not allow public discussing on "how to bypass the law with bitcoin". This is public relation. Just imagine a journalist that hear about Bitcoin and, the first thing it finds is people talking about setting a drug store or laundering money.This is not about morality. We all have different morality so we have to stick on one common ground. I propose to use laws as this common ground (which are, in this area, essentially the same in most countries).For example, I believe that talking about porn is fine because it is legit. What if someone talked here about setting up a child porn website ? Well, I created an account but I cannot login. I want to offer a fridge that I have and that I don't use for bitcoins. I will not be as critical as SOH. It could be a bit better (with some pictures) but what I'm essentially missing is a list of all offers and a list of the last 10 offers. oui, merci pour ta dépêche :-)J'ai découvert ça dans un commentaire sur la dépêche sur Flattr et le principe m'a interpellé. Et puis, le temps de réfléchir un peu et je m'emballe et me passionne :-) Un petit message en français.Je viens d'écrire un article de présentation des bitcoins :http://ploum.net/post/Monnaie-de-geek,-monnaie-de-singeL'article (sans les images) est sous licence CC By.
