Somebody has been impersonating me from Nov 7 to Nov 10.Of course I have changed my password and deleted the (about 30) fake posts. The fake posts were mostly inoffensive with some promotion for scamcoins, which is consistent with a paid spammer.I am posting this to leave a record that may be useful if this happens again.I don't post frequently and never advertise scamcoins, so if you see that kind of posts it wasn't me. Please IM me if this happens again and also send email (I am easy to find online). In fact, I foresee considerable opposition to implement sidechain hooks in Bitcoin Core. But sidechains can add so much value to Bitcoin that the change is likely to be implemented. If not, Bitcoin might soon become obsolete and give way to an equivalent network that implements extensibility via sidechains.I wonder what happens when the regulators realize that sidechains can put privacy and anonymity back ;-) But isn't innovation outside core exactly what sidechains are for? BITCOIN A stupid rich person can do everything - he just has to pay a smart person to do it. I am thinking of something like this:- Users can buy micro-shares of public companies. For example a user can buy 1/100 of a FB share (currently trading at $93) for $0.93, and pay in bitcoin.- The money is used to buy real shares. In the example, as soon as there are enough buyers for one FB share, the operator buys one FB share and the user receives 1/100 ownership.- Users can trade micro-shares.- Users can sell micro-shares to cash out. For example if 100 users want to sell 1/100 FB each, the operators sells a real share and pays the users.Does something like that (or similar) exist? Good article! There are discussions on adopting Bitcoin as one of the official Liberland currencies on the Liberland Forums at liberland.org.The realist in me thinks the project doesn't have a chance because the powers that be will crush it in no time as soon as they notice, but the optimist in me keeps hoping. If Liberland survives, it could make a big impact. In particular, supporting Bitcoin would be a win-win alliance. Bitcointalk username: giulioWhat I would use the card for: spending bitcoin everywhere, ATMsEntry Number ([previous entry number]+1): 7 I did an end-to-end coinb.in test.1 - I created and funded two wallets A and B2 - From A I created a 2-2 multisig address with the public keys of A and B.Address:3LvaMMABYXamGkH1DQbLfB4pYp8pU3of7TI saved the redeem script.3 - From B, I sent money to 3LvaMMABYXamGkH1DQbLfB4pYp8pU3of7TTransaction:https://btc.blockr.io/tx/info/230f6e6c3d8bca2686cdfaeda7b24f1f08d657f82cdb82a687a89834e84be52c4.

In general I thing coinb.in is great but perhaps too difficult for today's casual users - those who need click and simple one-click solution and are unable to open a new window or copy/paste. However, I am sure that it's easy to adapt the user the interface to specific use cases, hiding complex features and selecting the needed data (e.g. key and transaction to sign) automatically. Awesome indeed.  Thanks gmaxwell.Re 2- is there a hosted wallet with a simple UI to retrieve a public key and sign a multisig transaction? 1. Why the f# didn't they add the option to use also bitcoin addresses (instead of only public keys) to create multisig addresses? I am sure there must be a strong reason but I don't see it at the moment. Many users don't know their public keys immediately, and some (e.g. Circle etc.) don't know them at all.2. When a multisig transactions has been partly signed, how can the other allowed signatories be notified? (besides emailing them). It wasn't that, it was a blocked popup. I enabled popups and everything worked. I deposited $5 in bitcoin to my (previously unused) Neteller account. Then I could verify the account to raise daily limits (I had to send an id document scan to do that) and now I have all options, including the virtual credit card (free) or the plastic credit card (one time fee of $12). I think I will get the card to offer myself the experience of withdrawing cash-from-bitcoin and paying with bitcoin at the mall. Received from Neteller: Deleting Cookies and Internet History should fix the issue that you might be experiencing.  Sent to Neteller support: Hi, I just opened a Neteller account. The Bitcoin deposit feature doesn't seem to work - the system says "Selecting "Confirm" will launch the third-party processor and allow you to complete this transaction," but nothing happens when I click Confirm. I created a new Neteller account from Hungary and the bitcoin deposit option is there. But it doesn't seem to work at the moment, perhaps it isn't fully implemented yet. I am thinking again about this idea, which seems more and more appealing and useful.In this scheme the rest of the world acts like a sidechain - x BTC are moven from the main blockchain to the sidechain, traded (as a whole) on the sidechain, then eventually brought back to the main blockchain.Of course it's impossible to trace the movements of the x BTC on the sidechain.TTBit did you implement the scheme that you described? Just found out about Augur, very very cool. I started some threads on this forum to inquire about Bitcoin prediction market development projects, but didn't find anything really wow. This is the most promising project that I have seen so far. Impressive! A potential game changer. What publicly traded companies (NYSE, NASDAQ, OTC) are developing Bitcoin technology or applications? I know of Overstock, Bitcoin Shop and the Winklevoss ETF, but perhaps there other options for traditional investors that want to invest in the Next Big Things.
To clarify, I meant options to buy real stocks like Microsoft or IBM with Bitcoin.Or alternatively a stock simulation game where you can buy and sell in-game stock-equivalents at reduced prices, for example 1% of the real price. If something like that doesn't exist it would be a cool idea to implement. Of course it would need a sync method, for example buy/sell prices synced daily to 1% of the real stock market. What are the options to invest in the real stock market with Bitcoin? For example, funds where you can buy in with Bitcoin or Bitcoin stock simulation games. Some research and links here: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/micronation-adopts-bitcoin-official-currency/ In English: http://www.fortesaojose.org/ http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principado_da_Pontinha If the story is true, if Pontinha is really recognized as a sovereign nation, and if this guy can be talked into adopting Bitcoin as an official currency in Pontinha (not necessarily the only one), this could be huge. Anyone doing research and talking to the guy? For something that big it would be easy to find the money to build the minimal infrastructure for a nation. Thanks to all participants in this interesting discussion. I have written a wrap-up article, comments welcome: Post-Mining Bitcoin Â– Collapse or Sustainable Growth? https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/post-mining-bitcoin-collapse-sustainable-growth/ By the way, the Disney event chronicled in the article took place 2 months ago. Not only the Gawker writer utters BS, but old BS:https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-wedding-marriage-on-the-blockchain/ Gawker and all their magazines have a PC-liberal political agenda, and Bitcoin doesn't fit. The first comment summarizes their attitude: "It's all just some kind of masturbatory fantasy that only a techno-libertarian moron could love." Well, that makes it easy to blackmail others and grab their money. Say good-bye to the 100 BTC that were sent to you yesterday, or send 50 BTC to me first.Yes, that's the question I am asking. How could we adjust the incentives if it turns out that they are not properly balanced? Good point, and thanks for posting the quote from Satoshi in 2010. Yet I am still concerned about "enough mining to maintain the security of the system." If mining is only done by a handful of very large operators, what prevents them from pooling resources and launch 51% attacks to disrupt the network and grab others' money? Please don't answer "government regulation" - we can't eat the cake and still have it.I would be interested in hearing new ideas about how to make the mining system just a tiny bit more public, open and sustainable. Of course Satoshi's wisdom is legendary, but I guess he is just a person like us. Smarter, but he still puts his pants on one leg at a time. You and I are part of the core community, but how much % of the total number of users does the core community represent? 0.1 % or less I guess, perhaps much less. We could never maintain the Bitcoin network without the unwashed masses that are in strictly for the money. Those are incentive to USE Bitcoin, not to MINE Bitcoin. You can still benefit from all that if you only do off-chain transactions with Circle or something like that. So basically you guys are saying that those with enough money to open an ASIC farm, and those who live in places with very low electricity costs, will be able to make money mining. OK, but doesn't that confirm my point that mining is a useless waste of time and effort for the rest of us?I am persuaded that the rise of Bitcoin was mostly due to a large network of smalltime users running the full Bitcoin software and generating coins, and I am afraid that there is no incentive anymore.As far as the other argument is concerned - that once the Bitcoin economy is huge there will be enough of an incentive to maintain the network even if the transactions fee remain low - I think that's plausible, but we must get there first, and how do we get there if the system collapses for lack of individual maintainers? OK but doesn't that mean that mining is out of reach of the normal folks? I mean, I don't mine because the little (if any) profit that can be made mining today isn't worth the time and effort, and I guess most Bitcoin users would agree.I pay money to run a full Bitcoin node on a server to contribute to keeping the blockchain working and public, but how many people do that? We as a society have a very poor record when it comes to maintaining the commons, Bitcoin would never have taken off without monetary incentives. Who will maintain the post-mining Bitcoin network and why?It is often said that, once all bitcoins have been mined, the miners who maintain the Bitcoin network will be compensated with transaction fees. But that will kill one of the main competitive advantages of Bitcoin, which is very low transaction fees.OK the day when all bitcoins have been mined won't come for decades. But in a certain sense we are already in the post-mining phase, because mining is no longer profitable enough for most individual users. So I think we are beginning to have this problem now - no miners = no Bitcoin, mining not profitable = no miners.Of course a new altcoin can be created to make mining (of the new altcoin) profitable again and thus provide incentives to new miners, but the new miners would be maintaining the new blockchain, not the Bitcoin blockchain.Any new thoughts and perspectives on these related issue? I guess you are kidding ;-)There will be other Silk Roads soon, and soon after there will be decentralized markets without a single point failure that can be taken down.When people want to buy something, there are sellers. Which paragraph? Shouldn't CryptoGraffiti be implemented as a sidechain, with the option to make as many changes to Bitcoin Core as the application needs? I started a related thread here. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=838813.0 I have been thinking that one of the first killer sidechains could be one to store and show text, html and images (web on a sidechain). Bitcoin micropayments could be used to keep spammers out and reward the readers who maintain the chain (writers pay, just like you pay for web hosting). Thoughts and/or implementation ideas?
I am wondering what the first applications of sidechains will be.What I am thinking now is that with just one change from Bitcoin core (message length increased to some much higher but reasonable value) a sidechain could act like a distributed alternative for a mailing list, subreddit, or website comment system (or maybe the website itself). A required micropayment in BTC would keep spammers out. Good to see you here too David. So this is a board game? No computers? No Internet? Or (I guess) you are talking of an electronic version of Small World? I am lost, please explain. URLs?Or, Bitcoin killed by lawyers and mind uploading killed by banksters. It's all the same thing:The Banker and the BureaucratWere walking close at hand;They wept like anything to seeSuch quantities of land:If this were only cleared away,Â’They said, it would be grand!Â’If seven maids with seven mopsSwept it for half a year,Do you suppose,Â’ the Banker said,That they could get it clear?Â’I doubt it,Â’ said the Bureaucrat,And shed a bitter tear.O Sheeple, come and walk with us!Â’The Banker did beseech.A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,Along the land so rich:We cannot do with more than four,To give a hand to each.Â’The time has come,Â’ the Banker said,To talk of many things:Of shoes Â– and ships Â– and sealing-wax Â–Of cabbages Â– and kings Â–And why the sea is boiling hot Â–And whether Sheeple stink.Â’A loaf of bread,Â’ the Banker said,Is what we chiefly need:Pepper and vinegar besidesAre very good indeed Â–Now if youÂ’re ready, Sheeple dear,We can begin to feed.Â’But not on us!Â’ the Sheeple cried,Turning a little blue.After such kindness, that would beA dismal thing to do!Â’The night is fine,Â’ the Banker said.Do you admire the view?It was so kind of you to come!And you are very nice!Â’The Bureaucrat said nothing butCut us another slice:I wish you were not quite so deaf Â—IÂ’ve had to ask you twice!Â’It seems a shame,Â’ the Banker said,To play them such a trick,After weÂ’ve brought them out so far,And made them trot so quick!Â’The Bureaucrat said nothing butThe butterÂ’s spread too thick!Â’I weep for you,Â’ the Banker said:I deeply sympathize.Â’With sobs and tears he sorted outThose of the largest size,Holding his pocket-handkerchiefBefore his streaming eyes.O Sheeple,Â’ said the Bureaucrat,YouÂ’ve had a pleasant run!Shall we be trotting home again?Â’But answer came there none Â—And this was scarcely odd, becauseTheyÂ’d eaten every one.Â” Ah OK thanks, I missed that. "Virtual World" was misleading, I imagined fully immersive VR with Oculus Rift display interface, super high resolution, videorealism, hyper-realistic physics... ;-) But isn't massive parallel computing precisely what the Bitcoin network as a whole does? Why parallelize locally? FYC. Do you guys think this is a good and implementable idea?https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-governance-2-0-lets-block-chain/ I am afraid Foxpup is right. There are demonstrations that quantum entanglement can't be used to send messages faster than light (no "Bell's telephone"). The details of the demonstrations are complicated, but the core point is simple: entanglement only "works" if you leave quantum randomness alone, and you can't send a signal with random noise. Of course, but perhaps we can replace old pointers to transactions in the blockchain with new pointers.For example, I write a graffiti "I Love Lucy." Then I stop loving Lucy and start loving Linda. I make a new graffiti "I Love Linda" and replace the old "I Love..." graffiti with the new one (in CryptoGraffiti, not the blockchain). Very cool! Is this a Twitter on the blockchain? Are there possible ways to permit editing messages already sent?  No, it's a question, sorry I didn't make it clear. Is anyone building it? So who is building BitDAQ and BYSE, or something like that, a full equivalent of the global stock market on the blockchain? Note that the cheapest PieLayer configuration doesn't have enough disk space for the blockchain, you need the 45GB configuration ($7 per month) Thanks for confirming Newar. I got the same configuration and installed a Bitcoin node. It has almost finished to download the blockchain: http://blaxxky.com/bitcoin_node_info.php Newar, do you confirm that this is good for running a Bitcoin node and do Bitcoin related development work? Which location did you choose and which OS? Does anyone have experience with the low end 20$/year iniz servers for running a Bitcoin node and do Bitcoin related development?https://iniz.com/ OK thanks, you guys persuaded me that (at thie moment) Counterparty is not suitable for online poker, and I guess the same arguments apply to all realtime casino games. Then the question is whether new developments could make it so. Thanks Matt Y. Is Counterparty suitable in-principle for realtime gaming e.g. online poker?I joined the Counterparty forums and asked this question there as well. Thanks, I will take a look. What I understand from a quick browsing of the Chancecoin thread, it is NOT based on Counterparty, but similar features could be implemented. Thanks! This was my impression after first reading, but it's good to see it confirmed.Does Counterparty solve the trust problem for betting and gaming (the fear that the operator may take the money and go)?Is it suitable in-principle for realtime gaming e.g. online poker? But it isn't."The primary goal of Counterparty is to enable entrepreneurs, developers, artists and more to build a new, productive economy: doing things that have never been done before, made possible by the amazing technology behind Bitcoin. We want to unlock the potential of Â“Bitcoin 2.0â€³ for thousands of people, who will then create profitable businesses, as well use the technology to further the social good."Sounds like fluff with little content, could mean anything.The only usable info that I find on that page is:"Counterparty provides open, secure financial tools and markets that do not require a trusted third party or middleman to use."This is very encouraging but still a bit vague.I will join their Forum as you suggest So when can the option to change avatar be restored? I am bored with mine, had it for a long time.
I am trying to understand Counterparty but I guess I am too lazy and wish to save a few hours of hard intellectual work ;-) Can somebody think of a clear and concise single paragraph? What is Counterparty, why it is part of Bitcoin 2.0, what is its unique selling point, and what applications it's uniquely suitable for.Thanks! Bitpay helps businesses to accept Bitcoin, but it doesn't help consumers to spend Bitcoin at retailers or service providers that don't accept Bitcoin yet (the vast majority). I think more gateways like Gyft are needed to make Bitcoin really useful to the average consumer.In the US there are options - If I were in the US I could live in Bitcoin, using BTC via Gyft at Sears, Whole Foods, Home Depot etc. But only in the US atm. 4 mesi More options and easier ways to pay in Bitcoin, open to consumers worldwide. For example gyft.com is a cool and easy way to use Bitcoin at Sears, Whole Foods and many other chains, but unfortunately it's only available in the US. I think this is what Bitcoin needs for real mass adoption. Sounds super cool but Reddit is centralized, how can it become a decentralized media platform? I think this project could fly, but it should be based on a decentralized platform (something like Maidsafe etc.). Io sono su Circle da alcuni giorni, ma quando cerco di comprare BTC dice che "U.S.-based bank account or credit card required." Ho scritto e hanno risposto che ci stanno lavorando ma non possono dire quando potranno accettare banche e carte di credito internazionali. Come avete fatto per aggirare l' ostacolo?A parte questo Circle mi sembra fatto molto bene con un' interfaccia super semplice, puo' avere molto sucecsso. I see that the GeekCipher website hasn't been very active recently...I am afraid 5$ isn't enough for a good, well researched and well written article. Hal Finney The Economist - Harold Finney, futurist and cypherpunk, died on August 28th, aged 58http://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21615469-harold-finney-futurist-and-cypherpunk-died-august-28th-aged-58-hal-finney Not really, they are in the realm of near-future science fiction. See http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9249721/Money_talks_and_that_s_all_quantum_maker_D_Wave_has_to_say I am not sure this is a plus. If the value of Bitcoin keeps going up, almost by-design and de-facto, then everyone holds and nobody uses Bitcoin to buy things. Then Bitcoin is only a means of speculation and not a currency, and I am not sure that is a huge success. I think the biggest problem in cryptocurrencies is the fact that the vast majority of users still see them means of speculation (buy - hold - sell) rather than currencies (earn - spend).  Very interesting. A bit too expensive in my opinion, so I won't apply for one. However, I think a Bitcoin debit card is a killer app, because it permits spending your Bitcoins easily at the pub, McDonalds or the grocery store down the street, and that's what Bitcoin needs to go mainstream. I am sure after Xapo there will be other, cheaper Bitcoin debit cards. The path between socialism and libertarianism, or at least the path between good socialism and good libertarianism, is not as long and weird as one may think.I am a libertarian at heart, yet I often support policies that one may categorize as "socialist," like BIG (Basic Income Guarantee). I support these policies not despite of, but rather because of my libertarian ideas: I value self-ownership, autonomy, and personal freedom for everyone, and I think personal freedom must include the freedom to eat and have a modest but decent quality of life. I am against both Big Capital and Big Government, and I think Bitcoin can be a powerful weapon against both. Exactly. Bitcoin could be a powerful social equalizer and give to the poor the same financial freedom that the rich always enjoyed. See http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/prisco20140527 I voted "positive" (for the Bitcoin economy at large) because government regulation is part of becoming mainstream. However, government regulation is negative for those who don't like to be monitored by the government. As Bitcoin becomes regulated and mainstream, I think it's important to preserve its underground aspects. I guess it could happen in a parallel world, but it never happened in our world (besides primal societies of a few tens of people).  No country will ever "adopt Bitcoin," A country is a government, and all governments are ultimately control freaks. At best some countries may be forced to tolerate Bitcoin semi-officially. Also, some countries may experiment with centralized and regulated forms of e-money (this is happening now). Why? What's the best place to set up a Bitcoin poker/gambling operator?Of course the "best place" should offer a good/optimal balance of different criteria such as low regulation and good Internet infrastructure.
Silk Poker is based on the Cubeia Social poker network, see this Forum thread where they were looking for beta operators, Silk poker is the first beta operator:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=585931.0http://www.cubeia.com/http://www.cubeiasocial.com/ I like the name! Bitcoiners should be proud of their image of bad boys. Do we want to disrupt the establishment or not? ;-)I will try Silk Poker to see how it works. I haven't seen Silk Poker mentioned here so far.https://silkpoker.com/Din anyone try it and what do you think? Is there any BTC online poker with these features?- Open backend software that anyone can inspect online.- Random numbers from a hardware-based entropy generator (real random numbers, not pseudo-random) with sufficient evidence of no tampering by the operator (ideally the random stream should be provided by a trusted third party like a top university, NIST or something like that).- No BTC is ever held by the operator, all transactions are player to player.- Reasonably low rake of the order of 1%.- Modern and very easy user interface. It's obvious that states put more and more regulations, restrictions and controls on online exchanges. This can only get worse.The best is to buy/sell Bitcoins with cash.People who want to exchange millions of dollars can meet in Nauru or similar places and transact cash-in-hand, like they do for other things.The problem is for the little people (as usual). When Bitcoin will be more common it will be easy to exchange it in the street with strangers (like today in NYC we buy and sell cigarettes in the street at one buck per cigarette). Until that point, buy/sell Bitcoin will be a bottleneck. In a blockchain-based polling/voting system, what is the best way to ensure that nobody votes more than once, and what is the best way to keep votes secret (if that's a requirement)? The info available in the blockchain should be 1) who voted and 2) how many votes for each option. Charlie Stross is wrong, Bitcoin is a social equalizerhttp://skefia.com/2014/05/27/charlie-stross-is-wrong-bitcoin-is-a-social-equalizer/ Mike, I am sure you must have answered this question hundreds of times already, but why a new coin? Couldn't PHC's objectives be achieved by just promoting plain old Bitcoin among freelancers in the Philippines and those who employ them? What are the shortcomings of Bitcoin & alts for this application? Does the launch of PHCoin have something to do with state support? Very interesting. I started a similar thread some time ago (see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=139227.0 ) and I am giving some thought to implementation strategies. I will read the whitepaper with great interest. Interesting. I think the cryptocurrency ecosystem will include all niches, from mainstream/regulated (e.g. Circle) to underground/unregulated. Dark Coin may go for a niche closer to the latter. Count me in that half. Until Bitcoin really takes off, cash is the _only_ form of currency that I trust. He has a knack for explaining Bitcoin simply, also his NYT article of a few months ago was very good. Thanks. But I guess there must be tools that convert high level Turing-complete languages to low-level BTCscript code. Right?One of the main selling point of Ethereum, as I understand, is that their Turing-complete programmable system permits writing complex contracts.  Can somebody explain to me why the Bitcoin scripting system is purposefully not Turing-complete? To make malicious programs difficult to develop (I guess)? Or because it was difficult to make it Turing-complete? Bitcoin uses a scripting system for transactions. Forth-like, Script is simple, stack-based, and processed from left to right. It is purposefully not Turing-complete, with no loops. (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) In my opinion the main point is that, regardless of what you think of Circle, you are not forced to use it, let alone use it all the time.Those who have secret off-shore accounts with lots of money have also a local bank account and use it like everyone else. Note that not having a local bank account would attract attention. They keep a little money in their local bank account, and use it for daily expenses.I think this is a good metaphor for Circle. I prefer a world where bad things can happen occasionally, to a world where everyone is watched by Big Brother all the time. What Hunyadi said. Centralizing Bitcoin is one thing, developing a centralized Bitcoin service (one of many) is another thing. If you don't like Circle, don't use it and continue to use Bitcoin as you do now. This is for the unwashed. Why?Circle looks interesting so far. Take a look at this intro video:https://dotsub.com/view/472e43ab-0c1c-48a4-8f38-3780e18fcff5Things like Circle can only make Bitcoin more popular and take it mainstream. But even when Bitcoin is mainstream, there will always be ways for hackers and crypto-anarchists to use Bitcoin anonymously and untraceably.So everyone wins. Cash is still the simplest means to exchange money anonymously and securely without Big Brother watching.
Did anyone here test buying something in Bitcoin to see how it works? This is awesome but I don't understand the link to cryptocurrencies. Why do you think that cognitive radio and WSD's will boost the use of Crypto-currencies? Is Ethereum the answer? I think BTC won't be "replaced" by other cryptocurrencies anytime soon, but co-exist with a growing number of alternative cryptocurrencies.There is a chance that BTC will become more and more regulated and mainstreamized - for example, someday most merchants may accept BTC, but only with proof of identity and record keeping. If so, new systems more anonymous, less traceable, will gain traction. Then these new systems may become more and more regulated and mainstreamized in turn, other players will come in, and so forth.Question: what are the most interesting alternatives to BTC at this moment? Listen to me, call her something else, and put some Bitcoins aside for her to use when she grows up. Not (necessarily) for the price of Bitcoin, but certainly for the consumer acceptance and utility of Bitcoin. I am persuaded that as long as Bitcoin is only used for speculation it will never amount to much. But if a real Bitcoin economy takes off, with consumers everywhere buying and selling things, and if more and more people become able to "live in Bitcoin" (that is, earning BTC and spending BTC for all basic needs including food, clothes, housing, education, entertainment...), then Bitcoin will start really changing the world and making it a better place. Nothing is "absolutely 100% risk/abuse free" - this as a generally applicable principle like the 2nd law of thermodynamics. What we can do, is to make things _more_ risk/abuse free, watertight, and reliable for practical use, but there will be always be holes. WOW great, please say more! I am persuaded that the Bitcoin economy will really take off when everyone, everywhere, will be able to use BTC directly for small transactions like buying a coffee or food, without having to change to traditional currency first (which can be controlled and killed by the state). Yes, if you like, dollars colored with a value in Bitcoin. Any ideas on how to solve the trust problem? A crazy idea that I just had (but perhaps it's not crazy and/or not new):Banknotes (say, one dollar bills) could be given a value in BTC and used to pay in BTC. Anti-counterfeiting is already implemented, courtesy of the state.Take one dollar, choose a value of X BTC, send X BTC to an operator with the serial number of the banknote. The serial number goes to a database, and the operator will pay X BTC to the bearer of the dollar bill with that serial number.Developing validation smartphone apps is easy.Of course the problem is that the operator may take the money and go, or refuse to pay.Anybody can think of a solution, perhaps involving a distributed database and a "distributed operator"? Can the Bitcoin network itself function as distributed operator? Very cool Predictious! I am taking a first look at your website, looks very good. If you manage to attract a critical mass of users, I am sure Predictious will go places. The horrible user interface of FX is a badge of honors, it shows that it is a very old website! I know the people who created it, some years ago it had a good community of frequent users, but it seems dead recently. Perhaps this is a good time to revive it.The code is open source, so it is reasonably easy to add a modern user interface, Bitcoin as game currency (better to use an external wallet instead of a built-in wallet I guess, this should give more confidence to users), and a trustable play/payment system. Google news search and Google blog search. Also Twitter search, and of course this forum. How to Order a Pizza With Bitcoinshttp://mashable.com/2013/02/06/pizza-bitcoins/The site is the brainchild of Matt Burkinshaw and Riley Alexander, who state in the "about us" section that they did it "to further expand the usability of bitcoins on the open market." The advantage is that you can use your BTC without having to change them. This is an incentive for normal people to accept BTC for little exchanges.10$ for a McDonald and a couple of beers is not much, but 10$ a day for a month is 300$ and 10$ a day for a year is 3600$. So you can make a few extra thousands $ a year with side activities, without regulatory hassles and tax free. Food and beer, over the counter and delivered at home. This will set the Bitcoin economy free by allowing consumers to use their BTC without going through exchanges that can always be killed by regulators.BTW this seems a killer business idea in a large city like New York or London, is there anyone doing that already? I think the greatest contributing factor will be the ability to pay for a McDonald and a beer in BTC. Why? Because all means to exchange BTC with cash (exchanges, Bitinstant card...) will always be subject to more and more government control, and governments have all the cards and all the guns. A real, strong, parallel black economy in BTC will be unstoppable and uncontrollable. Last year I sold BTC to a scammer who charged back:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=28439.0But I kept a record with screenshots of our exchange on this public Forum. Though the scammer changed his handle several times and did all the other things that you can imagine, at the end Paypal gave reason to me and I kept the cash. It was quite tiring and time consuming though, and as a result I will never sell BTC over Paypal again. Western Union cash seems a good option, and face to face even better. Thanks Ukigo. I assume that by "trustless" you mean that buyers and sellers don't have to trust each other.This can be solved by automatic transactions: you offer to buy "X becomes US president in 2016" at 1BTC and as soon as there is a matching sell order the transaction takes place automatically and the money (minus a house commission of 1% or less) goes from your wallet to the seller's wallet.Of course users still have to trust the operator. I don't see an evident solution to that besides building a good reputation. Not even on the event outcome, because you can buy and sell at any moment before the event outcome is known. For example you can buy "X will become US president in 2016" and sell at a profit when others want to buy (that is, when the popularity of X rises).So there is no real prediction market in BTC? Do you guys think it would be a good idea to make one?
Is there a prediction market in Bitcoin? I found this http://betsofbitco.in/ - other examples?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_markethttp://ideosphere.com/ - one of the oldest implementations of prediction markets, developed in the Stone Age of the Internet A great announcement would be that McDonalds will accept BTC worldwide. I cannot imagine anything more disruptive than allowing everyone on the planet to buy food with BTC earned by doing microtasks online. How is the Bitinstant card different from http://bitcoin-debit.com/ ? Printing 50,000+ issues of the Bitcoin Magazine seems to me a step back to the 20th century.I like Bitcoin Magazine, and therefore I read it online. Like many citizens of the net I read everything in softcopy (online or in e-format on a pc/phone/tablet screen) and I have not bought a physical dead tree book or magazine for years.I suggest to invest something (much less) in a good adSense campaign. This is really great news, especially if (as I understand from Reddit and the posts in this thread), the card will be available internationally. Looks like the best way to spend BTC in the meatspace "real world" and a huge boost for the BTC economy if it takes off.I must say that I find difficult to suspend disbelief. I think the paperworkÂ  behind a BTC debit card is huge, especially if it is backed by major banks and credit cards.A debit card is good enough (asking for a credit card would be a little too much, wouldn't it). What I want is a quick way to pay for a beer in BTC. Once we have that, BTC will grow exponentially.Is Bitinstant here? I think this is VERY cool. The problem with BTC is how to spend them out of the still very limited "BTC accepted" early adopter community. A debit card that can be loaded with BTC and used to pay for things and services in good old meatspace seems the ideal solution at this moment. Hi, first post here after one year. I am persuaded that the BTC economy will really take off when we can go to the pub and buy a beer in BTC. In the meantime a _very fast and easy to use_ system to exchange BTC for cash would be useful. Perhaps based on NFC in phones? I am sure something like this must exist, please post links. Sounds cool! Just signed up. To those who are still sending me PMs asking if I have more Bitcoins to sell:No, sorry, I have been scammed twice already. Pick somebody else. If ever I sell Bitcoins again, I will only sell for cash (not virtual cash, but solid dead tree cash), and I will only deliver the Bitcoins after receiving the cash and verifying its authenticity.We should be pioneers exploring a new territory, trust each other and act honestly toward each other. Too bad it is not so. Thanks. I mean, how did you find out that a "critical" post had been deleted? Here there is no "this post has been deleted by the originator" flag. And now he has changed it again, now it is smacted.I talked to my lawyer who said that, even if Paypal reverses the charge, I can then sue this person for damages on the basis of the evidence I have. By the way psy, how did you find out? (ref your comment "what is this smell?") Probably. Let's see what happens. Of course I will never accept Paypal again. What are the best alternatives?The scammer has changed his forum handle, now is zbcoins. YES, I just found out that the asshole has initiated a chargeback and deleted his post where he confirmed receiving the BTC.Thanks to those who have quoted his reply where he confirmed receiving the Bitcoin. I am now going to take jpegs of all these messages and send them to Paypal.Forum admins: is there a way to recover a post deleted by the user? I hope there is, let's teach this scammer a lesson.G. I confirm having received the $1,200 via Paypal.I just sent the 85 BTC to the address specified by zjbcoins (in a personal message to me).zjbcoins, please confirm reception as soon as you see the 85 BTC in your wallet.Note: we are exchanging public messages here on the Forum to build a record of this transaction to use in case of a dispute. kingbc they say you are a scammer:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=28834.0I cannot know if this is true, but I will not deal with you. Selling 110 BTC. Paypal, money first. See my trading record here http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11984 The Italian Pirate Party http://www.partito-pirata.it/is now accepting donations in Bitcoin http://www.partito-pirata.it/magazzino/payBTC.htmlDonate to help making Italian politics interesting besides and beyond the sex life of individual politicians. I have just written this article, inspired by a picture of the Bitcoin billboard posted earlier today to Facebook and a recent experience of trading here on the forum. Enjoy. Full text pasted below, links and formatting in the original.Bitcoin: a CryptoCurrency for a free Internet and a free societyhttp://spacecollective.org/giulio/6894/Bitcoin-a-CryptoCurrency-for-a-free-Internet-and-a-free-societyI have just seen this picture on Facebook. Today on the memorydealers.com website: "We are excited to announce that we now accept Bitcoin as payment! Learn more about Bitcoin, the new peer-to-peer digital currency. It's like cash Â— it's free to use and nobody will charge you any fees. The first Bitcoin Billboard in the world! View from the road!" Seeing Bitcoin billboards on the road may indicate that the Bitcoin wave is now unstoppable, and the world has to deal with it.Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. Instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. Bitcoin has been created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto as one of the first implementations of a concept called cryptocurrency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. See alsoÂ  the Bitcoin page on Wikipedia.I have been playing with Bitcoin for a couple of years. Initially, only for intellectual and political interest: I am an IT professional and aÂ  Pirate Party member, and I am very interested inÂ  cryptography technology and the social libertarian politics ofÂ  cypherpunks andÂ  cryptoanarchists. Initially, my only transactions were small (and sometimes large) Bitcoin donations to get friends started in using the system.I will not go into technical details on how the Bitcoin system works, please take a look at the links if you are interested. It will be enough to say that you can generate Bitcoins by using the Bitcoin client to solve a complex computational problem which takes some time, and the difficulty of the task increases over time to keep the system stable. A couple of years ago you could generate Bitcoins fast enough on the home PC, but now it takes at least a personal supercomputing rig, perhaps built withÂ  GPGPUs (or you can pool resources with other users and generate Bitcoins together in a Bitcoin pool). This means that now the gold rush is over and the Bitcoin economy is based on trade and good business ideas.Only a few months ago I wrote: "[Bitcoin has] recently reached parity with the US dollar as reported by Slashdot." More recent articles on Slashdot have catchy and alarmist titles such as "BitCoin, the Most Dangerous Project Ever?" or "Bitcoin Used For the Narcotics Trade". And today (June 7, 2011) one Bitcoin is worth more than 18 USD and its value is going up very fast (you can track the value of Bitcoin at an exchange site like Mt. Gox). And this is not just theory: yesterday I needed some fast cash in my Paypal account to do something, and I easily sold a few Bitcoins at near market value on the Bitcoin forum. Of 4 buyers, 3 were honest and sent me the money, which is not that bad.When I wrote this blog post I had just made my first real purchase in Bitcoin, buying a one year subscription to a VPN. I paid 96 Bitcoins, which was a fair price at the time when one Bitcoin was worth about one USD. But now after four months the 96 Bitcoins that I paid are worth about 1.800 USD, so the good folks at the VPN have made a very, very good business. I hope this anecdote will encourage more sellers to accept Bitcoin for their products and services.A few months ago Bitcoin was covered by the popular show Security Now on the TWiT network: Security Now 287: BitCoin CryptoCurrency. I have posted to blip.tv an edited version of the video (the original has a CC license), with only the 45 min dedicated to Bitcoin. The video gives a simple and effective explanation, and the system has not changed much in the last few months. What has changed is the visibility and popularity of Bitcoin, which is now all over the press and the media.Â Rick Falkvinge, the founder and first party leader of the Swedish Pirate Party, says "IÂ’m Putting All My Savings Into Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin is an amazing technology with an insane potential. But there are four things that must appear for that potential to materialize. This is the first in a series of four articles, where we address usability." I am reading the article now, and I look forward to reading the next three articles in the series.A recent Big Think article is titled "What happens when Anonymous gets a bank?" (found via K21ST) : "Yes, that's right, the hacktivists now have a virtual currency that's untraceable, unhackable, and completely Anonymous. And that's where things start to get interesting. Veteran tech guru Jason Calacanis recently called Bitcoin the most dangerous open source project he's ever seen. TIME suggested that Bitcoin might be able to bring national governments and global financial institutions to their knees. You see, Bitcoin is as much a political statement as it is a virtual currency." Read also Xeni Jardin and Cory Doctorow on Bitcoin at BB.I am not even going to try making a list of recent news coverage, because Bitcoin is all over the blogosphere and the press. Just google Bitcoin or search on Twitter, and you will be (I hope positively) amazed.So... I should write some conclusions. I am sure governments are taking a very unfriendly interest in Bitcoin, and they must be already thinking hard on how to stop the Bitcoin wave. A Bitcoin Technical Lead is going to brief the CIA (see also the discussion at the Bitcoin forum). I am sure they will try to stop Bitcoin, they will try to make it illegal, and they will fight very dirty.But the open, distributed, P2P nature of the Bitcoin wave makes it very difficult to stop. And here is where we, freedom-loving citizens, must play our role. WE MUST PROTECT OUR FREE INTERNET AT ALL TIMES, and we must protect (what is left of) our free society. I praise memorydealers.com, and I have just sent them a donation. If we start using Bitcoin and take it above critical mass, they will not be able to stop it. Support Bitcoin. Download it now. Start to play with it. Buy Bitcoins and use them. Support the vendors who accept payment in Bitcoin. Tell all your friends and give them some Bitcoins to start with. Write about Bitcoin on your blog, Twitter and Facebook. Join Diaspora (another aspect of the free Internet that we must protect) and promote Bitcoin there. Send Bitcoins to your grandmother, with instructions on how to buy nice things.I think Bitcoin is important. We must protect the Internet and the right to free speech, pseudonimity and anonimity online, and we need a untraceable anonymous currency. Of course I realize that Bitcoin can also be used by bad people to do bad things, but I am sure it will be mainly used by good people to do good things, and I think the benefits outweigh the dangers. All things considered, I prefer to live in a world with untraceable anonymous currency than in a world without. I have just written this post about Bitcoin, with thoughts from this thread:Bitcoin: a CryptoCurrency for a free Internet and a free societyhttp://spacecollective.org/giulio/6894/Bitcoin-a-CryptoCurrency-for-a-free-Internet-and-a-free-society
3rd'd What is the status now?Has anyone thought of embedding bitcoinj ( http://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/ ) in a full Android Bitcoin client?Of course generation does not seem to make much sense on devices with limited computing power. Can I be an archangel? Of course I will never do that again. Which is too bad, because we should have mutual trust and flexibility. OK, I have no more Bitcoin to sell. I have the cash I needed in paypal, and it has been interesting.Summary: 4 buyers, I have sent Bitcoin to all, 3 have sent the money to me, one has not.Since the buyer who did not send me the money said he was having some problems with Paypal, I am willing to believe that this was a technical problem and I hope he will send me the money today.If not, what can I say. I think the Bitcoin economy may take off and have a huge impact. We are pioneers and we are making history here, but we should be honest with each others. Scams may take Bitcoin down, void its potential, and crash the value of our reserves to zero. Thanks to all those who replied. Yes, I still have Bitcoins to sell.Two transactions so far. The first with mikewillz, good. The second with the viper, I sent the BTCs but did not receive the money yet. I hope it is just a delay.I think Bitcoin has a huge potential as a P2P untraceable anonymous e-currency, if it really takes off and achieves critical mass. A problem is trust. I am sure there will be robust reputation systems, but in order to get there perhaps we should just trust each other more, which of course is risky. Hi the Viper. No I am not on ebay (I am very easily googlable tho). Thanks for the advice tito13kfm,We just skyped. We are going to transact in pieces to establish trust.Well... The BTC economy will never really take off if we don't learn to trust each other a bit more. Of course there will be scams, but as you say, not everyone is a scammer and most people are honest. Just answered via email and IM here. This is an interesting point: how do we verify each other's trustworthiness? We could be two scammers for what we know of each other. Advice anyone? Well I wanted to keep my BTCs but I kind of need some cash now. I am selling 200 BTC for USD via Paypal, bank wire transfer or cash delivery in NYC. So, who is the buyer? Or, please recommend a good exchange. Then, I am thinking of how the computing power of Bitcoin users could be harnessed to compute something useful.Imagine some opt-in scheme where, if you just want to generate bitcoins as fast as possible with minimal resources, you run the current software, but if you also want to contribute to something like folding@home you run a customized version of the software.Just an idea, I have not thought of implementation details. Good point, thanks. Tentative answer:At the beginning when the game is not popular, no cracker will bother.If the game becomes very popular, new deposits will be claimed by legit users faster than a cracker with reasonable resources can grab them. UBC to refer to micro Bitcoins is a good idea, but I think the official currency code should remain BTC. Like USD and EUR (both are divided in cents) Twitter @giulioprisco Of course the deposit generation module should be tweaked to favor locations near actual players.Suppose 50% of sales is reinvested in the platform as deposits. Then, if I am the only user, half of the money I paid to purchase the app will reappear as a deposit near me, and with some tweaking the platform could scale well as more and more players come in.Of course the platform could also be funded by third parties. For example if it becomes popular a club owner could generate a deposit in the club to draw people in. I am thinking of a Bitcoin treasure hunt with a mobile app. Players see Bitcoins deposits overlayed to the map on their smartphones (like you see things in some videogames like WoW), and the first users who comes within 20m of a deposit grabs it. Can be funded by selling the mobile app for Android, Iphone and Winphone.Thoughts?Are Bitcoin libraries for Android already available? falkvinge.net - Why IÂ’m Putting All My Savings Into Bitcoin falkvinge.net/2011/05/29/why-im-putting-all-my-savings-into-bitcoin/ Right. Remember that many Internet users don't know how to copy/paste. I can't say I am addicted to BC (I am addicted to too many other things as well), and this is my first visit to the forum since a couple of months, but I am really excited by the Bitcoin wave. Every day there are more and more mentions of Bitcoin by the press, including very well known sources.And as AA says, of course BC is "a real threat to the international banking cartels. It will be attacked, it will eventually be outlawed." What can we do to protect BC?This is a good article, I am sure it has been discussed on the forum already: http://launch.is/blog/l019-bitcoin-p2p-currency-the-most-dangerous-project-weve-ev.html I suggest that there should be no fixed rules on this forum, but ad-hoc decision on specific cases.In principle I am for total freedom of speech and no bans, but I can see why we want a clean image on the _official_ Bitcoin forum. Of course, if others want to advertise illegal trade in Bitcoin, they will do so elsewhere.
