I've been making backups of my wallet using Dropbox, but I found that the bitcoin client writes logfiles and other data rather often, which clutters up my Dropbox history. So, I wanted to write a patch that will let users automatically back up their wallet after every transaction to Amazon S3 or Google Storage for Developers. Anyone willing to pledge bitcoin donations for this project? Of course, I don't expect to get anything before I complete the project, but I'd be much more willing to put time into it if I know I'll get even a little cash out of it.I plan on making the project open-source, using the same license as bitcoin. Hi,Has anyone made a graph of the USD value of a bitcoin divided by the difficulty in creating the coin? Something likeUSD/mhash?I know that both the difficulty and the value have been going up dramatically, but I was wondering which goes up faster and by how much. Hi,Sorry if this is a FAQ, but I didn't find the answer after a few searches.I'm currently running bitcoin on one machine, and I see in my data directory:./addr.dat./blk0001.dat./blkindex.dat./database/log.0000000017./__db.001./__db.002./__db.003./__db.004./__db.005./__db.006./db.log./debug.log./.lock./wallet.datIf I wanted to run bitcoin on multiple machines on my LAN, and I wanted to copy the block chain so that it doesn't have to re-download, which files do I need to copy? I'm guessing ./blk0001.dat./blkindex.datare necessary, but what about./__db.001./__db.002./__db.003./__db.004./__db.005./__db.006And the ./database/log.0000000017, db.log, debug.log, and other files don't need to be copied, yes?Thanks for any help!
