We bitcoin users are some of the most trusting, also the most paranoid. among the smartest, yet also the most dumb.Take my words with with a grain of bitcoin. Higher post counts mean nothing. agree +1 wow, nice script. I wouldve helped with something like that if i had the skills. but i dont. It is opensource, code something more user-friendly, and have it pushed in.Though these are very important issues, these guys don't get paid for coding this software. easiest thing to do is a bridge.http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=663it will be seen as just a Wired LAN to the computer. I have used that before, works well. http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=4236.0Andhttp://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=23379.0 That is a chart of how much the Dollar has gone up right?     It's not like he can take our bitcoins away. I think it is semi-possible.while going for one address is unlikely to the extreme, just going after multiple random addresses is much more likely..I was testing keygen and memory once, and I had bitcoin generate 1 million keypairs. If a botnet was to do this scheme, I would think that there would be a good probablility of getting a small few. however the likelyhood of getting a single address with a large amount of bitcoins, is as impossible as attacking one address.I also wonder how many addresses most people have.. http://www.duosecurity.com/2 factor auth services. Mining will not stop. people will pay to mine (by paying the electric bill) just to keep their own transactions going, also to keep their investment secure. If users A,B,C all have 0BTC, how do they import money into it? I think I was looking up Cryptography on google.. was looking for things like gpg or something.. good! it'll be time for me to buy in. =D So is it the posting or the length of time here, that makes you more trustworthy? what does a worthless guy with no skills and no items of worth sell to get BTC? well now I am gonna have to find something else to sell, to get into btc more. well I don't think I should really listen to friends anymore :|
selling of characters is quite within tou for eve, despite that. please post only if you have a question with regard to the sale. or a bid. OP Revise bump. bump indeed. and they worry about people hoarding.. the higher the price, the more incentive to sell  "NOW"... I am pretty sure i won't be mining on the same old 5970 in 5, 10, or even 15+ years.. well, since bitcoin is hitting a low atm, the price will be adjusted accordingly. test [unlisted] +1 shockdiode watchable now.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwNfBgwbqngAs others said, I enjoyed the show. I also liked the fact that you both answered about the multiple sides of Bitcoin. ah, ty. appreciate the info kirian! missed it  build it and they will come.just create/sell some service or product. on win 7 it is C:\Users\%User%\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin explorer was easy and fun.though I nearly had it finished when achievements first came out. i put mine on my checks... weird? ironic? maybe... sorry for so many posts one after another. just turning on bitcoin with the -keypool command does not start the creation. you must click the "new address" button in the address book for it to start creating the new pool of addresses.and if i made the number say 50 it would create 50 every time i hit create new address. it does put it entirely in memory, and turning bitcoin on now takes almost entirely a minute. so i tested it outi used -keypool=1000000file size went from 128kb to 680,076kband it took ~3hrsvery interesting..
