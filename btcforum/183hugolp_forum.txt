Мое утро описали практически) первым делом включаю комп и изучаю свежие новости и только потом утренний моцион и кружка крепкого заварного кофе. Очень бодрит. Очень правильный принцип. Я всегда стремлюсь к улучшениям. Минимум одно улучшение в день. Каждый новый день стараюсь быть лучше себя вчерашнего. Негативное имею к ним отношение. Не мотому что я гомофоб. но я считаю что институт семьи развращать нельзя. Хотят любить друг друга - пусть любят. Но без регистраций( и смс)) в качестве ячейки общества Там стабильность) Была по крайней мере до недавнего времени. Ну а если без шуток то я думаю что в ближайшее время там делать нечего пока вся эта политическая возня не успокоится. А как же все эти ребята: изкоуглеводники и кетодиетологи? У них получается вполне себе обходиться без угловодов или с минимальным их содержанием. иногда деньги падают с неба в виде джекпота или случайной ставки в казино или на бирже. И тут главное правильно распорядиться ими. Истории известны немало случаев когда люди получив неожиданное богатство очень быстро расставались с ним. с другой стороны: если у человека-второй половины нет такого стремления и тяги к саморазвитию. И более того, он/она не видит надобности в этом, тогда зачем? Белок основной строительный материал для мышц в нашем организме. Жиры это источник энергии. Углеводы практически бесполезные элементы. Любой дизайн проект бесполезен без авторского надзора. Строители всегда норовят сделать как им удобнее и технологичнее Как только ребенок пошел в школу - от родителей больше ничего не зависит. Любовь или не любовь к учебе исключительно заслуга учителей. Ремонт это не смертельно, согласен, но очень нервно, трудоемко и времязатратно. Могу со всей ответственностью утверждать, как человек переживший неоднократные ремонты и переезды и затопления)   Мышцы будут уходить лишь в том случае если организм будет голодать, но если у него будет достаточное количество белков и жиров то ему не придется это делать. Это тролинг такой? вообще то здесь серьезная тема где обсуждаются серьезные вопросы и возможно кто-то из новичков прочте и одумается, не будет влезать в такую блуду. Не знаю к счастью или к сожалению но рельсовый транспорт эволюционирует и развивается гораздо быстрее чем колесный, поэтому у нас есть все шансы.  вот тут да полностью соглашусь - очень многие считаю что время без движения в пробке это личное время и можно занять его чем-то полезным и они перестают бдеть за дорожной обстановкой, из-за чего образуются зазоры и удлиняется время реакции на изменения дорожной ситуации, что никак не способствует скорейшему разрешению и без того непростой дорожной ситуации. ...комфортно стоять в пробке на своем автомобиле. На данный момент, не придумали ничего быстрее городского рельсового транспорта - трамваев, метро, электричек. Да вопрос даже не в том за сколько, а подставляться. Ну заплатят даже если огромные какие то деньги в чем конечно сомневаюсь, но присядите гарантировано вы а не ваш работодатель Генетическая склонность к полноте не более чем неправильная работа обмена веществ. его можно разогнать правильным питанием, режимом и потреблением жидкости. Но да вы правы - режим питания это на всю жизнь А если еще там не просто ровная стена а есть обход выступов, то это тот еще квест. Когда это все скрипит гуляет туда сюда. короче ноль эстетики и практичности, не рекомендую. Ну так зачем же тогда искать кого-то дурнее паровоза. Тем более что я уверен на этом форуме таковых нет. Если уж совсем нужно то лучше восмпользоваться услугами специализированных служб. ненене, не офигенный. А не хилый. Все эти знания безусловно из года в год морально устаревают и к сожалению образовательная прогрмма не поспевает за этим устареванием. Тут ничего не попишешь. Но все эти марки марки сталей, способы их обработки, соединений и прочая сопроматная хренотель навсегда врезались в мою память пригождаются в очень интересные моменты - при строительстве дома, при сварке одной марки металла с другой, соединения разных типов проводов  и таких мелочей просто масса. Я не пошел работать по институтской профессии ни разу. Но я никак не могу назвать эти знания бесполезными. Единственный предмет который я бы точно назвал бесполезным это физкультура. Я бы предпочел его заменить на ежедневную утреннюю гимнастику как в китайских школах.
Пластик вообще не разу не вариант. Это колхоз родом из девяностых. Лучше уж просто оштукатурить либо фактурно либо под покраску водоэмульсионкой. Ивсе равно это получится в разы лучше нежели пластиком. Лучше конечно до этого не доводить. Родина она и есть родина. Лучше бастуйте по методу Ганди - ненасильственного свержения режима. Протесты еще ни разу до добра не доводили. Тут же вопрос исключительно "вам шашечки или ехать" - вам вкусно питаться или быть стройным и здоровым. Если быть стройным и здоровым то придется чем то жертвовать. Без этого никак. Быть может эта работа настолько интересна и занимательна что для нее нужны посредники ибо самому такой работой как сейчас говорят стремновато заниматься Категорически позволю с вами не согласиться. Можете за это назвать меня ботаном, но помимо всего вами вышеперечисленного, я из универа вынес не хилый багаж знаний, который мне не единожды в жизни пригождался. Мне кажестя вы слишком опрометчивы в плане времененого дискомфорта от ремонта. Кто хоть раз делал ремент "на живую" поймет.  Везде пыль строительная, все мыть, убирать, мебеля двигать. А не дай бог если еще и мебеля потопом зацепило.  Как вы там, Наши Братья Картофельные? Держитесь, мы всей душой с вами! Если уж станет совсем туго, езжайте к нам, места всем хватит. Приютим, чем сможем поможем!  Почему вы так ратуете за макароны и каши? Диетологи давно доказали вред углеводов в любой форме для стройного телосложения. Проще говоря хотите похудеть - исключите углеводы из рациона. Вопрос лишь в том кто на что учился. Кто-то использовал возможность получить знания и поднялся по профессиональной карьерной лестнице. А кто то так и продолжает пить пиво. Я не топил. Всегда жил на первых этажах. И это стереотип, что плитка холодная. По таким стереотипам сразу выкупаю людей у которых нет дома плитки на полу. Попробуйте сначала интервальное голодание. Строго по расписанию, один выбранный день в неделю, хотя бы два-три месяца. И вы уже увидите ощутимые результаты Точно! про курение то я совсем забыл. Ведь что после стресса нужно сделать - покурить, а после работы чаще всего стресс снимают с помощью алкоголя. Правильно вы все сказали - нафиг такую работу Пожалуйста спрашивайте. На самом деле очень простые среды и для освоения и для конструирования проектов на нем любого масштаба. Зеннопостер или БАС. Не трудные в освоении среды, но позволяют индивидуально  настроить под конкретный проект и задачу. Обширный инструментарий и куча возможностей. Вообщем рекомендую. Это смотря какой начальник и как отругал. И как вы этому умете противостоять. Едем дальше, допустим у Вас кредиты и/или ипотека, зарплата составляет основную статью Вашего дохода. Иесли ее не будет или она существенно уменьшится Вам нечем будет платить по счетам. А дома еще жена и дети малые. Вот все это вкупе и заставляет испытывать стресс. Не то что бы правдоподобнее, просто взрослее. В школе мы все еще детьми были, хоть и хотели казаться взрослее. А в Универе мы уже взрослые и интересы у нас соответствующие. И голова ни разу не учебой забита. Люто плюсую. Сам всегда топлю за плитку. Один раз случился порыв стояка, залило всю квартиру, благо вода холодная была. Просто всю вычерпал и протер на сухо тряпкой. Не представляю, что бы было с линолеумом или ламинатом. Точнее даже представлять не хочется. Не интересно - Ваша правда. Но именно эти две штуки влияют на качество и продолжительность нашей жизни. От сахара отказался довольно просто с обычного кофе и чая перешел на бронекофе. Это мне очень помогло. Никого ни  к чему не призываю. исключительно личный опыт. Тут я лично усматриваю влияние 2020 года в целом. как он там называется ретроградный меркурий, во. вот и сходят все с ума по тихой. кто с 5джи кто с короной.  Таких сервисов пруд пруди. Можно найти даже живого носителя языка в своем городе. С живым человеком оно всяко интереснее заниматься будет.
все верно вы говорите! В том числе от снега зимой. и не только территории но и крышу чистить. Тут уже не будет жкхшных дворников - все придется делать самому. Хочется того или нет любые быстрые углеводы - сахар, хлеб, макароны, выпечка, каши - все это не успевает переработаться должным образом и оседает на боках. можно есть все вышеперечисленное при одном условии - это тяжелый физический труд или тренировки в спортзале Согласен с Вами, вполне реально. Но в моем конкретном случае расходы на аренду окупаются гораздо большей производительностью труда, нежели в домашней обстановке. открывайте в сбербанке. сбар есть сейчас у каждого не будет никаких вопросов с переводами. банк очень надежный. а вот с начислениями процентов на остаток это вообще не про пластиковые карты. надсмотрщик в контексте моего сообщения вообще за скобками. я имею ввиду сам рабочий настрой. я работаю сам на себя. но мне приходится снимать офис ибо все тот же диван холодильник и коты. фокусировать внимание на рабочих задачах когда дома та еще задача. мне это приложение помогло запомнить ряд регулярных выражений и оборотов. поможет начать уверенно изучать английский. рекомендую начать именно с него. подтверждаю. удалось скинуть пять кило просто ддобавив регулярное потребление минералки. закупаюсь паками и держу всегда под рукой. попутно сократилось потребление чая и кофе. да это так. но в частном доме затрат гораздо больше расходов и забот. в квартире большинство внешних забот решает управляющая кампания. в своем доме все придется решать самому. видимо все потому что это новая технология связи а все новое воспринимается агрессивно. как гелиоцентрическая теория галилео галилея тоже когда то воспринималась церковью как абсурд мнение вполне логичное. но вы не учитываете тот факт как влияние реды. находясь на арботе сотрудник находится в рабочей среде которая хочешь не хочешь но стимулирует на производственные задачи. а дома удобный диван горшок) и холодильник. и это очень сильно расслабляет и демотивирует. ну это такой себе совет. вкладывать небольшую сумму под максимальное кредитное плечо чтобы как можно быстрее пролететь. ну такое... абсолютно верное мнение. если у человека есть стремление к саморазвитию то он будет развиваться. но если желания нет, то на нет и суда нет. что, даже одноклассники  и мой мир?  попробуйте вайбер интересная штука. они как однокласники в мире мессенджеров) такойже олдскульный и архаичный мессенджер. Все верно. на то они и органы безопасности чтобы обеспечивать безопасность. зато все надежно безопасно и с соблюдением всех прав человека. да и для самообразования это тоже не очень огромная сумма. если выделять такую сумму на регулярной основе это будет уже существенно. можно просто найти человека одинаково стремящегося развиваться как и вы. а какие там интересы это принципиально не важно. вот если нет желания развиваться у когото это уже проблема. кстати да, тоже использовал контакт как медиаплеер пока они не задрали со своей аудиорекламой. теперь в поиске альтенативного хранилица. ну не в винамп же возвращаться в самом деле. чем вас не устраивает беларусь? бацька там разрабатывает специальный налоговоый режим для криптовалютчиков. такая себе офшорная зона для крипты. вы все верно описали. в основном на ставках зарабатывают сами букмекерские конторы. поэтому если незнаешь раскладов то лучше не соваться в это болото. 70 долларов за одного реферала это очень мягко говоря не плохо. больше чем некоторые зарабатывают за весь месяц. если есть возможность расскажите об этом поподробнее.
не сяоми единым. есть множество других марок которые не только не уступают но и превосходят эпловскую продукцию. теже самсунги и хуавэи. вы определись тогда чего вы хотите больше всего - вкусно гулять и красиво есть или иметь отдельную жилплощадь. именно после правильной расстановки приоритетов появится ясность. так думает еще очень много людей. именно по этому он признан самым лучшим драматическим сериалом всех времен и народов. и заслужил не дну премию эмми увы и ах. теоретические знания не дадут вам реального представления об инвестициях и трейдинге. навыки и практики можно наработать только на реальном опыте это да. самоизоляция не проходит даром. это отличный шанс подтянуть все свои навыки и компетенции, физическую и эмоциональную форму. что я с удовольствием и делаю одно время тоже увлекался ставками. вышел в ноль потратил только время и нервы. поэтому конечно нужно разбираться в вопросе чтобы мало мало выирывать окулист тут нужен без вариантов. если вовремя не обратиться к врачу и не перестать стрессовать то можно без зрения остаться совсем. поэтому чем раньше тем лучше. все мы начинали с малого, главное - во что это все вылилось. кто то смог пойти дальше а ктото остановился. вот это главное никогда не останаливаться и  искать новые способы заработка айфон слишком переоценен, за теже деньги можно взять изделия от южнокорейцев которые будут гораздо технологичнее эполовских. или китайцы из хуавэя тоже отличные ребята. в танки играют все от мала до велика - танкам все возрасты покорны. эта игра как мне кажется на долгие десятилетия наши дети и внуки будут в нее катать. вообщете миллион двести, и это без учета сложного процента, если его посчитать то очень приличная сумма набежит. да вы правы в двоем гораздо проще. очень страннно, почему нет совсем постов про недавнюю раздачу гта5 от эпик геймс? неужели никто не слышал про нее? в интернете с каждого утюга про нее  посмотрел наш сериал "эпидемия"... ну чтож неужто наши научились снимать годные сериалы. сериал смотрится на одном дыхании, лихо закрученный сюжет и хорошая игра главных героев это точно, пройдет не одна сотня лет что бы умы людей трансформировались для принятия таких ценностей. тогда наше общество станет совершенно другим. в будущем нас всех повально ждет чипизация и самой главной валютой станет время,станет самым важным ресурсом на планете.  как в том фантастическом фильме. ну а училась она то как? опять же по книгам журналам или ютубу/инстаграму? полюбому же где то что то читала и научилась. ил сами расскажите как и где чему жена училась любое чтени в общем и целом положительно влияет на развитие личности и расширение кругозора. ну а если литература тематическая - это еще лучше. бумажные и железные деньги выведут из оборота а вот цифровые врядли. хотя цифровые деньги уже давным давно применяются для межбанка.  идея конечно интересная. но 10-15 лет имхо очень и очень долгий срок неизвестно что с ним станет. не в том плане что он соскамится а что его могут полностью запретить. необходим врач и полный отдых: от стрессов от компьютера от душевных волнений. скорее всего это нервное. все болезни от нервов.
оху уж эти богомолы) они ведь могут забраться вовнутрь и выгрызть себе дорогу изнутри.(шутка) все эти страхи имхо родом из детства. заработок в баунти тоже всех радовал одно время. но потом как то все разом рухнуло. поэтому сейчас приходится просто работать. вот вот вот . у каждого смартфона свои плюсы и минусы. в том учисле у Эпл. по мне так идеальный телефон это нокия 3310 - не глючит не умирает неделю заряд держит минимум.  не так давно была официально зарегистрирована в книге рекордов гинесса бабушка-геймерша, возраст которой составляет 90 лет еще как вариант работать на работе и тратить зп на еду а весь приработок сверху складывать на накопительный счет ох уж этот твистер метал) помню столько времени и денег было оставлено в компьютерных клубах) еще был кармагеддон из этой же серии надо было гонять на монструозных тачках и убивать дуг друга и людей охтыж. лост это же как сантабарбара нашего времени. из последних сериалов что я смотрел глубоко запомнился лучше звоните солу у меня наверное семые тривиальные фобии из всех - это страх высоты и боязнь глубокой воды, когда нет дна под ногами, вообще паника начинается. мой первый заработок в интернете был на кликах и просмотре рекламы и рекламной почты. это было в далеком 2004 году так же хорошей инвестицией будут медицинские маски и антисептики. очень актуально в наше неспокойное карантинное время. очень любопытно всегда читать про связе в контексте "мне понадобится" а вы думали о том что вы сами можете дать этим людям? к сожалению сударь. соника на денди никогда не было. на денди был марио и танчики. а вот соник был только на сеге. на винде есть куча узкоспециализированного софта который не делается под мак по неведомым причинам.вот и приходится сидеть на вин. конечно нет. нынешнее поколение ушло далеко вперед со своими технологиями. и в том числе технологии развлечений. ненене ни за какие коврижки. как после учебы начал самостоятельную жизнь так больше на родительскую территорию нини. и чтобы накопить на квартиру надо ни один год прожить с родителями. и потом это расслабляет ни надо платить ни за еду ни за коммуналку. знаю многих людей которые живут в сорок с родителями и никуда не собираются. им итак хорошо. ох уж эти танковые покатушки) стоит один раз попробовать и уже не остановиться. затягивает по уши. элементарная физика. как и грибы из под асфальта. сила напряжения тургора настолько велика что пробивает асфальт тоже интересный формат просмотра фильмов это как читать книги в кратком изложении. мы часто этим грешили в старших классах) основная если не главная фишка эпл это идеально выверенный адаптированный софт. не смотря на более слабое железо эпл работает вполне себе бодро именно благодаря софту если игра в удовольствое приносит доход тогда это как? можно зарабатывать играя. но мне кажется тогда такой способ заработка станет напрягать. 
30 процентов от дохода это очень лихо прямо так скажем. не многие на такое способны. не все умеют копить. проще в ипотеку. ты вы сильно не обращаете внимание на такие посты. этож нативная реклама в чистом виде вписаная в контекст текущей темы. ну такое. очень сомнительное их ряда вон выходящее. пить курить и махать болтом направо и налево много ума не надо. в мире есть гораздо более интересные вещи. везет вам. в больших городах это просто катастрофа. в часы пик не пройти не проехать. даже в условиях самоизоляции пробки не рядеют. самыйлучший сериал что я смотрел - "во все тяжкие" и его спин-офф "лучше звоните солу" в них прекрасно все и сценарная работа и игра актеров и съемки. нет других вариантов - иначе разразится глобальный экономический кризис, последствия которого будут страшнее коронавируса. просто в привязке к битку н ненамного вырастет. нужны так же позитивные новости от самой команды разработчиков. халвинг например. офицальное признание биткойна цифровым золотом и накопление резервов. вариантом может быть много. на чудо надейся, а сам не плошай. надеяться можно а вот руку нужно держать на пульсе и внимательно следить за движениями рынка. есть целые федеральные программы по освоению дальнего востока - там и  подъемные и жилье и дальневосточный гектар, поузнавайте, вдруг действительно найдете чтото для себя. ваша мечта стала гораздо ближе и реальнее - запустили железнодорожное сообщение между материком и полуостровом ну а почему бы и нет? надо знать чем живет сын и уметь разделять его интересы. общие интересы сближают. ледниковая теория тоже имеет место быть. про соль это метафорический пример чтобы бы понятен принцип. или вы правда думаете что ветер за миллионы лет не сможет выветрить породу? Подоспели новые вводные: похоже что в связи с обстановкой в стране и в мире общественный транспорт отменяется. остается только  таки и личный. был раньше подобного мнения. но когда город действительно большой то удобнее перемещаться по нему на своем транспорте. куда надо и во сколько надо. очень странное выражение "как бог даст" особенно после того как вы его родили и поставили на ноги. есть такое выражение в эту же кассу "на бога надейся а сам не плошай" - поэтому как вы спланируете рождение после сорока так оно у вас и пройдет. это все выветрилось за долго до появления мха и деревьев. этому выветриванию миллионы лет. леса же нарастают мене чем за сотню лет. по мне так это не самый шедевральный корейский фильм. есть гораздо более достойные оскара фильмы как то "олдбой" или "я видел дьявола" или "поезд в пусан" ничего себе! меня тоже на фортнайт сын подсадил, нет нет да и да катаем по вечерам в нее. интересный формат общения. знаете это наверное проблема всех тех кто живет у моря - думаешь что вот оно рядом и можно туда поехать в любой момент. но рутина съедает все свободные моменты.
он неплохо так откатился, гораздо ниже отметки в двести долларов. я уж думал что обновит минимум годичной давности. возможно что киты прощупывают сколько денег на руках осталось у криптохомяков и трясут мало-помалу. понятно что на следующий же день после халвинга рынок не проснется весь в зеленках. но предпосылки то для роста никто уже не отменит как мы увидели что биткойн как упал так он и отжался а значит все это не более чем очередная спекуляция сильных мира сего. а что если заработная плата позволяет ему выплачивать этот самый кредит и забыть об этих инвестициях на пару тройку лет? #Proof of authenticationBitcointalk username: hugolpBitcointalk URL: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=183Campaign Name: signatureTelegram Username : @hug0lpERC-20 Wallet  : 0x34291586A84607cc9Db9326b8c5aB09f2730E33e мне кажется тут все намного проще. это как столбы выветривания. например если поставить яйцо на горку соли и аккуратно сдуть лишнее, то под яйцом окажется ровно столько соли сколько необходимо для удержания яйца в равновесии. так вот думаю что тут такой же случай. еще как вариант перейти в формат группы тогда станет доступна возможность набирать подписчиков гораздо больше 5000. но и так же для групп действуют другие правила, более строгие нежели для личных страниц. если честно, то фильм не зашел ни смотря на актерский состав ни операторскую работу. в этом плане гораздо интереснее мне показался сериал "нарко" он гораздо длиннее но там без прикрас показываются все деяния медельинского картеля ого, тоже любители форточки подтянулись. в последнее время тоже подсел на фортнайт. не контра конечно но гемплей интересный и как то незаметно она меня затянула в свои сети. ну и конечно же меня впечатляет  метро. на море удается выбираться в среднем раз в год. и чаще всего по делу. на обучающие семинары или тренинги. отличный формат ктсати. день плотной работы - вечерние прогулки на берегу.  рекомендую и да и нет. и опасно и рискованно. возможно что это будут рискованные вложения и они могут не оправдаться, а возможно что наоборот вложения будут успешны и сорвем джек-пот. в любом случае нужно взвешивать все за и против. учитывая опыт 2017 года, то эфир вырос до рекордных значений именно в конце года. поэтому стоит ожидать роста эфира именно к концу года. до этого срока будут только поползновения и попытки эфира занять определенные позиции я не могу тут с вами согласиться. даже если глава федерального резерва сша признает что биткойн это цифровое золото, то его ценность гораздо более шире чем сугубо спекулятивная.и мое мнение полностью с этим совпадает. "ох как как молоды мы были..." тоже по неопытности и не знаию натворил кучу непростительных ошибок и слил приличную сумму денег. но теперь взамен у меня есть опыт - сын ошибок трудных и понимание как надо делать и как не надо делать. тут я абсолютно с вами согласен, что подходить к вопросу выбора нужно самым тщательнейшим образом.  и то я бы рекомендовал на кредитные покупать не альткойны, но биткойн потомучто именно это явяется оправданным вложением кредитных средств. если вы посмотрите внимательно то в целом и общем рынок крипты на данный момент идет вниз. изредка стреляют некоторые криптовалюты для того чтобы у тех кто держит большой пул этих монет была возможность их слить и перезакупиться. я очень надеюсь что такого не случится и после халвинга мы начнем восходящее движение. всеже предыдущие два раза ситуация разворачивалась именно таким образом и я очень сильно надеюсь на повторения сценария. тогда имеет смысл закупать альткойны  не на всю котлету а по чуть чуть. на некоторую часть депозита. так вы усредняете стоимость депозита и страхуете риски от просадки цены. поэтому это можно делать, но аккуратно и с умом. как раз то что вы называете непонятно что переделом и называется. кошмарят всех вытряхают криптовалюту изо всех под любыми  предлогами. никому не интересно чтобы много криптовалюты находилось частных руках.
если кредит совсем небольшой и выплаты по нему меньше десятой части ежемесячного дохода, то почему бы и да? а так да, если есть стабильный источник дохода тогд можно смело инвестировать его часть в криптовалюты в несложный рынок верят либо новички либо дилетанты. во всех остальных случаях рынок сложный и многогранный и если вы хотите на нем заработать то необходимо следить за ним не отводя глаз. иначе рынок не прощает ошибок. ценность монеты теперь обеспечивается не столько ее пользой сколько пиаром и маркетингом. взять к примеру тот же биткойн кэш и биткойн SV. Какую реальную ценность из себя представляют эти моненты? но сколько вокруг них спекуляций и хайпа. ну судя по тому что ты несешь ты походу не сдал еще егэ. я понимаю что причинно-следственные связи и корреляции для тебя очень сложные материи. но хотя бы научись 2 и 2 складывать. займись саморазвитием почитай умные книжки, например по этикету, про вежливость ну и конечно же про криптовалюту и поведение масс. а потом когда-нибудь ты сможешь встревать в разговор со взрослыми дядями) это врядли. если посмотреть на предыдущие два пика роста биткойна то альтсезон всегда следовал за булраном биткойна и никак иначе. поэтому ожидать альтсезон ранее роста биткойна бессмысленно. хотя допускаю сценарий при котором все моет пойти не по плану. шортить надо уметь. ведь шорты быстрые как понос  и резкие как удар серпом по яйцам - никогда не угадаешь когда прольется. уметь шортить это целое искусство и оно не каждому дано. если вы умеете, снимаю шляпу пред вашим талантом. все так. новички будут скупать альтконы потому что биткойн дорогой. но альткойны так же отличный инструмент для преумножения биткона. через них можно преумножать биткойн потому что они иксуют гораздо легче и больше чем биткойн. вариант просто отличный. если проанализировать все стоимостные графики лайткойна и провести корреляцию с графиками биткойна - вы будете приятно удивлены. именно этот анализ и натолкнул меня на такие интересные мысли касательно лайткойна затариваться то можно. но меня беспокоят два вопроса: дно ли  это или будет еще ниже? и когда будет этот альтсезон - реально этого никто не знает. поэтому стоит ли закупаться сейчас или нет каждый решает сам. как только начнется новый рост. поналетят стервятники и все жаждующие заработать - от реальных разработчиков до пирамидонщиков. все кто сейчас затих и ушли из сферы и вновь активизируются. и мы увидим новый всплеск активного размножения проектов. не совсем с вами согласен. и да и нет. рынок всегда вносит свои коррективы и по закону джунглей выживает сильнейший. но всегда будут запускаться новые проекты. старые будут уходить новые появляться бесконечный цикл

они уже применяюься в финансовом и корпораивном секторах, для перемещения финансов и для ведения электронного документооборота, для складского учета, теже Ripple и  Corda бытует мнение что эти ребята давно в сговоре и прикрывают друг друга круговой порукой, поэтому не исключено что они действуют заодно. тут надо рисковать или наоборот обходить стороной высокорисковые проекты, вкладываясь только в биткойн, стабильно гарантировано, надежно все получается только у того, кто ничего не делает. рускуйте и возможно у вас все получится. мы все будем на это надеяться верно мыслите уж. лучше зафиксироваться в профите, чем ждать и понести убытки. справедливости ради нужно сказать что не все способны угадать момент падения. да и сейчас многие из них накачивать нет проблем. обьемы маленькие стоимость малая вот и гоняю цену туда сюда. разница в 5 процентов, но в лайткойн показал гораздо больший прирост по сравнению с биткойном в процентном соотношении.
я думаю в ближайшие дни все должно проясниться. подвижки уже начаты. посмотрим как рынок будет вести себя в ближайшее время и от этого будем плясать. очень правильное решение я считаю, ибо действительно все наелись скама или ожидания биржи чтобы продать свои токены за 2-3 копейки получается что рынок искусственно сдули, выдоили, обезжирили его на сколько смогли. именно поэтому рынку нужна регуляция чтобы киты н могли этого делать только по своему хотению тут скорее не высасывание денег из людей а скорее борьба с их отмыванием и утечкой забугор в неверояных масштабах ну по сути сейчас так и происходит что очень небольшая группа людей контролирует 80 процентов всего рынка
и все  равно это не даст гарантии что проект выстрелит в будущем. короткий памп при выходе на биржу и слив. удел большинсва выходящих сейчас проектов. что бы вернулся оптимизм надо пропампить биткойн хотябы до 20к. потом все ломанутся скупать биткойн как умалишенные и это будет не остановить так это в любом деле так. нужно сначала провести полный анализ, взвесить все риски и просчитать возможную прибыль и если одно перекрывает другое, тогда стоит делать. все верное. главное правильно выбрать точку хода и еще более важно - вовремя выйти из позиции, не передержать, чтобы карета не превратилась в тыкву.
Более того, уже сейчас удаленная идентификация становится нормой. В Москве запустили год назад нейросеть для обнаружения преступников через камеры наружного наблюдения, Сбербанк активно внедряет биометрию для предоставления к своим услугам. В Лондоне тоже уже работает аналогичная полицейская сеть, притом можно уже схлопотать штраф за умышленное сокрытие своего лица от таких камер. Будущее ближе чем мы думаем.  объемы нужны для того чтобы создавать ликвидность той или иной монеты - мол смотрите какой объем торгов за сутки, наша монета востребована, тем самым подогревается интерес к монете и на этом фоне монета может расти. Накрутка используется как один из инструментов маркетинга. вы же сами понимаете что тут вопрос стоит не в игнорировании мелких криптовалют а в их жизнеспособности и жизнестойкости. биткойн доказал свою жизнеспособность и минимальную валатильность в масштабах всего криптовалютного рынка  все так. даже сами киты - тот же пресловутый Джон Макафи это подтверждают, что рынок не подчиняется классическим биржевым законам ибо они не применимы к криптовалютам в той же мере как их применяют к класическому фондовому рынку. кус сам по себе процедура бесусловно вредная. но в контесксте проведения ICO я понимаю зачем она делается: дабы избежать большого количества фрода и отмывания денег, а так же чтобы соблюсти требованя антитеррористического законодательства.  в долгосрочной перспективе не исключен такой сценарий развития событий. монета молодая, ей всего каких то 10 лет, при том эмиссия очень малая. упорно циркулируют слухи что от 25 до 30 процентов монет находящихся в обращении безвозвратно утеряны. вот исходя из всего этого и можно сделать вывод что биткойн стрельнет до 1 миллиона как пить дать. ну а почему бы и нет? у одного старичка -миллиардера это уже получилось. почему не должно получиться у него? но что верно то верно - хайп вокруг монеты на фоне президентской гонки будет немалый. и на этом можно довольно таки успешно прокатиться. да вот как раз таки наоборот. считаю что покупка вначале 2019 биткойна пусть даже на кредитные деньги это была бы очень выгодная инвестиция. но дешевый биток к сожалению никому не интересен. все будут брать кредиты и покупать биток когда он вернется к отметке 20к вот это уже поистине глупые деньги. фейсбук располагает поистине широкими возможностями для внедрения своего койна в обычную жизнь. но как по мне самая важная суперспособность цукерберга это умение находить общий язык с регулирующими органами. так что по сути дело за малым - за, собственно, выпуском самого койна. вообщето кризисы таки имеют цикличность. это прослеживается хотябы на графиках цен биржевых "веществ" нефти, угля стали. насчет того что крипта станет новой всемирной валютой. такое мнение имеет место быть . но как по мне криптовалюты еще очень далеки от того что бы полностью заменить классические деньги. да где же это вы видели циклы по 10 лет. в век информационных технологий процессы ускоряются а время соответственно сжимается. возможно раньше кризисы и происходили раз в 10 лет, то теперь они происходят раз в шесть лет, а в скором времени будут происходить и того чаще. почему вы ограничиваете применение монеты фейсбука только самим фейсбуком? Цукербергу под силу организовать и договориться с комиссией по ценным бумагам США о выпуске привязанной пластиковой карты, а соответственно платежного средства и средства взаиморасчетов. а это уже выход совершенно на другой уровень применения криптовалют. #JOIN & #Proof of authentication"Name" of Bounty Campaign SignatureBitcointalk username: hugolpBitcointalk profile link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=183Telegram username: @hug0lp Bitcointalk Username: hugolpBitcointalk Profile URL: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=183Followed on Twitter: Yes https://twitter.com/hug0lupURL of the tweet you retweeted: https://twitter.com/hug0lup/status/1126093047266201600Joined Telegram Group: Yes  URL of the post you shared in your telegram group/channel: Subscribed on Reddit: Yes https://www.reddit.com/user/hugolupURL of your Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ICOAnalysis/comments/bm4epk/vite_testnet_incentive_plan/Followed on Steemit: Yes https://steemit.com/@hugolpURL of the post you resteemed: https://steemit.com/blockchain/@vitelabs/vite-native-coins-vs-vite-erc20-tokensURL of the screenshot for the rating/review: https://imgur.com/aOSryfA Day#: 20 (8/03)Twitter campaignTwitter url: https://twitter.com/hug0lpRow Number in Spreadsheet: 3408Retweets & likes:1. https://twitter.com/hug0lp/status/11044208485370961922. https://twitter.com/hug0lp/status/11044208311937146933. https://twitter.com/hug0lp/status/1104420774952226816Signature Campaign links1 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5072844.msg50090631#msg500906312 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3744889.msg50090676#msg50090676 меня мучает тоько один вопрос, зачем такой кампании как фейсбук выпускать свою криптовалюту? привлечь доболнительные деньги? так у него их итак как у дурака фантиков. при условии того что есть свободные фиатные деньги . если их нет то остается только сидеть и ждать всеобщего роста рынка. или как ваиант - пытаться трейдить.

Con el nivel de gastos de los políticos de USA, con lo que han pillado no tienen ni para cacahuetes. Gracias. Ahora, informar significa tener que pagar tambien supongo? Y como justifican cobrarte por actividad economica que sucede fuera de Espana? Significa esto que si yo, por ejemplo, vendo una casa en el extrangero ademas de los impuestos del pais donde suceda tengo que pagar impuestos en Espana? Me pareceria una salvajada. Si algún día voy a Munich me preparé, no iré preguntando a personas aleatorias algo que puedes encontrar facilmente. En vez de enfurruñarte deberías agradecer que se te digan las cosas a la cara. If anything is happening right now is due to speculators and panick users selling, but it was quiet for a big while. El número de memoria no me lo se no, si eso es lo que me estás preguntando. Lo tendrás en la wiki por eso, que es donde deberías haber ido a mirar en vez de preguntar en el foro. Tanto como en caida libre... Para estandares historicos de bitcoins el precio está sorprendentemente estable, solo cayendo un poco. 3 por persona así que no cojas muchas que sino al final faltarán. A ver si algun abogado, contable o alguien que sepa de esto me puede responder.Si me cojo una tarjeta de crédito extranjera, no anónima pero asociada a un banco extranjero y la voy recargando con bitcoins, tengo que declarar algo en España? Porque en teoría el dinero está siempre fuera de España con lo cual no cuenta como actividad económica en España. Si usara esa tarjeta localmente entonces tendría que pagar impuestos por la compra y si la usara para comprar en el extranjero tendría que pagar aduanas, pero en cuanto a declarar el dinero en la declaración de la renta no debería hacerlo porque el dinero está en el extranjero, correcto?También se agradecerían sugerencias sobre tarjetas de crédito recargables. He visto la de OKPay y las comisiones no parecen exhorbitantes. Im still looking for someone to act as taobao agent for bitcoins. Conditions are the same. First round will be around 1000 cny.I did not imagine it would be so hard to find someone to resend me some items for a fee. My conditions are standard and I have good reputation. +1 Lo que quiero decir es que les pueden pedir btc a cualquiero. No porque no aceptes bitcoins, van a pedirte euros. Te van a decir que te vayas a un exchange y les des bitcoins. Como he dicho, aceptar bitcoin seguramente te hace incrementar las probabilidades de ser un objetivo, pero que te pidan btc en chantaje le puede pasar a cualquiera, los acepte o no los acepte. Lo siento. Si la seguridad informatica fuera mi fuerte probaría a ayudarte.Esto le puede pasar a cualquier tienda web, acepte o no acepte bitcoins. Lo que si es cierto es que aceptando bitcoins puede hacerte un objectivo más probable, pero lo que te han hecho a ti se lo pueden hacer a cualquiera que no acepte bitcoins también. Acabo de realizar un withdraw the mtgox y está en transacciones pendientes. Answered. El gobierno decide lo que es legal y lo que no lo es. Si te crees que los politicos se van a quedar sentaditos viendo como se les escapa su su tanto por ciento estas equivocado. Si vas a hacer algo asi lo mejor es estar calladito, por mucho que por ahora sea legal. Answered. We would use scrow, but between 500 and 1000 cny for the first order. I want to buy stuff from taobao and have it shipped to my country. I need someone in China that, for a fee, will buy it and reship it. Im still interested in finding someone to act as taobao agent for bitcoins. For anyone wanting to act as a Taobao agent send me a private message. But keep in mind that we will use scrow for the transaction since we dont know each other.
HiI have a question for the chinese subforum, excuse the english.Im looking for a Taobao agent that accepts bitcoins. Google has turned nothing. Maybe someone in the forum is willing to act as Taobao agent for me?Thanks,Hugo Mah roads!Thats a big statement. I can understand a pragmatic aproach, the government exists and has more weapons than anyone else so Im going to pay. I do the same. But that is very different from saying that without government we would not have infrastructure.For example, in the early days of the USA the roads were build privately by cooperatives formed in the towns that needed the roads. It was later on that the government came in and monopolized its construction. In Somalia when the government collapsed the telephone industry had to build a lot of infrastructure that did not exist, flourished and provided the cheapest service in all Africa (with no regulations at all for obvious reasons). Just because we are used to government monopolies on infrastructure does not mean that if the government wasnt there the infrastructure would not exist. We can not know how it would be because the government is using force to impose its system, but the examples we have where governments werent there or have allowed the private sector to freely provide show better results than government monopoly.But I understand that after a whole life of living under government monopolies it can be hard to even imagine. Politicians count on this effect too. A common complain among a lot of people when the communist regime in Russia felt was that, without the government having companies, jobs would disappear. To us its absolutely hilarious but they were dead serious. All their lifes they had looked up to the government for a job so they could not imagine it otherwise, the same way people in western countries have lived under government monopolies for infrastructure and can not imagine it otherwise.Maybe the next step is cryptoroads...  Yo vi el video donde lo decía y me pareció más una gansada y ganas de llamar la atención que otra cosa. How do you trade manually when Bitcoin markets are 24h? Eso tiene que ver con la minería y porque la minería es una parte esencial de Bitcoin. Lee sobre como funciona Bitcoin o pregunta en las sección de minería. Porque si recibes un paquete en tu casa, incluso si es a tu nombre, siempre puedes decir que tú no lo pediste y que no sabes lo que es. Legalmente la policía no puede hacer nada excepto si tiene otro tipo de pruebas de que tú ordenaste el paquete. Solo recibir un paquete no es prueba para que te condenen. Obviamente puede hacer que la policía te preste más atención. En cambio, aunque recibir un paquete en un codigo postal tampoco es prueba legalmente, es mucho más sospechoso, porque es más dificil que se confunda un código postal.Es decir, el código postal no te aporta más seguridad, pero puede hacer que la policía te preste más atención. Por lo que he estado leyendo sobre Silk Road para saber si el modelo es viable o no y como puede afectar a Bitcoin, es común para los que piden un paquete dejarlo sin abrir durante unos días, porque si la policía aparece pasadas unas horas, siempre puedes alegar que no lo habías pedido y que ni siquiera lo has abierto, así que no tienen ninguna prueba contra ti. Puedes econtrar ejemplos de esto en r/silkroad. Es un ecosistema interesante por lo pintoresco de la situación. Entiendes que un cajetín es tan incriminatorio como que te llegue a casa, no? De hecho, un cajetín es incluso más sospechoso. Linux is the most used operating system in the world, just not in desktop, but in everything else. Server is linux dominated, embeded and mobile is linux dominated (think how many people use Android), supercomputers is linux dominated, etc... Only in desktop linux does not dominate. Con un cartel que pusiera: "Alerta campos magnéticos! La instalación no se hace responsable del cancer.", no se yo si entrarían muchos turistas... Imaginate el consumo por perdidas... Y el campo magnetico que podría crear. Because its impossible that the explanation is that people have a hard time sending fiat to Bitstamp? Im going to go anal:-bitcoin/bitcoins: is the currency and, as any other currency, you dont capitalize the first letter.-Bitcoin: is the name for the network, the protocol and even the software, therefore you capitalize the first letter.Note that you can not write "Bitcoins", you can only write "bitcoins" because only the currency can be plural and you never capitalize it. No está tan claro que Mutum Sigillum necesite las licencias que el DHS está reclamando, porque no está nada claro que Mutum Sigillum sea un money transmitter.De cualquier manera, es feo y abusivo por parte del DHS cerrar la cuenta directamente sin intentar hablar antes con Mutum Sigillum o siquiera darle un aviso para intentar remediar la situación de manera amistosa. Excepto Namecoin, no he visto una nueva moneda que aporta algo, son todo hype. Este mismo hilo, no tengo ninguna prueba, pero estoy convencido de que es una manera de intentar promocionar Bitbar. Estoy convencido de que Ferdinandreyes ha comprado bitbars y se hace el inocente aquí preguntando para que más gente vaya y la compre. Han hecho así con cada moneda nueva que ha salido. Cambian cuatro tonterías que en realidad no aportan nada, promocionan los cambios como si fueran el nuevo milagro, y se dedican a promocionar allí donde pueden normalmente haciendose pasar por parte no interesada. I understand its a very big file and that using 15 minute candles reduces the size of the database considerably, but having each trade can help simulate the spread much better (obviously having the orderbook would be ideal, but thats even more data). And with today hard drives being so cheap is it really a problem? Bitcoin-qt was included in Debian so Ubuntu probably got it from there. Also there is a repository with updated packages for the Qt client. Why not mtgox itself? There is no GROUP_ORDERS string in model.py. I think you have missed the part where I said I agree with your remark. Why does goxgui merges together some bids or asks? Ive noticed that sometimes bids or asks that are closed get showed together as if they are the same bid or the same ask. Is this a bug or a feature? Either way it should not be this way IMO.EDIT: Ive checked and goxtool is not doing it, it must be something goxgui is doing.
No, I do agree that there is a difference between so called "social sciences" and empirical sciences. There is people who even argue that social sciences, by their own nature, should not be called sciences. I dont really care about the name and redefinitions of the word science. I do acknowledge that by strict historical standards social sciences should not be called sciences and that the extended use of the word science has been used to give credibility to certain theories that probably did not deserve it. But the new meaning is so extended at this point that its a bit useless to try to "enforce" the strict old historical definition. As long as we understand that social sciences are different than empirical sciences, I dont have a problem with the word people decide to use.But social sciences are not art. Engineering has an "artistic" side, trading too, but social sciences are not so much about art, but about creating a theoretical body of ideas that try to reflect reality, not really about producing an effect (which is what art is).Moving into the economic part, since you have started by bringing up the idea of government spending to (allegedly) stimulate the economy, why dont you expand on as a first topic of discussion? I dont see how anyone would think that keynesianism has been useful. And more importantly economics is supposed to be a science, so it should be correct not useful and keynesianism has been proven false again and again.I tried having a debate with some keynesians who were claiming Bitcoin would not succed because keynesianism and they could not handle it, so I extend the offer to you. But by debate I dontmean an internet slogan-catchy phrases ridiculous back and forth, I mean an honest exchange of ideas. Es posible, cuando salieron las GPU también hubo una sobresaturación en un momento determinado. Al menos las gpu's se puedieron revender, algo que va a ser mucho más dificil sino imposible con los ASICs. For what I talk with other people, everyone is waiting to see which direction it moves. Oh shit, why has no one think of this. Thank you and time to sell. I would send you a generous bitcoin tip but Im sure you do not want it since its crashing anyway. In general the trading strategy is up to you. Youll find frameworks that make it easy to write a bot, but the strategy part you will have to do. Nobody is going to give you a money making machine just because. La semana que viene saldrá otra. Tú tranquilo. No lo habia pensado pero parece posible. La idea de Bitcoin como oro y otras monedas como plata no tiene mucho sentido. La necesidad de usar otros metales viene de que el oro era tan valioso que para pagar una cerveza hubieras necesitado apenas un poco de polvo de oro, pero obviamente era imposible medir esas cantidades y incluso si pudieran seria engorroso de manejar. Es decir habia un valor minimo en el que el oro se volvia inmanejable. Ahi aparecia la plata y luego el bronce.Pero Bitcoin no sufre de ese problema. El problema es que cuanto mas bajes el tiempo mas se incrementa la posibilidad de forks y llegara un momento que sera impracticable. Veremos como funciona chncoin con solo 1 minuto. Ademas, yo sigo sin ver como es una ventaja significativa una reduccion del tiempo de aprobacion que no lo haga (casi) instantanea. Cuando tu pagas en una maquina automatica o en una tienda cualquier tiempo de acceptacion que pase de unos pocos segundos es inaceptable. Nadie haceptara tener que esperar p.e. 2 minutos para confirmar una chocolatina.Y en internet o en una compra que no tenga que ser instantanea un tiempo de confirmacion algo mayor no importa casi.Una modena descentralizada que permitiera pagos (casi) instantaneos tendria una ventaja importante sobre Bitcoin, pero no veo como una reduccion del tiempo que aun no lo hace instantaneo realmente importe. Cual es la manera de siempre? Por lo que he leido en r/silkroad el acceso es intermitente porque estan lucando contra el ddos, pero imagenes de la DEA? Scrypt no anula GPU mining. Tampoco ASIC mining (aunque obvimanete las ASIC diseñadas para SHA256 no valen para Scrypt, tendría que ser un nuevo diseño). Eso es un bulo (otro más) que se usó para promocionar Litecoin. Valor equivalente en el momento de la compra supongo, pero no soy abogado. Para el gobierno español el que hayas pagado con bitcoins es como si hubieras pagado con vacas o con hierro, es un trueque. Bitcoin nunca será la moneda oficial de un país, puede llegar a ser la moneda de facto, pero dificilmente será adoptada oficialmente por los políticos. Its too obvious for the CIA. All the evidences point to Bitcoin being developed by the KGB and leaving clear clues pointing to the CIA as a cover up. No se dice. Es asi.Porque crees que Bitcoin tiene una media de 10 minutos entre confirmaciones cuando seria trivial tecnicamente usar otro valor? Los desarrolladores son tontos?Ademas no veo el beneficio de tener pequenas confirmaciones antes. En la vida real tu no vas a estar esperando 2, 4 o 6 minutos a que una maquina expendedora te confirme una transaccion. El problema de no tener confirmacion inmediata sigue siendo el mismo. Y si estas comprando por internet o algo que no necesita confirmacion inmediata entonces tampoco importa demasiado. No veo el beneficio. Ademas que vas a hacer cuando salga una moneda con un tiempo aun menor? Porque cambiar el parametro es trivial.El futuro no es ir reduciendo cada vez mas el tiempo entre bloques porque eso tiene serios problemas (aumentan los forks), sino las green adresses u otros metodos para permitir uso instantaneo de la criptomoneda. And China will promote anything tha hurts us dollars dominance over the world.If I had to bet, China gov will support Bitcoin as long as it helps bring down dollar dominance and then turn strongly against it if that ever happens. Crear una moneda usando el codigo abierto que proporciona Bitcoin es extremadamente sencillo, apenas has de modificar unas lineas. Si tu no sabes programar seguro que por cuatro duros puedes encontrar a alguien que lo haga. Lo dificil es darle 'hype' a la moneda, ahi es donde la mayoria de copias fallan. Por ejemplo Litecoin ha usado la tactica de ser pesado hasta la saciedad. Con las cagadas tecnicas que el creador hizo al principio cualquiera diria que solo chiflados se fiarian, pero el tio siguio promocionando su moneda incluso a quien no queria saber nada de ella. Tienes todos estos post de un tio haciendose el inocente y preguntando que se sabe de de tal moneda como si no supiera nada cuando 99 de 100 es un tio que ha comprado la moneda y busca que parezca que hay interes genuino. O posts que son obvios troll baits y solo buscan que se hable de la moneda, etc... No son sistemas piramidales, pero usan tacticas muy parecidas.En fin, que tecnicamente no es complicado, el problema es promocionarlas. Y por cada moneda que ves que ha conseguido un poco de fama hay decenas que han desaparecido en el anonimato. La verdad es que no lo se. No se si para atacar Tor necesitas miles de ordenadores como con DDOS normal, o con pocos ordenadores accediendo a TOR vía diferentes pasarelas basta. La idea de usar miles de ordenadores para hacer un DDOS (normalmente usando ordenadores infetados de personas que no saben lo que están haciendo sus ordenadores) es que no se puedan bloquear unas pocas direcciones y así parar el DDOS. Este método cuesta dinero porque usar las redes de ordenadores infectados cuesta dinero. En cambio si gracias a la propia anonimidad de TOR se puede hacer el ataque desde unos pocos ordenadores entonces no costaría dinero (o casi nada). Como he dicho, realmente no tengo ni idea, pero estoy especulando por lo que está durando el ataque sin que haya dado aún resultado.
Did you got left behind? Por lo poco que he leido del tema, el primer ataque fue un DDOS a traves de Tor a Silk Road, ese lo solucionaron. Pero el segundo ataque no fue a Silk Road directamente sino a las pasarelas Tor que daban acceso a Silk Road, así que realmente fue un ataque a la red Tor que bloqueó el acceso Silk Road, no un ataque a la página directamente. Y creo que el ataque lo había descrito como una posibilidad algun desarrollador de Tor. Se supone que los atacantes se inspiraron en ese documento (sino llegaron a las mismas conclusiones por si mismos, pero parece menos probable). El problema es que a la que otro sitio se haga grande, será el elegido para el ataque, y hay que tener en cuenta que sitios como Silk Road se basan en la confianza. Empezar de nuevo tienes muchos costes (monetarios y sobretodo no-monetarios) asociados.Además, la gente dejaría de usar el sistema ya que: porque vas a usar un sistema donde tienes que ganar reputación para funcionar bien si sabes que lo más probable es que no tengas tiempo de construir reputación antes de que lo tiren abajo? Sería un engorro para los usuarios, dejarían de usarlo muchos, etc...Esto necesita solucionarse de otra manera. O se arregla el protocolo Tor, o Silk Road encuentra alguna solución particular (por ejemplo asignar una web diferente a cada usuario) o se usa otro protocolo anonimizador que no tengas los problemas de Tor (pero las alternativas no han sido muy testeadas). Sino, el modelo Silk Road no sobrevivirá. Buen trabajo, se agradece. I hit a problem with my bot and its that the last days the number of trades has increased a lot at mtgox so downloading two days of data everytime I load the bot takes for ever. So Ive been programming a way to save the trades in a database. It obviously saves the trades in the database, but also on load my strategy checks the first received trade and the oldest trade in the database and downloads the trades missing between them so the history is always complete. The idea is to use it for backtesting as well. If anyone is interested I can share the code.Also, with more datapoints the hourly ema formula gives almost exacts results to bitcoincharts (as suspected) so thats good. The random walk theory admits that its a flawed aproach. It assumes a gausian probability (otherwise the calculations get so nasty that are impossible to do) when the empirical evidences of all the data gathered from stock markets show that they dont show a gaussian distribution. Por encima de los 100 otra vez y mtgox con más de 30 segundos de lag. Esto es de risa. MtQuid already showed how to include ta-lib in a strategy. Look early pages in this thread. He is not correct, because if you want to count everything you have to count the people using the exchanges not for day trading, but just as exchanges, which is another flow (in and out) of money. MtGox está goxeando otra vez. 120+ segundos de lag. Because the attack is on TOR itself not Silk Road specifically. The attack is happening because of a weakness of the Tor protocol, the attacker can do this type of attack to any TOR hidden and Im sure its a safe bet its something they want to resolve. En este caso particular el problema que Silk Road ha encontrado está en Tor, no en Bitcoin. Aunque nunca está de más citar a DPR, es un personaje impresionante. En la sección de newbies, donde además puedes postear hasta que tengas acceso al resto del foro. Más bien es la incertidumbre alrededor de la continuidad de Silk Road que ha provocado que algunos estén vendiendo bitcoins. Fijate que la bajada no se ha producido hasta que Silk Road no ha abierto de nuevo, permitiendo a sus ususarios sacar los bitcoins. Its obvious that a lot of Silkroaders (or however they want to be called) are cashing out at least part of their bitcoins as they are able to access the site. A lot of the sellers are not "Bitcoin believers" like most of the early adopters, but just drug sellers that are using Bitcoin because its useful (which is fine), so they tend to preffer holding fiat more than bitcoins, specially now that there is uncertainty. As more people access SR and have access to the funds more selling presure will appear. I think they will regret it long term and in a few years they wish they had kept their bitcoins, but you can not fault them for wanting something they are more familiar with and cashing out if they are not really into Bitcoin as a monetary system changer but just as a useful method to sell drugs. MtQuid that looks terrific. Hopefully prof7bit can include that or something similar in the source.Another solution might be being able to select what goes into the debug at runtime, so one could select to only have in the debug file the messages from the modules s/he wants. Im fine with any of both solutions.EDIT: MtQuid tried your code and its working perfectly. Im sending you a small tip. Yeah, thats an option, but I still would preffer to have a different file so I can check it from time to time.Thanks for the direction, I will try using ta-lib between today and tomorrow, hopefully it gives better results that my manually created one (which its not difficult...). Si, si... "broma". And how are the results?.I manually created a ema function, basically following the formula you see everywhere in the Internet (f.e. http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages) but Im getting results quite different from bitcoincharts.com, specially for the hourly ema's but almost identical for the 1minute ema's. Because of this my guess was: the formula calculates the sma with the first periods and then starts adding the data as a exponential. I assumed this means that over time with enough data it would converge and that is why the 1minute ema's were almost identical while the hourly ema's were not, since Im getting data of two days and there is only 48 hours while there is 48 * 60 minutes. Does ta-lib get better results with data from one day only?I actually would love to have the the web part in goxtool, maybe just as a plugin or something.EDIT: Also, can anyone give me a hint on how to create a separate debug file for my bot? The regular debug goxtool file gets too big and its very cumbersome to check. I hope you are not refering to voting, because then we are all doomed.
Sí, cuanta más potencia de calculo, más segura es la red Bitcoin.No se están gastando recursos y energía tontamente. Primero, las ASICS no consumen más que las FPGA's or las GPU's, son más eficientes. Y segundo, si la gente está dispuesta a pagar por el servicio significa que son recursos bien empleados. La minería son recursos destinados a mantener la red Bitcoin segura y ese es un servicio que mucha gente aprecia. Sorry I like to read about economics and finance, I dont lose my time with sensationalism. Youll have to find someone else to read the article and point to you why Matt Taibbi is just sensationalism. Excuse if this is offtopic, but I want my goxtool bot to notify my Android phone, and even sound an alarm (in case Im sleeping) when certain conditions are met. Whats the best way of achieving this? I know how to program for Android (but would be happy if I can avoid having to create my own program just for this) and own Tasker. One option seems to use Google Cloud Messaging, anyone has any other suggestion? The problem with Matt Taibbi is not that he is biased (he is), the problem is that he has no idea about finance and very little understanding of economics. He just puts shit together to sound sensationalist, but most of the times he is just plain wrong, not even wrong because of bias, just wrong because of lack of knowledge. But since he writes well and in general people dont have understanding of finance neither, people eat it. Prueba a usar goxgui. ClackMoody casca rápido cuando mtgox se pone tonto. Sospecho que la culpa es de mtgox y no de clarckmoddy, porque la página funciona bien cuando mtgox no está cargado. Ha subido a 137 de golpe y ha vuelto a bajar a 123... Puto mtgox, que solucionen el lag ya. MtGox va con 1 minuto de retraso ya. MtGox no será la causa de la caida, pero con el retraso facilmente está provocando más pánico y más caida. El precio está bien que baje, pero lo de MtGox lo tienen que solucionar ya porque no es aceptable. Thanks, that helped. I had an typo in one of my import statements so the module refused to load. prof7bit, it would be better if the log signaled the particular error otherwise you are in the dark making it hard to debug. Basically this change:Code:            except ImportError as e:                self.gox.debug("### could not import %s.py, reason: %s" % (name,e)) Im hitting this problem again and now I just get a message saying:Code:2013-04-24 20:21:58,510:DEBUG:goxapi.Gox:### could not import mybot.pyThe program keeps running but without running the strategy obviously. And yes, the file mybot.py exists and is the right one. No other indication as to what might be happening. Any idea of what I could do to know where I got the code wrong? I almost did not want to answer for the embarasment. Yes, it was there. Thank you. Im writting a bot (Strategy class) and Im having the problem that goxtool sometimes will just quit leaving a grey screen with no error message, making it hard to debug where I have fucked up in the code. Sometimes the error will show but others it just completely kills the program with no explanation. Is there a way to find out what happen or a way to solve it so one can get a debug message? He said that we were a bunch of jack booted thugs... Lets act like a bunch of thugs to prove him wrong!Yeah... Bitcoin spending is at an old time high. macho (o macha) pillate un movil Android barato aunque sea. Yo iba hasta no hace demasiado con un symbian también y menudo cambio. Te lo recomiendo, y los chinos tienen moviles decentes muy baratos. Me lo miré hace poco así que si quieres algún consejo enviame un privado. Probably just extremely bored. I kind of understand conspiracy theorists. Sometimes Im so bored that I want to believe my neighbours are on to me and that when I meet them in the stairs is not a coincidence. The mind always plays tricks on us if we dont keep it entertained. But remember, while most conspiracy theories might be a complete fabrication, that you are paranoid does not mean they are not spying on you. La idea de Ripple es muy buena y además está basada en una idea probada ya en la historia de la humanidad (la experiencia siempre es un punto a favor), pero la implementación actual no es buena porque no es descentralizada. Lo que puedes hacer es guardar un screenshot de la clave (y qr code para mas comodidad), encriptado y offline. Asi si pierdes el movil, lo reflasheas, lo cambias o lo que sea re-scaneas el codigo de nuevo y funcionando de nuevo.Yo scanee el qr code de mtgox y el programa automaticamente lo hizo todo. Se que ahora no te da consuelo pero recordar a todo el mundo usar 'double factor authenticator'. Sí, y ni idea si caduca o no, pero no tiene porque caducar. Si son euros MtGox hace transferencias SEPA (creo).
Si, ha salido Bernanke en rueda de prensa explicando la operacion. Ive found that some people are politically against Bitcoin and therefore think its ok to say whatever they can to stop it. Estoy de acuerdo, esta la situacion indecisa. De momento lleva paseandose entre 110-120 desde la manana, pero en algun momento deberia saltar. Puedes enviar una transacción sin ninguna comisión, lo único es que entonces puede ser que pase un rato hasta que alguno minero la pille. Es decir, si no te corre prisa puedes enviar la transacción sin ningún tipo de comisión. En cambio si incluyes una pequeña comisión, está va al minero que incluye tu transacción en el blockchain y por lo tanto los mineros pillan tu transacción rápido y se aprueba mucho antes. Depende de lo que necesites.La historia es que algunos clientes, creo que Bitcoin-qt entre ellos pero no estoy seguro al 100%, incluye una transacción por defecto. Esto es una decisión de implementación del cliente particular, no implicito de Bitcoin.Se está desarrollando ahora mismo lo que se llaman "green addresses" que permitirán el envio más fácil de microtransacciones como la que tu quieres enviar. Pues eso, creeis que hemos tocado fondo ya o vamos a bajar de los 60$/btc que vimos ayer? Lo acabo de ver también. A ver si es verdad, porque lo de esta mañana ha sido de verguenza.Aunque ahora a mi mtgox.com no me va. Me sale caído. Nunca había usado algo que funcionara tan mal una y otra vez. Espero que al ingeniero en cargo le salgan un par de canas más por lo menos solo de la vergüenza. Con que limitara la cantidad de ordenes de menos de 0.1 bitcoins que un usuario puede poner seguro que se arreglaba bastante. MtGox goxeando otra vez, 111segundos de lag ahora mismo... Esto es un festival. Aparentemente Bitfloor también está bajo Ddos. Honestamente, no se quien está detras de los ataques (o si son una excusa de los exchanges solo) pero no se que cojones buscan. Al final lo que están consiguiendo es evitar el tradeo de bitcoins, el precio ya está extremadamente volátil. Alguien es capaz de entrar a MtGox? A mi me sale la página completamente saturada. La madre que los pario. Encima nada mas empezar seguro que se boquea otra vez y empieza el tiovivo. A que hora espanola abre MtGox? A mi me gustaria que bajara si tengo que ser honesto. Eso si, la reanudacion va a ser como minimo entretenida. Deberías ir al local este a pagar en bitcoins y decirle al tipo que habeis ido especificamente porque acepta bitcoins. Y buen trabajo de evangelización Flix. Esto es mas elaborado y largo de explicar.Primero, en los numerosos ejemplos de economias precio-deflacionarias que decia antes podemos ver periodos donde la inversion y el consumo crecen.Si que es cierto que una moneda inflacionaria, como son las monedas fiat, incentiva la 'inversion', pero inversion entre comillas porque en realidad lo que provoca no es un aumento de las oporunidades de inversion, sino una huida de la moneda hacia cualquier tipo de activo que se crea mas seguro, sin importar si eso desarrolla un proyecto que aporta valor. Es decir, por mucho que el numero oficial de inversion aumenta, si lo desglosamos veremos que ha habido un aumento de las 'inversiones' puramente especulativas. No es que haya nuevas tecnologias que se desarrollan sino que la gente huye de ahorrar en fiat y ahorra en todo tipo de activos. Por eso con las monedas inflacionarias vemos el crecimiento de sistemas financieros hipertrofiados, como el que tenemos ahora. Tambien produce un flujo de dinero de las clases bajas y medias con sus sueldos fijos solo ajustados anualmente impidiendoles huir de la inflacion, hacia las clases mas altas que pueden acceder a los mejores 'money managers' y enriquecerse aun mas de las manias especulativas (o perder por ser ricos pero tontos...).Aparte de tener en cuenta la productividad de lo que llamamos inversion, tienes que fijarte que cuando haya un aumento de los tipos de interes debido a que los precios esten bajando mas eso significara que la economia esta siendo muy prospera ya. Cuando la economia no lo sea tanto la moneda no se apreciara o no se apreciara tanto produciendo una bajada de los tipos.A todo esto le tendrias que anadir espectativas y otros factores tambien. Cuando reabra mtgox va a ser un festival no apto para cardiacos.Espero que en mtgox esten muertos de verguenza y esten arreglando el sistema de trading en serio, porque esto deja muy mal a Bitcoin de rebote. Alguien como el pobre carlengue que solo quiere comprar unos bitcoins no deberia tener que sufrir estas cosas. Vamos nadie deberia, pero los nuevos usuarios son los que se asustaran mas rapido.Y ami tb me falla todo. Yo diria que el trafico usual de mtgox esta saturando al resto. Hombre el error lo puedes ver de dos maneras.1. Mirando los numerosos ejemplos de economias precio-deflacionarias en la historia de la humanidad y viendo como han funcionado por decadas sin que el efecto que explicas se haya visto.2. El fallo de la exposicion teorica que haces es que no tienes en cuenta que la moneda se aprecia. Si en un momento determinado hay 600btc disponibles para credito, y pasado un tiempo la economia prospera, los precios bajan por el aumento de produccion y ahora siguen habiendo 600btc disponibles para credito, en realidad ahora hay mas credito que antes porque esos btc valen mas. Es decir 600btc en el momento A no es lo mismo que 600btc en el momento B. Obviamente hay otros factores que afectan a la demanda y oferta de credito pero los he supuesto constantes para la explicacion. Si me estas preguntando si creo en la ley de la oferta y la demanda, y especificamente si esta ley aplica a los mercados del dinero y el credito, la respuesta es si. Pero vamos que no es nada muy particular del modelo, sino algo bastante compartido.Y no crees que antes de aceptar un modelo y insinuar que otra gente esta en contra por mania personal a Keynes o por razones politicas deberias estudiar las criticas y ver si tienen algun merito? La que se va a liar. Creo que Bitstamp se ha saturado a consecuencia. Al menos a mi me sale una pagina diciendome que no pueden ofrecerme la version actual. No te he preguntado sobre las consecuencias de aceptar el modelo, te he preguntado si te ensenaron criticas al modelo.
Y por curiosidad, que criticas del modelo IS LM te enseñaron en la universidad (o has aprendido tú por tu cuenta)? Te podria hacer una critica razonada del modelo IS LM pero sospecho que no tienes ningun interes y apenas entiendes el modelo, solo lo usas para sonar molon.Y no estes tan enfadado con el mundo que la mayoria de nosotros no te hemos hecho nada. Relajate que viviras mas y mejor. Esta la cosa tonta porque Mtgox se satura cada vez que sopla el viento y se crean fuertes volatilidades, los bots se vuelven locos, etc... No te comas el tarro ni intentes tradear ahora esta imposible. Esperemos que Mtgox haga algo o a la gente se le hince las pelotas y se vayan a otro lado.Edit: Ahora mismo mtgox tiene un retraso de 8 mins... es una verguenza. Diferentes coches ofrecian ventajas sobre ford y se posicionaron en el mercado. Otra moneda puede ofrecer ventajas sobre bitcoin y posicionarse, aunque el mercado del dinero es dificil por el 'network effect'. Litecoin no ofrece ninguna ventaja sobre Bitcoin. Entiendes lo que digo ahora o solo quier que suene litecoin como sea? La razón no es otra que Litecoin no ofrece ninguna ventaja especial sobre Bitcoin, es una copia. Solo una moneda que ofrezca algo diferente podrá hacer competencia.Si él creyera que litecoin va a hacer algo solo tendría que usar unos pocos de esos bitcoins que tú dices que él tiene, comprar litecoins y forrarse. Si no lo hace es porque pensará lo que dice. Los bots como locos. Hace un momento había un spread de 15$ en MtGox...A ver si se ponen serios en MtGox y se calma la cosa porque esto es de locos. Para los "panic sellers" MtGox está funcionando otra vez.En bitstamp el precio había bajado hasta ~130usd mientras que en mtgox ha "reabierto" a ~150$ y en bitstamp está subiendo de golpe. No fiarse de conspiranoias. Lo que ha pasado desde ayer es una mezcla de corrección que ya tocaba y incompetencia de MtGox. Puede que haya alguna conspiración por en medio pero de momento no hay más que habladurías y nadie ha aportado ningún indicio solido. Por donde empezar...1. Por supuesto que el valor de Bitcoin es subjetivo, como lo es el valor de los euros, del oro, de la comida, ... de todo ya que todo valor es subjetivo. No entiendo porque dices que el valor de Bitcoin es subjetivo como si fuera un problema.2. De donde sacas que es todo especulacion y nadie compra nada? Bitpay anuncio hace unos dias un nuevo record de procesado de ventas, bitcoinstore vendio el equivalente a 350.000usd en 3 meses cuando acaba de abrir, silk road sigue vendiendo, satoshi dice, etc... tienes alguna evidencia que muestre lo que dices, porque todos los datos indican que el consumo en bitcoins no para de crecer.3 y lo mas importante: Todas, absolutamente todas las monedas de los gobiernos en la historia han colapsado. El 100%. Dada la evidencia historica la unica pregunta respecto al euro o el dolar es cuando colapsaran. Podrian pasar decadas pero sus respectivos gobiernos acabaran colapsando las monedas como ha hecho cada gobierno en la historia de la humanidad (si no estas convencido por favor nombrame una moneda gubernamental en la historia humana que no haya colapsado). Las regulaciones que nombra van dirigidas a dar el monopolio a la moneda del gobierno, y como todo monopolio abusar de su posicion, lo que eventualmente produce su colapso.Como ejemplo de una moneda privada puedes leer sobre las monedas privadas que surgieron durante el inicio de la revolucion industrial en Inglaterra. Tuvieron tanto exito que empezaron a hacerle la competencia a la del gobierno y este acabo embargando las empresas que las producian. Porque no? Las monedas de los gobiernos siempre han acabado colapsando sin excepcion. En cambio hay numerosos ejemplos de monedas privadas que funcionaron bien y solo desaparecieron por movimientos politicos. MtGox iba con 40 minutos de retraso en algún momento, imagina. Meter una orden ahí es casi como jugartelo en Satoshidice. Seguramente ha habido un ddos, porque bitcointalk.org (y otros forums), bitcoincharts.com y incluso un exchange en china se han venido abajo cuando ha empezado el lag en mtgox.No se que pueden hacer, pero deberían hacer algo para evitar este lag porque esto crea mucha deconfianza. I dont think it exists, but the central banks usually make the information quite available, at least the important ones. What they dont release is to who they give the money, but the amount they all do afaik. Porque ahi la suben los propios desarrolladores. Si estas mas paranoico puedes bajarete las fuentes y compilarlas tu mismo. As far as I know he is married to a woman, but Ill admit that he is so well manered and soft spoken that you wonder the first time. Give him a try, he is an amazing thinker. Well said Kludge.And I remember you from the first forum we met and I can corroborate the change in attitude you talk about. Bitcoin is contagious, when I make a payment with bitcoins it just feels right. No hace falta hacer el experimento. Hay numerosos ejemplos en la historia de prosperas economomias con monedas precio-deflacionarias.El economista citado en el articulo es un chartalista, con eso te lo digo todo. Im feeling generous so Ill buy his bitcoins for 20 a piece... The 'economist' cited is a chartalist. Go figure. You set up laws so people leave a big part of their savings in a goverment controlled system, but you promise they will be safe. Then when you need more money you just go and take it. The simplicity is brilliant.I really wonder if politicians are social geniouses or most people are just retarded. If tax laws where simple and short, how do you create loopholes?
Montar un exchange no es complicado ni requiere mucho capital comparado con otro tipo de empresas. Montar la pagina web es relativamente sencillo, lo unico que ha de ser muy segura y eso cuesta dinero si quieres que lo haga un profesional. Lo que requiere mas gestion son los metodos para que puedan enviar fiat al exchange. Y el principal problema es conseguir que haya liquidez, es decir conseguir que la gente lo use. Cuando empiezas como no hay gente no hay liquidez, y como no hay liquidez nadie viene a usarlo. Es dificil atraer a gente cuando en otros exchanges que ofrecen lo mismo que tu hay mucha mas liquidez. Es una de las principales razones por las que la gente sigue usando mtgox masivamente a pesar de los problemas que tiene.En los negocios la gente se encaparra con la parte tecnica cuando normalmente conseguir clientes es lo mas dificil. Si tienes clientes siempre vas a encontrar a alguien con los conocimientos tecnicos. Han dicho que ya estan testeando el sistema alternativo pero que no quieren sacarlo antes de tiempo y que traiga problemas. Asi que en principio deberia solucionarse pronto. Ataque DDoS a MtGox? Donde ha salido esa información? Yo pensaba sencillamente que se habían venido abajo ante la demanda.Por cierto, menudo lag en MtGox. Cada vez que hay lag el precio se vuelve loco. Sería lo suyo que lo arreglaran de una vez. Donde se puede usar Litecoin, que no sea un exchange? Estoy decepcionado. Voy por el minuto 45 y aun no he visto los efectos especiales. Democracy is not controlled by the people to start with, so he has a problem.But watching his movies and how historically inaccurate they are Im not surprised the least about his way of thinking. Para poder avisarte el cliente tendria que saber cuando has hecho el backup y no tiene forma de saberlo. Como he dicho anteriormente, enviar bitcoins usa una nueva direccion (recibirlos no). Por defecto son 50 direcciones, pero es configurable.Una vez alcanzado el limite lo unico que tienes que hacer es otro backup. La wallet siempre tiene 50 direcciones sin usar.Por cierto, enviar bitcoins y crear una nueva direccion usan una nueva direccion pero recibir bitcoins no, asi que no tiene que ser contado. De donde eres? Porque si eres espanol seguramente te costara mas la electricidad que consume que los bitcoins que saques. Has hecho los calculos? tBitcoinqt ahora (desde hace ya unas cuantas versiones) crea 50 direcciones antes de que las necesites y las va usando. Asi, un backup sera valido siempre que no hayas hecho mas de 50 transacciones que crean una nueva direccion. Basicamente, con hacer un backup cada 50 transacciones estas seguro. Thanks. That looks well enough mantained. Im looking for a framework/library to program a trading bot. Ideally Python but java or even C would be acceptable. Anyone can recommend any?Just to be clear, Im not looking for an already programmed bot or strategies. Im looking for a library that it will facilitate writting my own. El cash también está regulado y se calcula que en España la economía "sumergida" es un 30+% del PIB. Que regulen lo que quieran, de la forma en que está construido Bitcoin lo llevan fino. Saludos. Esta bien ver por aquí a un ex-burbujista.El potencial de Bitcoin es muy grande, pero también muy impredecible. En mi opinión va a llegar lejos, pero va a ser un camino largo y con muchas subidas y bajadas. Ahora estamos en momento de euforia y todo el mundo está super optimista, pero yo aún recuerdo cuando pegó el bajón desde los $30, la gente dejó de entrar en el foro, se comentaba menos, no aparecía en ningún medio de comunicación y si lo hacía eran analistos anunciando que Bitcoin había muerto, etc...Disfruta del viaje porque estamos haciendo historia, pero hay que ser consciente que van a haber vaches. Por que no creas una cartera nueva en blockchain y envías tus bitcoins desde tu vieja cartera en bitcoin-qt a tu nueva cartera en blockchain? El problema no es no querer quebrar. Nadie quiere quebrar, pero si estás en quiebra estás en quiebra por mucho que no quieras. El problema es que el gobierno regula el sistema bancario y crea oligopolios con mega-corporaciones bancarias que como quiebren se cae todo patas abajo. Si no hubieran regulaciones habría menos concentración bancaria y menos riesgo en sus operaciones con lo cual las quiebras se gestionarían naturalmente. Pero con los monstruos que ha creado el sistema regulatorio, como caiga alguno de los grandes se lía gorda. Y así acabamos pagando nosotros vía impuestos. No me jodas que esto va de la falacia de que se necesita aumentar la cantidad de dinero para pagar deuda porque sino no se pueden pagar los intereses? Pero si es una tontería que se desmonta con simples matemáticas... Si buscas un servidor de bajo consumo mejor pillate un cubieboard que al menos lleva un A10. El Allwinner A10 no es ninguna maravilla pero comparado con el chipset del rpi es un cohete. El chipset del rpi es muy muy lento, sale a cuenta 10 euros mas por un cubieboard, que ademas tiene SATA.Si estas dispuesto a gastarte un poco mas puedes empezar a mirarte cosas come los odroids que llevan un exynos 4412 (el quadcore que lleva el S3). Aun no. Fuentes fidedignas me han asegurado que estan acabando de pulir los efectos especiales.
Creo que no depende de ningún gobierno o recibe subvención gubernamental alguna, solo donaciones privadas. Está relacionado con los más liberales y ancaps de España. El test facilmente sale negativo si no estás de acuerdo con la plataforma del partido. No es un test pensado para que se diga sí a todo. Pruebalo. Llevan 1 mes editando el video. Cuando salga espero como minimo tenga efectos especiales. Hola, hola ... Just to confirm that everything went correctly. Vescudero was very profesional as scrow.I would highly recommend trading with Nexusakachus. While the bitcoins were on scrow there was the big surge on price, and because of it and without any obligation on his part he included an extra battery as a gift. The packets arrived with the appropiate content and on time. One of the power supplies did not work and I had to replace it myself (2 eur). When I communicated it to Nexusakachus he insisted on sending me a solar charger as compensation. He has been nothing but profesional and has showed that he cares about his costumers. Yo también intenté entrar en el de facebook pero me pedía una cuenta y yo no tengo de eso. Se estan colgando de lo lindo. Hace unos segundos estaba retrasado 30 segundos. Esta al limite Muy cierto Nubarius. Y para hacerlo todo aun mas entretenido MtGox esta al limite otra vez. Ahora mismo su motor de trading solo laguea 1 segundo pero lo he visto laguear 15seg hace 5 minutos. Como se empiece a unir gente a la fiesta se va a armar gorda y todo junto no es nada bueno para la credibilidad de Bitcoin. And who will force the miners to stay in the highjacked pools? El problema no es solo por el control que OpenCoin puede ejercer. Supongamos por un momento que en OpenCoin solo hay santos, esta implementación de Ripple tiene éxito y pasa a ser una alternativa real a las monedas fiat. El gobierno solo tiene que encontrar una excusa y cerrar OpenCoin para que Ripple deje de funcionar. El problema no es solo corrupción, tener un punto central es estar expuesto a ataques externos.Esto que expongo es exactamente lo que pasó con los "Liberty Dollars" cuando empezaron a tener éxito: http://www.libremercado.com/2011-04-18/el-creador-del-dolar-de-oro-y-plata-en-eeuu-es-condenado-y-tachado-de-terrorista-1276420819/ Ya, si lo que dices es correcto, pero en mi mensaje yo asumia que estamos viendo una burbuja en el precio de bitcoins, asi que solo se puede estabilizar despues de habersela pegado. La pregunta era si la burbuja va a petar o aun le queda espuma para subir mas. Obviamente eventualmente se estabilizara, pero despues de habersela pegado. Tambien puede alguien opinar que no hay burbuja claro. Refloto el hilo para pregungar si creeis que estamos viendo maximos o que una vez recuperada la confianza volveremos a ver fuerte subida? Desde la cagada de MtGox saturandoseles el motor de ordenes el precio vs USD ha estado algo estancado. Estamos viendo ahora por encima de los 48, pero no parece que tenga la fuerza de antes de la cagada y aunque en realidad no significa nada hay una gran muralla vendiendo en los 50. Son los 50 la barrera psicologica que lo tira todo abajo o vamos a seguir? Que creeis? If they had a warhouse in Europe I promise you I would be buying everything from them. I was looking at a new microwave oven and the price was fine but the problem is the shipping fees to Europe were as much as the microwave itself, thus doubling the price. I feel like the USA bitcoiners will have to take the slack on this one since the shop is obviously aimed at them. I hope the shop does well and we can get something similar in Europe soon. Yo compro bitcoins a 21 euros la pieza. Si quieres ganar un euro mas por bitcoin enviame un mensaje. Que hace un brasileño perdido en Barcelona en vez de disfrutar del calor de Brasil? Ojala lo hicieran. Lo unico que habria que hacer es empezar una nueva red Bitcoin. Y con todo lo que nos habriamos llevado de un gobierno comprando los bitcoins que tenemos ahora. Dejan de ser accesibles, así que se pierden. Basicamente nos haces más ricos al resto de los que tenemos bitcoins porque has reducido la cantidad de bitcoins disponibles, así que elimina tantos como quieras  .Bitcoin es pseudo-anónimo. Bitcoin NO es anónimo. Para ser anónimo con Bitcoin tienes que entender como funcionan y tomar una serie de precauciones. No es excesivamente complicado, pero tampoco es trivial.La manera en que funciona Bitcoin es que todas las transacciones son públicas, quedan almacenadas en el blockchain. Esto es así porque al ser un sistema descentralizado en p2p todo el mundo tiene que estar de acuerdo con las transacciones que se aceptan para evitar el "double spending" (que alguien use los mismos bitcoins dos o más veces). Así que todo el mundo puede ver todas las transacciones de la historia de Bitcoin. Te estarás preguntando que entonces como es posible ser anónimo si todo el mundo puede ver a quien le envias dinero. La clave es que lo único que se ve es como se mueve dinero de una dirección Bitcoin a otra, pero no necesariamente quien está en control de la dirección. Como se pueden crear tantas direcciones como se quieran es muy dificil saber a quien pertenece una dirección si la persona no lo hace público. Por ejemplo, cualquiera puede ver que se han enviado 3btc de ljsdlñf3049wdslkjf93fldskdjf a 349834lksdjflsgns09df3l3kj (obviamente ficticias). Si los propietarios de esas direcciones no dicen a nadie que ellos las controlan, como es posible saber quien ha enviado dinero a quien? La respuesta es que no es posible.Dos cosas a tener en cuenta:1) Cuando tú compras bitcoins en un exchange, obligan a identificarte porque estás interactuando con dinero fiat y las regulaciones son muy estrictas en ese sentido. Así que cuando retiras bitcoins de tu cuenta en un exchange a tú dirección privada, el gobierno podría llegar a saber que es tu cuenta privada porque puede forzar al exchange a revelar tu identidad (por orden judicial por ejemplo). Para solucionar esto, usa localbitcoins.com (con lo cual solo el particular con quien tratas sabe quien eres y probablemente ni se acordará en un par de meses), o si quieres estar totalmente seguro usa un mixer.2) Cuando emites una transacción, estás enviando un mensaje a la red Bitcoin. El mensaje que tú envías obviamente lleva tu IP. Es muy dificil saber cual es el origen inicial de una trasacción, pero no es imposible, y de hecho hay programas que lo intentan, así que para estar totalmente seguro deberías usar Bitcoin a través de TOR. Pero es importante tener en cuenta que usar Bitcoin a través de TOR solo evita que la gente sepa la IP de quien hace una transacción. Si de alguna otra manera alguien sabe que tú estás en control de una dirección, da igual que uses TOR, aunque no puedan identificar la IP de la transacción ya saben que tú controlas esa dirección y pueden seguir los movimientos de los bitcoins en esa dirección.En resumen, manten tus direcciones anónimas y usa TOR para esconder tu IP cuando emitas transacciones. Los bitcoins son legales, pero eso no significa que todo lo que hagas con bitcoins sea legal. Si alguien compra droga con euros o con bitcoins debería mirar que no se enterara la policía (tampoco les importa demasiado si compras en pocas cantidades, pero siempre es mejor ser precavido). Hahahaha I believe this.
Nope. If nobody finds a use for Bitcoin they will have no value, no matter the amount of electricity you spend on them.What something costs to produce determines if you are going to keep producing it and how much, so it affects the supply, but it has nothing to do with the value it has. You could spend all the electricity and effort you want on a turd, its still a turd.Bitcoin has value because it is usefull for people, not because electricity was spent on it. Silver is a metal. Bitcoin is electronic.Next. Según los datos en bitcoinity, antes de las 00:00 estaba por encima de 45. A la 1:00 tocó los 35. A las 3:00 tocó los 45, para desplomarse rapidamente hasta casi 35 otra vez y entonces empezar a subir lentamente hacia los 45 (44 donde estamos ahora para ser exactos).Sea lo que sea, lo importante es que la actividad de ayer por la noche fue producto del malfuncionamiento de MtGox y no de que la gente ya esté vendiendo más que comprando. Si el incidente va a afectar el estado de ánimo y va a producir un desplome está por ver. Yo sigo pensando que el desplome llegará en algún momento, pero ahora vamos camino de recuperar los 45 así que el anuncio del desplome parece precipitado. No estoy seguro de que haya sido un desplome real, sino más bien una cagada (otra más) de MtGox. Aparentemente durante esta noche (hora peninsular) el motor de trading the MtGox se saturó completamente y las ordenes tardaban varios minutos en ser ejecutadas, así que nadie sabía realmente donde estaba el precio ni cuando ni en que condiciones se iba a ejecutar las ordenes que entraban. Los traders y robots debían ir como locos. Por eso bajó a $35 y volvió a subir a $45 varias veces, hasta que se ha estabilizado por encima de los $40.Podría ser que esta cagada de MtGox generará desconfianza y sea la aguja que pincha el globo, o podría ser un blip antes de seguir subiendo. Creo que aún es pronto para opinar. The misallocation of resources will not go on forever.What matter is if he avoid the effects until the misallocation end.As someone said: I don't need to run faster of the lion. I need to run faster than YOU!!![/quote]Yes, but the lack of jobs affects everybody. The lack of optimal production and development affects everybody. He will not get the technological developments that would have been posible without government regulations. He will not get the cheaper prices that would have been posible without government regulations. He will not get a less desperate and more mentally sane society that would have been posible... etc... How the government discoordinates the market and throws away resources affects everybody.You can make the best of it since thats what you get, thats fine, but saying that it does not affect you is false. El precio está en estado maníaco. Veremos hasta donde llega. What does it matter that the dollars are on paper or electronic, they are still dollars and count the same. They are not imaginary, they are real, even if electronic. When the people says that Bernanke prints dollars, they dont mean that Bernanke goes down to the machine room, gets the paper into the printing machine and presses the on button. By printing money people mean that Bernanke increases the money supply and whether it is in paper or electronical form is irrelevant. If he really welcomes the competition, he should campaign for the removal of legal tender laws and the obligation of paying taxes with Federal Reserve dollars. Once all the regulations to favor the Federal Reserve dollars are gone, let the currencies compete and lets see what happens. So the misallocation of resources and its consequences does not affect you just because you dont use dollars? Political and solutions together? I dont really understand this concept. Is this like unicorns? Bitcoin no se comporta aún como una moneda muy establecida, por ejemplo durante un tiempo se correlacionó más con la bolsa que con el resto de divisas (no se ahora como hará). Hasta que no coja más tracción no puedes considerar a Bitcoin como una moneda establecida porque no lo es. Honestamente, en esta era de Internet y adem'as habiendo emitido el video en directo por internet, deberia haber estado disponible automaticamente despues de la charla. No se si estaran haciendo algun tipo de edicion o algo, porque sino no es normal. Puede ser, pero yo vengo de abajo, así que vender a $40 o a $35 no me hará entrar en perdidas. El último dólar que se lo lleve otro. Porque te los vendería a $10? Lo que yo estoy diciendo es que quiero venderlos cuando empiece a bajar, y recomprar cuando estén otra vez a $10. Si me los vendes a $10 ahora te los compro. Yo estoy esperando una caida grande para vender... Quien piense que esta subida va a durar para siempre está loco. Veremos una fuerte correción, aunque en mi opinión esta vez es posible que no baje de los $10. Hay mucha más actividad real que cuando el otro bajón. La moda hippie étnica bohemia alternativa no es lo mio, pero parece interesante. Le pasaré la referencia a un par de conocidos que podrían estar intersadas. Ok, basically what you are asking me is about the keynesian story about people putting their savings in the mattress when there is a crisis, what keynesians call the paradox of thrift. Hayek wrote about it in his article "The 'Paradox' of savings", but I dont think you can find it for free on the Internet.First, this does not address the situation proposed in the keynesian paradox of thrift but it is worth noting that an increase on the demand for more liquid assets is not necessarely bad. Let me give you a simple example: Imagine there are a bunch of people stranded in an island. They collect, hunt and fish to provide food for themselves. They have specicialized a bit and some people have been able to not work on getting food but on getting other materials and producing stuff like better housing. They keep food for 3 days always stored just in case. Suddenly, they see a big storm coming, and they decide to stop any other activity and get everybody on getting food. They also ration the food and start increasing the amount of food stored. From a macroeconomic point of view, consumption has gone down, investment has gone down, in general economic activity is down, and savings are up. A keynesian would say it is a crisis and you need to stimulate consumption. But the reality is that there is a very valid reason for what people are doing, and increasing consumption would deplete the food storage and could get the people killed if the storm last for long. This simple example is just to explain that there might be valid causes for a temporal shifts in the demand for liquid assets.But the paradox of thrift is about people increase savings during a crisis, not at any other moment. Keynes argued that it was a paradox because acording to neo-clasical economics the self-interest of individuals would always produce the best overall result. In a crisis, the uncertainty increases and therefore most individuals have an increased taste for more liquid assets and less for risky investments. The result of decreased consumption and increased savings would depress the economy even more, producing more uncertainty, which in turn would make more people look for liquid assets, ... and starting a self-reinforced cycle into depression. To break this cycle it is necessary that an authoritarian institution acts decisevely against what individuals want to do and start increasing consumption to break the cycle. Again, the issue with this story is that it only looks at macroeconomic indicators. The answer I already gave it to you earlier (it is worth noting that, because of its macroeconomic nature, this explanation completely overlooks the problems that caused the crisis in the first place, for example, it overlooks an excess investment in certain sectors like housing during the last bubble):So if you do not look at the relation between sectors and how the decrease in agregate production output is a result of a process of shifting the types of production, and only care about keeping an arbitrary amount of growth in the production output, then the keynesian explanation makes sense. The problem is that looking only at macroeconomic aggregates only and therefore arriving to the conclussion that keeping an arbitrary amount of growth in the total output is what the economy should be doing, you miss what it is really happening in the economy and what the economy should be really doing, providing to the people what they need/want.But what about the unemployed? We let them rot? No, but if we want to help them we need to know how to create employment, and for that we need to understand what really caused the crisis and the real mechanism that will solve it. And answering to your question: So why do economic recession last so long? Is it because everybody starts hiding money under the matress as Keynes said? No, the reality is that people hardly hide money in the matress during crisis, more like are really struggling to get along. The lack of liquidity during the Great Depression or during the years after the 2008 crash is real, but it does not come from people saving more as Keynes argued, it comes mainly from banks having to cut their lending activities due to being completely overextended. And because the banking system is a government created oligopolly around the central bank and its monopollistic currency, competition can not fill the void propperly. Its not coincidence that during the Great Depression there was a big increase in the use of alternative currencies. Banks are broke and the transmission from savings into investment (what banks do) is broken, cutting any opportunity of recovery.Keynesians argue that the solution should be the central bank saving them, and in extreme cases use the taxpayer directly. Austrians argue that they should go into bankruptcy to liquidate the bad debt and have new management re-build the sector with what can be savaged. You will discover that a lot of keynesian phalacies at the end what acomplish is shift the blame from the banks to the people and the mesures proposed under the excuse of helping the people in reality are geared towards helping the banking system. Jaja, muy cierto.EDIT: Dios mio con el artículo:Y el problema de base es?Hay gente que aún se toma en serio a Krugman? Las ordenes de venta son como las lagrimas de la planidera, aparecen y desaparecen segun convenga. Yo hice compras cuando estaban a 15eur pensando que estaban llegando al maximo tambi'en.
Con la versión 0.8 del cliente qt-bitcoin (el que descargas en bitcoin.org, recuerda que no hay cliente oficial) ya no se tarda tanto en descargar el blockchain. Antes la base de datos era muy ineficiente y la escritura en disco era muy lenta. Ahora la han cambiado y el único limitante es tu velocidad de internet (en casos normales, si tienes una velocidad de internet descomunal no disponible para usuarios particulares o pimes entonces teoricamente el disco duro podría volver a ser un limtante). El video se está haciendo de rogar. Diles que queremos ver ya a las estrellas del Bitcoin español en video. Define "irrational change in comsumption behavior".If Im understanding it correctly, let me advance you that from an austrian perspective "irrational change in consumption behavior" is not possible because, for austrians, consumers are kings and the objective of an economic system is to produce and supply what the consumer needs and/or wants. So when there is a mismatch between what consumers demand and what the production system is offering the "fault" is always on the production system, that needs to re-organize. What is the point on having a production system that produces stuff people dont need/want?Any kind of alternative, it depends on each particular change on consumer demand.If the problem is happening in the currency market, then alternative currencies can be an option, yes. The answer is yes, but in a free market it wont produce a crisis because enterepreneurs will use the oportunity to fill the market with alternatives.Its only in the regulated market that we live on that inefficiencies are kept around and produce long term harm.The problem in reality between keynesianism and austrianism is the way each theory looks at an economic system. Austrians see the economy as an ecosystem, a mix of complex and changing parts with complex and changing interactions between them. On the contrary, keynesians have a macroeconomic outlook over the economy, where they see it as a whole, as a car that can only go faster or slower (or even backwards), but dont bother to look inside and how each different part coordinates with the other.So in the keynesian model talking about coordination, about how different parts of the economy relate to each other, does not even make sense. Its all about total output, without looking about what type of output its being produced. For an austrian thats a completely insane oversimplification that can never capture how an economy works. Thats why it is so hard for a keynesian or basically any macroeconomic trained economist (most of them) to understand what an austrian is saying: what type of product? coordination between sectors? why are you looking at that, just look at total production! Its going down, we need to do something!!When the austrian replies that the reason is because there is a realignement of sectors and therefore the temporal decrease in production is good because its a sign that in the furute the economy will start producing the type of products people need/want and not the old type of products people did not want (excess housing for example), macroeconomic trained economist dont understand. They just dont: why are you looking at different sectors, we only care about total output! And its going down!And the discussion cycle goes on forever. Its up to you to decide if you think looking only at macroeconomic indicators is good enough to understand and make predictions about the economy, or if looking about how different parts of the economy interact with each other and the coordination they achieve is needed and will give you a better chance at understanding and predicting the economy. Youtube dice que el video es privado. A ti no? Otro que también quiere ver el video. Sí y no.1. No son los mineros los que deciden, es cualquiera que tenga un nodo. Lo que sí es cierto es que los mineros tendrán más peso a la hora de influir al resto porque una red con más potencia de mineo es una red más segura. Pero cualquiera que corre un nodo certifica las transacciones.2. No dependes de la dictadura de la mayoría. Es un libre mercado. Si, por ejemlo, un 70% de la gente decide adoptar un protocolo determinado, el restante 30% puede adoptar otro y las dos redes funcionarían en paralelo compitiendo una moneda con la otra. Si el 30% tenía razón y su protocolo es más eficaz de una manera notable, se acabará imponiendo (o incluso podrían co-existir los dos, de la misma manera que el oro y la plata han co-existido como dinero muchas veces). Freicoin no está basado precisamente en promocionar la inflación como el ejemplo que yo propongo sino en obtener un interés 0. Pero sí, es un ejemplo de una diferente implementación.El problema particular de Freicoin son las teorías economicas en las que se basa que son erroneas. Discutí un tiempo con uno de sus principales proponentes aquí en el foro español pero fue un poco inútil. Si un fork es una de las razones por las que vas a abandonar el uso de Bitcoin deberias haberlo abandonado ya. Bitcoin ya ha sufrido un fork, aunque en realidad todo el mundo adopto las nuevas reglas y abandono las antiguas, asi que no hubo dos lineas, solo una. Es cierto que la razon del fork fue que habia un bug en la implementacion y si no se solucionaba la red estaba en peligro, pero por las causas que sean, hubo un cambio en las reglas de Bitcoin. Y aqui seguimos.De la manera que lo estan gestionando los desarrolladores yo creo que volvera a suceder de manera parecida, todo el mundo o casi adoptando las nuevas reglas.Lo que tu ves como una desventaja yo lo veo como una ventaja. La capacidad de Bitcoin de actualizarse es muy positiva. Imaginate que alguien tiene una muy buena idea y Bitcoin no pudiera actualizarse, o que saliera un bug importante y no pudiera actualizarse... Entiendo y hasta cierto punto incluso comparto la preocupacion por lo que pudiera pasar si un grupo de demagogos convence a un buen cacho de mineros y usuarios para que adopten diferentes reglas que comprometan seriamente el concepto Bitcoin, como por ejemplo no respetar el limite de 21 millones de Bitcoin y "imprimir" mas moneda. Pero en realidad incluso esa posibilidad es algo positivo. No hay que tener miedo a la competencia, si un grupo de personas decide crear un fork de Bitcoin, llamando por ejemplo Inflacoin donde producen mas y mas inflacoins, habria competencia entre las dos monedas y veriamos cual es la mejor solucion. Yo estoy seguro que Inflacoin no es una buena solucion, pero la gente tiene derecho a probarlo. Como he dicho, la competencia es saludable y no hay que tenerle miedo. Nuevas empresas y nuevas soluciones es algo que pasa constantemente en los diferentes mercados, y tambien deberia suceder en el mercado del dinero. Pero como nosotros hemos vivido siempre en un monopolio de la moneda, nos cuesta de imaginar, incluso cuando lo mismo lo vemos totalmente normal en otros sectores. Si tu (como yo) estas seguro de que Inflacoin es una mala solucion, no deberias tener miedo de que alguien lo pruebe. Además las version 0.8 que acaba de salir carga mucho más rápido. A mi cuando alguien me dice algo asi, le respondo que precisamente la ventaja de Bitcoin y la razon por la que triunfara es que no esta respaldada por un gobierno. Si Bitcoin estuviera respaldado por un gobierno yo no confiaria (ni borracho) en la moneda. Ojala se desplome. Cuanto mas tiempo tenga para comprar bitcoins baratos mejor. Same here. Since this are packages for Ubuntu it would be expected by a normal user to behave correctcly with its default DE. Jo era bastant actiu al forum al principi, pero fa un bon temps que estic una mica desconectat. Catalans n'hi han, ja ho has vist, no se quants.Salut Quan tu vulguis.Jo estic al costat de Barcelona, i suposo que on hi haurà més gent que hagi sentit parlar de Bitcoin tb serà a Barcelona més que res per una questió de numeros. No conspiracy. Bill Still is a wacko. And you dont need his opinions on Bitcoin for that. Just read what he says about economics and you will realize. Muy cierto, los impuestos sobre revalorización del oro y plata (y cualquier otra "comodity" que se quiera usar como dinero) es un factor importante que no había nombrado.Bueno, en general cuando se habla de usar oro, normalmente se entiende que se refiere a un sistema de certificados de oro, porque como tu dices el oro físico es incomodo para transacciones diarias. Por eso decía que todos los sistemas basados en el oro necesitan un punto centralizado, el amacen de oro. El oro físico en sí es también descentralizado, pero es impractico. La historia de minear es sobretodo el coste de la electricidad y en España no salimos muy bien parados.Al final el coste inicial es el mismo para todo el mundo, pero el principal gasto del día a día es la electricidad que consumen. Si instalas ASICS en España tienes que competir con gente en USA u otros sitios que puede tener la electricidad a un tercio de lo que tu pagas. No se puede competir con eso. A ellos les va a seguir saliendo a cuenta mantener ASICS encendidos y incluso añadir más ASICS cuando tú te verás forzado a cerrarlos. Hay que pensar que la minería es una industría Bitcoin con una barrera de entrada no demasiado importante y que por tanto la competencia va a empujar el beneficio hacia cero relativamente rápido. Si tú pagas el triple de gastos diarios se te van a comer con patatas, hablando claro.Si realmente quieres meterte en minería las únicas dos opciones realistas que tienes son: 1. Trasladarte a un país con electricidad barata. 2. Contratar espacio a una de esas personas que organiza centros de mineraría y tiene buenas tarifas eléctricas. Hace tiempo Vladimir de este foro organizó un negocio así, pero no se que opciones parecidas hay ahora. Los gobiernos han trabajado durantemente y por muchos años para transicionar desde estandares oro de libre mercado hasta los actuales sistemas de papel fiat. Cuando el gobierno impone leyes para promocionar su moneda por encima de otras, incluso cerrando intentos de competencia con malas excusas, es normal que acabe imponiendose.La diferencia con Bitcoin es que es un sistema descentralizado. Cuando han habido intentos de establecer competición de monedas con monedas basadas en oro los gobiernos han encontrado excusas para cerrarlos, como ya he dicho. Por ejemplo: http://www.libremercado.com/2011-04-18/el-creador-del-dolar-de-oro-y-plata-en-eeuu-es-condenado-y-tachado-de-terrorista-1276420819/ Y la razón por la que han podido cerrarlos es que con certificados de oro necesitas un punto centralizado, alguien que almacene el oro. Bitcoin no tiene un punto centralizado que pueden cerrar. Por eso tiene tanto potencial.La innovación tecnológica que es el blockchain se les escapa a alguna gente al principio, pero cuando te das cuenta de lo que hizo Satoshi (o la persona o grupo detrás del pseudónimo) no puedes más que asombrarte. Bitcoin es el primer sistema monetario totalmente descentralizado en la historia de la humanidad. Parate un momento y piensalo. Estamos viviendo un momento increible en la historia. A veces es fácil perderse en las batallas diarias y no ver "the big picture" que dicen por ahí.PS: Lo del patrón deuda no es realmente patrón deuda, la deuda es ficticia, solo un truco contable, pero eso sería otra discusión para otro momento. Creo que el problema viene de la teoría de valor. El valor es subjetivo. No hay valor fundamental o inherente o como se le quiera llamar.El problema que intentas plantear desaparece cuando te das cuenta de que el valor es subjetivo. Da igual que algo sea una pedrusco, un edificio o un bien electrónico. Lo que le confiere valor a todo es la valoración subjetiva de cada persona.Imagínate que quitas la capacidad de ser comido a una bistec, es decir, el bistec es una "cosa" que tú la compras y ya está.
El precio es un indicador del valor. El valor esta en la cabeza de cada uno, pero el precio indica el valor relativo que una persona asigno en un momento determinado. Entonces el oro es un esquema ponzi también? Y invertir en petroleo es un esquema ponzi tb? Y en algodón, y en maiz... etc... Basicamente según tu nueva definición todo aquello que no sea un certificado y pueda revalorarse es ponzi.Si te puedo ser honesto, no le veo yo muy sentido a esta definición. Bitcoin no es una estafa piramidal porque no encaja en la definicion de estafa piramidal. Solo un ignorante llamaria a Bitcoin estafa piramidal.Una estafa piramidal garantiza (normalmente bajo contrato) unos intereses. Bitcoin no garantiza nada. Si cambias la definicion para incluir a Bitcoin entonces toda inversion es una estafa piramidal y incluso muchas actividades de nuestra vida diaria podrian serlo.La vida es incierta y los que toman riesgos estan poniendose en situacion de perder mucho o ganar mucho. Es muy facil no arriesgarse, esperar a ver la experiencia de la gente que toma riesgos, entonces apostar a caballo ganador y quejarse de que una parte de los que tomo riesgos ha conseguido mas beneficio que tu que decidiste esperarte a ver que pasaba (y sin tener en cuenta los que tomaron riesgos y perdieron). Is this supposed to be good or bad? Is there any place to read about the technicallities of Ripple?Im specially curious about how they avoid double spending if it is a trully p2p network. The Federal Reserve has different partsThe Board of Governors (Bernanke and the rest of the gang) is a federal government agency (100% government). They take most of the decissions regarding monetary policy.The FOMC, formed by the 7 members of the BoG and 5 presidents from the local feds. It takes decissions about Open Market operations.The local Feds, this are semi government semi private. They have shares, but they can not be sold or bought, and the government, both federal and local, have members in the board. They dont take decissions regarding monetary policy, they execute the orders given by the BoG and FOMC.Check any reliable source and youll see this is how the Fed works and that is not correct to say its a private entity. The Fed has a special status (this is not unusual, there are certain sections of government with special status).Btw, the government never represents the people. It should not but in western culture public usually means government backed or controlled. Bitcoin is neither.It is public in the sense that anyone can participate, its private in the sense that its not government backed or controlled. The Federal Reserve is mainly a government agency (and the parts that take decissions are government agencies). Its a shame that the anti-Fed movement as important as it is makes basic mistakes like this because it takes away credibility and reinforces the Fed. Bitcoin is a private currency.I think you meant a corporate backed currency. I recently tried version 5 coming from version 3 and I want to congratulate whoever made the client eat a lot less RAM. Big improvement. Thats supposed to be Ron Paul (the video producer said so). MyBitcoin was a great example. People were so used to only be robbed by institutionalized traders, and not by small pot ones, that blindly trusted some wallet. Then disaster ensued. Happy Satoshi Nakamoto day! According to the merchants when the price of Bitcoin was increasing, meaning that prices were deflationary in bitcoins, the sales were increasing. When the price of bitcoins came down, therefore prices in bitcoins were inflationary sales were going down. So in past experience what we have seen is deflation = increase of sales, inflation = decrease of sales.My guess is that people were taking advantage the increasing purchasing power of Bitcoin. Well see how it goes in the future. If I understand correctly the core of the discussion is some people are worried about the "spontaneous centralization" of some Bitcoin related systems, while others are saying that since its not a violently imposed centralization but a result of the technical and sociological circumstances of Bitcoin it is ok.In my view, both groups are correct. The level of centralization that we are seeing will never be as bad and worrying as a violently imposed centralized system (like fiat currencies, etc...). But keeping in mind that it will never be as bad, it would not hurt to look for technical solutions to have more descentralization that can bring some benefits in the future. Bitcoin can be considered also the name of the technology. In any case is just semantics. You are playing with words.A system of free exchange by people (a free market) creates the right incentives to produce innovation. In turn, specific innovation can change particular markets or even create new particular ones. Note the difference between the idea of a system of free exchange in general (a free market) and the idea of a particular type of production (a particular market).Therefore a free market produces innovation and innovation changes or creates particular markets.And answerign to the first part of your post:Its clear that not all incentives to produce a product are strictly monetary. That does not mean they are not part of the incentives present in a free exchange system between people. A lot of people (a big majority) that develop FOSS do it for monetary reasons. But there are other motivations as well. So? From the article:What a bunch of bollocks. There are laws to prevent the creation of federal reserve notes (if you are not the government of course), it would be counterfitting. There is absolutely no law preventing the creation of private currencies.That is an article pretending to be a serious analisis of Bitcoin legality? I stopped reading there. If they really though this they would not pay any attention to Bitcoin. Its because they believe it can take off that they are so obsessed.
How are they supposed to know you are a US based player, specially if you pay with bitcoins? Proxies are cheap. I think that is what they are really aiming at. Default leverage. Thats a little secret of democracy, it should be called burocracy in reality. Thanks, I corrected that. Honestly, all this titles of american newspaper names sound the same to me. How many Something Times and Something Post do you guys have? The conclussion of the article:Wonder what he is talking about The whole article is worth the read: http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=13798 Markets do not behave linearly. You are supposing that an increase of the money supply of 1% should make the price go down by 1%. This is not true. In the very long run tends to be a direct correlation between the money supply and prices, but the relation does not hold in the middle and short term. You can see this for example when central banks intervene in the currency market, the decrease in price when they sell their currency does not correspond to the increase in the money supply they produce.The reason is again basic economics. The more you have of something the less you value having one more. An stupid example, if you go traveling 15 days and loose all your shoes, you will be willing to pay a very high price to get 1 (or even 2) pairs of shoes, so you can go around. But to get your third, fourth,... pair you wont buy unless the price is lower and you consider its a good deal. This economic law has a name that I dont remember now.Some people want to have a bunch of bitcoins but the more they have the less willing to pay a higher price they are. Its different for each person and more importantly it does not have to be linear, very probably its not linear. So once you start increasing the money supply, the price does not react linearly.I actually think its the other way around. Its a good thing the price is so low. There was people complaining about the deflationary nature of Bitcoin saying that it was a way for early adopters to profit since only a few people knew about Bitcoin back then. Well, now Bitcoin is famous and its cheap, so anyone willing can jump in. Its the distribution phase of Bitcoin.Btw, I agree with the part of the fiat currency imploding right now. Ive had a couple of email back and forth with the writter trying to make him see that a monetary inflation of 30% might have "something" to do with the decline in price. He seems like an nice and educated fellow. We'll see in the future how he reports about Bitcoin. I have to thank BubbleBoy for providing another example of what I said (sometimes trollas are useful). A bubble builds slow and collapses fast, exactly the opposite of what Bitcoin has done. Then is a missunderstanding. Im not saying all the supply is only the 7200 bicoins/day that are being created. What I am saying is that they are having a huge impact, I am pointing at it as the main reason of the decline. But of course there are other sources of supply. I dont see how you can deny that supply is overpowering demand. Since the price is going down its obvious that supply is overpowering demand, its basic economics. You could argue about the reasons why supply is overpowering demand, but not that is happening. Yes, but nobody is denying it. I guess you are aware that even the defenders of Elliot Waves admit that there are market movements that do not follow and Elliot Wave pattern and it only works sometimes.You are the one incorrect. There is not direct correlation between monetary inflation and price inflation since it has to go through the subjective valuation of the people, that also responds to other issues. A 1% increase in monetary inflation will not produce an automatic increase of 1% in the price and viceversa. Ive been quite inactive in the forums lately but the horrible reporting Ive seen lately has pushed me to post this. Bad reporting is nothing new for Bitcoin. I have not seen worse reporting in my life than with Bitcoin, but the last articles deserve an answer.First, it should be clear to anyone that Bitcoin was not and is not a bubble. Its not a bubble bursting or at least it shows very little of a bubble pattern.A bubble happens because investors missjudge an asset (or group of assets) and overinvest in it. The reason for this are bad signals by wrong monetary policy usually coupled with fiscal policy and press hype. Some economists blame "psicology" but thats like saying nothing, since everything humans does is due to "phisicologic causes".When everybody sees that the investments are not performing there is a panic and the price collapses as investors try to get rid of the assets as quick as the can. Thats why we see this patter: "slow" build up and "quick" collapse. For example, the housing bubble:With Bitcoin we have seen the opposite pattern, a "quick" build up and a "slow" downturn:You can see the decline has been steady. Even after the MyBitcoin "situation" the price recovered quickly showing there was confidence in the currency. Maybe the collapse from $30 to $20 can be asigned to a bubble pattern, as you can see in the graph. The rest of the decline does not follow a bubble pattern. The reason is very simple and I really dont understand why the press does not mention it.Bitcoin monetary inflation is huge, as Bitcoin is in distribution phase. Bitcoin monetary inflation is around 30%. That is huge. And the pattern of the steady decline shows that this huge supply is overpowering demand. Its that simple.This is how it was designed and it will change in a year when the Bitcoin monetary creation halves. Good question (for once) and even better answer.People dont realize that bubbles are destructive because resources are used in a bad way and are squandered. In this sense there is no difference on burning resources for nothing, destroying them in a war or using them to produce something people dont need (f.e. excessive housing). But because bubbles produce an increase in GDP some economist argue that the economy is growing, when in reality the increase in GDP is not real economic growth, just the result of economic activity that squanders resources.People is poorer because part of what was produced was not what people needed. Less useful production = we are poorer. The ECB is governed (and owned if it applies) by the UE country members, so your answer is the same as before.And the Fed is not private. It has some private component but it is almost anecdotical. Its controlled by the government. Its not me, even he admited his prediction failed. He was predicting a deflationary collapse that did not happen. Yes there was movement in the stock market and commodities that they recovered "quickly" and the CPI hardly touched the negative. If the government had not done anything it would have happened as he predicted. But a lot of people told him how governments would react and he ignored it. I dont really know why he only looks at the credit part while ignoring the rest.His theory of credit is great to know because it describes the present system correctly, but thats it. I dont have sources but its my understanding that the majority of the european central bank belong to their governments. I know for sure the spanish central bank belongs to the spanish government. Yes, the facts are clear and we agree.The issue is what are the effects of such contraction of credit and if it is good or bad that it happens. To some degree its "good" or at least necessary that happens because its the effect of removing bad business out of existance. If you dont allow that process to happen you will only prolong the depression.Steve Keen has a very interesting theory of credit and everybody should read it. In fact, I learned about it reading him. Its the same theory of credit that chartalist have adopted.But he fails big time on the rest. The proof is that he was predicting big deflation and it has not happened. When asked why his predictions failed he answered that we have seen an unsual government reaction that has avoided the deflationary collapse. The problem is that he knows its just an excuse, that the reaction of governments is not unusual and that a lot of economists had told him thats exactly what governments would do, because its what they do everytime a bubble pops. I dont understand why he takes so much care to understand one side of the monetary system (the relation between the banks and the central bank) but likes to ignore the other part (the relation between the government and the central bank). I really dont understand why he does that.Also, the use of aggregates and in general the heritage from keynesian economics hurts him as well. No. The relation between economic prosperity and prices is way more complicated than that. Some economist like to make easy relations based on short periods of history, but they are just wrong.You can find in history periods of deflation and economic prosperity, deflation and crisis, inflation and economic prosperity (although you might have a lot of problems trying to find this ones, becuase they are usually bubbled times, not real economic prosperity) and inflation and crisis (called stagflation). Btw, even the people at the Fed are admiting that price inflation is starting to get out of control: http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2011/2011-20.cfm
What better way for banks and governments to deleverage through inflation that the citizens pay? Why would Bernanke engineer something that goes against the interests of the people that put him where he is? This video is long and amazing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gguwuIiDYk He wants to leave abortion and evolution to the states, but I think he admits that the constitution grants separation of church and state and therefore supports it at a federal level. As a religious person, Ron Paul argues that separation of church and state is good for religion because allows for anyone to express their religious believes without fear of state prosecution. Yes. The price can easily go down the production costs. It just wont. I support the protests, but to be fair, they are just some hundreds. And for the size of the protest they are receiving a lot of media attention, a lot more than other bigger protests. Sorry for the late answer, dont have too much time lately:Yes, some areas are suffering but not all. Its the problem at looking at unemployment as a big agregate, you miss what its really happening. F.e. a construction worker is not competition for a google engineer. So when it comes to negotiate the salary for the google engineer the fact that there are a bunch of construction workers unemployed doesnt make any difference.The way it happened is that the people closer to the money supply saw their wages up sooner. Those people are the ones working on the financial industry, whose wages are recovering and going up in the middle of a depression. Then we are seeing the high skilled workers demanding higher wages, for example engineers of Google and Microsoft: Goolge war for talent rises wages 10% (2010), Microsoft raises wages to attrack talent (2011). But the central bank money is getting to specialized workers (not necesarely high skilled workers): Truck companies see a 30% wage increaseAccording to keynesians that should not be happening, but it is. The problem is that the idea that because unemployment is high wages can not go up is utter bullshit. Not all workers are interchangeable, not all unemployed workers are competition for working workers. As I said, that a bunch of construction workers are unemployed is not competition for a Google engineer. Its the problem of looking at aggregates and not at reality.For a better explanation I recomend this short article of proffesor Steve Horwitz: http://www.pbs.org/nbr/blog/2010/08/idle_resources_-_they_dont_sto.htmlThe sad part is that some areas, mainly of low skilled labour, are not going to see their wages rised because anyone is competition for them, while the rest are going to see their wages rised and prices are going to follow. So the less skilled workers, usually the poorest, are the ones who are going to suffer inflation most. As always, inflation works to increase the wealth inequality.Fair enough. Let me show you why they do:Yes, but the choice is not between deflation or hyperinflation. Some people argue that we are going to see a lost decade of near 0 inflation/deflation ala Japan lost decade, some others (like me) argue that we are going to have stagflation (high inflation and high unemployment) ala the 70's.What the governments/banking system are trying to achieve is high inflation but controlled. Granted this is not guranteed, there could be a panic and they could loose control and go into hyperinflation. While its always a risk my opinion is that they will pull it off and we will get high inflation for many years, while the unemployment wont fully recover.Bernanke has lost control over interest rates and raising them significantly (ala 20% Volcker beggining of 80's) would be a disaster with the governments and banks going broke. Thats why after the crash of 2008 Bernanke got permission from Congress to start paying interest on excess reserves. This had never happened in the history of the USA (or any other central bank that I know). What does Bernanke achieve paying interest on excess reserves? It controls the flow at which banks grant credit to the private sector. If Bernanke thinks too much credit is being emited and inflation is getting out of control he just have to raise the interest of the excess reserves and banks will decide to leave more funds at the Fed instead of loaning them out, because its risk-less. There are other tools Bernanke can use but thats the main tool that he will use to control the flow of credit into the economy to produce high inflation and avoid hyperinflation. The risk of hyperinflation is always present, but Im pretty convinced he will succeed and the western economies (the ECB will follow the Fed) will go through years of stagflation.Conclussion: If deflation gains traction Bernanke can monetize government debt (like it has done until now and has avoid any kind of price deflation). If inflation starts getting out of control it has tools to control it (not avoid it). Three things:1. Stagflation: There is not going to be growth (real growth, GDP could improve) and meaningful reduction of unemployment, while at the same time prices are going to go up. Keynesians are still in denial about stagflation. They keep repeating that salaries can not go up as long as unemployment is high, and therefore prices can not go up either. This is utter bullshit, salaries and prices are already going up while unemployment is high and it will accelerate. If anyone is interested I can go into more detail why.2. Banks want prices to go up. People keep saying that they want prices to go down so they can buy everything on the cheap. It this were the case they would have already done it. Banks have what they want and are in the bussiness of debt, not running bussiness. Why do banks need prices to go up? Because otherwise they go broke. The banks have a lot of underlying assets for the loans they gave. Those assets have plummeted in price and they are technically broke. Thats why one of the first mesures of the USA gov was to remove mark to market. Banks have assets on their balance sheet marked to inflated prices because otherwise they can not meet the reqired ratios. They need those assets to regain their previous prices so they can go back to normal. Its important to understand that if prices of those assests dont go up banks will eventually have to admit they are broke because they are blocking the credit system. And its important to understand that those prices were inflated and wont be inflated again, so they need the whole price level to rise a lot.3. "The Fed is out of bullets" Everytime I hear this I ask a question and never get an answer: Whats stopping the Fed from monetizing more government debt? (apart from the fear of producing hyperinflation). A private association is not a government. If you can stop being part of a "system" is not a government.If a private association decides to have a "democratic" governance thats fine. If you dont like it you can leave and join another one more of your liking, creating a new one or even go alone. In a democracy you have to obey the rules imposed by the people that can manipulate the masses. You can not  choose to be part of the system or associate in a different way with other people you choose. This second case is evil and the one I oppose. If a private association wants to govern themselves as a "democracy" I have no problem.Was that more understandable? Yes. Usually "safer" assets like gold and gov bonds were (more or less) correlated and at the same time inversely correlated to "riskier" assets like stocks. But now everything is almost inversely correlated to the dollar and derivated assets. Its because the market is speculating on the survival of the dollar, and anything else serves as a way to scape the dollar.Btw, the mainstream media has not commented on this piece of news: The Russian central bank has started to offer gold backed loans: http://af.reuters.com/article/metalsNews/idAFL5E7JQ0Q020110826For the people that believe that the government is going to let deflation happen, I really want to know: why? why would they want to let deflation happen and force them to default when they can monetize the debt and keep spending? Also, letting deflation happen would bankrupt the banks and until now politicians have done everything in their hands for the survivial of the big banks. Why would the government let their own default happen and let the big banks go broke when they can avoid it by monetizing debt? I dont understand the deflationist position.EDIT: Im talking mid and long term. I have stated before that we are going to see a lot of volatitility in the next years with recurrent deflationary mini-crashes like the present one. But the trend is inflationary. It worked well in Zimbawe. Bitcoin is not a government. You can stop using it if you want to. "Democratic" voluntary associations are fine. The problem is democratic governments, where you are forced to do what the majority decides whether you like it or not. FirstAscent stop the crap. You just want to get to power because you are a sociopath that want to mandate the lives of other people and profit from it. All the goody goody language does not fool anyone. Wacko videos. The producer has even admited that Money Master is full of historic inaccuracies. Hahahahaha. Honestly, if gold does not correct more, with the one that is coming down right now, its a very bullish sign. Gold is still up a lot from a year ago. Its normal to have a correction.Also, I have not seen mentioned tha the gold and silver margins were rised 21% (http://www.tradingnrg.com/gold-silver-prices-cme-margin-hike-by-21-september-24-2011/) forcing a lot of people to recapitalize or remove some positions. 21% is  a lot! Its very "curious" that they have choosen to do so just as the next deflationary mini-crash was starting. With the know history of the USA gov to try to keep the price of gold (and silver) down to help the survival of the dollar, it is "like" if they want to create a psicological effect to try to beat down gold and silver prices.Mid and long term Im bullish on gold. Because "state socialism" does not work, its just a scheme to get power by a few, and it has to cut back regularly to avoid collapse. States right is not my ideal system. Im an anarchist. In the imaginary situation were I could decide the system I would not choose a system with states rights.Now, given the present situation I think states rights is a good move in the right direction. The more local and close to the citizens the power is, the better. If I could I would support city rights.[Slavery issue]Ive left this apart because its always used not as a real argument, but just to emotionally influence the discussion.First, Lincoln was a racist and had no intention of ending slavery during his presidency. It is true that Lincoln did not support slavery, but he was racist, considered the black people inferior and actually wanted to deport them back to Africa. Also, there are letters he sent to the south asking them not to secede and assuring them that they could keep their slaves, that it was not an issue. He did not go to war to stop slavery.Actually, states rights were initially used to attack slavery and the anti-states right people tried to get ride of them to be able to enforce slavery all over the country.People is not perfect and some groups might do some questionable stuff, but having local power and close to the people always stops more abuses and produces overall better results. I think the same. Democracy could only work in very reduced circles and with some restraints.When you start adding too many people democracy, any kind, just becomes a circus of manipulation and demagoguery. All the talk about democracy being the voice of the people and all the rest is bullshit. There is no perfect information and there are too many issues for everybody to be informed. Democracy is just government by manipulation of the masses. I dont think you understand the libertarian position.Very true. This is one of the core believes of libertarianism. But I dont see how this is related to what she said.Somalia is not under complete anarchy, only parts, but regardless I dont understand the point you are trying to make.Again, the point being? 
Ok, Ill bite:Yes, Ron Paul is a doctor with an anti-abortion history. Is no mistery to anyone even if I disagree with him. But he actually wants to get the federal government out of abortions and let the states decide.He has changed his mind in this one. Check the last republican debate.This one and the death penalty are two of the big changes Ron Paul has had during his carreer.This is a law defending states rights, not what you are insinuating.+1+1I did not know about this one and Im curious about what he has to say.Ron Paul always votes against any federal funding that is outside of the constitution. Whats extrange about this one?+1 to abolishing the Federal Reserve.The link to the gold standard one does not work, but Ron Paul favours competing currencies and has introduced numerous legislation in this regard.+1 to peacefully trading with everybody and not favouring american imperialism around the world.This vote has a lot of merit since all the democrats that get their mouths full of peace and goody feelings voted in favour and only a republican had the balls to vote against.Yes, he is religious and makes no intention of hiding it.Wow, this is a lie and a big one.He has stated publicy numerous times that he is in favour of allowing people to join together and call it however they like. The article is not against gay marriage and does not oppose gay marriage at any point. Again, the article is about states rights.This lie says a lot about the person or organization that compiled this list (and anyone that reproduces it). A lot of republican representatives have spoken openly against gay marriage and its an issue that can take votes away from you if you are a republican, yet Ron Paul has splken in favour. In spite of this, someone tries to lie and make it look the contrary. This is the perfect example of how this list is not about issues or caring for the gays, but about attacking Ron Paul no matter if truth or lie.Very well written article that everybody should read about the dangers of pure democracy.+1False, read the article.Id like to hear the rationale for this one.He is commenting on first Bush president own words about the "New World Order". Mind control is not mentioned once. The link is about Ron Paul disagreeing with the political agenda of the UNESCO.I wonder why the need to lie about Ron Paul positions. Everytime someone gets close to the Federal Reserve and teh banking system all this bullshit starts to come out. I know what you are trying to say: MysteriousMan is a metaphore for the government! Wow, where did the anomisity came from?There is a big debate about this issue, because the progressive liberals have always wanted to portray the USA system as a democracy, while in reality the founding fathers always were very wary of democracy and wanted to have a republic. Thats why you find a lot of sources saying that republic and democracies are compatible. Yes, thats why wikipedia is not a reliable source.As I said, it can be argued that a reperesentative republic will degenerate into a democracy (thats what I believe), so they can seem similar, but from a theoretical point of view they are very different.In a democracy the decission of the majority is the rule of the country. What the majority decides its what happens. A republic is the opposite. In a republic there are a certian set of rules that are supposed to be inmutable, the constitution, including equality in from of the law, etc.. Well, it can be argued that a representative republic will always degenerate into a democracy, but from a theoretical point of view they are completely different (and exclusive). English is not my first language, you dont need to be an asswhole about it. Yes, I make mistakes when I write it, but I think I make the points clear enough.As for the rest, Im not insecure of my economic knowledge, I am willing to keep discussing about economics whenever you want to. But I mean discussig being honest about it and accepting when you see there is a mistake in your line of though. Try to be a bit logic. You dont have to win a discussion with words. We are trying to understand how the economy works, not show who has better rethoric skills.Lets reduce your argument to absurd. According to your argument we dont want to have price inflation because there was a period of stagflation and you dont want to be associated with catastrophic risk. See how what you said is not really an argument?The fact that when a bubble pops there is depression and also price deflation does not mean price deflation causes the depression. In fact it is the previous inflationary process that creates the depression. Price deflation is just a natural reaction and is needed for the economy to recover. Price deflation is healthy for the economy (in context).The person that will be taxed will spend less. In aggregate one can say nothing will change much. This is chartalist theory. I dont agree with it. Im just saying what the chartalist say.No. You are referring to the idea that when two people decide to exchange goods they are both better off because of the subjective nature of value. The problem is it only happens if they are both exchanging them voluntarely. If they are exchanging them because the government has imposed violently a monopolly on money and is using that monopolly to depreciate the currency people will just flead the monopollistic currency but they wont be better off.Listen, we are here to understand the economy not to win a rethoric constest. Velocity of money and prices dont have a direct relation as you stated earlier. And it is a basic premises of what you said and it being false invalidates your line of reasoning.Not true. As I said earlier there is no direct relation between velocity of money and prices. Prices can be falling and velocity of money increasing. There are examples of this in history.Your line of reasoning is based on false assumptions and therefore your conclussion is wrong. Credit crunches dont happen for lack of money. You are avoiding answering. A well functioning economy works under price deflation. There are numerous examples through economic history on booming economies under price deflation.First, I think you want to correct that. Taxing and spending has a different effect than printing money and spending. What you are trying to imply is that there is money missing in the economy and therefore the government must print and spend. Taxing and spending leaves the money supply intact.Second, money velocity and prices are not directly related. You can have an increase on circulation with a decrease in prices for example.Third, you are avoiding answering. I explained why you dont need more money to pay debts. If you disagree answer but dont repeat the same without answering. I will assume you are not trolling and you are just confused:Thats not true. Theoretically you can have a stable money supply. You will say that then there will be price deflation which is true and its completely fine.Correct (mostly) but only with the present monetary system that has been going on only 40 years. Other monetary system operate in very different ways.Correct (mostly). This is call monetization of government debt and is a very old concept, dating from 1700 in the modern central bank form.If this is true and efficient, how do you explain that everytime this system has been tried it has ended quickly into hyperinflation?Not true. They are limited by the amount of securities accepted at the central bank they can create.Not true. A well functioning economy works under price deflation.This is a big fallacy I see repeated again and again all over the Internet. You can return a total credit of $10.000 with a total money supply of $5.000. Money circulates. The reason for the credit crunches that we see when a bubble pops is not lack of money in circulation.Your premises are false (for the reasons stated above) therefore your conclussions (the gov must print) are wrong.You have been influenced by the chartalists (which have rebranded themselves as MMT, very fancy name). Chartalism is a long discredited theory. Just because they have updated their credit theory (which is mainly correct) does not mean that the underlying theories are right. They were wrong and continue to be wrong. The idea of a lot of people supporting democracy is that if they vote "the right guy" (TM) it will do good for everybody and everything will be dandy. In reality what they mean is if you vote ME and do what I tell you everything will be perfect. If you ask a democratic person they always have this plan on what to change and what to do to solve all the problems in the world. A democratic guy is always a dictator with the need of justification to impose their will. Again, your system is too open to uncertainties and not practical to implement.And even supposing it was possible (its not), Bitcoin has changed price a lot mainly because its a very small market. Trying to adjust inlation because of some exchage rate wont change it too much. Any big influx of money will make it go up and any big sell off will make it go down quick. As Bitcoin grows this will disappear.Fiat currencies are not "trusted", fiat currencies are accepted because the government impose them. If the governments were ot forcing their fiat currencies nobody would accept them.And there is lot of people trusting bitcoins (including me).  What exchange rate do you use?  Bitcoin to dollars? Bitcoin to euros? Bitcoin to pounds? Bitcoin to rembini? A basket of all the previous ones? Who decides if the index of the baskets need to change because the fundamental economic situation has changed (the euro has gone down, the dollar has lost reserve estatus, etc...). And then where do you get the data from? MtGox? TradeHill? Others? Combination? What happens if some of those companies goes down? Who is going to trust in a currency that needs constant changes and agreements to work? What happens if the miners dont agree? How do you deal with the uncertainty? It wont happen because its impossible to do with a decentralized currency. This has been discussed to eternity in the forums. They wont. The few people complaining about early adopters dont really care and use it as a way to attack Bitcoin. It all depends on how they define e-money. With the present definition on the EU it does not affect Bitcoin. Translation:We want to make sure the online payment system does not get too far away from the control of the big banks. Ok, so here is how it works. The EFSF debt is offering interest well over 2% in the last auction. The discount window of the ECB costs 1.5% now. If you are a bank in the eurozone (even if you dont have the funds) you can buy the EFSF debt and then place it over the ECB to get the necesary ratio of funds, while getting the difference between the interest rates. And the EFSF is backed by all the EU members including Germany, so the risk is very low. Yes, the money can come from investors, but if it doesnt it can come from the printing machine of the ECB, thats why they have had no problems raising money for the EFSF: backed by Germany and with free money from ECB arbitrage. Whats not to like (if you are a bank)?Also, you have to consider that the EFSF is only temporary. The real objective of the EU burocrats is the fiscal union, them having the fiscal power (taxation and emission of debt) and basically stripping the last important power that the governments of the EU members still have. The EFSF is only a way to introduce the eurobond in a stealth way (the EFSF lends money to EU countries backed by all the rest, so basically it is a eurobond with limited functionality). But as I said the EFSF is only temporary and the next step is the ESM (European Stability Mechanism) which implies traspassing the fiscal powers to the EU burocrats, because it allows them to emit debt backed by all the governments without the need of consent of those governments. After that they are only missing direct control over taxation. The ESM is scheduled to be aproved in 2013. I suppose the EFSF debt will be transformed into the new system.The ESM has been accepted by the PIIGS without too much complain (for obvious reasons, who does not want to be rescued?) but its facing more rejection in the central european countries (obvious as well, they are the ones paying). In Germany the FDP (classic liberals/libertarians), that is ruling with Merkel, is supposed to vote against. Merkel has said his party, the UCD, will vote in favour, but several members of the party has already announced that they will vote against. They have proposed an alternative system where the debt emission has to be approved by the governments. The EU burocrats wont accept that obviously because they want to have the control, thats the objective of the move. So Merkel has gone to the left wing parties (the social democrats and the greens) that have said that will vote in favour. It seems it has votes to pass.Unless people really oppose it, the EU is going to use the crisis to get the fiscal union (as Soros has been promoting f.e.) and they will inflate away the debt. Its very telling that Merkel wanted Weber from the Bundesbank to be Trichet successor, while France wanted the more inflationist Mario Draghi (italian, ex-Goldman Sachs). Germany has (had?) the control of the ECB so everybody assumed Weber was going to be then next ECB chairman. Until he resigned surprising everybody arguing that his hawky (anti-inflationary) monetary views did not have support in the EU. Finally Merkel has accepted Draghi. He might have positions there and thats why he recommends it, but short term is a good advice. Long term is crazy though. The EFSF debt can be used at the ECB discount window. Money printing, not real debt.
Use search. They could use OT and have their books open while keeping confidentiality. Well, Bubbleboy has changed his mind. First Bitcoin was going to crash into nothing and disappear. Now he is saying that it will crash into $1. Who knows what he will be saying in 3 months. Bitcoin is not a fiat currency, is the opposite, a voluntary currency.Fiat does not mean without backing. You guys are all the same, like clones. The corporatists know how to indoctrinate:Big business become big and powerfull to the point of abuse because of big government. Regulations protect big business and free them from competition allowing them to abuse their costumers. Social-democracy is nothing more than corporatism with nice words.See above.You are missing the new rich (and small) rich class that appeared, but that was not the point. It was for what I said above.That you should come to live here in Europe and check for yourself instead of believing the rosy distorted image that some people promote and you buy without even checking. Im too tired of correcting mistakes so just some points:- The USA had consistenly higher wages than the European countries. As the USA has been abandoning a more free market system and has become more a social-democracy, the wages in the USA have become worse and the difference with Europe has reduced. Also the difference between rich and poor has increased.- The nordic countries had the social-democrats in the government during the 80's and their economies suffered, went into crisis, etc... So they started voting the conservatives who liberalized the market, etc... and their economies improved. In fact, the european nordic countries are used as example of neo-liberal policies working.- Health care is not government run in all Europe. In fact a lot of european countries have renounced to government health and now implement some sort of mandated private insurance system, for example Germany or severeal nordic countries. In contrast, countries like England, Spain or Greece still have government run health care systems.Etc...I also dont continue because you are totally indoctrinated and dont give a fuck so facts wont work on you.Yes, you are very selfish, because you dont give a fuck about the rest and study what is really good for society. You just jump into the first pseudo-philosophy that promises a lot and makes you feel good. Thats all you care about. I am a libertarian. And I have answered about you caring for the poor. Ive told you that what you have said in this forum benefits the rich or makes everybody poor. Thats why you are a selfish person, because you dont care about the real consquences of what your preach, you only care about how the ideas make you feel. Im not capitalist. Im anticapitalist. Ive said it repeteadly in this forum. It shows how shallow you are.You are a seflish person that will believe whatever makes you feel good at the expense of the others. Honestly, what Ive read from you would either benefit the rich people or make everybody poor. But lets assume for a moment that you dont do it because you are a heartless agressive bastard, lets assume you have been fooled.And now cheap philosphy...Listen its very selfish from your part to not dedicate a bit of time to understand the basics of how this world works and just jump onto the first philosophy that promises you everything because it makes you feel good. You should stop being so selfish, think about your fellow men and learn a couple of things. I dont see you being agressive with yourself. Anyways being agressive and intransigent are traits of your personality that is very distant from a compassionate person. Some people get a thrill out of "free" stuff. I think it happens the same with cheating. The guy feels more intelligent than you because he is using your system in a way you did not intent. As I said, if you run a business youll have to deal with this kind of stuff. I hope the price goes high enough to get ride of naive admins.If there is a flaw someone is going to use it. If you want to run a business youll have to deal with it. Someone as agressive as you dont understand what companssion is so dont try to come all holly on us. Its still to be seen if we have really reached peak gold or the mining activity of gold was low due to the depressed prices. With the new prices of gold, a lot of gold miners are starting new projects and we might see an increase in the extraction again. https://bitcoin.org.uk/forums/topic/312-memorydealers-10-rebate-in-bitcoins-on-every-order/You might want a post announcements there. Its growing as the second Bitcoin forum. Weve been vandalized. And they dont even accept bitcoins...    The Fed mostly deals in short duration gov debt except when it does not. For example, during this crisis the Fed has been buying a lot of long term government debt.Also, I am fully aware how the primary dealer system works. Does not change anything Ive said. The Fed says they buy and sell government bonds to adjust liquidity and interest rates (which is true) but the end result is that mid and long term they always end up buying government debt as net result. Check the data of the last 20 years of the Fed and you will see how they always increase the amount of gov debt they have. Its a way of sending money to the politicians. In the video nobody says the Fed is private. Please read what I have wrote explaining how the Fed works. And then go and check original sources and check if Im telling the truth or not.Why do reason and logic dont work on people? EuSouBitcoin, Bitcoinica is not an exchange. But you are right that people should be careful because leverage + Bitcoin trading is a risky convination. Do you realize that the interest that the Fed charges to the government is not real? The Fed charges the government interest on the gov debt that it holds. That money is benefits for the Fed. The benefit of the Fed goes back to the government. So what the government pays, the government gets back. Its not real.Look, you should look to the original sources and make up your mind. I will have to leave it here. No, legally they are different things. And in real life they are quite different as well.A corporation in the USA pays as taxes a percentage of their benefits. The USA has one of the highest corporate rate in the world (the first or the second if I recall correctly) and it is something over 20%. The Federal Reserve gives their benefits to the government. There is a big difference.Also, the Fed is not private. Mcdonal is.
The benefits that McDonals generate dont go to the government. McDonals pays taxes.The benefits that the Federal Reserve System generates go to the government.Look, youve been told different and dont want to believe a guy in the Internet. I understand and I think its a healthy attitude. Go check for yourself the USA law. Check for yourself if what Ive told you is true or not. You will see that Ive told you the truth.This law wont pass. In that I agree with the guy that advocated violence. If you want to bet I accept. So we just have to legalize theft and then you will be allright with it? The question was why do you keep calling Ron Paul a fundamentalist. You dont need to keep dodging questions. You can answer, nobody is going to do anything to you. I would like to know why do you think Bitcoin is different from "anyone printin their own currency and using it".And if by having my own agenda means discusing against the use of violence on people to impose one particular currency, then yes. I will discuss with people who has agenda like yours, because I dont understand why you want to use violence on people to impose a currency. You have been misinformed.First of all, the government gets the benefits the Fed generates. If you want to know who controls a system check who gets the money.But then what you said is not true. The government chooses the whole Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Its important to note that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is a federal government agency and takes all the decisions on monetary policy in the USA (except open market operations).The open market operations are decided by the FOMC, that is a board formed by 12 members. 7 are the 7 members of the federal government agency Board of Governors. The other 5 are presidents of the local Feds (the president of the New York Fed permanent, the other 4 rotatory).The last part of the Federal Reserve system are the local feds. The local feds are a mix of government of private and government agencies but they are mainly government. The boards of the local feds are choosen 1/3 by the federal government, 1/3 by the local governments and 1/3 by the member private banks. So even the local feds, the ones accused usually of being private, are 2/3 government.Being honest, how can anyone say that the Fed is a private entity? Its mainly a government entity, with a private touch. The Federal Reserve system is a mixed private/government system. But its mainly a government system, and the monopolly on money is imposed by the government, who delegates its management on the Federal Reserve. I do not live in the USA. But if I lived there, am I not allowed to have a different opinion and try to improve the system? Btw, if you dont agree with your president why do you live in your country?Oh my god, in your country there is open competition for food, and for clothes... Anyone can set up a hsop and start sell.ing trousers. Madness!!Do you realize that most of the time in human history we have had competing currencies and it wored better than the present monetary system?If you support a monopolly on money you are not patriotic, you are the opposite.Btw, please expalin to me how Bitcoin is different than:You have Barack Obama that its quite similar in policy to Sarah Palin and the situation is bad but ithe USA has not collapsed (yet). Ron Paul would be a real change from those two. You keep repeating that Ron Paul is a fundamentalist. Care to explain why? I agree with you, just want to point out that the Federal Reserve notes are not the country currency, they are the government currency. I dont understand why some USA people keep ignorantly bashing their most honest and worthy politician. You vote, so what? Do you really think voting changes anything? Do you really think voting makes politicians accountable? Information is limited and local. People can not have infinite information and vote accordingly. Voting is just a popularity contest. How is it your money when you can not even choose it? You are forced to use it. Can you print it? The banks and the politicians can print it. You dont. You are just forced to use it.And what its backing the Federal Reserve dollars is the USA army. Thats why the rest of the world still use it as reserve currency.Only fundamentalists that support using violence on their fellow citizens support imposing a currency on the rest. If the USA got rid of the monpolly on money and the people used the money they choosed the economy would function much better and crisis like the present one would not happen. "Our money"? Some people are too high on Kool-Aid. Whats with this obsesion of eating gold a lot of paperbugs have? You can not eat paper neither (well, you can but you get me) and they defend it as money. If you want to eat get food, money is not for eating, money is a mean of exchange. Why would you want to eat money?!? He is just telling a list of posible competing currencies and the last one is Bitcoin. Its nice to hear Bitcoin named as currency in the USA Congress. Im fairly left-wing as well. Not all left-wings are authoritarian. Freddie and Fannie are not government entities?Also, even when they were private banks offering the money, they are largely subsidized and incentivized to expand the money supply by the government.I dont understand how anyone can say the government has taken a hands-off approach when we live under a monopolly of money.  So yes, you would preffer the opinion of a burocrat to decide if your mother is "worthy" of receiving treatment or should be left to die. Honestly, I just can not understand it.You are intelligent enough to not believe your justification. Burocrats are not interested in getting more money? Burocrats are interested in you? You know government burocrats and politicians are humans, just like business man, and most of them, as far as their job goes, care about money and not you.When you advocate government control you are advocating giving monopollistic power to some people that care about getting more money and dont care about you (except for discovering the best way to lie to you to get your vote).1. Advocating against government healthcare is not advocating against healthcare, its actually advocating against bad healthcare.2. If you go the constitutional way you are going to loose and you know it. The constitution of the USA does not allow for government healthcare.Government healthcare is not free and its not high quality. You know how I know? Because I suffer it. Let me give you an example: My grandma had cataracts and she was starting loosing her vision. She lived alone. The government said there was a long queu for that operation and she had to wait 6 months. 6 months without barely seeing. Her daughters got together and payed for her a private operation. And all of them had been paying government healthcare all their lives. Now my grandma, who has payed government healthcare, is paying as well a private insurer. Thats the reality of what you are asking. You are asking for hospitals collapsing, not metaphorically, our authorities asks us not to go to the hospiral unless its live or dead some weekends each year because the hospitals basically can not deal with people getting ill (yes this is the Europe you are told is great) and long waiting lists for basic operations. Thats what you call human progress and the reality behind the promises you are hearing.Its not random that most europeans countries, like Germany or some nordic countries, have gone away from government run healthcare and now run in some sort of mandatory private insurance system. joulesbeef very relax moderation is forum policy. If you want a different type of forum youll have to go somewhere else, for example:http://bitcoin.org.uk (I like this one)http://www.bitcoinforums.nethttp://bitforums.net/ The law also removes legal tender laws so it would be great for Bitcoin. So basically what you are saying is that MtGox detected the trades from compromised accounts and almost instantly undid all the trades until the first trade with a compromised account, then redid all the trades how it would have happened, all of this without stopping the system and nobody noticing it?I think you will agree its hard to eat that one. So basically yes, ignoring your stupid emotional cheap-shots, what you are propossing is that someone takes the money of your labour and decides if your mother deserves to receive treatment or she should be left to die. Quite amazing someone can take such an unhuman position.
Flip Pro let me ask you the other side of that question:Do you think government burocrats should be in the business of deciding who is worth of getting treatment and deciding who is not worth being saved? Again, privacy issues aside, I dont buy that explanation. The trading software creates a trade and publishes it. I dont understand even in that case how a trade got published without actually happening. If you stop a trade because you think its not valid then it does not get published.The most probable explanation with the information we have is that the new MtGox engine had a bug and produced the wrong information or messed up how the trades were matched. To avoid admiting it they are coming with an excuse including saving MtGox and Bitcoin from some evil terrorist... I mean hackers. I dont think they were even hacked, probably it was just a bug. And again, all of this is a wild guess with the little to non-existant information we have.Because what should really happen is MtGox comes clean and explains what really happened. But the explanation they gave is very poor and does not make a lot of sense. Specially when its not the first time MtGox has tried to lie its way out of a mess. Everybody can have a mistake, but this treating everybody like they are stupid with non-sensical excuses just makes me distrust them. TradeHill came clean and very open with the Dwolla issue and everybody understood and even praised them. MtGox should do the same. Its the power of the Bitcoin drama show. You never know what the next news will be. We could also open a section for Minsc and you about the art of Trolling. Honestly, the explanation MtGox gave is very lacking. How can a user create some transactions that dont go through but appear in the data?Its sounds to me more like a bug that they do not want to recognize than anyother thing. Yes, I read MagicalTux chat explanations. But I think the explanation is lacking. How does a user manage to create an order that does not get executed but still shows in the data? Is this normal at MtGox?Without more information Im guessing it might be a bug more than a hack, but the explanation he has given is lacking (as you already said). Sorry if this is a bit offtopic, but does anyone has a propper explanation of what happen at MtGox on Sunday with the ghost trades? The technical explanations Ive heard until now dont seem to make much sense. Paypal and MtGox are completely different services. Bitcoin is dollars and Paypal all together. Because MtGox is not a competitor. As me and nmat said before Bitcoinica is not an exchange. Why I am not surprised someone like you said this? This is not the official forum. Cablepair this forum is "under moderated" by design. If you want other type of forum they are popping around, like for example this one: http://bitcoin.org.uk, that is more moderated. Different people will want different styles of forums. Its all good. His place is not a exchange and he acts as a market marker. You could see this from any stock, any currency, anything really. If it was that easy nobody would be working. Did you start this from scratch or its based on something else? They allow short selling, so I dont think its the reason of the recent spike. They could have as well produced a big sell off. Great video. Thanks. And the best part is that he is totally open about it and has never tried to hide it. The ingenuity amazes me.Btw, his success should be an eye opener to the rest of exchangers. Parece que un exchanger sudamericano que permita ingresar dinero en cuantas bancarias podría tener éxito. "The manipulator" is the legend some have created to explain certain movements in the Bitconi price.
Too soon? No se trata de conceder o no. No había pensado las comisiones por meter dinero en los exchanges. Aquí en Europa se puede hacer una transferencia SEPA a los exchanges y es gratis independientemente de la cantida. Puedes meter 10 euros con 0 comisión por ejemplo. Así que aquí en Europa cualquiera puede comprarlos independientemente de la cantidad. Ya veo que en Sudamerica es diferente. More like SA trolls. Its hard to trust bitcointalk as well. Its very hard what to believe. Please go ahead and good luck.Im really looking forward to someone to create an inflationary version of Bitcoin, so when it fails we can point at it and end up the nonsense. [citation needed]Veo por ahí gente diciendo que los bitcoins están en pocas manos, pero muy pocas pruebas de ello. Cuando el precio era muy alto la gente dcía que solo los ricos podían comprar bitcoins, ahora qu eel precio es bajo debería ser lo contrario, no? Ahora los bitcoins son más accesibles y estarás más distribuidos. It wasnt meant to be an attack. True. But it might have a psicological effect. For example, there are some miners that will sell at any price as soon as they get some bitcoins, but seing that now it does not even cover their electricity bill they might decide to hold or at least set a minimum price at which they will sell. So, from around $17-18 silver shoot up to almost $50 in less than a year, and because it corrected back to $35 and now up to over $40, silver is a bad investment? I say that after such a rally its quite normal a correction.You know better than this. You transmit data in and out of the faraday cage with lasers. Oh, the drama!You should just stop using multinicks, be a real man or a real woman. You are free to choose the television channel you want to watch, not the currency you want to use. Thats for the government burocrats to decide (with guns and for your own good of course). Unlike you, Rassah is a known and long time member of this forum.The real question here is who are you a multinick of. And when I though no comment could be worst than the opening post, here comes this freak. Well, once we get that far we might as well get the record at least.   Another example of constructive an on-topic comment of AyeYo. Very interesting your explanation about banking regulations. Keep the good work. And I agree that it would have been even more deflationary without the cental bank actions. The point I was trying to make is thats exactly what the economy needed. Also, the central banks have always avoided deflation, so it was not that hard to predict that they would avoid deflation this time around again.Before and after QE2.I cant find the link but it was in response to this one: http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/the-power-of-minus/ Read the comments, its hilarious.Exactly.Just one thing, the banks are not required to have a 10% in reserves any more. Now its variable depending on the assets they have and in practice is way lower than 10%. If by stability you mean that QE avoided the re-structuration of the economy and prolonged the crisis, then yes. It did that.Also keep in mind that Krugman is of the opinion that the Fed and the government have done too little. For Kruggy the Fed has been tame and the increase of government spending not enough. Therefore I hardly see how he could have been surprised by the government doing too much.And I specifically mentioned his prediction of final 2010 that deflation was the big danger. Nothing notorious has changed in monetary policy since then, and Krugman has been utterly wrong. This mistake is so big that he has done something he rarely does, admit a mistake. But he has done it by saying that his adversaries were also wrong becuase they said that M0 or M1 (cant remember which one) was the driver of price inflation. Problem is this is a lie. Everybody I read says that M0 and M1 are just the first stages of monetary inflation and that M2 and M3 are more closely correlated to the CPI.If you try to make sense of what Krugman says you are going to end un with a headache becuase his blog is just a political platform. Some of his early books are worth reading. Not his blog. Neither Reagan nor Margareth Thatcher removed any of the banking regulations that Ive metioned.If you want to try to prove that they did, please go ahead. More ridiculous, Krugman's predictions have been horrible. He has been predicting deflation and we have not seen any of it. He claimed at the end of 2010 that the biggest thread was deflation, and three months later prices started to raise.Krugman is notorious by claiming a lot of things and only bring back the ones he randomly gets right. His biggest and most important calls during this crisis have been backwards.EDIT: And btw, he was not the only one claiming there would be investors going back to treasuries after the fed got out by ending QE.
And they are heavily regulated in the amount of money they have access to which is one of the most important issues and my point all along. 1. The fund managers are regulated.2. They get their money from the banking system to leverage and are completely influenced by the supply of money and credit.Please, make some sense.Neoclassical economics assumed until the 70's that information was given. Austrian economics has always assumed information was local and fragmented and no one had all the information. This fact was one of the main arguments of austrians to prove that centralized systems dont work and the free market is the best solution to distribute resources.Austrian economists called out neo-classicals (including the keynesians and monetarists) on it, but they refused to listen. Then during the 70's some keynesians claimed they had discovered a flaw in the economic though, and that was that information was not given. Ignoring that this was exactly what the austrians had been saying all along, they call it information asymetry (they are always very good with the marketing). Stiglitz even got the Nobel prize for this "discovery". Then they said it was a market failure, when in reality is one of the main arguments for the free market. I think you want to re-read yourself. The banking and credit system is the investment system. Of course. Fraud is based on confidence. The banking system is one of the areas more heavily regulated in the western countries. The money market is a government created monopolly and the credit system is a government created oligopolly, with the government setting the basic interest rates by decree. And you tell me its a market failure? I hope this is some kind of joke.Btw, I know you wont because you are too busy trolling but I would suggest you go to research historic periods where the banking and money markets have been a free market and you will see this you are complaining about did not happened. People keeps repeating that, he keeps going up in the polls.  You dont know Krugman and thats why you are being naive. But hey, youll discover sooner or later.Btw, at first read I also though the post was not that bad, but giving it more though the problem of the post is that its very wrong. Kruggy says that there is little trade because there is no inflation. Well, we are in the inflationary phase of Bitcoin so, according to him, there should be a lot of trade. But specially the part saying that a currency should be for trade not ofr making a profit. Thats exactly what Bitcoin is, the Federal Reserve notes are the ones that help a few to profit. We are news!Thats quite amazing. Probably talking about Bitcoin gives them a lot of hit, otherwise they would not create an article out of a forum quotes. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=38892.0 Probably Kruggy. Kenedy did not tried to end the Fed (yes I know about his silver dollars).But you are rigth that if elected Ron Paul has a lot of chances of being assessinated. I think he knows. Yes, probably the rate at which the block reward is adjusted should be more smooth, but still you have a predictable rate which will make it easier for the market to adjust.Also, its not that bad from a system point of view that the price of bitcoins is going down. The cheaper bitcoins are the easier people will buy them and the more distributed they are. Its being discussed all over:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=42004.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41994.0 I kind of agree with this, and thats why I am so amazed by the level of support Ron Paul is getting on this election. Maybe there is hope after all. Ron Paul votes against any funding from government to anything that its not authorized by the constitution. He has voted against giving money to religious entities that promote anti-abortion (and got flac from the republicans from doing so).The point is not that Ron Paul is in favor or against something, its that he thinks the government should not interfere outside of what the constitution allows. He has his own opinion about particular issues, but he does not let that opinion influence how government should act. Its a bit of a change for people that are used to the left-right type of thinking, it takes them a while to get it (probably your case).And what its so special about this guy? What got me, an atheist former social-democrat, to change my political views after almost 3 decades of life?For starters the guy has integrity. And I mean integrity like you have not seen in a politician before. This is what impressed me more about the guy and make me start to look into what he said. The guy has been saying the same things in Congress for 20 years and nobody listened to him. Its not that Ron Paul has changed to become popular, is that the people is chaging towards Ron Paul, mainly because reality is validating his views. Watch speeches of this guy 10 or 20 years ago, when nobody listened to him. Its amazing.For example, he has been always against the wars. A lot of times that meant him being the only republican voting with a few democrats on some issues in the middle of the crazyness that USA became after 9-11 (which is understandable, no offense intended). Even voting alone. And let me tell you at those times that was a polical suicide, specially if you were republican. I remember one recent vote about the USA government sending some agents or blocking trade against some arab country because some Al-Queda bullshit. He voted against it alone. Everybody voted in favor, except one congressman that was of arab origins and voted blank. Not even the guy of arab origins had the balls to vote against it, yet Ron Paul, a republican, did, dammed electoral consequences. This is the reason he is so hated by both neo-cons and some democrats.Its getting a bit long, you can ask if you want to know something. But basically the guy is a rock, specially in his main issues: economy and specially the central bank and foreign policy. I follow politics more than the average person, and I have not seen in my live nobody with the integrity Ron Paul has. Even his detractors have to admit this, and some try to paint him as some kind of utopian/quixotic guy to attack him. Its not that you own different companies, its that a NBC is owned by GE.Here is the thread where I discuss my view on property: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=38169.0 It was sane until the trolls arrived. Bingo.I would actually love to see this. All free market cartels in history have failed so it would be interesting to see it happen again and not just read about it. Correct. I meant to say hashrate. Difficulty has been stabilizing lately as well. Los gobiernos van a tener un problema enorme para definir juridicamente Bitcoin sin hacer que eso afecte a cualquier otro intercambio.Y luego van a tener un problema aún más grande para hacer que las regulaciones se cumplan. I posted a comment too. I think it was very polite but I dont know if it will be posted.Krugman is known for censoring comments he does not like. In fact, he was getting schooled in his own blog (even by other keynesians) so he lowered the size allowed for the comments so people could not elaborate a propper answer to his posts. Krugman's blog at the NYT is more of a political propaganda platform than anything else.
You are a good guy, you are just confused.  For example NBC is property of GE which has received a lot of money from the government lately. But I was talking about more than direct subsudies. If I enact regulation limiting the competition for you, how is that different from giving you money? Im giving you more business when the people might have choosen something different.If I have not answer to the part of what is justly adquired property is because I had that same debate here some weeks ago and dont want to repeat it. You should remember that at that time the forum, specially the section of economics, was almost a monologue of threads discussing about inflation/deflation. Every new person though that his point of view was so important that deserved a new thread instead of just posting in one of the already opened threads. It made the forum unworkable, specially some sections.So something like that was and is needed. You might think it could have been implemented better, thats fine, but it was and it is needed.I want to point out to you that you should discuss any issue you have with moderation with the moerators in private first. Thats a forum rule. I could have taken down your post and asked you to talk in private under the forum rules. Because you have been here for a while Ive allowed this to happen in the open so you see I have nothing to hide. Next time I will apply forum rules. Also, on a personal note, I would appreciate if you contact me first instead of widly launch accusations. I dont get pay to moderate and I am a person, with my feelings and all that shit. So you asking me what happened before jumping to conclussions about me being a censor and widly accusing me in the open would be much appreciated.If you have any more doubts you know where I am. Problem is that "property" was not adquired justly therefore is not really their property. When a televission receives subsudies (money taken by force from the citizens by the government and given to this corporations) and the corporations that own them are protected by government regulations, well... you can not apply the logic that its their shit so they can do what they want, because one has to question if its really their shit. I actually though the post wasnt that bad. I was specting Kruggy to be much more agressive towards Bitcoin. Also the demographics of the readers of Kruggy is probably one that has not hear much about Bitcoin, so it could bring new users. Very true. Does it have an ending? To continue with the same spirit:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZFlF9LN1CE Dont feed the trolls. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QsbvE_0Kpc https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=38892.0 Enjoy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPxzE2XM1TY Its totally legal in the USA to frame a private currency as a valid currency. Its not legal to frame it as legal tender, which he did not, even denying publicy that it was legal tender. The exact same article, not the same area of discussion. Yes, they were very very similar. Liberty dollar 5 dollar note vs Federal Reserve 5 dollar note:You would need a modern forensic team to be able to diferentiate them.   The article is duplicated. Thats why the thread was closed.As a rule, shouldnt you try to contact the moderators to know what happened as opposed to widly accuse someone? The worst part is that its clearly stated in the post that its duplicated. I believe all the code is already open, but well get confirmation when drGr33n appears. Then why does Germany exists? And why does the industry does not go to Africa where the price of labour is way cheaper than anywhere else?It seems to me your theory is too simplistic. I would prefer drGr33n to answer, but until he logs in, I can give you what I got from reading his thread. LinuxCoin was first Debian with some scripts added and the Bitcoin software installed by default. Later on he changed to Slackware. So basically is all open source. If you download the binaries you have obviously no way to test it, but I am sure there is a way to check the sources. Again, take everything I said with a grain of salt, I could be wrong.Also, if you want to become fully paranoic about security (which is not a bad thing to do) one has to be aware that windows has wholes accesible by governments (so they can enter on your windows computer at any time) and services like gmail have also government wholes (this is how the chinese hacked gmail, publicy admited by Google). So you might want to keep that in mind also if you are running Bitcoin (and anything) on Windows or using gmail. Isnt this already the case? When you move into a government currency, how can you do it anonymously (excluding cash which is not an option at the Bitcoin exchangers)?If you demand to move your funds to a bank account, you are revealing yourself because the bank account has your data. Also, Dwolla and similar systems require your data and also end up in a bank account anyway.
Anyone that does not know about this troll can check here (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41126.0).I think the first post states clearly where Kruggy is lying, but if anyone (that is not a troll) has any doubt just ask. LinuxCoin was created by drG33n and Im sure hell come here to solve any doubts you have. The official thread is here and so far is widely used and no one has complained. If by "define terms of the debate arbitrarily" you mean that I asked you to define your terms the way you liked so everybody could understand what you were saying... Yet you keep using rethoric to avoid defining in a clear and concise way what you say.Your refusal to define the terms you are using is a clear indication for anyone with a sane and rational mind.If you are up for a rational debate and start by leaving the rethoric aside and define your terms (the way your prefer) in a strict way, I gladly will continue. If you keep with rethoric and nothing else, Im done. Probably both.The developers got so high on the initial success of Bitcoin that forgot that the community of non-programmers was important to keep pushing Bitcoin forward. I am unaware if they tried to convince Theymos to change the policy of the forum, so we might be being unfair with them.The lack of Bitcoin community is an important issue that I dont see being talked around. Before the trolls started fukcing the forum, people had a place to meet and discuss things rationally. Any newcommer could ask questions and get a feel of what Bitcoin was and decide to invest or not. Not anymore. Most of the old members are gone with the big increase of trolls in the forums. ^^ stevendobbs I asked you for a comprehensive list of what you consider "left wing policies before the 70's" and "right wing policies after the 70's" not a polical speech like the one you posted. I specifically asked for no rethoric. You might want to try again.PS: And please dont use the term neo-liberal. Its just a propaganda term with no real economic definition (if it had a concise and exact definition it would not work well as propaganda tool). Yeah, its weird that Krugman would refuse to help the needed with a debate because he is always claiming that is his objective. Sometimes I forget you are a troll and answer to you. Hopefully it wont happen again. Germany and Japan are not hard money countries. Thats a shame. If you are really interested, you should go to the LinuxCoin thread (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7374.0) and ask there, maybe you can get it to work with other partition systems.  Yes, marxism has a lot of the components of cults, thats why it works so well on some people.Btw, the most ironic part is that Marx said that the buorgeois class had a different logic, but he himself was a buorgeios, therefore (according to that line of thinking) the workers should not listen to Marx. Its the limit of irony a buorgeios telling the workers not to listen to any other buorgeios but himself. I will do something better than that, Ill give you a whole explanation on how the policies produced the outcome. I wrote this some time ago: Yes, and I did. Because I am not accusing Kruggy of what you are saying I am accusing him. You might want to read what I wrote again. Yes, LinuxCoin connects to the internet. It even has a web browser installed. The point is that if you start visiting web pages you are increasing the risk of being infected. Just as a policy you should not do it with the LinuxCoin that has your wallet.Yes, this is an option as well. In fact, you should do that with the security copies. The point of having a bootable USB is that you have a more easy access to your funds. For example you might want to access those funds every 3 or 4 months, and the USB is just convinient. Apple now uses standard PC hardware so you should be able to use the USB. Linux has drivers for almost anything these days (even more than windows), but you will never know for sure until you try. In theory you should not have a problem. The OS installed in your hard drive should not be a problem since the bootable USB does not care and does not touch it. If you were to have any issue it would be with the hardware, but it should be fine.Let us know how it goes. Again, I am telling you the reason there is high unemployment is not due to the chinese taking the jobs, its due to the policies that the western countries have followed. The chinese "taking the jobs" is just a consequence. If we would have followed different policies there would not be this unemployment. I have some more time to loose, so come on, state what do you think is this left wing economic policy that happen before the 70's and how is this right wing policy that happened after the 70's. Please be concise and avoid rethoric. Again, check the data. You are going to be surprised about how the stories that have explained you dont fit what really happened.You could also define what you mean by "left economics" and "right economics", just to be sure. This might be relevant:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40417.msg506485#msg506485 No. There is a link between the loosing competivity of the western countries and that they loose industry. And this industry obviously goes somewhere else. But we have seen in history many nations with higher, much higher, wages outcompete nations with lower wages. Wage is only one factor of the cost of production.
Yes, I am refering to the language governments and some "intelectuals" and "economists" (not so curiously from conservatives to communists) about the evil asians that are stealing urrrjubs!What I am telling you is that it is the other way around. The USA financing its deficits through inflation is what has caused the discoordination in the economy and the lower oportunities for workers, while it has benefited politicians and also to a degree the financial system.What I am telling you is that the problem with the unemployment and lowering of real wages of unskilled workers has almost nothing to do with the development of Asia, but it has to do with the policies that have been followed in USA and in Europe. The asians are just being used as scape-goat so people dont look at the ones at home that have benefited from the situation. I dont think the inequality is growing because the evil asians are stealing from us. Its because the production system in the USA and in Europe has changed. The asian development could have happened without affecting us.The main reason for the increase in inequality is the increase of the monetary inflation since the 70's coupled with the changes in the way the CPI gets calculated. If you understimate the CPI (like Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, etc... did) the people that earn a wage will suffer because their wages are not getting actualized.This is why during the 80's and specially during the 90's started appearing so many low-cost services. It was the market reaction to the empoverisment of the middle classes and trying to provide the services they wanted but at a price they could afford. But I think you are wrong. Inequality and worse production system is what is driving low-skilled workers to go under the level of subsistance, not the other way around. Not only you can, but there is an easy HOWTO: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36663.0 The thing is that what you call the "rentier classes" are getting hammered as well, so your theory does not hold. Obviously they suffer less because they were in a more relax position but they are getting punished by the policies that are being applied. Hahahaha. Was this ironic or you really believe it? If you do I recommend that you go and check the data (at least only for mental health). And this has happened because of the policies the authoritarian left have defended (and to be fair also defended by the right wing).I dont understand how you can complain of something produced by what you defend. Is not inflammatory. Marx was a bourgeois and you follow his teachings, therefore you are infected with buorgeois mentallity. You need to break free of the buorgeois teachings of Marx to be able to understand how the world works and bring about the real socialist revolution. Otherwise you are just a traitor to the cause and a willing follower of the buorgeois. Typical bourgeois answer. You did not reply to what I said and tried to pass over it.You are a traitor to the working class follower of the bourgeois Marx. Marx was a bourgeois. You are a traitor to the cause by citing a bourgeois. I dont discuss with trolls, AyeYo. Well, thats not true. According to Krugman there has been two real keynesian stimulus plans in history. The one the USA made at the Great Depression and the one Japan made after their housing bubble pop. You can see the restults of both, the depression kept going.But one has to ask if the keynesian plan is even posible. Because if you give the politicians the power to go into debt and spend because all this academics are justifying it, well, surprise surprise, the politicians will go into deb and spend. The theory is wrong at the basic levels, but even accepting it, one should conclude that its impossible to enforce. It depends on the type of collapse. But usually long term the cash will devaluate.The thing is that after the pop of a bubble all the contraction of credit (credit crunch) produces deflation increasing the value of cash. Then governments counter-act by printing money but they want to be carefull as to not hyper-inflate and also it takes a while for the new money to appear in the market. So usually after a bubble you see some deflationary presures (a period where cash appreciates) followed by a period of inflation where the deflationary presures have disappeared and the country has to "pay" the money printing (a period where money devaluates).So the answer is not white or black. It all depends on the moment. Its the same for everything, there are periods to be in cash, there are periods to be in gold and there are periods to be in stocks. This is a fallacy on how you understand growth (growth can be consuming less resources) and in what you say about interest rates (you dont need growth to return interest rates, its just the present system that produces that effect). Not exactly.With anoymity and zero regulation the scumbags that did not manage to get into the government try to attack you.With regulations you have institunialized scams and theft.At least without regulation you can defend yourself. This has been endlessly discussed here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=11627.0 and its basically a fallacy. What the merchants have seen is that people actually spend more when Bitcoin is appreciating because people find the prices cheaper and try to take advantage of that.By the way this article is duplicated, it has already been commented in the forums. There are sensible ways of managing a bankruptcy of a government regulated banking system like the one we have today. Sweden did it and it worked very well for them.Also, its important to notice that its not only important to let bankrupt institutions fail, but that removing legal tender laws and allowing peole to pay taxes in whatever they earn is necesary as well, because it would allow for the creation of alternative financial system that could channel savings towards new productive investment. If that is the case 90+% of socialists are not socialists. Discrete tomatoes I would add. Looks really good. I wish there were more merchants like you in Europe.
Marx himself is a contradiction for this. Marx was a bourgeois with money that never worked until he was old (and all he did was publishing some articles) and travelled in first class all over Europe. And all of this while at the same time claiming to know what the workers felt and needed. And some people, usually government payed intellectuals, consider this bourgeois a valid representative of the working class. Hahahaha Very funny.   I actually felt for that. Problem is they can not be sure how the people is going to react, and they can end up loosing instead of making money. It all depends if they manage to control the reaction. If they do they win, if they dont they can loose big time. I still laugh when people say: Hey, but the banks returned TARP...Yes they did... with the money the got from the FED. If the Fed buys my shitty assets that nobody wants at high prices I could repay all the money in the world as well. Yes, thats also the best way to discoordinate the economy and make everybody poor.The best way to rob a bank is stop using THEIR money. I like to see how they enforce this. You know why this is happening? Yes, in the back of your mind you guess it right (even when you wont admit it  ): government regulations.What that article is not telling you is that most USA corporations have big piles of cash... but outside the USA. And why they dont bring the money back to the USA and invest? Because if they want to bring the money back to the USA they have to pay a tax. Because in most cases its not worth it they keep the money outside the USA and investment does not happen.Btw, this is a distraction of the main topic. The fact that Warren Buffet profits from rising certain taxes and that he refuses to pay others, shows how hypocrite he is and how easy the progressives can be diluded into supporting personal agendas. You fail to understand.People always tend to use resources to their more basic needs and then go up the scale. When the government takes the money using violence or thread of violence from the people and uses it in a determined way, those resources are not available for the people anymore. Therefore, if you tax people you are taking resources from them and they will have it way harder to create the institutions they would if they had all the resources.But even more important, when the government creates a monopolistic agency that has all the resources and could destroy your competing company, you can not expect anyone to take the risk to create such competing company. Specially when the governments have been proved to be very expeditive about destroying (by changing laws f.e.) competing systems that are providing good service to the people and therefore start to grow and attack the government monopolly.The only hypocrite here is you that promote the use of violence to leave the people without resources to auto-organize and then come here to ask why is people not auto-organizing. I would change this one:to- Scientists are always objective.Science by definition has to report reality. If it does not its not good science. http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/taleb1/English Pool is down? DDOS? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargeback Im shocked, I tell you, shocked!. Yes you are.If the thread have disappeared it was a mistake. Even if you dont get a lot of donations its still a non-anoying way of propagandizing Bitcoin. El precio del par euro-btc o USdollar-btc depende como todo de la oferta y la demanda de cada moneda.Respecto a la oferta y demanda de bitcoins tienes:Oferta: La oferta viene de los mineros o de ahorradores que venden. Los mineros generan de media unos 7200 bitcoins al mes, pero es imposible conocer el porcentaje que deciden usar para comprar euros o dólares y el que se deciden quedar (para comprar lo que sea o para ahorrar). Respecto a algún ahorrador que decida comprar dólares o euros con sus bitcoins es también muy aleatorio. Yo creo que es acertado asumir que la parte más importante de la oferta de bitcoins es un porcentaje de los 7200 bitcoins que se crean mensualmente.Demanda: La demanda es mucho más aleatoria y seguramente la que marca el precio, por eso el precio tiene cierta correlación con Google trends (más noticias -> más gente se entera de Bitcoin y compra).Sobre la estabilidad monetaria me refiero a que las políticas oficiales de los gobiernos actualmente es inflar la moneda (imprimir dinero) y, aunque Bitcoin está ahora en fase inflacionaria de reparto de moneda, esto irá cambiando con el tiempo y se tenderá hacia la estabilidad monetaria. Nice initiative op. The difficulty as of last has been quite stable between 10.000GH and 15.000. Where do you get that its dropping? Yes, I think he means we are in 1975. 
Yes, I cant be bother to look for it though.I remember, f.e., the initial prhase of the Bitcoin blockchain comes from a news announcing the UK bank bailouts. Probably Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan have complained that someone else is taking their business and have ordered the SEC to stop them. You can already create programs that trade commodities without the need of money. But using money is convenient because it simplifies a lot the economic calculation.For example, when you are planning something is easier to think in terms of just one thing, money (I need 300 bitcoins for this project), than a list of commodities. It also allows for unexptected contingencies (I need 250 bitcoins plus 50 to be safe). Money is useful and makes things easy helping human development. Thats why we use it.Also, your point 2 is wrong. Money is not decreed. The decree comes later when people is already using it as a means of creating a monopolly. Gold, silver, etc... were socially selected. Check what Satoshi posted in this forum before he decided to stop using that nickname. Youll see that there was some intention. Yes, I think your article is very interesting. I have even pointed to it in other threads because I think its a good read and I am happy someone did it. I think it adds to Bitcoin.What I am not happy about is the way you have chosen to promote it. And I know how the college ambient work so I know how you manage to get attention. I think the way you did it was dishonest. Im a libertarian. I am a libertarian because I believe in sharing and community as opposed to force and violence. The fact that they only appear together gives them up. But its quite clear that a big part of the new people around here are trolls. Even if you are new to the internet you just have to see the mood that there was at the beggining and the mood that there is now. Some months ago there were discussions even with communists in a civilized manner. Now its all personal attacks with little substance. A troll (like for example Jeffk) will keep giving you the roundabout when you discuss with him, then will turn around and say the contrary of what its telling you in another thread, then it will repeat arguments you have already refuted in other threads, will tend to attack personally, etc...Yes, exactly like in a democracy. Your point being? Sorry but speculative bubbles go the other way arround, the have a more or less continued increase in price and then they collapse quickly. Exactly the opposite of Bitcoin. Its not posible to prove. I dont have access to the IP register and even in that case it proves nothing, since its very easy to access from different IP's.But both nicks appear always during the same period and dont post during the same periods (Im sure it will change from now on). Also they have the same way of being disrespectful and troll style. He does not think that. FirstAscent/AyeYo is just a troll. If you want to be a great leader, you must learn to follow the Tao. Stop trying to control. Let go of fixed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself. The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be. The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be. The more subsidies you have, the less self-reliant people will be. Therefore the Master says: I let go of the law, and people become honest. I let go of economics, and people become prosperous. I let go of religion, and people become serene. I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes common as grass.- Tao Te Ching (Mitchell translation), Chapter 57They say everything is invented and we just keep rediscovering things, and there is some true to this as proven by the Tao. The last sentence is the one that I liked more. No. Bitcoin no es una manera de hacer dinero rápido. Bitcoin es una moneda que sirve para facilitar transacciones, especialmente en Internet, y tener la estabilidad monetaria que los gobiernos nos niegan. So forced by the circumstances (their currency hyperinflated or almost hyperinflated depending on your definitions) Iceland had to repudiate the debt (tehncially it didnt, it refused to acknowledge the debt). This is what most economist of the austrian school of economics recommend and basically is the classical solution: If someone can not pay the debt it has to default on it. But keynesians and others defend the idea that its better to get rid of the debt through inflation promoting ideas like systemic risk and Too Big To Fail, to justify their rejection of defaults. In fact, Krugman defended the bank bailouts in the USA although he had some (sensible I must say) complains at the way it was done.Well, unsurprisingly the country that did not follow the keynesian ideas and just refused to pay the debt, Iceland, has been the first country to get out of the depression and the unemployment is going dow to normal levels. The situation is still dire, but all the indicators are improving.But Krugman has no shame to vindicate this contradiction of his ideas as a triumph, lying to his audience about who defends default as a solution.hxxp://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/iceland-exits/ Exactly. They claim that since the history is there it might be posible to track the transactions. The problem as always is linking a Bitcoin address with a person. There is this researcher at some university that made some very cool graphs lnking addresses of the blockchain and he claims that he could find who stole some bitcoins, but he never did, so it remains unclear if he actually can or not. Nevertheless its important to understand that Bitcoin is psedo-anonymous, not anonymous, and that one has to be careful. Here are the parts where they talk about Bitcoin:Later on:And finally:Clearly, the banks are annoyed that we are trying to operate outside the regulated system. True. But its not only correlation, its that a bunch of indoctrinated kids came with lots of arrogance and attitude and very little knowledge and respect destroyng the mood in the economics and politics sections. And they happen to be progressives. Not all progresives are like that, but they were progressives.I dont see how a humanist can be any other thing than a libertarian...  But I am sure we could have interesting conversations. At the beggining of Bitcoin the forum was much more libertarian, and the mood was a lot better. People had more respect for each other, conversations were less agressive. People were happy in the forum. Even socialist and libertarians were speaking and discussing rationally. It wasnt a problem at all. Since the "progressive kids" started pouring in with their stupid attitude and their programmed ignorance the whole thing started going down. You have not provided any evidence of why Bitcoin is flawed in comparasion to Solidcoin. In fact the contrary, SolidCoin is unsustainable because of the amount of memory it will consume. JA37 its quite clear that you have not researched Ron Paul a lot. It really seems like you are trying to rationalize some sort of irrational dislike towards Ron Paul.Expand.Actually, its the other way around. Ron Paul is one of the most policy oriented and less egomaniac guys in the USA politics. Actually he is accused of not being agressive enough and being too ideological. So is basically the contrary of what you are saying.Again, false. Ron Paul does believe what he says and his faith is real (something I dont like about him). He has a long time tradition of conservative values, although he does not want to impose them through the government (which is what makes me like him). Sarah Palin, Rick Perry, Mitt Rommey, they all have skeletons in the closet. In that regard Ron Paul is even boring. He has been married with the same woman for decades, has no sexual scandals, etc...Well, Obama is religious and believes in the imaginary friend. Obama has said that God guides his decissions. I dont see noone, not even atheist democrats getting all worked up because of it. But somehow is used against Ron Paul. ThomasV the whole article is a good laught. Just from the start. They claim that the FBI is involved in the Bitcoin development, linking to a post that says that the USA government will infiltrate and do whatever to anyone trying to create an alternative currency (and the government employee does not mention Bitcoin). I guess following that "logic" we should conclude as well the FBI is involved in the SolidCoin development. OMG WTF!  I think its pretty obvious by now that was only an excuse.
What the Solidcoins guys are not telling you is that this introduces another set of problems.As I understand it they acomplish this by ramping up the amount of confirmations per unit of time. The problem with this is that then the information the miners and users have to store increases by the same factor, and makes the currency unworkable. SolidCoins would suffer this problem if it had any chance of taking off. If Bitcoin were to adopt this it would be a disaster.You have to find a compromise between number of confirmation per unit of time and storage for blocks.EDIT: I could guess you could adjust the difficulty every 500 blocks instead of every 2000 and something blocks. I still dont see this as a big deal. Not worried at all. Which is the one I used.The point being is that he was incorrect in his believe that there has been deregulation in the USA. Honestly, I have not seen anything in SolidCoin that makes it better than Bitcoin. Their claims are way off, specially the one saying that transfer confirmations happen quicker. They dont. Hahaha. If I had any doubt about the viability of SolidCoins, now they are all gone. SolidCoin is going to collapse like the rest of copies. I said there is no point in discussing semantics. Everybody understand the context.The point is that contrary to what Lupus was saying the number of regulations in the USA have increased, not decreased. Thats probably because the guys behind the MyBitcoin fraud read the forums (probably post under different nicks) and know that the trick to incriminate Bruce Wagner for the MyBitcoin fraud has failed: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40417.msg492861#msg492861 You are playing with semantics. Laws against theft and murder are not consider regulations. Nobody considers that the USA constitution is a set of regulations. Everybody understand by "regulations" the set of ever changing rules the governments use to manage the economy.And btw, there are lots of libertarians that are against regulations and believe that the law should be an emergent system from the tradition of society. See, I played again with the semantics of regulations, lets not do that. Im glad that you admit in your way that what you said was basically wrong.Btw, Allinvain case is not a confirmed theft. He came here, said he was robbed but there is no confirmation.Its quite amazing that you go around saying things like deregulation! deregulation! without even looking at the data and what has really happened. You are proof that propaganda works. Here you have a nice graph:Im guessing that even after seeing the data proving that the people claiming deregulation were lying to you you are going to continue believing them (propaganda works).In a free market, they would not be allowed to do those things and the quality of the water and the air would be much better. Its only because the government has taken over the management of the environment that they get away with it.Btw, you are resorting to not answering arguments and just launching stupid accusations.Right, because the taxpayer money the banks got was not taken away from people right? Also, the FDIC causes lots of other problems. In fact without the FDIC this crisis would not have been so big.But the gem is this: "avoiding Great Depression 2.0"? We are in the Great Depression 2.0. This is again another proof that propaganda works. Ah, the myth of Standard Oil again. Honestly, you are going through all the points of the basic indoctrination for government regulations. If you really want to debate Standard Oil, lets go at it, but I feel you dont know much about it and will change subject like you have been doing for all the "debate".You are the cause that BP got to pollute the golf and that corporations get to fuck over us. You should try to be less selfish and study a bit more reality for your fellow man. If you support regulations you are a corporatist.There is lots of literature about it. I can point you some if you are interested. So you dish the reaction of the community to your paper because somehow you dont like to believe it is the reaction of the community to your paper, and preffer to mention as "proof" a website outside the community and a lot of the reports on Bitcoin. Let me tell you that the press on Bitcoin has been highly inncaccurate and not only regarding anonimity. I have not seen something reported with more mistakes than Bitcoin. The community tried to correct them for a while, but ended up giving up. You can see the comments in the press thread.Look, you and I (and everybody) know what its going on. Your paper is cool and the work is great, but you decided to give it a bit of dramatism accusing the community of things you should not have, to get more recognition and more press. And that is dishonest from your part. For example, even before your paper, the word pseudo-anonymous was removed from the main website to avoid confussion (even when the word pseudo-anonymous is accurate). The community knows how Bitcoin works  and your accusations are false and only looking to get press. You should not do that, its dishonest from your part. Again, Im not saying Bruce Wagner is not guilty of whatever. Im just saying that regarding MyBitcoin all the evidences point to the people behind MyBitcoin scam trying to frame BW using the drama that is going on. As you say, we should not stop trying to expose scammers if posible.Also, we have to keep in mind that the forum is under a cohordinated attack. Stick to proven facts. Bitcoin is not legal tender, but it is a currency. Also, its an asset with an easily determinable value. I dont have an opinion on BW. I am just sure that with all the accusations that have been going around here there is something bigger going on.I was just stating the fact that his statement is false. The address of MyBitcoin pointing to the same server as OnlyOneTv is a recent event, check it for yourself: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40417.msg492861#msg492861, so its a move clearly made to incriminate BW. Also, it was made in coordination with the acusations about BW being involved with MyBitcoin in this forum.This does not mean that BW is an angel and is not guilty of other things, but the most logical conclussion is that the people behind MyBitcoin is trying to make people believe BW is behind MyBitcoin using the drama to take the heat away from them.Also, you have the emails from Madhatter this morning advising BW to drop the whole thing if he does not want more attacks on him. BW refuses, and the whole drama happens. Actually, its the other way around. Since the whole attack on BW started the MyBitcoin domain has been changed to point to a place to incriminate BW. It seems that the MyBitcoin scammers are using the whole BW drama to hide take attention away from themselves. You are wrong.1. Even if you pay on bitcoins you are required to pay taxes. Whether its enforceable and you do it is another issue.2. Theft is not permited, and that its independent of on what you pay taxes.I feel you need to try harder and talk of things you know and understand.Again, you are wrong. Companies push for whatever they want, but usually it means MORE regulations. Thats the reason why in each of the last decades the regulations in the USA have increased.Yes, despite of what the official propaganda says (and you obviously believe), if you check the data you will see that regulations have increased in each of the last decades in the USA. The deregulation myth is just that, a myth. Please dont believe me, just go and check the data.Again, not true. As net result companies push for more regulations. The sad part is that they have educated a bunch of kids that grow into disfunctional adults into believing that regulations are for their protection.Actually, the FDIC is the perfect example of how regulations work. The FDIC does not have the money to pay for the banks failures and that is why the taxpayers have had to rescue them, specially through the Fed. That you think that you are not paying for the banks failures just shows that propaganda works.No, of course not. If there was no regulations, companies would have to compete and offer good services and good prices. Without regulations, how would the big companies abuse the costumers? We can not allow that. You see under my name where there is a G then an L then an O then a B then a A then another L. That means Global. Keep learning more letters and you will find out.And you dont need to change between your AyeYo nick and your new clone. But what you are saying is not true. Even if you operate in bitcoins you are protected by the legal system of the country you live on. With the MyBitcoin fiasco someone in the forum has explained that he reported to the FBI, but nothing has happened. Well, thats the kind of protection you get from the government monopoly. I dont understand how you can defend that system.I believe that under a competitive justice system you would get much better service, but as anything in social science there is uncertainty about it. But what we can be sure is that the system you defend is not working.Yes, but this is exactly how regulations and the regulatory system works. Having regulations does not mean having some angels coming from the sky to take care of us faliable humans. It means having limited and corruptable humans with monopolly power. And the net results of regulations are always benefiting big companies and hurting the little guy, exactly like the BP case.No. In a regulated environment the big players of the industry get to pass regulations that allow them to cheat the consumers. Thats how regulations work. The rest are just excuses.Well, since you mention MyBitcoin, a Bitcoin bank, let me mention that we are in a depression were there has been record of bank failures under a regulated environment. According to your way of thinking it should not be happening. But its happening.Regulations dont work how you think they work. Ok, Im going to bite and tread you like an adult:On justice:So you mean that if a private legal and enforcing system the USA (or whatever) government would not have a problem with that and would try to mantain its monopolly? You really meant to say that the fact that there is no private justice is not because the government imposes a monopolly on justice?On scams:The BP fiasco where the company polluted the ocean and hurt the health of many many people happened under a government regulated system. The government has stopped any system of market based control and has decided to control anything related to the environment by itself with regulations. Those regulations allowed BP to avoid big compensations to the damnified and will be able to keep operating as they have been in the future. How is this justice? I completely agree with the need to make the Bitcoin system easier to use for everybody (but this is easier said than done) and about the suggestion to include the social variable into the Bitcoin dynamics. Just a couple of things:While I agree people is bad with numbers and foresight, taking the $50 now instead of $52 next week makes sense. And it makes sense precisely because people is bad at foresight, therefore its better for them to have the $50 now, than to risk waiting one week and maybe have some development that changes the conditions and they dont get the $52. People know they are bad with foresight and economics in general, therefore they go for the secure option even when it might not be the best option long term. The point is that they dont have the capacity to judge, so its a good solution for them to take the money now.This is a bad idea in the way you have expressed but its not that bad. It could be done by the private parties. F.e., TradeHill or MtGox could have their own Bitcoin initial package for download with all the tools to use their exchanges. Same with mining pools. But having the Bitcoin community or the main Bitcoin developers choose is a bad idea.It acomplishes the same you are proposing but without the community or the developers having to pick winners and loosers. FirstAscent/AyeYo you have resorted to taking to yourself. Are you feeling ok today? Maybe you can ask your doctor to increase your medication? Yes! Housing bubbles for the win!
I guess the USA should invade Canada and Australia for using the word dollar as well. [citation needed] You might find Bitcoin unrealistic also because its not yellow and it can not be hold on your hand. If using the three points means being Bruce, more than half the forum is Bruce.Its this kind of ridiculous assertions from low count post members that make all the acusations look extremely stupid and basically an orchestrated campaign. Then you had thought wrong and that is YOUR problem and not the problem of Bitcoin. Bitcoin members always stated the nature of Bitcoin and how under certain circumstances the transactions could be linked to the person. There is absolutely nothing new on what you are saying. It had all been said by the Bitcoin community already. You only have to see the reaction on the forums about your original blog post. The reaction was: so what? this was alredy known. The problem is that you are claiming the Bitcoin community was saying the contrary and its very dishonest from your part.And the biggest problem is that I went to your blog post to point exactly this to you in a nice and educated way, but you keep going around with the same dishonest claims, so you are clearly doing it on purpose. If you are acting on good faith you should stop your claims that the Bitcoin community has publicited anything different. What you are saying is nothing special or new. It was well known.Why not? If you really can prove it as you claim why not do it? Its easier than that. You can moderate by not allowing coments claiming something without proof or citation, and even more important not allowing personal attacks (unless they can clearly proof what they are saying about the other forum member is true).With those two clear rules you can get quite a good forum without having to limit the range of ideas someone can express. And you are not going to get it because given my post its obvious what I was trying to say (and also you can guess my position). I wont play stupid rethoric games. Watch out with that. There is a lot of people that disagree with the USA laws regarding minors and sex. In my country, Spain, the law states that its legal for a 14 year old person to have sex with and adult (consensual obviously). Most of the world except the USA has more lax laws regarding under-18 years old and sex. So you are going to find lots of people in the world, a big majority, that thinks that USA laws are stupid, including me. There is nothing exceptional on what Bruce is saying.When I was 17 I started dating a 16 year old girl. When I was 18 and she was 17 we were still dating and having sex. It was my first important relation and one that me (and I believe her as well) will remember forever. Under USA law I would have been a criminal. Its stupid to ruin first relationships and put pressure on teens because of stupid laws. Good luck with your project. Ill give it a try when you have your first episode.If you have notice a lack of reaction it is because the trolls and clones of the forum are more interesting on attacking anything (including the Bitcoin Show by Bruce Wagner) than doing or supporting anything productive. Im sure youll get your round of attacks from when your time comes. But dont dispair, if you ignore them your Bitcoin experience will hopefully be a fun ride. Yes, it was all a big joke in reality.    I want to point out that Nanaimagold and his multinicks did EXACTLY the same they are doing here with Bruce Wagner, but with Praxum. They cite forum posts attributing words that are not theirs to the people they are trying to slander, and when the deception is pointed out they change subject, trying to get people to ignore the fact that they are presenting false proof and trying to keep the pressure in the person they are attacking.You can check how he did the same here with Praxum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=32604.0 (fun starts at page 3). At the end there are always lots of accusations and noise, but absolutely no proof. Same "modus operandis". Again, this forum has been under constant attack from trolls and people with clone users. Low count users is very indicative of being a troll or a clone trying to "create opinion" or give the impression that a majority of the opinions go in some directions when it is not the case (although there are some, few, low count users that are valid). Just understand that if a bunch of low count users are all posting in mass in a thread with opinions in the same direction you know what is happening. This exactly what you are proposing. Politicians want to make money and you are proposing giving to them the monopoly. Its ridiculous. I would recommend to anyone checking the number of posts of the people answering here. Usually the "users" with low post count go in one direction and the user with high post count go in another direction. You are so ridiculous you are sad.Ohhh... your ego is as big as small is your sanity. Please go get attention somewhere else. You are nothing. Nanaimogold you are just an attention whore. Go pay a prostitute if nobody pays you any attention in your real life. This only proves that operations that involve government currency are not anonymous. It says nothing about Bitcoin.And not, Bitcoin is not anonymous, its pseudo-anonymous. I too believe thats the problem. All the attacks started when Bruce said publicy that he was gay. Bernanke can certainly influence in a major way as to create corrections that makes people go into dollars and increase its value and make the rest decline (stocks, commodities, gold, etc...) The problem is if Bernanke mantains it, it would bankrupt the USA government and the banks. So it can produce short term corrections, but it can not do it long term. In the interview reddit did they ask him the same question. He gives a more complete answer. I dont know exactly in what part it is because I watched it time ago, but it starts here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKAaps6mFYkI have not read End the Fed. Ive heard is very good but I tend to read more academic books. But if you want an example it is exactly how Andrew Jackson got rid of the Second Bank of the USA (the third central bank of the USA). He removed the charter and competition appeared. In two years the bank was broke. And yes, it has the added benefit that the Federal Reserve notes, the present dollars, would devaluate and the debt would disappear. Its and added benefit.Yes, if you think about it allows for more control of the people over the government, because people notice taxation, but inflation is very stealth. So the government only financing itself through taxes allows for more citizen control.Ideally you could pay taxes in anything you earned. This is nothing extrange, during the majority of the history of humanity its been this way.Well, I dont support setting gold (or anything else) as legal tender. Gold has qualities to be a good currency and is used as money on its own, it does not need the government. But in the case you proppose, the government would need to set a dollar note/gold ratio adequate for the reverse of gold it has (basically the price of gold would skyrocket).Again, look at history. Andrew Jackson did it and it took two years for the old central bank to go bankrupt. And in those two years people had migrated to other notes. For me, removing the central bank charter and allowing competing currencies is the best and most smooth solution.Yes, if Ron Paul or someone similar does not get elected the keynesian maniacs that are in power will keep abusing the currency until it eventually disappears and they will be forced to produce sound money.
Its false that Ron Paul does not believe in evolution. There is a video that goes around where appparently Ron Paul says he does not believe, but its manipulated. Check the complete version of the video. Ron Paul says that evolution is a good explanation on how live evolved but he has doubts about how the first live being came about and for that moment he does not believe evolution is a good explanation. But it does not matter how many times this is repeated the manipulated video is posted around and ignorant people keeps voting it (f.e. reddit today, that place is mainly ignorant and manipulable people).Btw, one has to wonder who made that manipulated video.Competing currencies is not having more government imposing different currencies and print them to hell. Competing currencies is private currency where people can stop using the currency whenever they want thus forcing the currencies to behave. Competing currency is f.e. Bitcoin. Android is already selling more than iPhone. Its not that Android is growing because it was selling very few and now is selling more than very few. Android is already growing more than iPhone. And yes, the iPhone is a more diverse platform and that can produce some uneven results about customer satisfaction. They will polish that. Again, my argument was not going that way, Apple can not compit against everybody. The iPhone has already lost the race for biggest mobile platform. Anyway, no point in discussing further, you tell me in some years. Because Android had more growth than iOS for example? Apple is the only company that sells phones with iOS. It does not matter that it has the most sold phone. The majority of the rest of the companies are choosing Android and in aggregate Android is growing more than iOS. As I said above, Apple alone could not compete against all the vendors together in the PC area and that is why it lost to MS, and the same is happening now in the mobile area and that is why it has already lost to Android.Apple iPhone and iOS is a thing of the past and the present, but not the future. Because of the way Apple operates it has already lost.EDIT: I have never owned a iPhone or an Android phone. Im still using a Sony Erikson. I dont own stocks either at Google or Apple neither. Better said debt was used as money before coin was used as money, according to him. Is this one a troll or not? I dont remember him/her.If you bother to read my first post that is exactly what Im saying, including the effects of money printing. What does sentiment represent? Or said in another way, how do you calculate sentiment? To add to this, the distrust for the dollar comes from before the end of Bretton Woods by Nixon. People did not trust Bretton Woods as they saw it was a fake monetary system. Already at the end of the 40's Saudi Arabia was having problems getting an once of gold at $35 (and remember FDR devaluated 40% just a decade before), and so the USA had to create special gold coins and send them to the arabs as payment instead of the paper dollars. During the 50's and the 60's the price of gold went crazy (well over $35) a couple of times, until the USA could not control it anymore and had to default during the 70's. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rzCJDAwn0sInteresting video for more than one reason. Nuff said. Yes, but we are past that discussion. We are in the next phase. Stagflation. You are going to be hearing that word a lot from now on. Why not? If its not really useful why do people change a house for dollars? If you are correct why would someone change something you say its "really useful" like a house for something you say its not "really usefull" like dollar bills? Yes, it was interesting to read. You had to filter his obvious marxist views, but its worth the read.I think the titles capitalism and socialism are worthless. There are too many ideologies under those tents, even opposing ones inside the same tent, that it does not tell you anything that someones call himself socialist or capitalist.  Well, that puts us on the negative on this round again. Im kind of getting use to it. Did we actually had a 6:45 one, 10+ million shares? is that some kind of record? Hopefully is another of the recurrent hang ups of the scripts that report the data. Here we go again... If you want to "fight deflation" then yes, the central bank is doing the correct thing.I dont think its correct to "fight deflation". Define real wealth.   Mirate esto: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=32958.0
You need to learn to read. It would create deflation IF there wasnt a central bank increasing the money supply. Hahaha, no, its not me.Ive been to the USA and Canada a couple of times, but when I was younger. Of course. When the crisis started the financial system went into panic and as the money printing started again the benefits went up again. But now the money is starting to leak everywhere, and even truck drivers are starting to get wage increases. Thats the sign that heavy price inflation is around the corner. According to keynesianism wages can not go up when there is high unemployment. And because of this, they argue, prices wont go up much, because any upward presure will meet people having stagnant wages. This is their explanation of why printing money in a depression is ok. But reality begs to differ.The problem with the stated above is that they are looking at the economy through aggregates, which is a horrible way of looking at the economy and leads to big mistakes. What happens in reality is that not all workers are competition for the rest of the workers. For example, a guy with experience on the housing industry that is now unemployed is no competition for a engineer working at Google, therefore when the Google engineer negotiates his next increase it does not affect him much that there is a lot of construction workers unemployed or not. Thats why in the last year we have seen a lot of the more skilled workers getting better wages, even in the face of high unemployment.Now the raise in wages is starting to move onto less skilled workers and its the first evidence for the wave of high inflation that we will see.http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/08/first-significant-hint-of-wage-price.html I refuse to have a Bitcoin meeting in California. They are the world producers of porn and that would create bad reputation for Bitcoin.   Just to clarify, this is because of the client, not because of the Bitcoin protocol. The Bitcoin protocol allows you to send a transaction with any fee you want including 0 (whether is processed or not thats another issue). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoqY6CpgpSE But the government will never accept anything but their own currency to pay for taxes because that would undermine the monopolly on money. Maybe at local level its posible, like some USA state that accepts gold and silver to pay for taxes. I completely agree with your analisys but I dont think we need to make an effort to get Bitcoin business taxed. They will get taxed even if they dont try to. What would be great is to have the government accept taxes in the currency being used in the trades and not only in dollars, but I dont think changing that is doable right now. Not really.The libertarian position is defense and respect for individual rights. This includes the right to freely engage in business, but there are a lot of people that got into libertarianism for other reasons, for example civil libertarian issues.Not all libertarians are great businessman not they have to be. We just know that allowing a free market to happen will benefit us by having better quality products and lower prices as opposed to socialdemocracy that always helps the oligarchies.EDIT: Btw op great chart. Shows that Bitcoin is more stable than most people think. Apple has made the same mistake they did against MS and they dont have any intention of chaging (and maybe its too late already for them to have any impact in the mobile world). Apple only allows its OS to operate in their hardware (Jobs himself said that Apple was a hardware company that just happens to make software for that hardware). So they are always one company against the rest. Its a battle they can not and will not win.When the PC OS battle was starting Apple had the best OS, way better than MS, but Apple's OS only ran on Apple hardware, and MS offered a "cheap" solution to the rest of the hardware vendors, so they all adopted MS. So MS got most of the OS market share and the programs started being developed only for DOS and then Windows. That sent Apple to nowhere because they were all alone against the rest of the industry. They went almost bankrupt with MS, the company that had initially a worse product than them, buying a big part of their stocks.Its the same story with Android. Android is Open Source and almost free to implement for the rest of the mobile hardware vendors. So its gaining traction (not only in the mid and low level sector). Also, I can tell you programmers are very pissed off with the Apple shop acceptance policy and they are deserting Apple and the development of Android apps is outgrowing the iOs.Its sad that a great company like Apple is making the same mistakes again. They have already lost the mobile battle, its a matter of time only. Most of the images dont work. Good catch. Apple has already lost the mobile (and probably the tablet) battle to Android. Find a hobby. Seguramente si envías bitcoins a una cuenta de TradeHill o MtGox, los transformas a dólares (0'6% de comisión) y de ahí se los envías a las cuentas de la gente a la que tienes que enviar (no se cual es la comisión) seguramente hasta te sale más barato.Una vez has hecho esto unas cuantas veces, se lo explicas y les convences para que acepten bitcoins directamente. Si te ponen dudas diles que pueden gastarlos aquí: http://www.bitcoindeals.com/ I did say it, just not as explicit as you had stated it, granted my statement could be left open to other options but that was not the intent.[/quote]I stand corrected then. What you are not saying is that this situation was happening because the USA was printing more dollars than the gold it had. If you promise to pay gold for each dollar you print, and then start printing dollars... well, you are going to run out of gold. The printing to pay for the Vietnam war and getting Nixon re-elected was the final nail in the coffin. Even the gold haters are coming in: http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/08/anti-gold-roubini-recommends-physical.html Whether this is another sign of a trap or not Ill leave to you. The deflation argument again reshufled. I really think that these people get a lot of hits (and thus ad money) by trashing Bitcoin and that is why they do it.
LOLI agree. If there is space for lower prices it will happen. It didnt. Its just the trolls of the forum trolling people. If you see the post of the girl arrested that I have posted above they were arrested for selling lemonade without a license and not for anything the trolls are saying. You have showed yourself incapable of discussing economics. Everytime the discussion gets a bit deep you chicken out and disappear from the conversation.Troll, go tell the people paying you that we want better quality trolls. He did not said that. Read the comments, he is asked the same question and answers it. One of the girls arrested has a blog post expalining the experience. Btw, they were not charged with using someone else property, they were charged with selling lemonade and not obeying the police. According to the USA government the "Lemonade Libertarion" group is the new big thread (sadly its no joke).http://megmclain.com/?p=48If after reading this anyone is not convinced the USA has become a police state I dont know what will. They can do all that just because someone sold lemonade without license. Judging by the reaction I say that the mining community is very mature. There were issues with the pound but the USA was running out of gold. You just have to check the decreasing level of gold reserves through the 50's and 60's. And how at different times during that period the USA was unable to keep the dollar pegged to $40/oz, and the price shut up to almost $50. Then you have the deal with the rest of the world to stabilize the price of gold and latter on the fight with South Africa, until the USA gov could not find more tricks and was forced to default, breaking the gold conversion.Btw, the relation between the USA central bank, the Fed, and the pound go way beyond the 70's. In the 20's they were already playing along. And this is the perfect example why the media is like it is: propaganda works. He is a known troll. Not even worth answering. Just ignore him. The police is shutting down a lot of kid stands that try to sell lemonade to earn a few dollars during summer (like they use to do) because they require to pay a license. We can not allow the kids to take business away from the big operators and so we need regulations to keep the big business safe... This was an act of protest against it. That it is ilegal to sell limonade without a license. Its an act of protests. Its civil disobedience. This people are not policeman, they are thugs.Your taxdollars at work:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04MNf1YdNxI Stop feeding the trolls. Weve tell them about property rights in environmental issues, they know not all libertarians are anarchists, weve tell them there would be courts in anarchy. They keep ignoring it, because they are trolls.This was an interesting thread with adult conversation and they are derailing it. As long as you keep feeding them they will keep derailing it with stupid answers. He is a troll, dont bother. What a useless example. Johnyj are you trying to be the member that exposes more economic fallacies per day?Why would C and D not start doing something else? Or fish and get fruit for themselves? Why does GDP matter? If people want to consume less, so be it. I am too lazy to look it up now but I have seen Kevin Carson refering to himself as a socialist and a the rest of the mutualist that I know do also. Benjamin Tucker was a socialist, as was Lysander Spooner, and they are his ideological precedents. At the end that branch comes from Proudhom that is a socialist. They are not marxists, but they are socialists.I personally dont care much if someone calls him/herself socialist. I think the word socialism is a bit useless. I dont see how a stalinists, a progressive, an anarcho-syndicalist and a mutualist can all call themselves socialists and assume they are in some kind of common tent, when they are opposites. What does a stalinists have in common with an anarcho-syndicalist? Yes, they might use similar vocabulary and rethoric, but thats all.Btw, I dont see how anarcho-syndicalism/anarcho-communism makes any sense. When I discovered mutualism (which is what lead me to become an anarchist) I also investigated anarcho-syndicalism/anarcho-communism. What I read is that they oppose the market and money itself, but they want to substitute it with something that looks very similar to a market and money. So basically they want to form local communes that would exchange (not trade!! that would be a market, they exchange, but I see no difference) their products in some exchangers (not a market!!, again I dont see the difference) based in the time it has taken to produce the goods. So basically imposing a "time to produce" monetary standard, but again, its not money according to them. I dont see how a market based in some "time" monetary standard is not a market and is not money, but also there are several problems with this situation, basically that producers would be compelled to lie about the time it took to produce the products to adquire certain goods. According to my very superficial readings anarcho-syndicalists argue it wont happen because, since "capitalism" is gone, people will act very different. To me this is wishfull thinking. While it is true that the dynamics of capitalism creates certain harmful ractions, believing that without capitalism humans will react according to how each anarcho-syndicalists thinks society has to be is 100% wishfull thinking. When you question this, they reffer to Marx writtings as scientific proof (!!!!!). It seems to me like a religion, where once something has happened (you die and got to heaven, capitalism ends) everybody will start acting by your personal and subjective moral standards. Honestly, I dont see how it makes any sense. It has been true until now that when there has been a downturn investors have cashed out into dollars. But at some point it might not be the case and investors could start cashing out into precious metals. Im always checking the price of gold and silver when the stock markets crash. If they keep going in opposite directions it means the dollar is fucked. I dont think it will happen now, but its very possible at some point during this crisis. This is an economic fallacy. This "model" supposes that there is only one type of good being produced.This does not happen in the real economy. Its only inflationist propaganda. Are you? You are very trusting of the burocrats.
Why do you think this will happen? Only because of charting or do you have analize fundamentals as well (not judging just curious)? We are discussing the validity and reach of property rights. You can not justify owning something by saying that you own it. We are discussing exactly that concept, what it means to own something.Again, it all boils down to your idea of property rights.If you are able to have a house of $50.000 there unused I am sure you are capable of storing some wealth in other ways that allow you to recover from your loss. Also, Im not being very strick. If you visit your house from time to time, it can still be considered yours. I dont think its fair or socially stable in a voluntary society to have a bunch of capital unused for years and years. People will not accept that arrangement and will lead to violantions of property rights. Only under a represive society those type of situations are accepted.Yes, its like that with those people. I think that when they see a thread with adult conversations they come to distract.EDIT: Btw, lemonginger last time I check mutualist were socialists. I dont consider myself a mutualist or a socialist, although I have taken or share a lot of ideas with them, because I dont feel that strongly about wage labour as they do. I guess Im near them, but somewhere in between. Are you trying to keep the debate honest?  I guess that what happened last month here in the EU with the people poisoned by food did not happened since we have the government taking care of safety. Or should I say that since you support those agencies you are guilty of what happened?You can try to play all the rethoric tricks you want. You have said nothing. Yes, that is the broad picutre. What you expose has been there for months and things were more or less stable. Im just saying that there is something in particular going on right now that is driving everybody nuts and in panic but I dont know what it is.Also, the debt is a big problem but its not only the debt. The distortion of the capital structure is stopping the recovery as well. The most dramatic part is probably the people. You have a lot of people that specialized in the construction sector, in my country people stopped studying because they were getting payed a lot in the construction sector. What are these people going to do now that all that demand for construction labour is never going to come back (at least in some decades)? Are they going to go back to study again that they are over 30 and with family and obligations? Are they condemned to low-level paying jobs? Are there so many low-level paying jobs? The situation is dire.And the sad thing is that there is no magic solutions and the objectives of the solutions being applied are to mantain the status quo at any price, no matter the consquences for the people.If history is any reference, when the system is so gone, governments and society in general never take the difficult (but correct) decissions and just keep going until everything collapses. Bitcoin no usa demasiado ancho de banda para los estandares a los que estamos acostumbrados aquí, así que supongo que tampoco habrá problema en Cuba en ese sentido, pero desconozco hay mucha diferencia.Realmente Bitcoin puede ser una gran manera de enviar dinero a Cuba. Yo diría que hay negocio, aunque faltaría ver la respuesta de las autoridades claro. Creo que hay alguien que ha creado un sistema así en UK. And reducing taxes so people can self-organize saftey consumer associations, yes. But honestly, there are other more pressing matters than those. Curiously enough there was a proposed law in France to tax gold and the the NO won. Wonder why the politicians voted no on that one...   Corruption always find ways around the law.Also, by giving government money by numbers of votes you are punishing small parties and benefiting big parties. They get more votes so they get more money, because they have more money they get more votes, because they get more votes they get more money, ... Its a vicious circle that stops any kind of political diversity. Something funny is going on. It seems nobody says what is happening, but there is something big going on.ECB is buying gov bonds in record quantities, and it is suspected this time includes spanish and italian bonds.The Fed is injecting money in the banking system again.The major stock markets are collapsing.Gold and silver are shutting up.I dont know the exact reason for all this panic, but something is happening. If you dont want the premiums of physical gold or silver (I live more comfortable knowing I own "the thing", and not some claim on it) and are wise enough to distrust SLV and GLD since they dont have what they promise, you could look into miner stocks. Its more risky though.Be careful with the COMEX contracts as well. The COMEX change their regulations during this crisis and now it does not guarantee the physical, you can be payed back with SLV and GLD. Ive said:And my view on private property:andIt is true that I have not defined free market. Im an anarchist so I see a free market completelly free of any government interference. Well, in my view its not enough that someone comes after 15 years and says: "hey! Im still interested" and then goes away again. In my opinion in that case that property would be unowned. But I can tell you that I have discussed this with anarcho-capitalists and they consider that "no use" is not cause enough to declare a property unowned.I think people understand that we dont have a free market. Some (so called) "economists" like to say stupid things to blame the free market, but thats it.I already have, no? Thats silly. The Fed should buy my house and my products. That way the (my) economy would recover very quickly.And the price of food is very cheap, poor people have it too easy, so more money printing and higher food prices is not going to matter. Because in reality porn is degrading to men and some women like it. You can see in the movies how women use the men to obtain sex and use them as sexual objects without worrying for their emotional needs. Its discusting how some women can do that to a man. Yes, if you read what I wrote I never claimed that as long as you are using a property it can be taken from you.Well, I agree (thats the point I was trying to make), but anarcho-capitalists (at least the "offical" doctrine) dont agree with this.I dont think the most common use of the word capitalism is private control of property. What is commonly understood is that the system we have now is capitalism. I dont think there is much discussion about it. If you go to the street and start asking what word would they use to define the present system, capitalism would win and by a big distance.I oppose the present system, a system of government control over the market, therefore and according to your own words, I oppose capitalism.Well, there are degrees of control. Usually its only called fascism at the later stages of the process.But its not really a matter of definitions. Usually left-libertarians, while defending individualism, also are more positive about the role of cooperatives in a free market, while anarcho-capitalists usually consider them inefficient. In general, left-libertarians are more concern against hierarchical structures and consider the present system very different of what a free market would produce, whereas anarcho-capitalist consider it more similar (even when they correctly point that its not a free market and some things would be different). Depends of what you mean by private ownership. I dont support the idea of strong property rights as anarcho-capitalist do. I have a less absolute and more utilitarian view. I think ownership or exclusive use rights is something that emerges in a society because its the most efficient economic structure. F.e. anarcho-capitalist say that once a property has been homesteaded it belongs to that person forever unless he decides to trade it. To me it seems unreasonable and since property is a social structure, once a property has been unused for a long period of time it can be considered unowned and homesteaded again.Also, capitalism implies more than private property of capital. Contrary to what some people think, the word "capitalists" was used before Marx. Previous to Marx, clasical liberals (libertarians) and individualist anarchists used the word capitalists in a demeaning way to describe the people who was using the system of government control over the market to unjustly adquire wealth. Capitalism implies government control over the market. I oppose that and support a free market.A free market. Thats an interesting twist. How do you control who connects to where and who pays what? F.e. a pipe is providing water to company A that provides water to 3 towns, but company B decides to connect to a earlier point of that pipe, leaving company A without enough water to provide the needs of those 3 towns. Who decides if company B can connect or not? Who decides if more investment is needed, and if thats the case how is it payed?Following your idea you could argue that in a free market a cooperative of water distributors would be more eficient that companies alone because they could share the infrastructure more efficiently. Im a free market anti-capitalist.The author is a libertarian. Give the article a chance, youll like it. I will assume that when you say "public" in reality you mean government controlled and not public.The problem is that you dont have competition at the producer level and thus there is no incentive to provide water of good quality or at good price. Turn the camera towards the speakers.
Ya que estás puedes informarnos de las comisiones de cada opción? Yo tengo pensado empezar a usar un exchange. Gracias. http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2011/08/libertarian-anticapitalism/ Op is just trolling.But there are a couple that sell porn videos for bitcoins, altough I dont see the business with all the free porn around. Cam services might have more traction. I believe porn is degrading to men.Btw, the Internet developed because of this "shaddy" business that is porn and obviously did not go anywhere else after that. There is a very cheap way to remain free: Just offer a secure and trustworthy way to store funds anonymously to the politicians and corporatists of the rest of the countries. Dont install 11.7 on Linux: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=32520.0You can get limitless OC with 11.6. Thats not accetable because then she could compete with the big business and then what would that regulation be good for? For what I know, there is a lot of references for that quote but none of them is an original source. Its all bad researched documentaries and such. It would be nice that it was true, though. There is no proof that Wilson said this quote. It has been referenced in the Internet and in some "less than exact" documentaries, but there is absolutely no reference that he actually said it. Everything indicates that the quote is false.It would be a nice quote, but apparently he did not say it. Esto es falso, solo habían 6 bloques encontrados (300 bitcoins) cuando Satoshi hizo publico el proyecto Bitcoin. Puedes comprobarlo en la blockchain. In this case you need to go to spam the Offtopic section. 7 hours now.Are we trying to break a record again or a script went rogue again? In the year 2040 the world government moves to impose a monopolly of its own issued currency and bans the Bitcoin network. Soon the Bitcoin resistance is born. Thousends of free and courageous citizens around the world hide their mining rigs in abandoned basements and installations, far away from the reach of the money censors. I could not resist... I dont think nature is so easily controllable, pretense of knowledge and delusions of control comes to mind. Some of this people spending a lot of money on genetic augmenations are going to be up for a big surprise. How does the backup pool works? Does it try to connect back to the main pool? How long does it take and can it be configurable? Actually he has a non-disrubtive way of changing the monetary system and that is just removing the privileges the Federal Reserve receive from the government and allow competition of currencies. That way the change would be progressive. You have a point there. But it really depends.If Ron Paul only manages to change a bit the direction and put some control on the dollar but without changing the monetary laws, then yes, it would be bad for Bitcoin.BUT Ron Paul has proposed laws and has stated several times that his intention is not trying to influence the central bank system (he thinks its unworkable), but to eliminate legal tender laws and allow competition in currency. If he managed to acomplish this it would be HUGE for Bitcoin. Come on, saying that the republicans are for small government is like saying democrats care for the people. Since when a republican president has decreased the size of government? Ronald Reagan, "the last republican hero", raised taxes, created the department of education, increased the debt, etc... Republicans are a joke. 1. The developers are volunteers. Nobody is paying them. If they dont contribute they are not being lazy, they are just doing whatever they need to do. If you want you can take their place and contribute to the community.2. Encrypted wallet is already in the git branch and will be in the next release. #2. Dont spam the forums.
AyeYo you are an asshole. You are the perfect example why this forum has been derailed. Its impossible to have an honest debate with assholes like you around.How do progressives like this one pass as loving and caring human beings? This is false. Government education hursts the lower classes, since its always lower quality and the taxes stop them from being able to look for better options, while the rich can afford those better options. This way society gets more divided and the poor have less oportunities of improving themselves.Government education is just another way that socialdemocracy has to hurt the poor and mantain the status quo.I highly doubt you have really been exposed to libertarianism, otherwise you would know this makes no sense. This is not what libertarians say.Libertarianism does not say that without regulations businessman will all become angels that care for their fellow citizens. What libertarianism say is that competition and self-organization by the citizens and workers do a much better job at avoiding abuses than the government and its burocrats. In fact, its quite obvious for anyone that can look to the present situation without being blinded by ideology that regulations is a way for business to avoid competition. Regulations benefit big business and hurt consumers.And history proves the same. I find ironic that you mention that historic evidence prove that we need regulations when it proves the opposite.Sorry, but I dont believe that you were a libertarian because you clearly dont understand libertarianism. Its not that.To understand the attitude towards libertarianism of some autoritarian left-wingers you just have to read their blogs and news sites. Since libertarianism started growing after the 2008 crisis, they have been on a crusade to attack libertarianism with the most absurd arguments. Since all this people are emotionally attached to those sites and have no previous experience with libertarianism, they believe them and adopt the same agresive and intolerant attitude. Its not about reason and understanding, its about attacking the "enemy". They adopt that emotion.Thats why you see this knee jee reaction towards libertarianism of some sectors with the most absurd arguments. And its also why logic and reason does not work on them. They keep bringing absurd arguments and changing subject constantly because its not about understanding something, its about attacking the enemy. Even if they dont really understand why. Its a pure emotional reaction they got from the sites they visit. This is just you rationalizing why you are not a libertarian.I was a social-democrat until 27 raised by social-democrat parents, and when I discover libertarianism I saw that it makes much more sense than any other ideology.Anyone saying what you pointed above really has not read anything about libertarianism. Its only "logical" since they already spy the phone calls...Here in Europe they are trying to pass very similar laws. Its very sad. Isnt this the base of authoritarism? What I feel is right, is right, and violence is justified to impose it on others. Choose any topic on economics, the one you feel more confident, and open I will open a new thread.Catalan and spanish. The problem with this is that I am not american and english is not my first language. I would have problems debating you live in english. Why not do it in text? Whats the problem? You seem to have no problem writing here.Ill let you choose the topic in economics you want to debate about. I propose a debate about economics to FlipPro (and anyone else). You and me only, no "OMG LOL You are diluded WTF", speaking like adults, replying honestly to what the other person is saying, not cheapshots, etc...If you accept well open a new thread and will debate. I keep asking why do you come to this community to insult people. Have you tried using reason instead of dealing with politics as black and white and insults to people? Can you explain to us how you get to this judgements? When Im in a situation how can I know if me or someone else is being greedy? Whats the rule?Its obviously a trick question, because in reality there is no rule. Thanks. So they are reducing some of the subsudies but not stopping them. The most funny part is this:Typical from politicians, we say we cut, but we dont really. I said what I said, and it was correct. You call me a lier for it. You can now claim to read my mind and pretend I was implying whatever you want.You dont even know my political positions but it has not stopped accusing me of a bunch of stuff. Regarding what you are saying, its the fault of progressives. You justify the polticians having more control and produce the corporate system we have now where corporations fight and lobby politicians for tax regulations (f.e. Warren Buffet) while diluted people play their game and ever cheer them.You corporatists will justify anything. I said corporate tax rate. Then you change it to corporate tax rate income to GDP and call me a lier. You corporatists are just incredible.Ayeyo, I gave you a full critique of keynesian economics and you completely chicken out and disaperared. Im still waiting yo respond at any point on keynesian economics. When the discussion got serious and just a bit technical you chicken out and disappeared. More rethoric. Are you capable of using a rational argument?If you really believe this you are even more naive than you seem.Who says we are ok with it? You progressives are guilty of this situation.And in the USA corporations pay higher tax rate than in Germany. If you like Germany I guess you support lowering taxes for corporations in the USA right? Or this Germany things is just another of your stupid talking points?The USA has the highest corporate rate in the industrialized world. Germany and all the northen european countries have lower corporate rates. Is that the model you are defending? The only one fighting for rich people like Warren Buffet is you. Progressivism is just corporatism with a nice smile.But let me use a language you will understand: You are delusional, you dont see the truth, ary ary, blablabla... Better that way? Im really fed up with the empty rethoric. Have you ever trying saying something?Nobody has proposed a society with no rules.etc... you guys keep repeating talking points, using empty rethoric and isulting people. Lets see where it gets you.And btw, congratullations on completely derailing the thread with stupid rethoric. You seem incapable of being rational. I understand, but I wont buy any Bitcoin t-shirt in anything else than bitcoins. Im sure you understand as well. If you manage to solve it, send me a private message, I like your simple designs. Im sure there is a very obvious reason, but here goes anyway: Why do TradeHill and MtGox (and the rest) dont use GoogleCheckout if it works for this guy?
I dont understand why you come to this community to just repeat talking points and insult people. I doubt that is true because Ive talk to a lot of paulites about Bitcoin and nobody has mention, not even the ones that did not like the idea. You are probably confusing with someone else. Im in Spain. I have place at my house as well. Thats a nice one.But now seriously, Ive been looking to buying some simple bitcoin tshirts and I like yours. If you accept bitcoins Ill buy 3. Neither indirectly or directly. If you keep reading I wrote: I did not claim such a thing. Try again (and if you want an honest debate, stop the trolling attitude). Why would there be a Ixcoin table at a Bitcoin conference? It seems as weird as a Nokia stand at a Motorola conference.Not trying to be agressive or anything, Im just curious. I really dont get what a Ixcoin table would do at a Bitcon conference. No. Both my parents work for the government.But you and I are being hurt by those actions even when we wont inherit a company, because it produces a concentration of wealth in fewer hands and reduces competition.One thing is being clever by respecting and profiting from benefiting your fellow citizens. Its very different profitting from imposing rules by force onto your fellow citizens. The first helps human progress, the later destroys society and hurts the people.

To select a different card: AMDOverdriveCtrl -i X (where X is the number of the device you want to adjust). Its all explained in the AMDOverdriveCtrl docs. Warren Buffet is not rich by being nice to people like you and me.http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/stop-coddling-warren-buffettIm sure Warren Buffet will thank you for voting politicians that make him rich. Greed is, and we need to deal with it. Society should be stablished upong fundations that uses greed to increase prosperity. Trying to create a society that either tries to ignore that greed is a human characteristic or tries to make greed like the only moral ideal will be a failure.And one have to keep in mind that everybody is or has the potential to be greedy, no matter if they work as politicians, businessman or wage workers. Even voters are (stupidly) greedy. Thats sexy. Im running Ubuntu 11.04 and can use AMDOverdriveCtrl both with GUI and without GUI. Catalyst 11.7 is no good on Linux. It takes the cpu to 100% and heavily slows the miners.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=32520.0 Well, its not trivial, but in very evident cases it could be reverted. The problem really is, if something like this happened, Bitcoin credibility would suffer a big hit. I see. I strongly recommend ending ME1 and then importing your character into ME2 and save the character for ME3. Its a lot more fun. Its also a good idea going full paragon or full renegade. The game allows middle way, but its not made for it and you will loose some options if you dont have a certain level of renegade/paragon at certain stages. This is a good point. I had not though of this.I still dont see why, you keep saying it but there is no proof. The money you need to control 51% of the network is huge and you are up to gain not much. I see an attack by some government or something much more probable than by a thieve. If you want to make money, you could just spend the money in mining.True.Fees were zero at the beggining and have been increasing. Its spected that this will continue as more transactions start happening in the Bitcoin network.Will have to see, but I doubt a 50% attack is economically viable.
I dont think Im explaining myself properly today. Let me repeat the concept again:Everything else equal, it dos not change anything in regards to the network security or the incentive to mine if the miners get money through inflation or only through fees. The inflation is a method of creating and distributing bitcoins, not a way to finance an initial investment in mining.The reason why is the same is because if there was no inflation the value of bitcoins would rise faster (everything else equal), and the incentive would be the same. It does not matter if you get 55 bitcoins that can buy X electricity, or you get 18 bitcoins that can buy the same X electricity.PS: People are paying transaction fees, I dont see how miners including low-fee transactions is a problem (its what makes Bitcoin great, low fees!), and yes, we dont know the rest, nobody does, thats why Bitcoin behaves in a free market way, so it can be handled efficiently. Communism would be no wages. Fair-wages is an oximoron in communism, as wages can never be fair for a comunist. The profit of the attack is directly related to the value of the bitcoins stolen. Performing a 51% attack is very expensive. So the higher the value of the bitcoins the higher the incentives to attack the network and the higher the resources that can be dedicated to the attack. The same is true in the opposite direction, the lower the value of bitcoins the lower the incentives to attack the network and the lower the resources that can be dedicated to the attack.But the same is true for mining. The higher the value of the bitcoins the more hashing power you can dedicate to mining (since the bitcoins you earn from fees allows you to buy more electricity and more hardware). Again, the same is true in opposite direction.So you can see its not a problem.Also, note that if you perform a 51% attack on bitcoins to steal them, as soon as its known (and it will be quick as people complain) the bitcoins you have stolen would probably go down in price quick and you would end up loosing money. Please, can we stop asking the same question again and again? Specially when they are nonsensical.There will be no "post mining era". The block reward does not disappear suddenly, it goes down progressively over time. The reward will disappear completely by 2040. If by that time Bitcoin does not produce a lot of activity and therefore a lot of fees, it might be that it was not needed or that the government has managed to keep imposing the monopolly on money. The idea of the initial reward is a way to create and distribute currency. Since Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no central authority that can create new bitcoins and give them to whoever they want.But back to your question and hopefully shutting up the nonsense, the process of adapting the hashing power (whether is up or down) will be gradual because the reduction on the reward is gradual. You do NOT need to edit the BIOS. Since version 11.6 of the Catalyst driver, you can overclock (and underclock) the cards to whatever you want in Linux. So install 11.6 and use something like AMDOverdriveCtrl or similar.

Capitalists will tell you that capitalism is based on ethics, that its the most ethical system. It doesnt show that. El 11.7 no va bien en Linux. Si estás usando Linux quedate en 11.6. Looks amazing. Aquí tienes una lista de los comerciantes que aceptan bitcoins: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade (bueno, los que se han apuntado). La lista de servicios en castellano es mucho más reducida, esperemos que vaya creciendo poco a poco: https://es.bitcoin.it/wiki/ComercioLo que dices es cierto, pero también puede ser que el comerciante gane porque el precio del cambio bitcoins-dolar suba. Pero lo mismo pasa cuando compras un producto a los chinos o a los estadounidenses. Tienes que añadir el cambio a la ecuación. De hecho, de variaciones en el precio de la moneda no te libras ni cuando operas solo en una moneda. Que pasa si vendes algo y de repente la moneda se devalua (suben los precios)? El comerciante ha perdido.La ventaja de Bitcoin en todo esto es que no es una moneda inflacionaria, a diferencia de las monedas de los gobiernos. Aunque ahora Bitcoin esté en la fase inflacionaria, creadon 50 bitcoins cada 10 minutos, es solo para crear moneda y distribuirla. Poco a poco la tasa de creación de bitcoins irá disminuyendo, por ejemplo en año y medio se crearán solo 35 bitcoins cada 10 minutos. Así hasta que llegue a cero cuando se hayan creado 21 millones de bitcoins. Esto será en 2040. A partir de entonces se mantendrá constante la cantidad de bitcoins. Debido a la naturaleza no inflacionaria de Bitcoin, es previsible que si se va adoptando como moneda su precio respecto al del resto de monedas suba (sin tener en cuanta fluctuaciones a corto plazo). Compara esto con las monedas de los gobiernos que siempre están devaluandose (es la política oficial).Pero si un comerciante aún así no quiere ahorrar bitcoins y solo quiere usarlos como servicio de pago (algo así como una VISA) hay servicios que le hacen el cobro en bitcoins al cliente pero envían dólares al comerciante, a cambio de una tasa obviamente. Por ejemplo, yo conozco este: https://bit-pay.com/, pero puede haber otros. El comerciante también puede tener una cuenta en MTGox o TradeHill y intercambiar los bitcoins por dólares o euros casi inmediatamente (lo ideal es automatizar este proceso, pero claro, hay que programarlo, a cambio te ahorras la tasa). Yo creo que esta última opción (usar Bitcoin solo como servicio de pago) es ser corto de miras, pero es totalmente viable. The attack of the trolls.I bet you its only one troll with multiple accounts. Its not only a problem of being authoritarian, its a problem that without price mechanism you can not distribute resources efficiently because information is local and (to the human capacity) infinite.The Zeitgest movement just ignore this and keeps repeating that without money everything will be dandy. They have resurrected a lot of marxists economic fallacies (most of them dont even know where the ideas they repeat come from).
Cuando la empresa recibe el bitcoin, ha cobrado, ya posee ese bitcoin.La empresa entonces tiene dos opciones, guardar el bitcoin para usarlo ellos mismos, o también puede decidir venderlo a cambio de su moneda local si lo necesita (en MtGox o en cualquier otro sitio, normalmente hay intercambiadores locales). En el foro diferentes personas que tienen una empresa han reportado como han convencido a sus proveedores para aceptar bitcoins. Esto es lo ideal, así se cierra el circulo y se empieza a crear una economía que funciona solo en bitcoins.Bienvenido al foro. Scrow system. andYou said it.Also:So the bitcoins obtained from the fees are real revenues but the 50 bitcoins obtained are not real revenues. And this is because "it(they, the 50 bitcoins) does not have any value outside of it(the Bitcoin system)", but I guess the bitcoins of the fees are a different type of bitcoins that have value outside of the system?How do you want me not to think you are either a troll or dont know what you are talking about? Serious question: do you understand how Bitcoin works exactly?If, for example, the network today or in the last month had double of transactions the cost for the miners to process those transactions would have been the same (not more as you suggested). The real limit on the number of transactions in the Bitcoin network does not come from electricity costs, in that sense is irrelevant, but in the amount of data that would need to be stored.The cost of electricity is correlated with the value of bitcoins. If bitcoins are worht more (meaning its purchasing power goes up) it incentivizes more investment in mining. The opposite is true as well. So if the value of bitcoins goes up, more miners will appear and the electricity costs will go up (but probably not in terms of bitcoins).Your thinking is flawed big time both in costs and revenues. In costs you are missing the cost of hardware which I can tell you is a big part of it, but you already knew this. What you are missing is a part of the revenues, the 50 bitcoins that are created everytime a block is found. That is real income for the miners.Honestly, your stimation of the balance of Bitcoin mining was very poor. You either dont understand how Bitcoin works or are a troll. New low in stupidity.http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/08/new-policy-government-now-pays-airlines.html He is comparing it to the volume of bitcoin transactions in one day, not the total number of bitcoins.The whole post is playing with numbers, ellaborate trolling if you ask me. Yes, I agree, but he was refering to the big "drop" that the 8 hour stimate had this morning. Please, send a report to Gigabyte. They will probably ignore us, but nevertheles if they receive a bunch of complains the might solve it. If we dont tell them anything they sure wont solve it. You are confusing growth in the number of transactions with increase on the value of bitcoins. Ive seen you in better times BubbleBoy.Gold was not a competing currency, it was the backing of the government currency! Rosevelt then prohibited phisical gold to be able to devaluate the dollar 40%, that is reducing the amount of promised gold in the gold certificates it was issuing, the dollar.In fact, at some point the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates because it was afraid of a run in the dollar (people demanding gold that they did not have).Ive already told you that the costs go beyond the costs of issueing the fiat currency.So the miners dont care if the coins they get are secure or not? Aha, very interesting concept. And as answer to my question you say that:Aha, also very interesting concept. It clear all my doubts. Apparently the problem is not in all Gygabyte boards but only in a few models. I can confirm the Gigabyte 990fx UD5 is affected. Prove it.Btw, if absolutes dont exists, what can we say about sentences that say that absolutes dont exist? Why do you thing the economy can no longer support everyone by means of working for wages?Do you think the present unemployment situation is due to technology or is due to the discordination that produced the crisis?The malfare state is not a "current solution", its a sheme to keep control over the system.This is the best website in the Internet on free market socialism: http://c4ss.org/ (highly recommended for everybody, and they have been supporting of Bitcoin). Also, this blog is one of the oldest left-llibertians blogs that exist: http://aaeblog.com/ Gresham law has nothing to do in this case. Gresham law only applies when there is a fixed artificial rate between two currencies, which is not the case here. Alternative currencies disappear because the government makes it very difficult for them to opperate.You still have not addressed your mistake regarding the cost of a fiat currency.Its not useless, it goes to secure the network. How will you create a distributed currency without securing it somehow? It seems to me you are describing the present situation (government regulations). This is not true. The amount of electricity needed to create a block that handles 1 or thousends of transactions does not change. Arent you a bit biased? What is the cost for the government to impose and mantain a monpolly on money? You can not count the cost of printing a piece of paper and saying that is all the cost involved in fiat money. Same here. Pool and website down. Have you seen how the "hashing power" is already back up near 15000? Its not the total hashing power changing, its the luck of the miners influencing the stimations. The problem is that solar energy is not (yet?) even comparable in cost to fosil fuel energy. At the beggining solar energy was not even profitable, it costed more energy to produce a panel and the rest of the electronics than the energy it would obtain in its lifetime. Go figure. At the beggininng solar energy was more of a lobbying things than anything else.But even right now, its infinitevely more profitable to buy fosil fuel created electricity than buying a solar panel. If solar panels increase in efficiency this might change, but that is a big if.
I visit Zerohedge often (I dont read much of the comments though) and I have not notice any antisemitism. Funny guy.First the guy deliberately ignores that Bitcoin is money AND a system of transmiting this money. So the price of electricity goes to pay for both things, not only one. To compare Bitcoin you need to do it against the cost of the Federal Reserve printing money, its employees, the cost of the government imposing the monopolly on money, AND all the companies that work in making transactions in the dollar economy, that is VISA, Master Card and part of the banking system.It is true that this could change in the future and there could be money handeling companies around Bitcoin, but at this moment that is the situation.And as always he ignores that Bitcoin is young and still does not have a lot of activity. That is one of the reasons why miners get a fixed amount (right now 50 bitcoins) with each block, and its also why this amount will decrease as time goes by expecting that more activity will produce more fees.I wonder why people is so dishonest in regards to Bitcoin. You need to check Europe again. Europe is not socialist. Murwa, compare Europe to the USA and you will see that they are not very different in the range of command economy-free market.Its funny that a lot of USA people think that Europe is some sort of socialist paradise, when the European socialists say that Europe is a capitalist explotative place. Thanks for the answer. Can you indicate the version of Diapolo's kernel you are refering to? Is this some kind of joke I dont get or are you serious?Since when are we europeans socialists? And since when is China a free market?Honestly, I had doubts about answering you. If this is the level of answers you keep giving, I will just pass. Well, LinuxCoin booted in a computer I have with a ATI card but it didnt with some Xorg problems in another computer I have with Nvidia card, so I supposed that because of the AMD propietary drivers it was AMD graphic cards only.Glad to know it can boot in any system. Going to correct the HOWTO.I will try in my Nvidia computer again. Any logs I should check when/if it fails? 2000 and something blocks. If a block is found every 10 minutes exactly it takes 14 days to revise the difficulty. We are entering the terrain of speculation here, but the case where all this financial "innovations" would not have occurred in the way they did in a free market is easily defensable. In fact, proving that it would have happened in a free market is hardly defensable.The banking system earns money by charging a fee from transfering savings into investment, the fee being the difference between what they get from the investment and what they pay to the depositor. So the banks are always looking for new investments, prioritazing the more profitable ones, and going down until they dont have more money to lend. But when they have access to cheap money (because of the monetary system imposed by the government) they start to look for more and more investments, lowering their standards. They are not restrained by the amount of savings. You can see this all through history. When inflationary policies are pursue, there is an explotion of speculation and new financial vehicles appear. Obviously we have now computers and we have been able to produce a financiarization not posible until now. But the process is not new or unexpected.Also, the titularization has been posible because of the trust in the rating agencies. Without them giving AAA's left and right it would not have happened. And the rating agencies are an oligopoly created by the USA government and later endorsed by the EU countries and others around the globe. With competition they would not have been able to rate in the way they did and the process would not have happened or would not have gotten so big.As I said, small corrections and short term crisis are posible in a free market. People make mistakes, its unavoidable. But this crisis has the government written all over, including in the titularization process. Some points even contradicted each other. Other are just ridiculous (like number 2). In the ludite debate, I believe you guys are forgetting something. If we get to a level of productivity that allows us to produce so well that people dont really want to buy more stuff, we could always work less hours. In fact, this is already happening, since 200 years ago they had to work a lot more hours a day to survive and have a much more miserable live.Remember jobs is not an objective. We want to produce stuff to survive and even be able to enjoy live (a modern phenomenon for a big part of the population). If we could produce all the stuff without working it would be great. What a live that would be. Unfortunately, thats not posible and we have to work to produce. But the more efficiently we produce, the better, because it allows us to either consume more or work less.Luditism should be treated as a mental illness. Well said. Its funny to me how a lot of people that get their mouth full talking of cooperation in reality dont want cooperation. According to this way of thinking slaves are not being forced to work, they are cooperating...I disagree with you here. This crisis has not been atipical, in the sense that it was spected and we have seen similar crisis in history. Also, in a free market we would not see crisis like this. Some time of corrections and some periods of readjustment with somehow higher unemployment than usual could be, but it would never get to the level of discordination that has produced this huge crisis. Op is an obvious troll.Dont feed the trolls. You either centralize the system which brings back the problems of abuse and counterparty risk or live with the problems that any decentralized system has.Its not a bug, its a feature.   Ive created a HOWTO to use the modified unetbootin version of drgr33n to create a LinuxCoin bootable USB from windows: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36663.0drgr33n I have also taken the liberty to edit your first post to correct the link to the modified unetbootin.EDIT: Also, LinuxCoin only boots in computer with ATI/AMD graphic cards. I know it has to have the propietary AMD drivers to be able to mine, and I understand that having two versions is trouble and work. Its not ideal. After all that has happened I think its cristal clear for anyone that its important not to trust 3rd parties to store bitcoins. Some complained that it was hard for non-geeks to safely store bitcoins, which was true (until now). So I asked drgr33n to provide an easy way to create a bootable usb with LinuxCoin and he did. If anyone wants to thank him for his amazing work send tips to drgr33n's address: 1AsY8kT5a3UTkzQ8WjocpfQasGf81ZmAeKSo what is a bootable usb? It is a usb that you will insert before you start the computer. When you computer starts it will boot from the USB and not from the hardrive. In fact, it wont even touch or modify your hardrive in any way. Once you are done, you shut off your computer, remove the usb, and restart it as always. This way you will have a isolated system that you should only use to receive and send bitcoins avoiding interactions that could infect your computer with a virus that steals bitcoins or any other problem that your computer might have.This system is intended for you to store your long term savings. What I do is I keep a wallet in my computer with the bitcoins I spend monthly and then the wallet in the usb with my long term bitcoin savings, that I only access when I need to transfer funds to my day to day wallet. Obviously, you can find alternative uses.So here we go:[At the moment, only for windows. For general instructions go here]First, you need a usb flash drive of at least 2Gb (4Gb minum recommended). It should be formatted as FAT32, that is what most drives are formatted by default. If you want to make sure just follow this guide to format the drive again. (remember to select FAT32 as file system).Also, you need to download the program that will help you create the bootable usb from here. Its a modified version of unetbootin. You need to run the program you just downloaded as administrator. On Windows XP just double click and accept when prompted. On other window versions, like Windows 7, you need to right click and select run as administrator.Then you will see something like this:In this program you need to do 4 things to create the bootable usb.1. You need to select LinuxCoin as the distribution from the list. It will automatically select the 0.2-final version.2. You need to select the size of the persintance drive. This is the space that LinuxCoin will use in the usb drive to save and store files, like it would in a normal hard drive. The size is specified in MB so if you want to select 1GB you should select 1024, 2GB is 2048, 4GB is 4096 and so on. Remeber to leave 1 GB for LinuxCoin. For example, if your USB is 2GB you want to have a 1 GB persitance, so LinuxCoin can be stored in the other GB left. Dont worry too much though because unetbootin should automatically adjust the size if you entered an invalid one.3. Select the usb drive that you want to use. If you have only 1 usb drive inserted it should be selected automatically.4. Click OK! You are done. It will take its time. It has to download LinuxCoin (over 700MB), copy it to the usb and create the persitant drive. All together it can take more than one hour. You can use the time to browse the rest of the forum to learn more about Bitcoin and get to know this great community. Dont worry if it seems stuck at some point, creating the persistant drive can take long and the interface might not respond for a while. Just let it finish.If you want to test your new LinuxCoin system, restart the computer. If your BIOS is not configured to boot from a usb drive you will need to do so. We can not help you here since each computer is different and there is nothing we can do to make it easier for you. If you are having problems, ask in this thread or use Google for help.What to do now?Once you boot from the usb you will first see a menu with blue background and Unetbootin as title. There will be a 10s countdown. You can let that finish or select Default. Either way LinuxCoin will start to load. The load screen has a pinguin (Tux, the linux mascot) with a Bitcoin coin. LinuxCoin is quick to boot but remember that you are booting from a usb and they are slow compared to hard drives. It depends on the speed of your computer and the usb drive but it should take less than 1 minute. Once LinuxCoin has finished loading, you will see a simple desktop.The Bitcoin software is already installed. Open the main menu (left bottom, a Bitcoin coin), go to Accesories and select "secure bitcoin wallet". Wait for a bit for the client to load. Now you have a new Bitcoin wallet with new addresses where you can send the coins you want to store. Before sending any coins you should backup your wallet (this is true for any Bitcoin wallet). The usb could get corrupted or you could lose or damage it. To backup the wallet, you need to copy the file wallet.dat located at /home/user/.bitcoin/ (note de dot before bitcoin) to whatever media you choose (a cd, another usb drive, encrypted in the cloud, ...). I personally backup my wallet.dat twice in cd.It is recommended that you use it only to store bitcoins and dont browse the web or anything from that system, since you are always increasing the risk of being infected. If you like LinuxCoin and like to use it to browse the web, have two different system in two different usb drives.Any doubts or suggestions welcome. If you find LinuxCoin useful remember to tip drgr33n: 1AsY8kT5a3UTkzQ8WjocpfQasGf81ZmAeK The cheap computer either would be connected all the time or would have the same problem. Same with hackable BIOS.Nothing is 100% guaranteed in this world, not even the love of a mother. All you can do is make it very very difficult. By having a bootable usb that connects at very ocasional and random times and maybe from different computers, you are making your bitcoins extremely difficult to steal. You can even have your savings distributed among different usb wallets since usb are so cheap to avoid losing it all in the extremely rare case that something happens, and making it even less appealing to try to hack you because the reward would be inferior. The "proof" you provided is no proof at all.Sipa calculates the hashing power of the network by aproximation. It computes the difficulty and the blocks found during a certain period. If the miners happen to be very unlucky for some period, it can seem that the hashing power is going down. And the same is true in the opposite direction, if the miners happen to be very lucky for a while, it can seem that the hashing power is going up.Big short term variations are usually due to the luck of the miners. We have seen movements in the "hashing rate" like this before, both up and down.You need to wait for a more long term average to confirm whether this was due to luck or not. The price would have to collapse for something like this to happen. The most probable outcome would be a progressive decrease of the hashing rate with the difficulty addapting itself.Also, some miners might want to continue mining expecting higher prices in the future. A bootable usb is even cheaper. There is a thing I dont understand about the results of these modifications. They increase the hash rate but they also increase consumption, and I always though that since they are making the kernel more efficient (same task with less instructions, less work for the gpu per hash) they should increase the hash rate without chaning consumption too much. Does anyone know why the more efficient kernel is not also more energy efficient?Also, if one of you guys is out of ideas to make the cards runs faster it could be interesting to target energy efficiency instead of speed. A lot of us are not interested in running our cards at the maximum MHash/s rate but are more interested on having a better MHash/J rate.
There are connection problems. My miners are showing a lot of disconnections from the servers. The speed of the whole pool has gone under 2000Gh/s and Im guessing it is because of these problems. Are we getting DDOS by an angry botnet owner again?Eleuthria, thanks for fixing last share. De nuevo: Al bajar los precios los proyectos requieren menos dinero para ponerse en marcha. Whow says he doesnt? Btw, you are using the word utopia to describe something you clearly dont understand. The first rule to criticize something is understand it, you should not criticize something you dont even know about.Nobody is saying there should be no law or no courts. Let me be clear, nobody is saying there should be no law or no courts. The question is whether the legal system should be a government monopolly. And even if you believe it should be, how long should it reach? Its utopic to give monpollistic power to one institution and trust that it will be controllable like you are claiming. Check history and tell me when that has happened. Only once please, tell me when you utopia has happened.And btw, more than the 50% of the world trade is done based only on trust, outside of any legal jurisdiction.As I said the problem is that the people is used to live in a bubble world and have forgotten how to behave. Try:Code:poclbm.exe http://lolo.1:lolopass@arsbitcoin.com:8344 --device=0 -v 99 -f 7The instructions are here: https://github.com/m0mchil/poclbm (scroll down to the end). You can now add a backup pool. Eleuthria, the last share has started going over 2 minutes regularely for me, while some weeks ago it would not go over 1 minute. Now it stays around 1 minute and a half by default. The speed of the worker and the rewards are what they should be, so I keep wondering what is changing that gives a different last share value.Yes, they could infect one machine on purpose and check where the virus is sending the shares. I dont see how a botnet owner can have its own pool and keep it secret. Yo sigo sin entender porque repites que la deflación de precios puede desincentivar la creación de capital.Ten en cuenta que la mayoría de paises se industrializaron bajo sistemas monetarios más o menos de deflación de precios y "curiosamente" empezaron a decaer cuando fueron por la senda inflacionista. Por ejemplo, Inglaterra se industrializó en un periodo que aunque no fue perfecto y tuvo sus vayvenes en general tuvo una ligera bajada de precios. Cuando empezó a ir por la senda inflacionista acabó perdiendo el imperio. USA otro tanto, se industrializó bajo un regimen monetario con deflación de precios durante el siglo XIX (guerra civil en medio incluida) y en cambio a la que durante el siglo XX ha ido más y más en la dirección inflacionista todos hemos visto como se ha financiareado y se ha vuelto menos industrial. La deflación de precios favorece la acumulación de capital mientras que la inflación la evita. O mejor dicho, un sistema monetario estable favorece la industrialización y estos dos factores producen deflación de precios, mientras que un sistema monetario inflacionario dificulta la formación de capital. Cuestión de surte. Hoy BTCGuild ha tenido muchísima suerte. Watch out about believing the Fed statements about not raising interest rates. In the speech Bernanke gave previously to being nominated chairman of the Fed, he named three points. One of them was that by making people think that the interest rates would be low for longer than they would be, it represents negative interest rates (and he sees this as positive). So the rates could go up earlier than they say.Dont get me wrong. Im not saying they will raise them tomorrow or next month. They wont. Im just saying that everybody should be careful when the Fed says that they wont be raised until 2013 because Bernanke thinks that lying to the market in this issue could be positive. Bernanke did buy a lot of the mortgage shit from the banks, but it has also bought a lot of government debt. In fact, while QE1 was both buying from bank and the government, QE2 has bought only government debt and QE3 will be only government debt as well.They are all in this together, dont get fooled. Most politicians will say a lot of things but at the end of the day they like what Bernanke is doing, its just they can not say so to the people who is being pusnished. But check how Sanders, a self-admited socialist, betrayed R.Paul and A.Greyson and approved a reduced and one time only version of the Audit the Fed bill. They know what its going on and they like it. You can be sure that if the political power does not like what its happening enough the next day the Fed is over. Congress just needs to pass a law and the Fed is history, and the Fed knows it. In reality, they are all one happy club, and you and I are not invited (George Carlin dixit). It never stops amazing me how people are so indoctrinated as to believe the government regulations work and do away with all harm when the proof that they dont work is in front of them. But they learnt when they were kids that without regulations we will be all dying in a waste of chaos, and so we need them. The motto of the government should be: Get them young and profit the rest of your life.The worse thing is that they really believe that by being violent against this woman for example, they are making a better world.This is the perfect example of the level at which we have arived. People actually trusted a nobody with huge quantities of money! We are so used to live in this world where theft is either regulated and indoctrinated as normal and any competition in the scam sector is prosecuted, that a lot of us dont know how to take the minimum precautions.In this sense I think Bitcoin is great because it will teach us a couple of lessons that we desperately need. The Fed is neither a 100% government government agency neither a private insitution. I guess is a matter of opinion which side goes more, but if you look at its structure you will see that is mostly government controlled. Anyway its a useless debate, whether more government or more private it does what it does and its a problem. And the Fed is indeed a banking cartel. For me the best way to define the Federal Reserve system is: a government created cartel of private banks.The supposed independence of a central bank is that, supposed. Its undoubted that if the Treasury was in direct control of the printing press it would be even worse (think Zimbawe), and that the structure the government has created has a certain balance of political power, but still the central bank panders to politicians and does what they want (at least in part). Otherwise the politicians would do away with the central bank. As an example, you can go and check the Nixon tapes, where you can hear Nixon preasuring the then chairman of the Fed, Burns, to inflate the money supply to create a bubble that would reduce unemployment temporarely and help him win the election regardless of the consequences (then, surprise surprise, stagflation came). http://www.businessinsider.com/any-theory-of-political-independence-of-the-fed-was-destroyed-by-the-nixon-tapes-2010-11 <- check the pdf with the actual conversations, I read it and its quite entertaining (if you are a bit of a economic-political freak of course  ), how the president talks and all that, its curious. Es más dificil que esto porque cada sector funciona de manera diferente y el IPC es solo un indice, pero así de forma general sí.No necesariamente, solo en las condiciones que tú has dicho. Creo que no te has dado cuenta pero ya te he respondido a lo que me vas a plantear en el comentario anterior.De todas maneras te respondo: El tipo de interés depende de más cosas que la tasa de precios esperada y no se puede asegurar que sería menor, pero asumiendo las condiciones que tú planteas la tasa de interés será más baja porque habrá menos demanda por crédito a tipos de interés altos (ya que no se podrían pagar). http://absurdresults.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/its-not-illegal-to-use-real-strawberries-its-just-impossible-if-you-dont-want-to-do-something-illegal/So fucked up. The government officials outright recommend not using natural ingredients.And this is the perfect conclussion: Estas mineando con la CPU, por eso tienes tan poca velocidad. Minera con la CPU no es rentable (gastas más en electricidad de lo que consigues). Lo más probable es que necesites instalar el SDK para que el programa te detecte la tarjeta gráfica. Bitcoin is a distributed database of transactions. The coins dont "really exist".When your client connects to the network it will download the last transactions and will see the received coins. You dont have to have an active client to receive bitcoins. Just so you know, this is not the speed of money circulation, but the money multiplier. They are different things.And the Fed is not private and its not owned by the banks. The Fed is a mix of government and private institution, but mainly a government institution. For example, the majority of decissions are taken by the Board of Governors of the Federal REserve system that is a federal government agency. Ben Bernanke is the head of this board. Wouldnt this make them vulnerable to being discovered? Is there anyway to set up an anonymous pool?EDIT: I think something is wrong with the pool, we are having good luck. "Day of the Tentacle" Amazing game, graphically very intensive. Its not. If you want to buy you should sell your miners. But as long as you keep the miners and spect the price to go up in the future you should keep mining. Keeping the mining but not mine is the worse option. One should either sell them or mine, but not keep them idle.That is a good decision. I didnt imagine the price of electricity in California was that bad, specially when other parts have it a lot better. Here in Europe is bad, but its more similar everywhere.
Es todo muy raro. Tom Williams, supuestamente el propietario de MyBitcoin.com, ha anunciado que sí le han robado y en otro anunció ha dicho que solo tiene en posesión el 49% de los bitcoins que tenía en custodia. Si nos lo creemos alguien ha robado 75.000 bitcoins, que podría estar vendiendo (en MtGox aparecieron 25.000 bitcoins a la venta de golpe uno de estos pasados días). Si no nos lo creemos, lo mismo pero podría estarlo haciendo él mismo.A saber lo que realmente ha pasado. Está denunciado y el FBI está investigandolo. Curiously enough, the last changes solved my problems. I have been now like 36 hours without a problem. But only one agency has changed the rating. I think the USA gov debt can still be claimed as AAA because of the other agency ratings (not 100% sure though). What we have seen during this crisis until now is that in moments of fear people goes to cash, specially because there is people that leverages a lot to go into gold and silver and when things go south they need to cash out of gold and silver.Historically gold and the stock market are inversally correlated, but during this crisis they have started going (more or less) correlated. This is because during this crisis is not about risky investment/safe investment, its about if the dollar will survive or not. So gold and the stock market are acting as a way to get out of the dollar and they tank when people go back to cash.This is how it has been during this crisis until now. It could change. But keep in mind that if at some point you see the stock market crashing and gold going up for a sustained period of time, it means the dollar is in great danger. When the stock market crashes and people prefers to go into gold than into dollars... that could be the final blow for the dollar. Everybody knows the USA government debt ratings were as valid as the mortgage ratings. The USA government debt should have lost its AAA long ago, so the real question is why is S&P downgrading it now.An article in The Atlantic speculated that it was a mesure of presure against the Obama administration so they changed some of the regulation of Frank-Dodd Act in favor of S&P. Who knows.What I find pathetic is that the USA politicians always pointed to the AAA rating as proof that everything was fine. Now that one agency has changed the rating they blame the agency. Well, why were they using the agency rating as proof before then? The agency ratings are only good when they say what the politicians want them to say? The drop started after the MyBitcoin.com and the polish exchange fiascos.Whether is just panic or loss of confidence or MyBitcoin.com scammers selling the stolen bitcoins is just anyones guess. It could be a combination of both. But we have seen massive sellouts (25.000 bitcoins) in just moments during these last days.Are you serious? 40 cents? And I though Europe was bad. Thats insane, no wonder why California is tanking and the industry is leaving.Btw, I know you are taking a conservative position, wait and see, but if you believe bitcoins will rise in price you should keep mining if you have the funds to pay the electricity, because it does not matter the price they have now if you believe it will go up in the future. And if you belive they wont, you should sell the equipent right now to recover part of the money. The wait and see attitude might seem like a middle point, but in reality you have your investment without producing anything, Ive always though that its better to take your guess and use it or sell it.On second thoughs, Im happy difficulty is going down, so hey, scratch what I said and everybody stop your miners right now! Note that he said that he is protecting wallet.dat making it only readable (chmod 400 /path/to/wallet.dat). How would the client would react if it cant modify wallet.dat? Spoken like a true professional economist.   The problem with this "theory" is: as you say when someone sells it puts downwards presure in the price of bitcoins, but you forget that when someones buys it puts upwards presure.So if he started buying again at $8 the price would not have stayed there nicely for him to buy all he wants at that price, it would have gone up big time.This scams dont work unless there is a massive panic selling from other people than the scammer. Otherwise the scammer will loose a lot of money.If the money from MyBitcoin.com is being sold at the exchanges, most probably whoever is dong it is trying to get out of bitcoins, not buying back. Keiser is french if im not mistaken, but yeah... In my country and a lot of others downloading copyrighted music and movies is legal as long as there is no profit. I feel that your system could be labeled as profit and therefore rendered ilegal. Not that it matters much, but could be a problem. Ok, thanks. I guess no BAMT for me until/if Gigabytes solves the usb issue. What I am trying to do is to have BAMT as another option in the GRUB menu, but I think that is not what Norton Ghost allows to do. I think Im supposed to select the option from disk to disk, but that will wipe out my other partitions. Correct me if wrong please. Exactly why you need to let them go bankrupt instead of propping them up, so other or new companies can occupy their places. But as long as bankrupt companies are using resources because they are being artificially proped up (bailouts, stimulous, ultra-low interest rates) there wont be a change and the capital structure will stay distorted and weak, because other or new companies can not take their place.There is some true to this, specially in (and I believe only related to) the banking system. The banking system is a government created oligopolly and the government has regulated the amount and type of leverage they can achive. This has lead to a unsustainable situation. If we allow the market to correct it through the natural method (bankruptcy) the correction would be very quick, but also very brutal, with a lot of people loosing their savings, etc... I dont think this would be true in any other sector, IMO only the banking sector needs some kind of special solution. There are two sensible options.1. What sweden did in the 90's. Its a government managed bankruptcy process. The government takes care of the banks for a while, so it can guarantee the deposits, but (and this is very important) completely wipes out the shareholders and the debtors. Both groups gave their money to a badly managed company so they deserve to loose their money. After a while, the government sells the banks to the private sector to recover part of the price of saving the banks. The BIG difference to what it is being done now, is that now we are rescuing the banks, including the shareholders and the debtors. The present "solution" is insane, its pure robbery by the plutocracy.2. End the monpolly on money by removing legal tender laws, allowing to pay taxes in any currency, etc... By doing this you allow competing currencies and a competing financial system around these new currencies. This would allow for new investment to happen, that is now blocked because the banking system is bankrupt. Also, as the USD loses marketshare it would devaluate making the USD denominated debt easier to pay helping to solve the debt crisis much quicker.I preffer the second solution as its better long term (the first solution does not change the present monetary system), but given what we have now the first solution would be very welcome. You can imagine we wont get any of both, we will keep saving the plutocrats through taxes and inflation, and will suffer stagflation for years until all the debt is wipped out and the capital structure has recover. The problem in your reasoning is that cutting government spending does not cut jobs, or better said, cutting government spending leads to a reduction of government jobs on the short term but favours creation of jobs in the private sector (productive jobs). On the contrary increasing government spending makes the statistics look good short term but its a disaster middle and long term. The increase of government spending along with not allowing bankruptcies (keeping bad business alive) is what is causing this depression to last so long.You want jobs? Cut government spending, let bankruptcies happen (no bailouts and no bullshit), basically take the short term bullet and after a bit you will see a real recovery, not this jobless, stock bubbly "recovery".PS: 100 years ago if a politician spoke about "jobless recovery" the citiznes would have taken him to the pitchfork. Now we just discuss why its happening... But you are forgetting two things:1. Bitcoin and USD are opposites. The USD is a fiat currency while Bitcoin is a voluntary currency.2. You are misrepresenting the position of the people criticizing fiat currencies. There has not been a paper fiat currency that has lasted more than a 100 years in history. And paper fiat currency is a very old concept, it has been tried for centuries. That means something.And we can see the effects of the monetary policy all around us. Bubbles everywhere, big disparities in wealth, destruction of the middle class, etc... The fiat monetary system is hurting us. But that does not mean that you change to a paper fiat currency and the next morning the whole economy collapses. Nobody is saying that. The market is resilient and can keep going even when abused. The system could have another ride and last 20 or 30 years more, who knows, but its quite clear that its getting to the end. Its more and more unstable as time goes by. Thats the one Im using too. I have sent gigabyte support a report on it. I doubt they will do something on just one message but if some of us send them complaints about it, it might do something.Downloading your software now, thanks. The problem is that we are so used to being scammed from our institutions on legal growns but with controlled trade that we dont know how to behave in a unrefulated market. We are dumbed down and are learning the hard way how to behave in a real market. Just for the record, the rating agencies are already regulated and have been for a long time. They are in fact a government created oligopoly with only a few agencies being granted permission by the government to rate assets and being accepted by different government bodies.S&P is not opposed to being regulated, they just want the present regulation more in the favour. I dont trust my memory. At all.
I plan to buy my cat food with bitcoins. There is a shop in my country that sells it. I have to agree with this one.Someone   might start working on something like this soon. But it would be ideal if the GUI (or the client) told you when you needed to backup your wallet again. It could be done easier than it sounds. The program just needs to remember the date of the last backup and the client has a rpc command that provides the creation date of the first address in the queue. Comparing the two dates you can tell the user if a new backup is needed or not. The only problem is communiticating with the wallet, because opening the jsonrpc only for this seems a bad deal because of the security problems it could bring.Both bootup and shutdown work fine here.And I would suggest extrongly against java and no need for a good browser. LinuxCoin is meant to be secure. There is really no need to use it to visit the web and stuff. I've liked BAMT for mining but (as stated above) my motherboard wont boot from most linux bootable usb so I want to install it in the HD. I have tried googling for Norton Ghost but there are a lot of versions and I dont really know what I should get. Can you give me a bit more detailed explanation, specially on the software to get? Ideally BAMT would live as another OS bootable from GRUB, but if I have to wipe out the HD and install only BAMT so be it. Thanks. He probably has no idea about cryptography, but that is no reason to answer this way. Its anyones guess why bitcoins are going down in price in respect with the dollar, but in my opinion the MyBitcoin.com scandal has been a big hit to the confidence in the Bitcoin project. Thats why bitcoins are going down.I dont think Bitcoin is a big enough market to be affected very strongly by outside stuff. I can not get BAMT to work, I can not even boot into the desktop.I have downloaded BAMT twice (in case there was a problem with the download), I have tested it in two computers and from two USB devices. Same result. I get a failure about not being able to mount the file system and it drops me to a terminal.I have installed it with imagewriter from Ubuntu.EDIT: Ok, I have no idea why, but made a last attemp on one of the computers, with the same usb that refused to load earlier and now its working. Looks very good, now I need to find how to change the voltage.EDIT2: It turns out the motherboard of the miners has a bug in the BIOS and does not boot from certain types of USB systems. No BAMT for me. Me too. Im very curious as to why they did it. I suspect there might be political reasons, because having the USA government with AAA for so long was ridiculous long ago, so why downgrade now? I truly was not expecting this. It would be interesting to understand the politics behind the move.  You can see the unconfirmed transactions here: http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/I doubt the 2 month old is there though, but it does not hurt checking. The new one should be there. There has been a big "other" part of the mining pool pie chart for a while (http://bitcoinwatch.com/). It has not been like sometimes happen when a pool has problems and a part appears as other and then it comes back. There has been a "other" part of the pie for more than one day (I dont think it has gone when I was not looking and come when I was).What is going on? Massive solo mining? By who? Im programming a web that will use bitcoins and what I have done is that the out address does not change until 24hours after the change request has been made. So the user sets an out address, and if someone gets hold of his/her password and tries to change the address it wont work for 24 hours. We also send an email to the user if it has set up an email.this way the user has some time to discover the "hack" and contact us. Im surprised people just dont use cd's. We are doing it on purpose. We are trying to break a record. Its getting very anoying. I have to be restarting the computer like once or twice a day. I guess its time to change miner for me. If Im not mistaken Ruxum trades in asiatic currencies. Nothing, I wasnt trying to prove anyhing. Im not a trader so I was just being a bit goofy.Lets forget the bet then. You want to bet 5 bitcoin that next week the stock market is higher than todays lows?EDIT: Im not a short term trader so you have high chances of success... I was wondering exactly this. How is it operating if it was destroyed? We need a virgin.Im sure we can find one in this forums...
I have not been scammed.You didnt backup wallet.dat? Copy the file in a couple of cd's and you are set. You can use AMDOverdriveCtrl without the GUI.Code:AMDOverdriveCtrl -b deviceX.ovdr -i XWhere X is the number of the device you want to configure and deviceX.ovdr is the AMDOverdriveCtrl profile file. You can create the profile file with the GUI, just save any configuration. If you need to change the configuration later on you dont need the GUI, you can change the configuration by editing the file manually. Im using the version from git (updated two days ago) and I am getting miners stuck once a day at least. The program gets stuck at the screen saying that there has been an rpc connection problem( "Problems communicating with bitcoin RPC 0 2"), and it does nothing after that. Even Ctrl+C does not stop the program. Que burbuja? Los bitcoins llegaron a $30 y enseguida corrigieron a $14.  Eso no es una burbuja, solo el proceso normal de busqueda de precio. Y ahí se han quedado un tiempo. Luego con los dos escandalos a bajado a $10.Que pasará en el futuro? Vete tú a saber. Yo personalmente no he vendido ni un bitcoin. Next time use the search option. This was my answer in another thread saying exactly the same as you said (yes, you are that original): Los escandalos del exchange polaco y MyBitcoin.comTambién podría ser que alguno de los dos no haya realmente perdido las claves (lo más probable) y esté ahora vendiendo los bitcoins de sus clientes.Sea lo que sea aprovecha estos precios. Exactly this.Even if you think the MyBitcoin guy is not guilty, this would be a way to prove it. Please, go to your client, check the address(es) you used to send coins to MyBitcoin.com and report them here. "The constitution is just a piece of paper"George Bush I can attest that the moderation policy is deliberated. I am an anarchist but had other ideas on how to handle the forum, meaning more strict moderation, but I was told to let go and so I did. Now I only moderate the most blatant cases. Its the style that is wanted for this forum. I see a pattern there... Hahaha. The Onion where fake news are more real than actual news. This seem to me like a good idea. Its just that it is no fractional reserve, its just having two accounts. Si el interés no puede ser negativo no existe el problema.En tu ejemplo no has demostrado nada. Has puesto unos valores aleatorios y has dicho que pasarían ciertas cosas sin justificar muy bien porque.Si existe un exceso de oferta de crédito su precio, el interés bajará. Si lo que quieres decir es que en cierto momento la gente se va a negar a prestar el dinero porque el interés es muy bajo y lo va a acumular (por ejemplo, debajo del colchón) lo que pasará es que los precios bajarán (hay menos cantidad de dinero circulando) y por lo tanto el precio de poner el marcha el negocio baja y por lo tanto pasa a ser realizable al interés mínimo que pidan. 1. Sigues diciendo que evita inversiones productivas. Pero decirlo no es demostrarlo.2. El interés negativo nunca se puede dar en un libre mercado. La deflación de precios hace la deuda más dificil de pagar sí y eso ayuda a priorizar las inversiones, evitando malas inversiones. Las inversiones productivas se harán igualmente porque la demanda y oferta por crédito buscará el equilibrio. ¿Que evitará que el mercader que acepta freicoins, una vez los reciba, los intercambie inmediatamente por bitcoins (o por cualquier otra cosa)? Si se queda con los freicoins sabe que van a devaluarse, si los cambia por bitcoins no. Incluso podría automatizarlo. ¿Porque va a estar el comerciante manteniendo sus freicoins en posesión y perdiendo dinero cuando facilmente puede cambiarlos por bitcoins? (razones ideológicas aparte).PD: No es adhominem, es mi opinión sobre Gessell. Y la de muchos economistas también (aunque eso no es garantía de nada). Pero sobretodo, las ideas de Gessell no son originales, la idea de estimular el gasto para estimular la economía es más antigua que el comer. The theory of oversupply is completely false. Its flawed because its based on the study of aggregates which hide what its really going on in the economy. There never has been in the economy a general excess of supply. What has happened is that there has been an oversupply of certain products (f.e. houses) and an undersupply of others. What do you think would have happened if all the resources, including human labour, that was dedicated to build houses everywhere would have been dedicated to produce something people actually wanted?Its not oversupply, I dont understand how people can look around with so many poor people and conclude that we produce too much. Its a problem of not producing what people really wants. The monetary inflation, the 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes, was the same when the USD-BTC went from cents to 30USD than when it went down.The important question is: Why do you want the USD-BTC exchange to go to 30 again? Whats wrong with 13-14? This I agree.Very true. Having to work less hours to produce the same goods and access the same standard of living is horrible. Horrible! We should all be working more hours.This is false. Example: Bitcoin. In fact, usually new technologies are disruptive for big stablished companies and helps entrepreneurs.Luditism should be declared a psicological illness so we can stop hearing the same arguments over and over again. Do you realize that people in the XVIII century were saying exactly what you are saying? Some were very afraid that the new automatition was going to leave the people without a job. In the fucking XVIII century! Hasnt happened yet. What has happened is that thanks to the machines we work less hours, in better working conditions (the machies do the harsh work) and we enjoy a better standard of living. So please lets stop the crazyness, we need more automatition so we have to work less hours and have an even better standard of living. I dont really believe in the statistical methods, but I too apreciate your threads. They are fun to read. Its all good speculation, and sometimes you can find interesting correlations.Btw, I think you have a very difficult task because in general you are trying to predict future behaviour with the experience of past behaviour, but since Bitcoin is so new and growing so fast the patterns can change quickly and radically.
So you think copying a file (wallet.dat) into a couple of cd's or usb drivers or whatever is something only people with a computer science degree can do? How hard is to copy a file in a couple of cd's? Honestly, backing up your wallet.dat is not that hard. Anyone can get three cd's and make three copies. There is no excuse.Being a business is harder because new addresses are created and you have to do it regularly but still, its nothing specially complicated. Well, that is if you believe the story. Im not saying its false, I dont have any indications that its either true or false.But all these wallet.dat's being erased magically from all these services without the owners having any kind of local copy... It stings at kilometers of distance. What we should do is locate the keys where their funds where stored and keep an eye on them. If some years after they start to be moved you know what happened. Also, doing this would make anyone thinking on doing the same think twice about pulling something similar. Honestly, while he has been harsh the MyBitcoin debacle was something easily predictable. There were several threads in the forums warning about the bad service. Specially about not answering emails. Why would you keep a big part of your bitcoins in a place that does not even answer emails? I dont get it.People need to understand Bitcoin is not reversable, therefore you need to secure them. Bitcoin has a lot of advantages, non-inflationary (when the first phase is done), decentralized, pseudo-anonymous and not reversable (which is an advantage for a lot of things). But in exchange it has its drawbacks, the main one that you really need to secure them. I try not to leave too much time bitcoins at a third party. I dont even have more than 50 bitcoins in the linux machine I have connected to the Internet all the time. The rest of my bitcoins are offline.Its not that hard to secure your bitcoins. +1 Then wait until you learn about the part of the code that the developers dont know what it does. Its alive... Their tekin' urr pools!!! I know. But to be fair these guys are probably very young and misled or just trolls. There are (other) progressives with whom you can talk rationally about things. bitcoin.com.es no es un exchange, ni pretende serlo. Es solo un servicio particular para intercambiar bitcoins por euros y viceversa.Yo no lo he usado. Yes weusecoins is ok. Al final voy a tener que cobrarte por tanta explicación...Esto que dices no tiene sentido porque hay muchísimos ejemplos en la historia de diferentes metales conviviendo y siendo usados como moneda a la vez. La preferencia de usar billetes sobre monedas en algunas épocas no tiene nada que ver con la ley de Gresham. La razón por la que puedes estar confundido es que los keynesianos han distorsionado y mal-explicado la ley de Greshma para intentar demostrar que es falsa. Si has oido una de estas versiones distorsionadas es normal que estés confundido. Y por cierto, citar la wikipedia en materia económica te va a dejar mal en circulos más o menos serios.Cuando no hay un cambio artificial entre dos monedas, pongamos por ejemplo oro y plata, sino que su cambio flota libremente, la gente puede tener preferencia personal por pagar con oro o con plata, pero en general si el cambio está a 20 oz plata = 1 oz oro, a ti te da igual pagar o que te paguen 2 oz oro o 40 oz de plata.El problema viene cuando por ejemplo el gobierno fija un cambio artificial entre el oro y la plata. Imaginate que como el cambio está ahora a 20 oz plata = 1 oz oro, el gobierno fija ese cambio por ley. Pero más tarde se descubren minas de plata (esta situación exacta se dió precisamente en USA en el siglo XIX). Como hay abundancia de plata el cambio cambiaría y tendrías que pagar más oz de plata por oz de oro. Pero como el gobierno ha fijado el cambio no se puede actualizar el precio, la gente ve que la plata está sobrevaluada y te da plata. Además, la gente que tiene oro se niega a vendertelo por 20 oz de plata porque en otros sitios puede conseguir más o sencillamente se lo guarda porque no quiere hacer un mal negocio. El oro ha desaparecido de la circulación y solo queda la plata.Sijate que si no hubiera el cambio fijo del gobierno, el precio se actualizaría y no desaparecería ninguno. Si el nuevo cambio fuera 25 oz de plata = 1 oz de oro, la gente pagaría 50 oz de plata o 2 oz de oro sin problemas, y podrías cambiar entre oro y plata.El problema es cuando se fija el cambio. Cuando las monedas flotan libremente la ley de Gresham no aplica, precisamente porque el precio se actualiza.Esto que te explico, lo de tener el precio fijado y que desaparezca uno de los dos metales, sucedió en USA varias veces en USA en el siglo XIX en ambas direcciones (desaparece oro y desaparece plata, la vez de la plata muy influenciada por el descubrimiento de minas nuevas).Lo de las monedas del mismo metal normalmente sucede porque el gobierno acuña monedas con menos contenido en oro (o del metal que sea) pero exige por ley que se acepte al par con la moneda más pura, muchas veces incluso imponiendo penas de muerte a los comerciantes que se negaran. ¿Porque los gobiernos hacían esto? Muy sencillo, si no lo hacían las nuevas monedas tenían un valor menor a las más puras y al gobierno no le servía de nada devaluarlas. Por ejemplo, si tiene 500 oz de oro, pero quiere gastar por valor de 1000 oz de oro, acuña 1000 monedas con las 500oz. Si la gente puede valorar esas nuevas monedas libremente pagará aldedor de la mitad por esas nuevas monedas (llevan la mitad del oro) y el gobierno vuelve a estar en las mismas que solo puede gastar por el equivalente a 500oz de oro. En cambio si por ley impone que se tengan que aceptar a la par con las puras, puede gastar por valor de 1000 oz de oro.En resumen, la ley de Gresham solo aplica cuando se impone un cambio artificial. Sino existe este cambio artificial los precios se actualizan y, preferencias particulares aparte, la gente gastará ambas monedas indiferentemente a los nuevos precios actualizados.Estaba claramente hablando de si se hubiera consiguido poner en funcionamiento el sistema, por eso he separado y he dicho que yo creo que dificilmente podrían ponerse en marcha directamente.El problema que tienes y que no quieres entender es que si nadie quiere mantener los freicoins en posesión y todo el mundo quiere deshacerse de ellos rapidamente su precio colapsará. Oferta y demanda. Si no hay demanda por mantener el dinero en posesión, colapsa.Como ya te he demostrado la ley de Gresham no aplicaría en este caso, porque el precio entre, por ejemplo, bitcoins y freicoins se actualizaría. Conforme el tiempo pasara y la "demanda ideológica" por freicoins se hiciera más débil (la gente se cansa, etc...) la demanda bajaría aún más y eventualmente su precio colapsaría. La oferta de freicoins siempre va a ser apabullante, colapsando la moneda, sobretodo si hay una alternativa mejor.Ya te he dicho alguna vez que Silvio Gessell no es una fuente seria. No me extraña la confusión que tienes si lees a Gessell. Es curioso porque parece que lo que te guía es que crees que las ideas de Gessell acabarán con la especulación abusiva, ayudarán a la gente y demás (y esos objetivos están bien), pero en realidad son una serie de ideas sin sentido, que no funcionan.No entiendo. El aceptar la moneda era totalmente voluntario y no todos los habitantes del pueblo conocían las teorías de la libremoneda. Simplemente la gente prefería trabajar y comer a no hacerlo.[/quote]Aparte de lo obvio que has escrito tú (en negrita), ya hemos comentado este caso anteriormente y tu concediste que:a) estabán en medio de una depresión con falta de liquidez así que cualquiera moneda adicional, fuera mejor o peor, tenía el camino allanado.b) La moneda no duró suficiente como para ver sus efectos a largo plazo. Ok, back to basics again. As a friendly advise let me tell you that if you try you will see that reading some books is more effective than posting a lot of emoticons.The banking system in most developed economies is an oligopoly around the government created money monopolly. The banks receive several privileges on the issuances of currency from the government and this regulations that the government grants to the banks are imposed through violence or thread of violence. The way the banking system is regulated is far more complicated, but this is a start.Btw, Im not claiming that anything represents a incredible distorsion of the free market. During history there has been some periods with some mild regulations but they were close to a free system. But the present monetary and financial system is the opposite to a free market money system. We live under a government money monopolly, which is the opposite extreme.You were answering to me and misrepresented what I was saying. Its all there so go back and check. Estás aplicando mal la ley de Gresham. La ley de Gresham no dice lo que tú crees que dice.La ley de Gresham solo aplica cuando hay impuesto un tipo de cambio artificial. Si los tipos flotan libremente la ley de Gresham no aplica.Exactamente la razón por las que los freicoins no pueden funcionar y su valor colapsaría. Si la gente no quiere ahorrar feicoins y todo el mundo intenta deshacerse de ellos, la demanda por freicoins disminuye y su valor acabará colapsando y nadie aceptandolos. Y esto suponiendo que despequen inicialmente, lo cual en mi opinión no sucederá sin coacción o una carga ideológica muy fuerte que lleve a la gente a pensar que les interesa aceptar una moneda de inferior calidad.Y ahí tienes la respuesta. Lo que dices es cierto, pero esa formula es falsa. La velocidad de circulación no influye sobre los precios (excepto en algunas excepciones). En realidad el factor V de esa formula no es la velocidad, son factores psicológicos, basicamente la demanda por la moneda. Sorry, I though I was talking with someone who knows the basics. Let me explain:If you make a voluntary choice, that is not using violence or thread of violence, you are not distorting the singals. You are peacefully cooperating.If you foce people to make some decisions or deprive them of options using violence or thread of violence then you are distorting the signals in the market because people is not choosing according to their needs but forced.Now try again.EDIT: And let me clarify again because I think you did not get it. I did not say HFT is not free market. What I said is the way is used today and in general the state of the whole financial system is not a free market outcome, but an outcome of the progressive/conservative policies. First, you should drop the attitude. You have been proven unable to answer questions about economics. But answering your question:A quick google search: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/magazine/16Europe-t.html?_r=2&ref=opinionIts your standard policy to resolve the disequilibriums by inflating away the debt and devaluating the real wages because you argue that wages are rigid (wages being rigid is partly true).Its quite sad that a lot of progressives are lead by slogans and dont even know the policies they defend. If we have to be historically accurate thats false.JFK passed a bill to emit silver certificates, he did not pass a bill allowing congress to print as much as they want to, and it is quite unclear the silver certificates was the reason why he was assesinated. I guess it could be, there are several theories as to why he was killed.Lincoln did print "all" the dollars he wanted, but the dollar hyperinflated and lost 50$% of its value in 2 or 4 years (dont remember exactly right now). If it were not because congress decided to stop printing which returned confidence in the currency, the dollar would have completely collapsed. Again, there are several theories as to why Lincoln was assesinated but saying its because of the greenbacks its quite a strecth. It does not make too much sense. First, we dont need your condescending tone here. Try speaking like a normal person.Second, the free market works because of the price signals represent the real choices of the people. When you distort those signals the outcome is not a free market outcome, even when apparently were done "freely" by someone. Its a constant in history that when a inflationary period starts it develops a financial boom and fostering reckless speculation. The financial system in the western countries is completely out of control and hypertrofiated, and that is thanks to the progressive policies. You would not be seeing the crazyness or inequalities you see around in a free market.I have already said that I dont have anything against HFT and the problems I see. I dont believe what the op is saying and he has demonstrated quite a few time that he has not much idea about economics and likes to go over the top. I know someone dedicated to HFT and he is not doing by far that kind of money. It could be that it just happens that the guy I know is very bad at his job I guess. 5870 The problem is not fractional reserve. Fractional reserve is fine. The problem is central banking. You dont need to have a money monopolly regulated by a central bank, people can freely choose the money they want.
We are open to suggestion. Like what? Its running on a single core CPU and I have no problem with 11.6. When you say debt to GDP you mean government debt or all the debt (private + government)?Im a bit surprised that they saw that 90% is the tipping point because I had seen empirical studies previously where they found that there was not a clear tipping point and the amount of debt (total debt to GDP) was not related to the crisis directly. Ill see if I can get a copy. Para minear, las 5XXX rinden muy parecido, algunas incluso mejor ya que consumen menos, que sus equivalentes de la serie 6XXX. La serie 6XXX introdujo mejoras que las hacen más potentes para gráficos pero no aportan nada de cara a minear, y por eso consumen un poco más en general. Por otra parte, has de tener en cuenta que si te la quisieras vender en algún momento te será más fácil vender las 6XXX que las 5XXX. Así que si las quieres exclusivamente para minear son mejores las 5XXX (además si las encuentras seguramente serán más baratas), pero si te interesa también por gráficos o tienes previsto venderla en un futuro próximo igual te conviene la 6XXX. The rating agencies are regulated by the USA government. The USA government will never loose the AAA rating by these agencies. Brilliant move! Now that they are angry its the best moment for them to consider an alternative. No, this is incorrect. Im from Europe. The word "liberal" in the USA changed in meaning at the beginning of the XX century. From that moment the ideas represented by the word liberal until then, became classic liberalism, as opposed to the new meaning, progressive "liberalism". In Europe the word did not change.So basically european liberalism is the original liberal ideas, and are completely different from progressive "liberalism", that is the default for liberal in the USA. European liberalism is the same as classic liberalism. Libertarianism is the USA evolution of classic liberal ideas. Rothbard used the word libertarianism, because the progressives had highjacked the word liberalism.I dont think I made myself very clear so:- USA liberals = progressive "liberals" = european socialdemocrats.- USA libertarians ~ USA classic liberals = european liberalsUSA liberalism is not real liberalism. The word got highjacked.What it is (was?) true is that european conservatives tend to be more authoritarian than USA conservatives (although I believe this is changing and the USA conservaties have become more like their european counterparts during the last decades, neocons). But it is also true that european lefties are also more authoritarian than the USA lefties. The USA has the (real) liberal influence and so it is (was?) less authoritarian in general.PS: The UE is a authoritarian monster and does not respect civil liberties. The EU tried to implement Internet survailance and only popular protest stopped it. They have forced the EU countries to implement draconian airport controls, etc... Yep.The real problem with bot trading is that the stock markets are willing to undo trades when a bot goes crazy. This way the bot owners have no incentive to make the bots better. If they lost big time everytime a bot goes crazy, they would think twice about using a bot or if the did, they would do it more carefully. I have not read the Reinhart and Rogoff book. I have been told that apart from presenting the data in an excellent way they do not really present any new or original economic idea, and are very tame as to why the crisis happens. Can you make a short explanation of why the crisis happened according to their thesis? Im specially interesting in knowing why they think the financial system behaved like they did.PS: Ludites, that is the ideas that technology is going to "eat us" or/and cocentrate power have been always wrong. The record is out there for anyone to check. Bitcoin is the best example on how technology increases people's choices. Its weird that you say this becuase this is standard progressive policy. Nice strawman.Enjoy the progresive Federal Reserve.The progressive and conservative policies have taken us down this path, and you still have the audacity of blaming it on non-existing free markets? Do you have any kind of honesty limits or morals? Creo que depende de el precio de la electricidad, minear con Nvidia no es rentable, es decir te costará más la electricidad que los bitcoins que generes. Para minear quieres alguna ATI de las series 58XX, 59XX 68XX y 69XX. En la wiki inglesa encontrarás una tabla comparando las diferentes tarjetas. 11.6 works fine here and gives you more freedom to under/overclock. I bet you a couple of bitcoins that Bernanke will keeps monetizing government debt (whether it calls it QE3 or gives it another name is irrelevant). Deal? A contingency plan is good for the marriage as well. It gives you peace of mind about your options allowing you to behave more calmly in the marriage and without preasures and shows that if you stay in the marriage is because you want to and are fully commited, not because you need to.I would be suspicious of any partner in a marriage that does not have any options. Im using the modified phatk kernel, the last version adequate for poclbm, connected to uswest. Have no idles, last glitch was 15 hours ago and previously I went without any glitch for more 2-3 days.Eleuthria: Have you changed the level of difficulty of the work you send to the miners? The miners speed (Mh/s) is fine and always around the real speed, but I am seeing more and more the last share over one minute, when previously it did almost never happened. Sí, el problema que yo veo es que sí es posible que haya una cierta espiral deflacionaria, pero solo cuando la deflación viene de la contracción del crédito (usualmente después de una burbuja) y es provocado por las restricciones que las regulaciones del gobierno imponen sobre la moneda y el sistema bancario. Es decir, la espiral deflacionaria puede suceder siempre que el gobierno se empeñe en que suceda, el mercado de por sí no la crea.Estoy de acuerdo, que siempre se usa como "coco" para justificar cualquier tipo de inflación, pero aún así no deberíamos faltar a la verdad. Si explicamos las cosas adecuadamente no debería haber ningún problema. Para explicarlo, muchos austríacos para explicarlo hablan de deflación buena y deflación mala. Es decir, cuando la deflación vivine dada por un incremento de la productividad no existe posibilidad de espiral deflacionaria y además es una deflación positiva. Cuando la deflación viene dada por la contracción del crédito después de una burbuja entonces dependiendo de las políticas del gobierno, sí que es posible que se sufra una espiral deflacionaria. Y aún en este caso, hay que remarcar que una cierta deflación es positiva y ayuda a eliminar las malas inversiones. Im sure it will have some effect, but I am also convinced that the whole financial world knows that the GDP is a sham so Im not convinced it will have a devastated effect. They already know.I see all this more as a way to justify QE3 (or however they call it this time). They need to start soon, so they can create a mini-bubble for the elections of 2012 so Obama can have some numbers to point to. Estoy totalmente de acuerdo con lo que has dicho. Solo un detalle. La espiral deflacionaria no es exactamente un mito, lo que pasa es que tampoco es como la ponen los keynesianos. Por ejemplo Hayek hablaba de deflación primaria y deflación secundaria, siendo la deflación primaria buena y necesaria para eliminar las malas inversiones, pero la deflación secundaria siendo excesiva debido a la contracción del crédito y llevandose por delante a negocios que sí son viables. En mi opinión esta deflación secundaria ocurre porque se bloquea el sistema bancaria debido a que está quebrado. No puede salir un sistema bancario alternativo, porque vivimos en un monopolio de la moneda y el sistema bancaria es un oligopolio a su alrededor. Si hubiera libertad de moneda saldría "rapidamente" nuevas monedas y sistemas financieros sanos a su alrededor que nos ayudarían a salir rapidamente de la recesión. cypherdoc I know what you mean, but the USA and half of the world is already in a depression. We never got out. GDP is a horrible measure for growth. GDP only measures economic activity, not growth. It does not say anything about the productivity or sustainability of said economic activity. Also, the GDP we all use is a government statistic, so it should be taken with caution.
Fantastico. Acuerdate de añadirte en la wiki, así la gente sabrá que aceptas bitcoins y puede darte publicidad: https://es.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comercio Cual es tú tienda? Aprovecha a hacerte un poco de publicidad anda. I think the Bitcoin protocol already allows for a chargeback system. But its optional and selected by the payer. If you want more info youll have to ask one of the developers. [Mod:] Ok, aurumxchange and BitcoinExpress have stated their opinions without prove. Their post wont be deleted neither them banned. But please, dont post anymore without prove. You have already said what you think and it will remain in the post for anyone to see. Now its time to show prove or just stop.Also, if the Praxum reps want to open a new thread only dedicated to answer doubts about how your business work you should do so. Can you please bring prove that Paxum is Mallick, because until now you have not prove anything. Pleople here will thank you the information. This keeps getting better and better... Ok. So here is what I have gather from reading that link:Malick is a known scammer (epassport fiasco).Now, you claim that Paxum is run by the same Malick. I have read 10 out of the 15 pages of the thread, please point me to a link if there is anything interesting after that because all Ive seen is speculation. What I have gather from the thread:User nanaimogold says that he expects it to be owned by Malick, the scammer:Nanaimogold also says:But then he backs down:Now a Paxum rep appears and denies any relation with Malick:It seems confirmed that Paxum has nothing to do with Malick, the scammer, (nanaigold stops the accusation), but the Paxum rep admits that a guy employed previously in epassaporte worked with them for two weeks only:This is all that is relevant on the first 10 pages. Nanaimogold does not provide any more prove and in fact does not acuse Paxum of bein owned by the scammer any more.I have no relation with any of the companies involved here. That said, its a bit random that just after the MtGox/AurumXchange deal (http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=30982.0), AurumXchange comes here to bad mouth the new Trade Hill partner. Hopefully you are doing with the best of intentions.All I want to say is that if you are doing this to help the Bitcoin economy avoid another fiasco, thank you. But if this turns out to be one or various companies using bad tactics and spreading FUD and FEAR to damage competitors at the expense of the reputation of the Bitcoin economy, I promise you that I will use the little reputation I might have gather in this forums to spread the word so people dont use your services.EDIT: There has been some serious "pr work" in the forums lately by interested parties, trying to appear as normal users. All this has to stop. But here is the catch: the incentives are resversed in respect to a (government) democracy. If you are a user of bitcoins and have some amount of bitcoins and spect to earn more bitcoins in the future, and you are faced with the option of choosing between two clients: one that devaluates your money over time and the other that does not, which one would you choose?Also, it would not be a disaster that the bitcoin chain even forks in two (or more) option. Let the community that offerst the best money win.First, the pools hold as much power as their users want. If a pool does something that the miners participating in that pool dont like, they will leave and the pool will loose importance.More in general, anarchy has a mechanism to avoid concentration: not having a government, that is what allows a few to gain excesive power over the rest. Which is very good in my book. Democracy, facism, etc... all kind of authoritarian systems, apart from being inmoral are not efficient.If by voted you mean that the community would choose which client to use, then thats how you "vote". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source http://mises.org/ click on the Mises University 2011 Tab and you can watch the conferences live. Depending on how many miners I launched, I believe its because its the cpu that is the limiting factor.Whith only one miner the speed were swining between 60-40%. With four miners it was between 30-10% speed. I guess this is posible depending on how the 24h luck is calculated. Yes, I understand that, but the problem is that the luck was at 9'X and without solving any block it went to 10'X. Thats what cought my attention.If there is no block solved how is the luck going up? Eleuthria, the 24 hour luck indicator is going up but the last block awarded keeps stuck in the same block count. What is going on? Have we found a block but the count is stuck and not reseting? There is something wrong with the 24 hour luck indicator? AMDOverdriveCtrl Cuando quieras. Un saludo. Tengo dos tipos de billetes de 100 pesetas. Uno de 1925 donde sale Felipe II y el otro de 1928 donde sale Cervantes. Luego tengo otro de 50 pesetas de 1928 donde sale Velazquez. Luego ya tengo otro más moderno de 1951 de 5 pesetas donde sale Jaime Balmes (que no se quien es). Me los dio un familiar y tengo lo que tengo, no los colecciono yo. Ya me dirás si te interesa alguno. Actually no. Between MtGox and TradeHill they are the 90+% of the Dwolla bussiness. And in the rest there are other Bitcoin exchanges. Dwolla does not like to talk about it, but Dwolla is tied to Bitcoin. Without Bitcoin Dwolla would be nothing. As far as I know (and please someone correct me if wrong), that graph aproximates the speed of the network from time it takes to the network to find the blocks. So it is influenced by people adding and removing workers, but the temporal swings are also influenced by the luck of the network.Its imposible for anyone to know the real speed of each miner, not even the pools can know the real speed of the miners connected to them and approximate by the number of shares that each miner contributes. Same with that page and the blocks the whole network produces.
I tried 11.7 under linux and it was a disaster: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=32520.0 Im using Ubuntu 11.04 amd64 with 5870 cards and with the new Catalyst 11.7 driver I get 100% cpu and very low mining speeds (probably because the CPU can not keep up).I had the 11.6 drivers installed but since there was a kernel update and had to reintall the drivers for the new kernel I though I would install the new version, 11.7. But I get the problems described above. I have tried to uninstall the drivers, get Ubuntu working with the open source drivers, and then install again the 11.7. Same results. CPU goes to 100% and miners become very slow.So my advice would be to not install 11.7 under linux, but if anyone tries I would love to know their experience. Something like this?  The Obama side has no credibility, they are projections. Its based on some projections on what will do on the future, and they assume their stimulus plan works and the crisis is over so he will start reducing the size of government in the future. It wont happen. Obama is going to be as bad as Bush, if not worse. I guess you could use extenders and put any kind of card. For mining, you can use pci-e 1x to 16x extenders without any decrease in bitcoin mining speed. Video is great. If I ever go to New York Ill sure visit Meze Grill. To be fair, Bruce has said the CEO from Dwolla will be on his program: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=5952.msg403956#msg403956Im waiting for the episode to be aired to get their side of the story, but, honestly, it does not look very good for them. Its the other way around. When the debt ceiling gets increased (because it will, all they are doing now is a theater, everybody knows that they will increase the debt ceiling) it will allow for the government to keep spending and the Fed to monetize the debt. Its inflationary, bad for the dollar, bullish for competition for the dollar.If the USA government cut spending (by not raising the debt ceiling f.e.) or even if it defaulted, then it would be another issue and the dollar could strengthen, hurting bitcoins.But no worries. After all the theater they will raise the debt ceiling. But you get to watch the political theater. Enjoy it, you are paying for it. The more you talk the more convinced I am you are just a troll or have some personal interest on the issue. Keep giving them ideas...Where have you been? While some of the changes on this graph could be due to people starting and stopping their miners, a lot of it is due to variance of the whole network: Not true. The network as a whole can have good or bad luck. Yo tengo billetes españoles de 50 y 100 pesetas de 1925 hasta 1950. Perfectamente conservados. Te podría cambiar algunos por bitcoins.También tengo algunos más modernos de Brasil, Hong Kong Malasia, Egipto y China. Me los dio un familiar y los tengo ahí guardados.Si quieres fotos de algunos se puede arreglar. Aunque no pueden parar que la gente posea bitcoins, tenga nodos bitcoins en su casa o tenga sistemas de minería de bitcoin, sí que puede dificultar mucho su uso imponiendo regulaciones sobre su uso. Depende de lo draconianas y caras que sean esas regulaciones muchos negocios pueden decidir no usar bitcoins porque por los requerimientos legales no les compensa. Podrían salir una economía alternativa y demás, pero siempre va a ser más fácil crear una economía Bitcoin de negocios existentes que creandola de cero. Then maybe Im wrong and people want this system. Go and try to implemented. Lets see if the demand is there and it takes off.PS: You might want to join us at the spanish forum. I dont think people does not like the idea of a decentralized exchange (at least its not that I dont like it). The problem I see is that at this point it seems a bit useless. If there was a strong demand for changing between electronic decentralized currencies, it looks like a good idea (honestly I have not given a lot of though from the technical point of view). But there isnt, so it seems a bit useless. My 2 cents at least.But at some point, if the situation changes, it might be a very good idea. Just not now. Competition is not a tragedy of the commons. The guy in the other thread is full of shit in the way he uses the terms.What would happen is that miners would close operations and less miners would share the fees, making mining profitable again. The problem really is not with the viability of mining, as long as people use Bitcoin some level of mining will be profitable. The argument is about the level of security that can be achieved, f.e. you could argue that if some miners close, the equilibrium point will not have enough miners to mantain a certain level of security against 50% attacts. This is the real question, not the bullshit about competition being a tragedy of the commons.I think its a flawed reasoning because the value of bitcoins depend on its use. The more people using bitcoins the more demand will be and more value they will have (since the supply its a known factor). So the more people using bitcoins the higher its value and obviously the higher the incentive to try to attack the network. The same is true in resversal, the less people that uses bitcoins, the lower its value and obviously the lower the incentives to try to attack the network. But then at the same time, the more people using bitcoins, the bigger the amount of transactions fees (also of higher value) there will be, so the more miners there will be and the higher the security. As you see there is always an equilibrium between the incentives to attack the network and the incentives to mine and make the network more secure and the attacks harder and more expensive.Also, lets speculate on what would happen if there is a 50% attack. You have to think that a 50% attack would be recognized very quickly because it can not be sustained in time, its a very expensive operation. You would have to buy hardware and pay electricity to double the Bitcoin network hashing speed, so you are 50% (or 51%) of the network. When the news spread, there would be panic and the value of bitcoin would go lower, a lot lower. Probably a lot of merchants would stop accepting bitcoins at least until the issue is resolved. Maybe even exchanges would freeze activity for a while, etc... So the attacker would be basically spending a lot of resources to steal something that would depreciate and would be harder to use becuase of his attack. I dont think anyone would get his/her "investment" back from a 50% attack. The only option for a profitable attack would be if you are able to cash out really quick after the attack, but it seems improbable given the amount of money you would need to cash out to make up for the huge initial investment. A 50% attack makes more sense from the point of view of a government or financial institution that wants to destroy Bitcoin credibility.The main point is there is an equilibrium between the incentives to attack and the incentives to mine. Very nice work. Thanks. España ha aprobado una nueva ley de dinero electrónico (que me parece que viene de la UE). No soy abogado y estaría bien que algún abogado o alguien que sepa de leyes nos dijera si esta ley implica algo para Bitcoin.http://boe.es/boe/dias/2011/07/27/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-12909.pdfNo estoy seguro de que Bitcoin entre en la definición de dinero electrónico de la ley:Tal como yo lo entiendo (y repito no soy abogado así que podría estar totalmente equivocado) Bitcoin no representa un crédito sobre el emisor, ni se emite al recibo de fondos. Me da la impresión que van a tener un problema enorme para definir legalmente Bitcoin, una moneda descentralizada y voluntaria, como dinero sin una definición tan amplia que incluya cualquier intercambio no monetario. The problem is that he is looking for libertarian countries, not "austrian" countries. Libertarianism is a moral and political theory. Austrain economics is not a set of policies, but a social science.Im trying to make him understand this but he keeps using his "angry mummies kid" rethoric and saying that I want to have economics separated from everything and stupid stuff like that. 
Not exactly the same but related: http://www.economist.com/node/17366137?story_id=17366137&fsrc=scn/tw/te/rss/pe Im sure Eleuthria will be able to expain it better, but after the DDOS the luck went down a lot. I always supposed it was because of some artifcat in the statistics because of the DDOS. Maybe I was wrong. En el futuro esa "propina" será necesaria si quieres que tu transacción se valide en un margen de tiempo aceptable. Pero facilmente esa propina podrá ser de 0'05% (p.e.). Gracias a la competencia entre mineros la propina será mucho más barata que cualquier otro sistema. I think the -7.5% is not real because it includes the DDOS attack time.I actually suspect that sometimes something happens during the server changes because we always seem to get bad luck when one occurs, but I dont suspect eulethria honesty (hopefully I wont have to eat my words). Please, stop embarassing yourself.Well, if you study economics you look at economics. Saying that its useless, is like saying that biology is useless because it does not look into physics...But you did not even understood what I told you. Austrian economics does not have a set of policies. Austrian theory is just dedicated to understand and explain how the economy works with some predictive capability (as far as a social science can go).Then some austrian economists, based on this knowledge, have some policy recommendations, but they can and do change from one economist to other. Also, their policies are influenced by their political theory, which is usually around libertarian political theory (but not always).This has nothing to do with austrian economics or with what I said.There are a lot of practical applications of Austrain economics.  Basically understanding how the economy works. This can be very useful, for example, a lot of traders and hedge fund managers know and apply austrian economics and do very well.Actually not. While the Chicago school advocates have similar advice than a lot of austrian economists in a lot of areas (while widly different in others), at the core of the theories, monetarism (chicago school) is similar to keynesianism. Basically the methodology of monetarism is the same as keynesianism. Austrian economics is the most different fo the three.Maybe another day and to another person. Hes probably not using his own account. That would be stupid. For the ones that hate all legal terminology, can you explain the difference between a chargeback and reversing a transaction. Since you have come back we got an 1:30 minutes block and now a 3 hours 40 minutes and counting round. If I were a "modern" economist I would believe that correlation implies causality and so I would demand that you were ban from the pool. Mod: There are already 3 threads in the main forum about TradeHill and Dwolla. Did you really though a new one was necessary?Also, I would recommend to anyone not following the link. Bloggers are starting to see that bitching about Bitcoin brings them traffic so they bitch about Bitcoin as soon as they can. The solution is not to follow these types of links and they will stop bitching. I have that hardware here right by me. Just tell me how long do you want the number to be and for a low fee I will provide you with a trully 100% guarantee random number.  If a lot of people decided to sell a lot of bitcoins no matter the price and no matter where they come from (Deepbit, someone cashing out, etc...) without a similar influx of buyers then the price of bitcoins would drop.Currencies are just like any other product, they follow the law of supply and demand. Increase of supply, same demand = price goes down.This is very simple. The hard part is to predict the changes in supply and demand, and that is why predicting the price is so difficult. Honestly, if they did that it would be even possitive. It could be easily taken back to them to show that the press has an anti-bitcoin bias and get people interested into why they have such bias so they learn about Bitcoin.It would be a very bad move from them and very good for us. First a clarification to the op, because he got some basic ideas wrong:Austrian economic theory is just that, theories that describe reality and have some prediction capacity. Austrian theory does NOT have a set of policies to apply. Austrian theory, as opposed to other economic schools, is a social science. Austrian theory is not political theory, the political theory you are refering to is libertarianism.Honestly, for all the arrogance and high school showing off (uhhh, you went to high school....) the op is howing I though he would know the basic stuff.Now, if you meant that any country that got prosperous under the usual policies that a lot of austrian economists have recommended you have several examples. For example, Hong Kong or Switzerland, although they have changed right now. But you have historic examples all over the place, for example Canada during most of the XIX century or the USA during specific parts of that same century. In fact you will be hard pressed to find examples of countries that became long term prosperous (that means benefiting the people, not the elites) with policies too far away from what austrian economists recommend. In fact the USA today is a very good example of why following keynesianism creates problems. The USA could quite easily solve its problems if it adopted the right policies, but right now it seems politically imposible. I dont see either how this is going to be spin off as a Bitcoin failure. Its a failure of Dwolla, a dollar service. We had a user that brings bad luck to the poll. He left as a sacrifice for the rest, and as soon as he left BtcGuild has satrted having great luck. The gods of the mines were pleased with the sacrifice.http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=7760.msg397575#msg397575 Eulethria, the bug where the speed of some workers is reported 0 happened again to me just now.   Since you left we have had 3 lucky rounds, that is 3 rounds that lasted less than the average round for the pool speed. Maybe I should start believing in gods and dragons... Actually, he is right, I dont know if for the right reasons or not.To get rid of the government debt you need to change the monetary system first. Otherwise, by eliminating the government debt you would eliminate (almost) all the currency.If I am not mistaken, the last and only president to pay all the government debt in the USA was Andrew Jackson and he did it by removing the central bank and then having restrictive fiscal policies to return the debt. When you die you will receive 50 virgins. +1
I know. My 24 hours rewards its almost at half what it should be. -50% luck in the last 24 hours its a lot of variance for such a big pool.EDIT: Its oficial. My 24hours earnings are less than half of what they should be theoretically. <50+% bad luck in the last 24 hours. Not bad... Someone in the comment nailed it. They are mixing the worst of both worlds. If you want a have a centralized currency you dont need hashes and shit, just have it. Go away now! Its an order. If you want to blow money just for fun I recomend hookers and/or drugs. The bad luck is getting ridiculous. I dont know why, but we always get bad luck after changing servers. Maybe we should sacrifice some young virgin to the gods before eleuthria changes a server.Ive found two, and I would have made double by going alone than mining in a pool. But its all theoretical, because the murphy law states that if I had gone alone I would not have found any. Maybe if you would have gone alone, you would have found some. Its still to be seen if its legit and it could be a scam, but how is he trying to rob investors from their money when he has agreed with the greek company financing the test to not be payed until they have a prototype working. If this is not legit and they guy is doing it just for the lulz this is the trolling of the decade probably of the century. Calcetines de alpaca (no es broma, son de muy buena calidad), hardware de ordenador, música, monedas de bitcoin chapadas en oro.En unos días voy a probar por primera vez comprar la comida para mi gata con bitcoins (http://www.telepienso.com/) y espero poder comprar comida pronto. Y aunque parezca mentira llevo tiempo buscando comprar una camiseta de Bitcoin sencilla con bitcoins a un precio razonable (las que tienen precios razonables tienen cargos de envío a Europa muy caros) y no he encontrado aún. Hasta donde yo se, estás en lo cierto. TradeHill cobra una comisión del 0.6% por cualquier transacción que hagas dentro de su sistema, pero para las transferencias bancarias usando SEPA no cobran nada. The USA economy, while still stronger than a lot of people think, its not the reason the rest of the world respects the dollar and allows the USA to spend more than they produce. The reason they "respect" the dollar is that the USA has the bigger army in the world and uses it. Para prestar bitcoins. Hacer de intermediarios entre los que tienen ahorros y los que tienen ideas. Btw, I though huffpo was about news with some gossip. I dont read it but when I occasionally go there is always lots and lots of gossip. Shes dead? This might be the reason:http://www.zynga.com/about/poker-chips.phpAny buying and selling of the chips is ilegal and thats why they dont care. They are hard to sell. Its not really competition for the dollar. Im using bitcoin-qt. To be honest, I dont remember if I the last time I used the official client version it was .23 or .24 so it may have been solved already and blaming you guys for something that its bitcon-qt fault.Great.I know. It depends on what the miners decide to incude on the blocks and obviously a higher fee is a bigger incentive. Nobody is specting that you predict the behaviour of the miners. The explanation in the wiki is great. There is nothing ilegal with barter, and you have to pay taxes (in dollars) for it, but the smaller barter transactions are not required to pay taxes.Now, Im no lawyer and Im not sure about the next sentence, but I believe that the USA government would tax you on any capital gain you make playing poker in euros once you convert them back to dollars. F.e.: You use $10,000 dollars to buy euros, send them to a online poker website, play poker, win more euros and convert all your euros back to dollars for a total of $15,000. In this case you would have to pay taxes on the $5,000. And I repeat that the law might be more complicated in the USA, Im not 100% sure about it. Obviously. And its the right path. A single company can not fight against the USA government. Its ridiculous.Bitcoin can be very anonymous. It does not mean is always anonymous. +5I was unaware for a big while that the client included transactions fees automatically as well. And its not only the fact that there is no FAQ or other explanation, but that you are setting zero fees to the client but it sends a fee without telling you. It should not be that way and it feels like cheating. The client should say that its sending a minimum fee as a way to get the transaction processed. Yes:-US Dollar.End of list.Btw, if players connect via VPN or something similar to a Bitcoin poker site it would be impossible for the USA government to detect them. And they could pay the VPN with bitcoins as well. The problem would be for the poker site then. It would be very difficult to filter users to avoid bots and specially collusion. This is dishonest, since the Fed end up buying the mortgage shit from the banks with QE1. The problem with most peak-oil people is not their geological knowledge. The problem with a lot of them is their economic ignorance and their political activism getting on the way of making objective predictions. I have seen the most surreal economic explanations coming from the peak-oil people, and when you try to talk to them they just act like a sect.Im not a geological expert, I dont deny (or support) peak-oil, it might be real I just dont know enough about it, but their economic ignorance mix with arrogance when explaining their economic views gives me everything but confidence in their predictions.
eleuthria, could you include "Last Block Awarded" in the JSON stream? Thanks. Te lo sigo diciendo, programar una web es muy diferente de programar un microchip. Y en python las listas tienen una serie de limitaciones y hay que pareder a usarlas.Deberías dejarte de tanta teoría y bajar a la realidad. Te lo dice alguien que ha programado microchips y ahora está aprendiendo a programar webs. No te tomes las cosas tan literales. Programar una web es muy diferente de programar un microchip con C.Aunque yo no tengo que aprender los conceptos básicos de programación (que es una variable, que es un loop, etc...) sí que tengo que aprender como funcionan las listas en python, familiarizarme con la sintaxis, aprender html, aprenderme las librerías de django, etc... Es un mundo totalmente diferente y es mucho trabajo aprenderlo. Mining will never be unprofitable for all (except maybe in very short periods). But mining has very low barriers of entries and will become a very low yield activity.  También deberías ponerlo en: https://es.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comercio y si quieres en la sección inglesa también.Yo soy programador C y ahora estoy aprendiendo a programar con django (python + html + css), así que estamos un poco en el mismo carro todos. 1. The price of bitcoins depends on supply and demand just like anything else. Only the supply of bitcoins is known, the demand is unknown. So the price of bitcoins (that is the purchasing power of bitcoins) is unkown and can change. Because usually the productivity increases with time, its assumed that the purchasing power will go up, but in the short run nobody really knows.2. Its false that people stop spending when money appreciates (I dont even want to go into defining what a rational person is, the fact of the matter is that people spend even when money goes up in value). Bitcoin merchants have reported that when the price of bitcoins were rising sales were higher, as people were lured by the lower prices. You also have numerous examples in history of price deflationary economies were people kept spending.The idea that people dont spend because a currency appreciates is just a myth. I wish I could buy food with bitcoins in my country. First, Im not rigth wing, if I have to be somewhere Im more left wing.Second, while the statist right is being more vocal about inmigration, the statist left agrees. In my country the right wing party has legalized more inmigrants than the left party. The difference was that the left did it with a lot of propaganda while the right did it very silently.You can talk to any statist lefty here and I can assure you that a majority is against inmigration. We have had marxists playing the rethoric of the "evil chineses are taking our jobs" to get votes.Please, dont tell me the statist left is not anti-inmigrant because its a lie. The right wing is capitalizing it, thats the only difference. Ya estamos en tu opción 2: http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ Yes, I just checked and some miners went to the backup pool 9 minutes ago while another 2 hours ago. There is definitevely problems with the connection. No es que sea erroneo, es que las premisas pueden estar equivocadas. Ahora mismo poner más mineros es arriesgado, solo saldrá a cuenta si la dificultad no sube más y/o si el precio de los bitcoins sube más. PERO además si el precio subiera más te saldrá más a cuenta haber comprado bitcoins que no poner un minero.Minear va a ser rentable dependiendo de la futura dificultad y del precio de los bitcoins. Y predecir eso es dificil. Pero una vez supones esas dos variables el analisis que hace es correcto. Corrected it for you. Actually, the history of the progressive movement is full of racism and pro-eugenics.Its still to be seen if modern progressives are really not racist and not pro-eugenics. F.e. USA progressives were anti-war, apparently very anti-war, and the USA has now one of the most progressive presidents (Clinton was a center-democrat or so they say, I get lost in all this subtleness)... and he is extending the war operations. And I am the first to admit that one person, even the president, does not speak for the whole. But the sad part is that the progressives are silent, except very few but honorable exceptions. Code pink has almost disappeared and their president even justified the wars once Obama was in office. Where are the people that were so worried about the kids dying in Irak and outraged against Bush now that Obama is in power? Was the outrage real? Do I have to believe it was real?A lot of progressive economists are calling for tariffs arguying that foreigns are "taking the jobs". With their history of racism and changing positions to win elections, am I to believe that progressives are really for open borders or is just a plot to get votes?Anyway, it does not matter really, because as long as they proppose to give the government more power, this is what we all are going to get. I dont know if you realized the irony when I said: "The progressive dream is becoming a reality. The state will control everything, for your own good obviously." According to the progressives, its always for our own good. But what we always get is policeman with fingerprint readers. Progressives, european conservatives and a big part of USA conservatives are no different in reality, only different is the rethoric, nothing else. And we have a winner. Exactly. The theoretical posibility for cold fusion is there. Its more a problem of engineering. We dont know how to harvest that energy. This guy claims he has. Well see in October. The progressive dream is becoming a reality. The state will control everything, for your own good obviously.Hopefully more people like you will refuse to comply, its the only way it will stop. Im in Europe too and wont comply if implemented in my country. Im using linux too and dont want a GUI. I manage my mining rig through ssh. I have notice as well some short disconnects.EDIT: eleuthria, it seems there might be a problem in the webpage instead of disconnects. Im seeing some indicators with value zero and then on page reload going to their "real" value. It usually happens on worker speed, but I have seen it also on stimated rewards (the workers were not at 0 and stimated rewards was at 0, on reload it returned to its usual value).  Im in south Europe but its being a cool year. I tried this (I was a phoenix user until poclbm added backup pools), but the second miner would take some hashing power from the main one (big deal), and then if the main one went down it would not perform at full speed because the aggression was lower.
Backup pools. Its a big plus (and peace of mind).Also, for me poclmb is slightly faster than phoenix with the same kernel. Thats hot.I have mine in a separate room with two opposite windows fully opened, so air goes throw and I think I will be able to keep operating during the summer. The only bad thing about this is the rain. I hope this happens soon so we can point out at an example of a currency not working when someone proposes the same idea.Unfortunatelly he is a troll and wont do anything (hopefully Im wrong). If I remember correctly it has to have your money inmobilized for a while, which is equivalent to charging interest. And food would be so expensive that you would work only to eat something. If you can go to Madrid, this is one of the best: http://www.urjc.es/guias_docentes/guias_docentes_2007_2008/v_cienciaseconomicas_4_1.htm Dont give up so quickly on your trolling. This cite that has nothing to do with what anyone said is very poor even for you. You can do much better. You are such a troll.If you want the market to decide why were you arguing yesterday that the market can not handle the fee structure and that we all need to follow a fixed set of rules regarding fees following your oh so intelligent advise? Just for everyones information, cunicula comes daily to the forums to discuss Bitcoin while at the same time thinks that a decentralized currency is not possible (or has serious doubts about it). So basically he does not believe in the basic Bitcoin idea. Thats why he wants to kill it.Oh yes, and he continuously uses class warfare rethoric.Cunicula if you think you can create a better currency go do it. The Bitcoin community has released the code in open source and you just need to change a couple lines to be up and ready. Go take over the world with your inflationary currency. Read "free banking" theory, you will be surprised. The mentioned Lawrence White and George Selgin along with Steve Horwitz are the main proponents of free banking (that I know). Canada during the XIX century was that way (and btw, they had no central bank and no banking panics). There are other numerous examples.For raw data about the USA XIX century one of the best sources is the book Milton Friedman and Anna Swartz, although the book has very flawed conclussions due to their lack of valid economic theory. Rothbard's History of Money and Banking in the USA from the... is good to understand what happened.Then you can read Lawrence White about Scotland during the XVII century or George Selgin about Canada. There are no official numbers. It was reported by merchants in the forum whether you want to believe them or not i sup to you. But I dont think they would report something that hurts their sales.Also, you have data of price deflationary periods in history when investment and consumption went up. Do you realize that inflationary currencies are very old? All human history is plagued by inflationary currencies. No. Read what I wrote. Merchants, real merchants selling stuff, are reporting increasing sales when the value of bitcoins goes up. The theory that people dont buy because the price of money goes up is a myth. Decentralization is very important. Without it Bitcoin would not had even taken off. Apart from being false, it promises something it can not deliver. Nobody can know the amount of real transactions in the Bitcoin network or wealth being transfered for bitcoins, so its imposible to calculate a rate of monetary inflation to mantain stable prices. And what happens when prices are signaling that you need to contract the money supply? Its just stupid. Merchants are reporting bigger sales when Bitcoin price goes up, not when it goes down. This idea that people dont spend money when its value goes up is just a myth. Not necessarely. I had the same problem with a card in previous versions of the kernel. After 20 minutes it would produce that message in phoenix or would crash poclbm. But with exactly the same configuration and later kernels it was solved, even when it was producing higher hashing rates. I am not sure why it happens exactly. Money is a product because it produces a service. Just like a bus ticket allows me to take the bus, money allows me to trade with other people. Money is just a product. The fact that the product raises from social interaction as a kind of implied contract or agreement does not change the fact that money is a product.No exactly with all the rest, but yeah, there are level of substitution.Depends on the system. If you mean in the present monetary system, no, money is not artificially scarce (except in some puntual moments), the problem is the distribution and management.Well, the Fed has the federal fund rate at 0 right now... The thing is that the yields of nothing never get to 0. Its a tendency.See, this is where you have it wrong. Money produces a service of very important value. It allows people to trade (avoiding barter). This is an incredible service that I think you take for granted, but without it developed human civilizations could not exist.I was assuming that a working currency changes to Freicoin system. If it has to start from zero, I dont think it would be widely adopted, maybe only by ideology. And in case it was adopted by ideology competition would end up taking over. Maybe I have the system wrong, but monetizes a service or a product. If I give you a product, now I have credit with you at Ripple. Now I can use that credit with someone that thinks you are trustworthy. Well, yeah, you are monetizing the debt. Its still fine. There is nothing wrong on trading the debts.Youll have to be more specific. The list is huge.See above.Actually no. The interest are not mantained artificially high. The problem in the present system is the way money is distributed and managed. Again, the Fed has the fed fund rate at 0%.I think you are getting it upside down. Money produces a yield because there are people willing to borrow it. If nobody borrows money does not produce interest.Now if there are no real world projects that are profitable at a certain interest rate, nobody will borrow. Therefore money will yield absolutely nothing. What savers will do (through the financial system) is lower interest rates until they find someone willing to borrow, meaning that the yield of capital will be higher than the interest of money. Does that makes sense? You have not answered why you think its ok to earn a profit by renouncing to use a car (f.e.) for some time but its not ok if its money.They dont drop to cero naturally. They tend to zero because of competition, but then new products or improvements on previous products appear which allow someone to charge more for a while... and again and again.But I though interest rates were bad? Anyway, freicoin would not have low interest rates. While it lasted the lack of demand for the money would push price inflation up thus interest rates up. Then freicoin would disappear as people choosed another currency.Ripple is fine. Its a system that monetizes real goods. I have not followed the project and I dont know why it has not developed more but its a shame that it hasnt.2 issues. 1) During the Great Depression there was a contraction on credit and alternative currencies help mitigate the lack of cash. Almost any alternative method of payment would have helped. 2) It did not last. Monetary events take years and decades to develop. You can not judge a currency for a few years opperating, dont you think?Why? The same could be said from any kind of activity that produces profit.Why? Im guessing he will say that it pushes money into a few hands thus money does not circulate and the economy does not perform good enough.
hxxp://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/sticky-note/Seen here: http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/07/krugmans-error-of-being-stuck-on-sticky.html Bullshit. The serious issue is why do you keep trolling this forum. Krugman is now trying to defend his denial about inflation by showing charts of sticky prices... And even the sticky prices are going up. Obviously sticky prices are going up slower than non-sticky prices (no shit sherlock), but even sticky prices are going up.I dont understand how people can keep reading that clown. Suffolk bank was not a monopolly. It was a private entitity that at its peak had asociated around 60% of the banks of the state (from memory though, the % could be different). And during some periods it had competition. The prove that it was not a monopolly is the fact that a competiting bank appeared and Suffolk was forced to close its clearing house operations in one year.The point is:1. Contrary to what you said, security is not best handled as a monopolly, or at least its not impossible and not profitable to handle by private firms, as real life shows.2. With all your chaning subject any time you are proven wrong, I even forget what you are trying to prove about Bitcoin. Yes, so? The issue is still the same, you are getting compensated by renouncing for its use for a while in both cases. Why do you think its ok in one case and not in the other.Such a system is not posible economically but lets ignore that for now. The question is why interest is inhrently bad to you.Why do you want to build more houses? Do you realize that the role of money is to efficiently allocate resources, not build more of everything? If you decide to build more houses you are renouncing to build other stuff. Is that an adecuate decission? Interest rates coordinate that process and allow for an efficient allocation of resources satisfying the needs of the people. If you drop it to 0 the information is lost and nobody knows what type of products will be profitable or not.Why this agreement can not be around a commodity?In reality, money is a product.We just had a housing bubble with an excess of builiding houses thanks to the government regulated financial system.Money should be free in the sense that you should be able to choose the mony you want.Im ok with any voluntary system. The problem is, as stated above, that the ideas of Gessel would lead to discordination and poverty. The problem with Gessel is that he had no idea of capital structure and had this idea that the more the money circulates the richer everybody is, which is evidently false (if it is not evident to you, then comment). Stop trolling.Honestly when I though you could have an honest debate, you start trolling again. Sad.EDIT: Search Suffolk bank. I dont agree at all. In fact people pay for security to private firms in the present system where there is a monopolly on security and apparently it should not be necesary.And the private security agencies have not gone away, even in the face of a monpolly, so they are working. Sorry, what you say is not true. Efficient miner is different than a miner with a lot of hasing power. I can start mining with a very efficient system (consuming less energy for Hash than my competition) but still have very little processing power, and I would need time and money to get to their position, which in turns gives them the opportunity to react. Its called the market process.Therefore being efficient does NOT imply getting a lot of fees. It will tend to go there with time, but a) the efficient miner needs to add more hashing power, thus avoiding the problem of reducing the hashing power, b) the others will react and try to become efficient as well.You are basically saying that competition is a tragedy of the commons, which is basically nonsense. But again you are forgetting that the decline in Bitcoin generation does not go away suddenly. Its progressive over time and wont end until 2040. Miners have plenty of time and also the incentives to adapt.What you are proposing is a fixed level of fees depending on a set of conditions that you think are the best. But how is this fixed system that you are proposing not more dangerous and less adaptable than a system where the miners, the people with the experience and the information, decide at every moment the best strategy? Imagine the percentage or rules you propose are too much or too little? That would hurt Bitcoin big time. Its better to leave the miners decide what they need to charge to be in business.EDIT:Already answered to him. See above. Competition does not work the way he is portraying it. According to him/her competition is a tragedy of the commons. If that were true, the human race would have disappeared long ago. Thank you for pointing out that this thread is just a rehash of another thread. Why not continue the discussion there, instead of making everybody repeat the same arguments? Propagandizing or trolling are the only two options I can imagine.No, this if false. It is true that the inefficient miners will be pushed out of the market, but that does not mean reducing difficulty in a meaningful way. What will happen is that the more efficient miners will take the place of the less efficient miners, and probably a part of the less efficient miners will learn how to become more efficient.The failure of what you are saying is that a extremely efficient miner with very little hash power, will take very long to get a block thus taking away very little fees from the other miners. Unless the efficient miner starts expanding and adquire more hasing power it would not represent a thread to the rest of the miners. Therefore you already have more hashing power appearing.See above.I though the Bitcoin community was dogmatic. Now the problem is too many opinions? Some people are never happy.I dont see how you have answered to my points. 1. You are ignoring initial investment.It might not be profitable to buy more hardware because the rate of return is so low that it will take too long to recover, but it might still be profitable to keep the hardware running. Miners will hardly stop mining as long as the income is slightly above the price of electricity. So maintaing a certain hashing power once the network has gotten there is not that difficult.2. The value of Bitcoin creates incentive both ways.If Bitcoin value goes up incentivates more cheaters, but it also makes mining more profitable atracting more hashing power. Also, Bitcoin has been created to be used widely, so it will generate a big amount of transaction and therefore transaction fees. The initial compensation for block is a way to jumpstart the system and at the same time distribute the currency.3. What you are proposing is already posibleThe "solution" to the no-problem is already in place. Miners can decide which transactions they process and which transactions they dont. If they feel they are not being payed enough they can decide to not process transactions with a fee that does not met a certain percentage of the bitcoins being transfered, for example a 0.5%. So if someone with a lot of bitcoins wants to transfer them the miners can decide not to unless that person pays a fee that pleases them.And last, this has been discussed already. Why keep opening threads discussing the same again and again? You wrote:I answered. Stop messing around.Cunicula is a troll. Do you really think that cheap discussion tactics are going to get you anywhere? Not even trying to argue my points. Just repeating talking points. Sad.Its easy to pove that what you repeat about me is true. Im discussing openly with you. Refute my points and prove to everybody that Im what you said. Otherwise you are just making everybody loose their time. Its your opportunity to stick it to a mod. I would suggest that if you want to have a rational conversation you stop saying things like:Its insulting.Second, this post is the best example of cunicula being a troll, for example:This is just ridiculous and FUD. Forking is a reality, and in fact happened at the beginning with a bug in the client.This is a bunch of bullshit. Creating additional nodes is very easy, specially if you are going to profit from gaining more votes. If you are going to create a voting system you need to identify people, which is a bit contradictory if you want to have a pseudo-anonimous currency. This type of bullshit is what you call "thinking people".Also, the above statment is just trying to create "class warfare" mentality. People is not forced to use Bitcoin, if they dont like it or think its unfair they can go and use another currency or even create their own. Bitcoin is open source so you only need to change a few lines in the code and you are set to go. The Bitcoin community has done all the work for you. It does not get easier than that. How is that creating a domination elite?The guy is a troll, and not very intelligent at that. For example, BubbleBoy was a troll but one you could be entertained with because he was intelligent. The DDOS part is easy to avoid. Have two or three (or more) proxies.I dont see how you would get an increase in 14% earnings. Imagine a proxy of three pools. The proxy emits a new block mesage and you properly guess its coming from that proxy. Now you move your miners proportionally (the way you preffer) to the three pools connected to that proxy. You might be gaining by connecting to the pool that just found a new block, but how do you know that the other two pools are not in a bad strike and you are hashing low profitable shares? It might increase a bit your earnings, but not close to 14%.But even that can be avoided. The pools could have several proxies and rotate among them randomly. That would stop also the DDOS attacks (or make them more difficult). Now the groups are not defined but change randomly. How could you attack such system?Costumers are free to complain to the business owners about the service and go away if their complaints are not met. If the clients keep returning to the business it means they dont care that much about it. If the owners feel it would improve the service they can decide to change the way their business operate to accomodate some of the complaints of the costumers. If other costumers dont like the changes they can complain and/or go away as well. I dont see the big deal. Cunicula is a known troll. This was his lame attempt at starting a "class war". He is always very insulting and puts other peole down. What about a SMPPS without negative memory? There would be some loses when there is a bad strike at first, but eventually, because of probability compensating, the pool would have enough saved to whether most bad strikes without going into negative. Yes, the problem is that the systems you propose (money that rots f.e.) produce discordination in the economy and if imposed exclusively would lead to poverty.There is nothing bad in interests. If you have a car and rent it, you are getting a profit because you are renouncing to its use for a while. Same with money. You rent it out and get a profit because you are renouncing to its use for a while. I fail to see the difference and why you consider one ok and the other not. So you leave and go to another place to get your burger. If enough clients dont like how the fast good burger place is operated it will loose a lot of the clients and it will close. So far, it seems the majority of the BTCGuild users like the changes. Nobody is stopping from creating your own pool if you think you can do better. No, because it would be a private proxy, where only 2 or 3 pools have their bitcoind connected.1) You can still DDoS their bitcoind now. Just because groups of 2 or 3 pools join together doesnt change the game much.2) You could not connect, it would be a private proxy only used by the bitcoind of the selected pools. Read too quick. I think if someone did something like this, it would be considered spam and some measure would be taken to avoid those clients or IP's.3) Whats your beef against proportional pools?
Its in its way of happening then. If BBB was a government agency there would be no way to "fight back". You would have to finance it through taxes and shut up. Yes, but what if someone hacks the browser and sends a send to order to the client? Browsers are very hackable, they are very expose and do a lot of stuff.A solution might be to have a mode in the client where all the RPC transactions have to be confirmed manually. Im still fearful of connecting the client to the browser but that might work. Yeah, Im curious too about the exploits for SMPPS. So I was thinking in a way to stop this and I think its easy: Just have deepbit, BTCGuild and maybe others bitcoind client connect to the Bitcoin network throught the same proxy. The pools would still have the same chance of propagating when a new block is found because they are using the same proxy, but the pool hoopers would not know from which pool is coming because all they see is the messages coming from the same source.Ideally pools would join in groups of 3 and 4 and create several proxies so there would be less chance of cheating and it would be more decentralized.Thoughts? But with the speed and the start time they can get a good enough stimate. What they really need is the start round time. If they dont know when the round started they can not pool hoop. If they know, they can stimated and even if they cant get an stimate getting early and leaving at some random point is still profitable. The point of pool hooping is to get in at the beggining of the round of each pool to get a bigger change of getting shares of the short rounds and avoid the shares of the long rounds. I went to another pool because of the pool hooping problem here.I dont see how removing the "share in round" solves anything. As long as they know when a new block was solved they can jump in at the beggining. Or what am I missing?EDIT: There you go: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=26866.msg374692#msg374692 Are you guys sure you want to connect your browser to the bitcoin client and allow it to send it orders? That would be a hackers paradise. I have, the version with the molex to get the energy directly from the psu. I have two 5870 running with those cables. Not a problem, no reduction of speed. Bad analogy. A better analogy would be that the owner of the stadium has changed the horse racing rules to make the race more even and give a better spectacle.Do you realize that if everybody pool hooped the pools would suddenly get stuck in a block because everybody would have gone away? And please, stop the bullshit that you are so clever because you downloaded a program from the Internet that allows you to pool hoop. If I wanted to I could download the same program and run it. Its nothing special.Its normal that the people who dont pool hoop have asked the pool owner to do something about it. They are being loyal to the pool, sticking around during the long rounds and contributing the less payed shares, and getting the worst part of the deal. The pool owner has decided what type of user s/he wants. Why are you complaining? And pro-anarchy does not mean pro-caos or pro-violence. Actually, the contrary.   Someone forgot to take his/her pills. Same here. With the hoopers gone the payout is a lot more stable.You can see the measure hurt the hoopers by the reactions in this thread.I dont know what I was thinking when I wrote this. For some reason I though the dealy started counting when the round started...   I was thinking, and the pool hoopers could know sometimes when a round starts. When the previous round was longer than 1 hour the round will appear and the pool hoopers will know a new round has started. Its a bit of a long shot, but I think the solution is quite easy. It could be solved by delaying 10 minutes the report of a block that was longer than 1 hour. +1Also, how do you decide which price inflation indicator to use? What we call price inflation is just the price index issued by the government. But Bitcoin has no government and the price index can be calculated in infinite ways. Someone could create a wireless connection from Alaska to Russia and act as a bridge. Sarah Palin says she can see the "other side" from her home... You mean this: http://bitcoin-otc.com/ ? +1EDIT: Btw, I dont know if Im just having bad memory, but it feels like lately we are having more variance. 2'2 TH/s we should be around 45 minutes each block on average, but we are getting several very long blocks (4+ hours) and then several very very short blocks (less than 10 minutes). I dont remember so much variance before. Probability is a bitch I guess. Who are you talking about? I dont understand your answer.+1 If you are comparing the real interest rate on the loans you have to apply the price inflation/deflation in both loans, not only in one. Fair enough.
The problem is that a lot of the miners will go away when the block becomes too long, as had happened in the 10th round. I am waiting for the changes to be implemented to return to the pool.(I wish I had changed so quick because I missed the quick round and went to BTCGuild that had a horrible luck strike. Oh well.) You could make it either way, but honestly I would make it so it does not remembers negative strikes, because otherwise it will stop newcomers from joining the pool. At some point the pool should almost always have a positive credit and rarely touch 0, because variance should even out. That has to be the worst strike of luck ever. At 2000+ GH/s, we found 2 blocks in 10 hours 10 minutes. Thats almost 6x. I dont know if we will be able to find the investors. Maybe is easier than I think, who knows. The obvious move now is that someone capable and with some respect in the Bitcoin community ( **cough** JoelKatz **cough** ) picks up the project, writes down a viable plan both from the economical and engineering point of view and then throws the idea out to see if the investors are there or not. Sounds fine. The problem is finding 1000 investors. Does not sound like an easy task. I have not read the whole thing yet, just made it to the middle, but you can not expect people to demand the same interest rate in a inflationary monetary system than in a non-inflationary monetary system. The premium for inflation is always considered when given a loan. For example, a 6% loan with a 3% price inflation rate, has a real interest rate of 3%. Thus in a price deflationary system, f.e. -1% price inflation, a real interest rate of 3% is a 2% interest rate. In both cases the burden to return the loan is the same.You can not seriously expect someone to demand the same interest rate in a price inflationary environment than in a price deflationary one.EDIT: Ended reading it. You are now appliying the price deflation rate to the loan. I dont know if you realize that you should also aply the price inflation rate to calculate the difference between the two loans. In proportional if you have a bad luck streak you get paid less. Fullstop. In SMPPS if you have a bad luck streak you might be able to recover a part. Yes, but they would not be payed in proportional either. So its not like you are loosing anything. The worst thing is that I am not even surprised. What about financing it through shares? I mean, creating a sort of a cooperative that pays dividends in cards, so people pay the money and at the end when it is developed they get payed in cards. That way you are making sure you will get a number of sales before starting the project. Sort of like testing the waters to know if the demand is there. There is no need to delay the last share received or the speed worker stats, but the shares this rounds would need to be delayed because it reveals when a round starts. I had though on doing this and host it in the freenet network (freenet is similar to TOR but with wepage hosting included). Also, make a plugin for the client so the anonimization would be extremely easy. If this is about programming skill, then you wont mind that the pools delay their information one hour. Without the info about when a new round starts in each pool, lets see how those programming skills help you. Since you are counting $400 for 4 chips and $150 for the rest (for a total of $650) would it be posible to include a chipset that allowed a ethernet connection and a very simple webserver (like the chipset in a home router) instead of the usb chipset. This way you could have an independent device just connected to the ethernet network and configured by a simple web interface. Im not very informed about the prices but I dont think it would push the cost too much and it would avoid the need for a computer (saving energy and money). The question I guess is if that simple chipset could handle the mining software load. Yes, but that does not matter here because the point of a pool is that it does not matter who finds the block in the pool. No matter who is the miner that finds the block the profits are shared. In the pool what matters is how many shares you send and how much you earn for each share.The key is that by being only at the beggining of the rounds you get a higher chance of getting more shares from short rounds (the more profitable shares) while avoiding a big part of the shares from the long rounds (the less profitable ones). A currency that its not monetarely inflationary is considered price deflationary because of the increase in production due to raise in productivity. If there is not an incrase in productivity prices dont change. So the wages of the workers do not go down becuase the lower prices come from increase productivity (each worker now produces more stuff). We have been discusing about Pool Hooping in the BTCGuild thread and the conclussion has been that delaying the information stops pool hoopers. The idea is that pool hooping is only profitable if you join when a new round starts. But if you dont know when a new round starts then you can not do pool hooping. So there is no need for complicated system. Just delay the information some hours and pool hooping is not posible. In BTCGuild they can probably get away with delaying the information 1 hour, but in smaller pools like this one maybe you need to delay it like 6 hours or something like that? I am completely ignorant about how LP works, but does it really report when a new round on the pool starts, or only signals when a new block has been found (in some pool but you can not know in which one)? In the first case pool hooping is posible with LP, in the second case its not. If the pool hoopers know when the rounds start in real time, they hurt the rest of the users. If they dont, then pool hooping becomes random and they can not profit and do not hurt others.Pool hooping is only profitable if they know when the round is starting. So yes, delay the stats 1 hour (or whatever) and pool hooping problem is gone. Its easy to read the JSON. But yes, I dont know if they do it, as I said Im not a hooper. In this sense its probably easier for the hoopers to operate in smaller pools so the probability of a very short round is a lot lower.
Hoopers, at least inteligent hoopers, only jump to pools that just started a round, and then leave to join another pool that just started their round. Im sure there will be better optimizations, I am not a pool hooper so I dont know them. But the key is that you know when a round starts, but not when a round ends, so by being at the beggining of each round in different pools you increase the probability of getting the more profitable shares while avoiding part of the less profitable shares.They key is that you know when a round starts but not when it ends. First, the "legal" user does not benefit from having the hoopers in the short runs or in the beggining of the long rounds. Yes, it will make the pool discover rounds quicker, but then the bitcoins have to be divided among more people, so there is no increase in profit from having the hoopers for the "legal" miner. Maybe the only advantage is a reduction on variance, but only maybe because they leave in the long rounds making them longer (Im not really sure about the net result on variance but its irrelevant, the point is that it does not increase the profits for the "legal" miner to have the hoopers).Then, the shares in the quick rounds are more profitable than the shares in the long rounds. Ideally everybody would want to have luck and get quick rounds. But we know that over time things even out, so "legal" miners assume that they will get an even number of more profitable shares and less profitable shares. But pool hoopers get a bigger number of more profitable shares, while leaving the less profitable shares to the "legal" miners that have to assume its costs alone.Is that clearer?EDIT: Its easy to prove that hoopers are taking bitcoins from "legal" miners in other way: Since bitcoins are created at a predictable rate (lets ignore difficulty changes for this), and hoopers make more bitcoins by changing pools (and this can be demostrated easily), it means that there are less bitcoins for the rest. This is because the "legal" miners work more on the less profitable shares (the ones from the long rounds) than the hoopers. But this is not true.Because the "legal" miner gets to colaborate more in the long rounds, the ones that are less profitable, while the pool hoppers jump to a new one and stop collaborating. In the more profitable rounds, the pool hoopers get their complete share.Supposedly you are collaborating in the long rounds because it gets compensated in the short rounds and with time its even. But if some of the miners only collaborate fully in the short runs and only a part collaborate in the long rounds, the less profitables, there is a problem where some are benefiting at the expense of others. But there are still 50 bitcoins created every ten minutes (roughly) that means 6000 bitcoins a day, 42000 bitcoins a week, ... you get the idea. Thats a big increase in the money supply and there are a number of miners that sell what they produce, so there has to be people buying, otherwise with the new supply of bitcoins the price would plummet. You can use pci-e extenders that get the current directly from the PSU so the motherboard does not suffer. You can get $100 motherboards that will accept 6 cards with extenders without a problem. And you need the extenders anyway becuase the cards are double and you want them to be separated to keep them cool. So really there is no need for such a expensive motherboard. Get a good one, $100-150 and extenders with a molex to get the current directly from the PSU. Actually, during the 70's there stagflation. The Fed was loose but because the capital structure was so distorted from the inflation from previous years, the stock market did not do that good. The money flowed into other areas. So watch out, with stagflation the stock market wont collapse but it will hardly keep up with price inflation. Some stocks will do good (specially the ones related with commodities), but overall I dont think it will be that good. The thing the guy is not publishing or explaining how it works inside because:1) Its a scam.2) He wants to make money out of his invention and does not want to reveal how it works.So yeah, the guy is not publishing anything with scientific standars, nor giving information about his invention, but that does not mean automatically that its a scam.From the videos I have seen if it is a trick its a very good trick because I have not seen where the energy could be coming from. Also, he has agreed with the greek company to not be payed a dime until they have the prototype working and he has agreed. If it is a scam and the thing does not work why would he agree to something like that?I guess we will see if it is real or not in a few months. The prototype from the greek company should be ready by October. Ok, so there could be "negative" excess reserves, meaning that the pool will pay in the future those shares when they are found.Yeah, this sounds like a good idea. But if the pool goes into a strike of bad luck, new users still know that they might be payed less, unless the pool goes into a strike of good luck, so its not as big but there is still a disincentive. Also, its complicated, people like simple things. Ok, so Im waiting for someone to prove this is just a scam, but for what I have read Im starting to think it could be legit. The wikipedia page does not link any criticism and there are a couple companies (one from Greece, one from the USA) that are starting to develop systems based on this idea.Anyone has more information (for good or for bad) about this? Sounds too good to be true. The only problem I see is that I think it consumes a lot of water but I still dont understand the system completely. I dont see the difference. If prices are going down, they are lowered.Maybe, but they did not know. The probably just saw something cheap and bought it.Yes, but this does not mean a reduction on consumption.Once people have their basic needs covered they can start thinking more about the future, meaning they can start saving more, which in turn lowers interest rates. When production grows, f.e. there is more or better food, prices go down, people can access those basic goods cheaper. With what they have left they can increase consumption, increase savings (thus lowering interest rates and promoting investment) or a combination of both. So lets say the system gets implemented and the pool has horrible luck for two weeks. The miner will have some shares that are not payed since the reserve funds are 0. Now Bitp.it has two weeks of very good luck and creates some reserve funds. At this point some new mienrs come in. Now other two weeks of horrible luck, but this new miners get payed because the pool has available funds they did not contributed to obtain. Am I missing something? That is some clever idea.The only problem I see with this is that if the first rounds after implementing this are very lucky the funds will be used to payout the future long rounds where miners that werent there before can profit. And there is no point on keeping it secret since it can be easily calculated from the pool stats. Anyway, given the options its not a bad solution. How does SMPPS work exactly? Are you sure that card is working? Its bad because the non-pool-hoopers do the ungrateful work while it is being payed the same as the other work, while the pool-hoopers get the rewards from quicker finds of other mining pools. Pool-hooping is profitable unless the pool stablishes some time of anti-hooping mechanism, like rewarding more the late shares.I know is tempting to not discourage pool hooping because you get more Hash/s rate for a while, but I think it also discourages the "legal" miners that feel they are being cheated. What is with the big swings in the pool total hash rate today? In the lat hour or so I have seen it in the from 100Mh/s to 70Mh/s. Elections on 2012. Obama wants the Fed to inflate to create a mini-bubble and give the impression that the economy is improving so he can use it during the campaign.Nixon did the same with Arthur Burns and the USA then went into stagflation: http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.20.4.177 But if you are fixing the price to another currency, why not hold the other currency directly? I mean, if I know 5 beers are going to always be 50 euros, why not just have 50 euros and avoid the counterparty risk?I just dont get this project and Im trying to see if Im being thick or what. And thats why they dont invent anything else of worth anymore.  But seriously, when I talk about inventions Im not talking necesarely about discovering how to produce fision energy. Im talking about this kind of stuff: http://uk.reuters.com/video/2011/07/11/bringing-light-to-the-poor-one-liter-at?videoId=216968892&videoChannel=82 Really fulfilling the needs of the people with the resources available. Slush pool adds automatically the IP of the user to the whitelist (from the web browser), while allowing to add new IP's in the account screen. The people less experienced usually has the miners in the same IP, and the people that has big mining systems know how to add an IP to a list.Also, I believe (but Im not sure) the whiltelist is off by default and only goes on when there is an attack on the pool.
Yes, but what I am saying is that the type of growth that you are getting or the distribution of such growth is because of politics. Im saying that the inequality is not inherent to growth, but to the politics that are happening.If you study the USA XIX century you will be surprised by how resourceful and ingenious some people without studies can be (and I have an engineering degree, so Im not saying this out of ego) if they dont have regulations on their way. The problem about regulations like licenses and controls is that it stops and discourages people with ideas but not much credibility from being able to try new things. F.e. the plane was invented by some guys in a bycicle shop, when there were re-known people trying. Studies is only a factor if you are judged by your CV, but not if you opperate in a free market. Why not create a whiltelist system, like slush?EDIT: the stale thing is weird. I get amazing stale count, but suddenly I get like a burst of stales, for example this just happened:Code:pool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:49:35, 15e344e4, acceptedpool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:49:35, 6a9587b6, acceptedpool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:49:38, 3fa0e6a4, acceptedpool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:49:48, d228fc62, _rejected_pool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:49:53, 39d74dee, _rejected_pool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:49:56, 400c5ad2, _rejected_pool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:49:58, e044bf7e, _rejected_pool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:50:07, 658b753c, _rejected_pool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:50:17, 0608dbdc, acceptedpool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:50:33, 957bcb54, acceptedpool.bitp.it:8334 13/07/2011 21:50:42, 67c6fe07, acceptedIt happens in random cards and only in this pool.Except for this "bursts" of stales the stale count is amazing. Why? I dont think growth necesarely leads to a specific change in the balance between investing and consuming. It can go anyway.As I said, I dont think the balance between savings and consuming needs to change in a pre-determined way. In general growth leads to lower interest rates because there is more resources available (and this can happen even if the relation between savings and consumption has not changed because the overall production is bigger). The only case where growth does not lead to more savings is if all the increase goes to consumption.High interest rates yes, falling prices not necesarely. In fact, you have an empirical evidence with Bitcoin. The merchants have reported that when the exchange usd-btc was raising for bitcoin people spent more in the Bitcoin economy lured by the lower prices. The meme about lower prices stopping consumption is just false.Savings. Hoping in is not a problem, the problem is hoping out. Well, Im asuming a free market. Bernanke changes the game.I think you are missing one point though. If people decide to consume more or less at some point, it will change the money they can save and therefore the money there will be availabel for investment. In an extreme case if people got fed up of saving and increased consumption a lot, therefore not being able to save interest rates could raise even when growth was happening. Obviously, since people is consuming like crazy and not investing for the future, future growth would suffer, but theoretically you could have interest rates raising infront of strong growth. But such a change in behaviour from everybody at the same time is not probable at all (in a free market).I still think that saying development always leads to higher inequality is too broad. It can go one way or the other depending on the effect of the new technology.In my opinion, austrian economics has the most developed theory about how interest rates affect the economy. Interest rates give information to entrepreneurs about what type of business society wants/needs/can afford. Higher interest rates signals less savings which means business man will start more business that are closer to the consumer, while lower interest rates signals more savings, more resources available, so long term projects, that are father away from the consumer become viable.Its quite academical but if you want to read about interest rates and how they affect the economy I would recommend you "Time and Money" from Garrison.But you are assuming that the inequality is due to the growth and not to the political reality of the country. In my opinion is a big stretch. There are very poor and underdeveloped countries with big inequalities. Ok, so you are basically a 100% reserve bank of whatever currencies you decide to hold. But the question now is: whats the point? Why would I want to use your currency instead of euros if I know they are the "same? And what do you get of all this and how do I know you will stay honest? Interesting topic, lets speculate a bit.True most of the time (growth tends to increase savings, which in turn determines interest rates), but its not the only factor that affects interest rates.Without giving it too much though, I would say that such situation would produce a halt to the development of the specialization and the division of labour. But not necesarely reduce inequality. You have to think that scientific and technological advances produce growth and also can help mitigate inequality instead of creating more. When unqualified workers have access to new machinery they produce more and can bargain for better wages. In fact, technological development a lot of times eliminates the need for a set of qualified workers (usually by creating another type of qualified workers).It dont think its as easy as you paint it. It can go both ways. Was that another round?That is lucky.Btw, I support implementing some sort of anti-pool hooping measure. Its tempting for me to do it since its profitable. If you dont have direct control of the supply, you wont be able to control it for long. You will eventually run out of funds, there are very clever speculators out there. This happens constantly when central banks try control the exchange rate of their currency. Because they dont control the supply of the other currency they get crashed. The chinese are able to do what they do because their economy is developing and the natural tendency of their currency is appreciation. Devaluating is easy and "free" (for the central bank). Increasing the value of a currency is expensive. If the chinese economy started to fail, their central bank would be unable to hold the value of the yuan to the dollar.If you have direct control of the supply, who is going to trust the currency? Sorry, I dont get it. What is the difference between the page you linked and the page you are proposing? A currency is a property, and a property can be a currency. Correct in general. Just a couple of points:1. Nothing has intrinsic value. Value is always subjective. What people that talk about intrinsic value want to say is that Bitcoin does not have other use apart from being money.2. Bitcoin does not have any other use apart from being money right now (at least not in a meaningfull way). The idea that Satoshi had and used to create Bitcoin might have other uses, but not Bitcoin. Exactly. Ive always seen people put the fans on top of the cards, and I always though its dumb. The fans should be under the card, or at least on the sides. You pull the cold air from the bottom towards the cards and let the hot air go up, instead of pushing the hot air the cards are producing again towards the cards. In reality Bitcoin was valued originally by entrepreneurs that could see its future value as money. Maybe curiosity was a factor for some too, but if you go and check the early messages on the forum, we really believed in Bitcoin and time is slowly starting to prove us right.So I say that the initial value of Bitcoin is the value that entrepreneurs assigned to it because it was useful to the "vision" they had. And we have a winner! Exactly. They just said something similar in Australia regarding housing prices, so you know the australian housing bubble is about to crash. The real state agents are already failing to provide the prices they are selling the houses for as required by law.Now that China housing bubble is about to pop now, the only big housing bubble that is left is the canadian one. I wonder when will Canada crash. Stales is a problem of syncronization between the pool and you. Its not an issue of your card.I tried Mine.co and saw huge stales as well. Other pools have better software. I had problems as well. Lots of stales one after another and problems connecting.Now it seems to work fine. A new technology with better energy efficiency appearing for example. If I have understood correctly, you wont accomplish what you are promising, because its basically imposible. The price of anything, including a currency is determined by supply and demand. You are controlling the supply and it wont change more than your 3%. But the demand is unknown and can be very variable, so you basically can not control the price.
Thats exactly the point. Mining is used to secure the network. Its not useless or wastefulness. Completely agree.If you need to tax (big if) probably the best way is a mix of corporate tax, tariffs and consumption tax. The balance between tariffs and consumption tax is important to not favour too much the internal products (because you become inefficient and products more expensive) or not favour too much external production (you can cause problems of unemployment, although less than what people generally think it does, and expose yourself too much to crisis in foreign countries).If Bitcoin goes big it will probably eliminate the income tax, because it will be too dificult to collect. Finally guys, for a moment I though you were trying to break a record or something...I just pointed my 4 miners towards you. Lets see how it goes. Yes, please, keep us informed.Btw, Im a fan of your books.  Im using the previous patch, that is almost as fast, in that card, so its ok.Im wondering as well if the card has some kind of problem, but with other kernels it has been running non-stop for days without a problem. Dont know why some kernels trigger the crash. They are mining bitcoins!!  http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/07/federal-reserve-has-secret-facility-in.html Es cierto, pero va a épocas y regiones: http://www.libremercado.com/2011-05-25/china-se-enfrenta-a-la-mayor-crisis-energetica-de-la-ultima-decada-1276424328/ Previous patches had solved one of my cards crashing the miner every 30 minutes or so, but this one has reintroduced the problem. One miner mining a 5870 crashed after 20 minutes. Bitcoin has its risks, but the dollar has guaranteed devaluation. Alguien sabe el precio de la electricidad en China? The processing part is taken care by opencl, and the processor is not the bottleneck (my processor rarely goes over 20% with 4 gpus hashing 1800Mh/s), so I doubt it will make a difference. The key for speed is in the opencl code not in the python part, and that is why there is people optimizing the mining opencl kernels. Even at 1600GH/s this is not normal. Yesterday we have spectacular luck, but since the new server went up there has been terrible luck. Maybe is just coincidence, who knows. This is false. The first roads in the USA were built by cooperatives formed in the towns that wanted to build the roads. It wasnt until later that the government got in because it wanted its share of the business.Previously, the elder could save in money that would last and did not need to be gambling in the stock market to keep their retirement funds or trust that the politicians would not collapse the social security funds before they need them. You have to thanks the government for that too. They sure are spending their money. Its nice to have this type of press releases. I promise you a bigger share of your own money.  Vote for me!And the rainbows!! Dont forget the rainbows, without the state there would not be rainbows.Its not the people working that produces all that above... No, no way. Its The State! All hail The State! Thats weird, I have been sending bitcoins without fee and before an hour the transaction is confirmed. And Vala! Yep.You can alredy see the cracks in the chinese economy, specially in the energy and housing sectors. If you receive something in the mail the shop obviously knows who you are, but being able to send bitcoins without revealing your real address stps the shop or anyone else from linking you to your original address and that address remains anonymous, which is always interesting. You should choose either go to C or go to python (or ruby, but I personally preffer python). C will give you a more clear understanding about programming and will make it easier to learn any other programming language in the future, but its harder to learn. Python is easier to learn and will allow you to achieve results way faster.
And we have a winner!!!This is actually very good. But what about the kids?!?!?! What you say next is correct, but its not because of the Gresham law. Gresham law only applies if there is an artificially fixed exchange rate between two currencies. If the currencies float freely Gresham law does not apply. F.e.: The market price of gold is now over $1540, so it means there are people buying and selling around that price. If the government now sets a price of $800 by law, nobody will sell it at that price and gold will go into hidding. This is Gresham law. But if the price is freely floating, if you raise the price enough you will find someone willing to sell you gold. When prices are free Gresham law does not apply. It only applies when there is a artificially fixed price.(Btw, this confussion about the Gresham law is not strange, because the keynesians have tried to misrepresent the Gresham law so they could criticize their mischaracterized version)The reason what you say is true, is because the government discourages the use of any alternative currency by forcing everyone to pay taxes with the government currency and by legal tender laws, thus creating a monopolly.But I am with you that Bitcoin has the potential to overcome all this.   Does the standard pci-e has a limit in the number of devices it can handle? Probably the chipset of the motherboard does. Ok, Ill answer the troll:There are no Bitcoin banks yet, so there can be no insurance for leaving your bitcoins in the bank. You got that one right... in a way. In the future we will see.I wonder what happens with the dollar if you get robbed in the street. Oh yeah, you loose them. The dollar is so useless...  No shit, libertarians are against theft?!?!?! This must be new or something.Yes, the federal government imposes a monopolly on justice and security, and libertarians have no option but to use that monpolly tfor security and justice. Are you propposing that the government should not provide justice and security and there should be private companies doing it?Oh, we are talking with more mainstream people. Ohhhh.... How does it feel to be as mainstream as you? Im sure you get all the girls.This is poor quality trolling. The previous trolls were better.You have a point in the last part, but the solution is almost ready.Keep sucking the man cock, youll like the reward.You can get a song out of this.Actually, you got this one wrong. FDIC takes care if your bank goes bankrupt, not if your bank screws with you.Sorry I got tired of answering your trolling but you are low quality. Try again. That was it. Im testing it now. Both are very similar to democracy.The only difference is in democracy you get to choose the PR every 4 years. I tried to compile it and got an error. Under Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, I installed all the dependencies as per the github page, then qmake, then make.

All excellent points.This one is risky though. If the Bitcoin wiki allows for a rating system it opens itself to be blamed later on when something goes wrong with some business that had good ratings in the wiki. Let some other web handle that. The trade list wiki page is only there because its convinient now, but in the future it wont be necesary probably. Wouldnt it be more inteligent to sell when its higher? This is a good one. In reality everything floats to everything. There is not an absolute. What happens is that for commodity we use the most liquid asset as a reference, but in reality you can use anything as reference. The most liquid asset is that one that everybody accepts, in the USA the dollar, in the EU the euro, ... As JoelKatz explained, when you have a big base of people using bitcoins it will happen the same with bitcoins.And btw, from 1990 from 2011 the prices in dollars have gone up a lot. The common definition everybody uses for "distorted signals" is signals produced not by voluntary exchanges but by force. That is the definition I was using.With that definition the signals are distorted and that produces bubbles. But I hope you at least have noticed that trial and error process is different from a bubble, because during a bubble the cluster of errors of the entrepreneurs get concentrated in one way only, while in a trial an error process they are everywhere. Noticing this should lead you to understand why the bubbles form: Why do entrepreneurs suddenly make all the mistakes in the same direction while the market process produces mistakes in very different areas and in very different ways due to people trying things and sometimes failing? This is not related but anywyas:The goverment is taking money by force. Its a fact. Lets see how you justify that Im not a victim of that.Yes there are public goods, that is a completely different thing than government goods.How does everybody have/own something? (and not, if the government owns something we dont all own it, the government owns it).Bad examples. Long discussion. Not having it here.Yes, social institution are important. They are in fact the basis of society. But you dont need a government to have social institutions.True. Dont see your point.Do I really need to answer this?Externalities are the name you give to the violations of private property.Because government takes away your right to private property.This is not even an example of what you call externality.On the contrary, the government creates these "externalities" by violating the property rights of the people.You wanted to say: And making sure the politicians are the one in charge of dealing with this issues, not the people.Im happy that you are happy fellow of the corporate regime. But if you really truly believe that the government does produce better results, why not make it voluntary? It will produce better results and will prevail anyway, why impose it? Unless you know it does not produce the best results. If this is your evidence I have already won the discussion. Im supposed to believe that the decission of one corporation regulated by the government and that pays taxes is a clear indicative of your point? Your point is already defeated, but if you wish I can point to you a lot of decission where the government did not look at the long term. Would that be prove to you that the government is incapable of looking long term? See how what you said is irrelevant?Let me point you again that I was giving a historical perspective and that I already said that the present situation has changed. But in the example you are giving: During this crisis, the company cutting off in long term research to dedicate more resources to the short term needs that the costumers might have? How evil...   We should let the costumers out of what they need now in the name of the long term...Again, I already pointed out that the government is involved in the USA healthcare research industry, but the fact that with more private sector there is more innovation is an indication that the private sector can invest long term (and better than the government does) if the resources are not taken away.Yes, Europe is leeching off the USA and also the USA has been damaging its healthcare industry and making it more expensive with growing government regulations all over the XX century. And btw, I suffer european government health care so dont tell me about it.But you are talking about something not directly related with the discussion to supposedly score a cheap point. Is this how you want to keep the discussion. Pointing anecdotes and arguing about things that dont directly relate?Yes. Its very speculative. Its as speculative as you saying that if the money is left to the private sector it would not investigate long term. Its a social science and we can do no better. Again, what Im trying to say is that all the things you are saying are anecdotal evidences of a situation where the government takes the money away from the private sector by force, so the government has the resources to investigate while the private sector does not. By pointing the developments of the government or the actions of some private actors (heavily regulated and subsidized by the government private actors) in this situation you are proving nothing.A more fair analisys would be to compare similar (as much as posible) countries in the same time period with similar technology, one with heavy government involvement and the other without. That would be some valid evidence (not prove, but valid evidence).And please, if you have to answer to something, answer to this part.The rest is really not related to the discussion but I ll answer anyways in the next comment. True, the discovery process has a lot of failures, trial and error. All in different sectors, all different things that are being tried, from which only a few succeed. But its not similar to a bubble. A bubble is not in any way a magnification of that process. Hayek always said that what make him some interested in the boom bust cycle was this question: There are normal errors always in the economy, people trying things, some times succeding, but a lot of the times failing (as you pointed out), but why suddenly all the investors and entrepreneurs make all the same mistakes in the same sector?Its not the same as mistakes in different areas and different ideas. During a bubble the investors and entrepreneurs make all this mistakes in the same direction. Why? Because they are getting false information (mainly interest rates), the price signals are perverted. And as long as this false signals are mantained, the problem goes on, and that is why there is no correction until even the government can not keep the bubble going with more coercion.A bubble is not trial and error, its not a discovery process. Its reactions to bad signals, and that is why the trial and error is not called malinvestment (you are getting information), but a lot of the results of the bubbles are indeed malinvestments, and could have been avoided if the price signals would not have been distorted. Almost 5 hours and a half on this block @ 1500 Gh/s? Is there some problem with the reporting or just horrible luck? Bad luck it is.Btw, I dont know if you change something or its the lower traffic, but the stales have gone down to incredible levels. Great work in everything. Yeah, I know. I was more thinking in a historical sense. That is why I pointed out that the situation has changed now.But then, how can you compare? If the government is taking the money, the government is the one producing the investigation. But how can you claim that if left with the money the private sector would not have done better? Its a long and interesting discussion. But the point that its important to keep in mind is that the results of what we see now is not because the private sector can not investigate long term. Its the result of the government taking the resources needed to investigate from the private sector and using them. Pointing out that some discoveries were done by the government proves nothing. 1. Im not from the USA.2. You are 100% right in this second comment. The problem is not the debt payment, because that can and will be monetized, the problem is the price inflation that will produce (and the possibility of hyperinflation, although I think it wont happen). This is exactly what I wanted to point out. Sorry, but this is a big hand waving and saying that the middle point is always better (a fallacy).You are saying that the USA private sector does not invest long term or does not do it right. This is a lie. You then compare the capacity of the USA economy with the capacity of the country you come from, which probably is not comparable. But lets compare zones that can be compared, like the USA and Europe. In Europe medicine is basically in the hands of governments (although there are private insurances and hospitals), and in the USA it was more in private hands (although this is changing quickly). What do we see? The USA is one of the biggest innovators in medicine and basically decimates the medical innovations coming from Europe (and yes, I know that there is some government involvement in the USA medicine investigation, but the comparation is still valid).What you are doing all the time is taking the position of a bully. I take the money from you by force, stopping you from using it and investing in investigation, spend it in an inefficient way to discover some things, and then claim that you need me to discover those things. The question you are not answering is: What would have happened if you left those resources to the private sector?
Right, because if you leave the money to the private sector this things would not have happen, even in a more efficient and cheap way.So the government takes the money by force, reducing the resources the private sector can dedicate to these things, then does all this things in a inefficient and expensive way, and then asks us to thank it. Yeah... I agree with this.The real possitive effect of Bitcoin in the economy is that it provides currency when the banking system is broke and cutting the transmission of savings towards investing. Even the Federal Reserve has admitted that the local alternative currencies that appeared during the Great Depression helped to keep valid business alive. Some deflation after a bubble is good, but too much deflation is bad (what Hayek called primary and secondary deflation).Not all the investments of the dotcom bubble were malinvestments. A part of it has been re-used, but another big part was wasted. There was no need for all the crazyness and all the waste to create the infrastructure we have now. While the situation of the USA government is bad, the affirmation that the income tax will all go into paying the debt is heavily misleading. In fact that is not a problem at all. WHAT?!?!? Yes, its not a problem and its easy to understand why: The bigger holder of USA gov debt is the Federal Reserve. And the interests payed to the Fed are returned to the government, so in reality those interest dont matter. The government pay them and then gets them back. No big deal. The interests that you have to look at are the rest of the interests (always discounting the interest payed to the Fed).The federal government wont default. As long as the government can keep printing money (the fed monetizing the government debt) it wont default. Its impossible. What will happen is that the monstruous monetization that is needed to wash up the debt will create heavy price inflation. The people will pay the government debt by higher prices. This is not an answer. I did not say that all actions of a government go in that direction. I said that the net result of a social-democratic government is to benefit the elites at the expense of the middle classes and the poor.Nice way of switching the topic of the conversation.Youve been dodging issues all the time, instead of answering them. Why wont you admit that social-democracy is corporatocracy when you have it in front of you? Im getting similar errors:Code:useast.btcguild.com:8332 08/07/2011 07:42:54, Setting pool xxxxxx_xxxxxxx @ useast.btcguild.com:8332useast.btcguild.com:8332 08/07/2011 07:42:56, long poll exception:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "/home/ben/poclbm_old/BitcoinMiner.py", line 338, in longPollThread    (connection, result) = self.request(connection, url, self.headers)  File "/home/ben/poclbm_old/BitcoinMiner.py", line 299, in request    response = connection.getresponse()  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py", line 1027, in getresponse    response.begin()  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py", line 407, in begin    version, status, reason = self._read_status()  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py", line 371, in _read_status    raise BadStatusLine(line)BadStatusLine: ''api.bitcoin.cz:8332 08/07/2011 07:42:58, Setting pool xxxxxx.xxxxxx @ api.bitcoin.cz:8332api.bitcoin.cz:8332 08/07/2011 07:42:58, Attempting to fail back to primary poolEDIT: Also, a couple of miners have gone into a kind of a loop where it fails to connect to firs server, connects to second server and after 1 second tries to connect again to first server, fails, connects to second to second server, after 1 second tries to connect again to first server, fails,... (-failback = 1) No es por desanimaros, pero pudiendolo mirar por el navegador para que necesitais una aplicación? BTW, does this implement the thin client idea or is just a "normal" bitcoin client running on Android? Being paranoic does not mean that THEY are not after you. I reported it twice in this same thread...It only happens in one of my cards (I have 4 5870's, and I have one that its an identical model that works fine). In phoenix what happens is that it will give a mistake about a kernel mistake and will continue mining (I suspect phoenix reloads the kernel). Just updating on the meeting. It was ok, but I dont think they were really interested in Bitcoin. They were more interested in creating some sort of european asociation. But the local people was very interested and ask me to return another day to talk only about Bitcoin. A picture of the guys (the ones in the background, Im not in the picture): Why would you try to buy all the bitcoins from one person, when you can start a new chain? Nadie interesado? Está en perfectas condiciones. El precio inicial es de 14btc, una ganga de por sí, pero acepto ofertas. 5870, Ubuntu 11.04, 11.6, 2.4, poclbm, went up 1MH/s (with last modification from previous modification).The good news is the card that was randomly crashing the miner every 20 minutes with previous patch has been running for more than an hour without problems, so it seems stable now. Just crashed. I dont know what happens with this card and the modified kernel. Also, consumption has gone down like 5W. Im very puzzled by this changes in consumption by the different kernels.Very good job. A small donation is going your way. I went to slush. Im waiting for this guys to finish their present block to join them. Awesome performance regarding stales: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=12181.0  Sorry, but this is very very poor. There is no way this is tracking the velocity of money. You are missing all the microtransactions that could be real, and suddenly a guy moves his saved bitcoins (lots of them) to another address and your function would give you a big velocity of money when the guy could be sending it to himself. You are not tracking the velocity of money. The pseudo-anonimity of Bitcoin makes it impossible to track. Ok. Thanks for all the answer. So it seems there is an agreement that the initial proposal is the best way to go.No, im not from Iceland. These guys are coming to my country to talk to some groups, and a friend has asked me to come with him because they like the Bitcoin idea. And I am gladly doing it. I am talking with people and will probably do a couple more conference about bitcoin in the coming months.This is not the place to discuss this but, legal tender laws dont make commerce smoother, they just impose a currency monopolly. So allowing legal tender laws and not restricting alternative currencies are opposites. Its one or the other. In fact legal tender laws are a basic tool to allow inflation that creates the boom and bust cycle that stops commerce.And to answer to your point, the guy in the gas station is not going to loose a client because he/she is paying in another currency. In some extreme cases the gas station owner might impose a fee because of the burden of accepting another currency. You can see this in history, and in the present days I have payed a London driver with euros because I had no more pounds. He took them. Saying that different currencies stop commerce would be like saying that different food brands stop people from eating. So no, legal tender laws do not smooth commerce and are a basic tool to create the boom and bust cycles that stop commerce. Im all eyes and actually curious. Tell us how this can be solved. If you take bitcoin as the base, its the dollar that is highly unstable. Howcome all democracies do the same (with different excuses)? I know, its not a real democracy... Arent you drinking the kool aid?
Apart from what myrkul is saying, here you are supposing governments are a force towards equality, you are supposing that politicians actually take from the rich to give to the poor (in simple terms). What we see in reality is the opposite. Governtments are a force that creates more inequality by favoring the corporate budies of the politicians at the expense of the middle and poor classes, that are left with no oportunities, expensive prices and some defective government minimum services so they dont die and can keep working. Thank you. I have my lube in hand in case a girlfriend comes around. My bitcoins are well too. I dont care much about their price in dollars at this moment. But you boys have fun with the intraday. No digo que no pueda pasar. Digo que tampoco se puede asegurar, ni de cerca. Que pasa si justo cuando la Fed está haciendo salvajadas hay otro escandalo MtGox y la gente decide refugiarse en otro activo que no sea bitcoins? Y que pasa si justo cuando se está contrayendo la masa monetaria aparece una web que solo acepta bitcoins quees un éxito y provoca un aumento de la demanda de bitcoins?Mercados como el oro, con mucha historia y tradición, sí que son más directamente influidos por las políticas de la Fed (y aún así hay fluctuaciones propias). Bitcoin es un mercado muy joven y con demasiadas variables que pueden influir mucho, como para hacer ese tipo de predicciones. ¿Que puede influir? Absolutamente, pero si realmente va a influir y hasta que punto es algo muy abierto. Ok. Lets say that, go on. The Gini coefficient is defined. What represents your minimum is not defined. You are dodging myrkul question.Hahahaha. Actually it would be to almost everybody, but the joke is still valid. Bump. No suggestions? Im meeting them in 5 hours. Creo que querías decir subir los tipos de interés.No necesariamente, en general no sucede así. Los bancos centrales suelen subir los tipos de interés tarde y poco, por lo que lo único que hacen es realmente evitar que se les escape el proceso inflacionario hacia la hiperinflación (y a veces fallan). Pero sigue produciendose inflación tanto monetaria como de precios.Además, muchas veces lo que hacen los bancos centrales durante las crisis es subir los tipos de interés para intentar controlar la inflación, pero a la vez seguir comprando deuda de los gobiernos para permitir a los políticos seguir gastando. Es decir intentan controlar la inflación ahogando al sector privado, minetras siguen inyectando inflación a base de financiar al gobierno. Mira India y Rusia que están en este proceso ahora mismo. Y el BCE acaba de anunciar que volverá a financiar al gobierno griego. El BCE y la Fed van a hacer esto mismo.Esto supone una visión simplista. La Fed podría aumentar la masa monetaria de dólares y el bitcoin bajar de precio respecto al dólar. La gente podría decidir comprar otras cosas y no Bitcoin. No creo que haya una fuerte correlación entre las acciones de la Fed y Bitcoin porque los grandes bancos y hedge funds que son los que reciben primero el dinero del banco central y gobierno no están metidos en Bitcoin. Quizás sí que provoca algún efecto psicológico en la gente que les empuja a comprar bitcoins, pero habría que ver la correlación, yo personalmente no creo que influya casi.Por la misma razón la Fed podría disminuir la masa monetaria de dólares y el bitcoin subir de precio respecto al dólar.Lo que te he dicho arriba.Primero, las presiones deflacionarias de esté parón, están siendo mínimas comparadas con las que hubo en el credit crunch de 2008, o cuando la Fed acabó QE1. Conforme pasan los años de crisis, la economía se va re-estructurando a pesar de las medidas de los gobiernos para evitar que lo haga, y las presiones deflacionarias son cada vez más pequeñas. Además, muchos actores del mercado están cargados de liquidez que les ha dado el banco central (si no la usan no influye obvimante).Como te he explicado arriba, falta ver la correlación real que hay entre los bitcoins y las acciones de los bancos centrales. Argumentar que las presiones deflacionarias en el dólar van a influir sobre los bitcoins porque sí es un argumento muy flojo. La influencia no está tan clara. Se puede saber que tienes pensado o es secreto de estado? Buena suerte, la vas a necesitar... Also, woundnt that expose them? Can you create an anonymous pool? So today Im meeting with the guys creating the new constitution of Iceland, that is basically a process by which all the people in the country are participating to write it. More information in english here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/iceland-crowdsources-its-next-constitution/2011/06/10/AGiBplOH_blog.html and their webpages: http://stjornlagarad.is/ and https://www.facebook.com/Stjornlagarad .They want to know about Bitcoin, they like the idea, so Im going to meet them to explain them Bitcoin. The meeting will be about more things, so I dont know how much time I will get. The good part for Bitcoin is that it could appear in the new constitution from Iceland and it would gave respectability in the eyes of some.The problem I see is that Bitcoin is designed to be an emergent currency (decentralized, pseudo-anonymous) not a government or constitutional currency. So I am thinking that the best way to focus this, to benefit both Iceland and Bitcoin communities is to suggest them to include a clausule allowing for competing currencies and forbiding legal tender laws and similar stuff. As examples of competing currencies the constitution could name Bitcoin (but only as example).What do you think? Any other idea? This, try another card on the computer or/and try the 5870 in another computer. This way you will be sure where the problem is. Since most gpu miners are using now the phatk kernel you should upgrade to 2.4. Phatk kernel is optimized for 2.4. You will get better results. Ok, calling me, the only person who is trying to make sense here, a conspiracy theorist and a nut is enougth. Im done. You keep repeating the same mantra without any proof. You guys are just propagandists without no interst in reality. Good luck. +1 My opinion exactly. People is not as dumb as some people here claim, but most dont see the need to use bitcoins. A horrible idea. Money transfered between accounts does not mean that people is spending money. Miners that want more money created would just transfer money between their accounts so more money is created and they can get some. And there is no way to change this without radically changing Bitcoin and loosing some of its basic characteristics.And then its also a bad idea for the economics behid it.A regulated market means a market rigged in favour of the bit players (see Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc...). I much rather deal with stupid kids trying to play the free market (and most of them loosing at it) than knowing that the system is completely rigged in favour of a few by regulations.Just remember how a Chicago trader approached the SEC several times warning the regulators about Madoff. The SEC did 3 investigations on Madoff and decided not to act. Madoff was very well connected. And this is not an exception, its the norm. For example, recently a judge retiring from the CFTC, the commodity regulators, admitted that they had been covering market manipulations. His own words:"There are two administrative law judges at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: myself and the Honorable Bruce Levine. On Judge Levine's first week on the job, nearly twenty years ago, he came into my office and stated that he had promised Wendy Gramm, then Chairwoman of the Commission, that we would never rule in a complainant's favor. A review of his rulings will confirm that he has fulfilled his vow. Judge Levine, in the cynical guise of enforcing the rules, forces pro se complaints to run a hostile procedural gauntlet until they lose hope, and either withdraw their complaint or settle for a pittance, regardless of the merits of the case"See how regulations and regulators work? They only serve the big players. Its not something you want in Bitcoin, unless you are a cheater and want to make use of them. Then you should keep an open mind and try to learn instead of giving lessons.I already answered to this, but let me try again from another point. First answer to this: ¿This programs you want the government to do when there is a recession can be anything, like getting people to dig a whole and then others to cover it, or should it try to be a productive investment? Yes. The EMP blast is coming soon. I tend to buy when bitcoin is rallying because you find better prices. I bought some things with bitcoins when it was over $25. It was a great decission.

You have basically avoiding answering.This:is faith, not logic or empirical evidences or anything related to economics.Honestly, the keynesians in this forum are very very weak. Its mostly hand waving, repeating the same mantra over and over again, and avoiding addressing arguments. It seems more like a histeric propaganda squad than thinking people. If you rise the fee you are making it more difficult for people to go into Bitcoin.All this conspiracy about moving up and down the market its fun, but take it with distance. People that try to move the price sometimes win and sometimes looses. If it were as easy as you say everybody would be doing it. In that case, why use Bitcoin? Why not use paypal or VISA? The exact same thing that picked my interest. Fireworks neither defend people like guns... The newest kernel gives an error on only 1 of my 4 cards. Phoenix says something about a kernel or OpenCL error and suggest that the card might be malfunctioning (and then keeps mining), and poclbm just crashes. The card is a ASUS 5870, but I have an identical model that works fine. The error might not happen for like 20 minutes. And the card apparently works perfectly since various pools accept the results from that card with no special extra-stales.Also, I find it weird that the newest kernel seems to add some Watts of power consumption (I need to measure this propperly though).. Since its doing less operations and that way achieving a higher rate, shouldnt it consume the same? Sorry, I misread. I have a 5770, not a 5570. Whitelist sounds like the perfect solution for pools. Webs can not use it because everybody visits them, but miners have to register and you know their ip beforehand. Poclbm has an option for backup servers now, so no need to configure proxies or anything else. It also has the phatk kernel. The author is wrong when he says that Deepbit has all the power. The power belong to thousends of miners that use Deepbit. If Deepbit tried to abuse, it might get somethign temporarely (and would damage Bitcoin image), but the miners would pull out quickly rendering Deepbit useless. Also, Deepbit would be out of the game, so it has a strong incentive to keep being honest.As for the DOS attacks, pcolbm has now option for backup servers, so when one mining pool server goes down the miners automatically switch to the next one in the list and the network keeps working.The problem with a p2p mining pool is how do you keep the miners honest. It would be very easy to cheat. I think that just taking some care that no mining pool has 50+% and now that the miners allow for backup servers it will be enough. I have a 5570 and can do 200+ Mh/S... Unless a 92% means something different now, there is a problem somewhere. I though it was a faraday cage to avoid the EMP. Im confused now... The (Not so) "Wild" West was actually a very pacific time. Movies needed action and shots, but its not how reality was. http://bitcoinwatch.com/ Under Blocks you will see difficulty and next difficulty. People already has the hardware payed or almost payed. If you check since the last two difficulties increases, the hashing power of the network has grown less. It means people is not investing much in mining hardware. Its less attractive to mine right now. If the price exchange of bitcoin goes up you will be profitable. If it does not, hope that difficulty stays low...And if the price of bitcoins goes up, you would have done a lot better just buying bitcoins and holding them than investing in mining equipment.Dont get scared. Im just pointing to you the facts so you know what is in front of you. Nobody knows what will happen in the future, anything could happen. Im just pointing you the posibilities. Yes, I know, what I meant is that I am surpirsed that more miners did not jump in. No fees and almost no stales? What else can anyone ask? And with 10 or 20 "normal" miners moving in your could get 200GH/s and then it would probably snowball. Do you think the system would scale with higher loads? (You probably are going to say YES! but lets hear it). Thats a possibility yes, but a ATI serie 5 card will always have a low discount. Im very impressed until now. How do you do it to get so few stales? This should be a top pool. This difficulty rise will be only around 10% increase. The two previous ones were both over 50% increase. If the price of bitcoins does not go up, you wont recover your investment probably. Difficulty goes up.
This will happen no matter what if Bitcoin keeps working. Mining has a very low barrier of entry, so it will happen. How long it will take to get there depends on the price of the ASIC's (if they ever appear, but it seems they will). But the Bitcoin economy is not directly related to mining profits. Yes, that is the only option that does not work. It only works with the GUI on, dont know why. I have opened a bug, maybe you can add a comment so it picks the attention of the developer: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3322352&group_id=387278&atid=1609264But aticonfig does not allow this option neither (as far as I know).Are you setting it in the right performance level? Also, you can not set a gpu speed lower than the previous performance level. F.e. if performance level 1 has gpu speed at 975Mhz, you can not set pu in performance level 2 a gpu speed of 950Mhz. To have a pgu speed of 950Mhz on performance level 2, set the gpu speed in performance level 1 under 950Mhz.In general you should not have a higher setting for anything, gpu spped, memory speed or voltage, in a lower performance level.One more thing, it does not affect mining apparently, but it is also recommended that the memory speed is the same in all performance level, specially in the card connected to the screen (if any). Ive pointed 1 of my miners to your pool to try it out. Right now is working fine, not even one stale. If this continue this way, when you find the current block Ill point the other 3 as well. Yes. You are kidding me right? Microsoft biggest clients are government administrations. What regulations did the government pass that went against MS except some of the EU with no real impact?Im not using MS. How is that a monpolly?Monopollies, that is situation that harm the consumer, can only happen with government intervention. You never addressed my reply about how government spending does not work. I find curious that you keep repeating the same. But this is going to take a lot of time. I think a more realistic view is:You pay the baker in bitcoins.The baker pays his website hosting in bitcoins.The website hosting owner buys an offer from Metaco.inThat person buys bread from the baker (yes my imagination is tired, but you get the idea)You dont need the business to only operate in bitcoins for Bitcoin to be a sucess. As long as people have a place to spend their bitcoins, they will realize in a few years that owning bitcoins is a lot better since they dont depreciate and they will favor it more and more, they will tell their friends, their costumers, other business owners, etc... We just need to create a bit of an economy (this is going to be the hardest part) and then it will snowball. This model of the effect of regulations is too simplistic and completely unreal. I dont asume those premises. No, I dont.yes Says the king of hand waiving. AyeYo you become more sureal as time goes. Im a miner as well, and I think you (and everybody) should keep in mind that Bitcoin is a voluntary currency. Anyone can drop its use at any time, so its very important to offer a good product (the product being money) and to keep confidence. You might be used to fiat currency, but people dont use it because they like it, they use it because its a monopolly. If you start abusing with the Bitcoin users, a lot of them might drop the currency, specially if there is competition (other voluntary currencies, maybe similar to Bitcoin). Its of no use to have more of something that has little value. Can we have it the other way around? If we are going to have expensive prices, bad quality and even shortages I would preffer that it would ben on expendable goods and not on basic/vital goods.Yes, so do most of the rest. That is why they study economic theory. Someone (Keynes) said: "Its the other way around. When government regulates it allows companies to avoid competition and introduces a lot of innecesary overhead. This produces more expensive and of less quality products. If you want food to be available for everyone, deregulate. If you want it expensive and bad quality regulate.If you have to regulate something, please regulate the iPods, not the food, otherwise you hurt people.Monopolies can only happen because of government intervention. Please, check the origin of the word monopolly and when it changed of meaning. You will be surprised. Why do people complain about Bitcoin not being inflationary with the amount of inflationary currencies around the world? Almost all of them are inflationary. Its not like you dont have a choice... Agreed. Also, time has a value. Yes, that were already payed.But it is not up to you to decide what type of cost should happen. Let the miners (and up to some point users) decide what is the best course of action. Why do you want to impose your criteria over the rest? Whats wrong with letting miners (and up to some point users) decide the best way to handle the costs (and benefits) of the network? When you let people decide on their own you get amazing creative solutions. Ok. Then its my mistake and I apologize for jumping to conclussions. I read second law of thermodinamycs and I though you were a monetary wacko. I re-read it and see now what you meant.But I think its a bit meaningless, someone could argue that the miners are there to keep the transactions valid, so only people doing transactions should pay. At the end of the day you can argue all you want, but the best path of action is to leave it to the miners to decide how they want to fund themselves. And if someone is not happy about it, he/she can jump in and compete with them (or start a new currency with more like-minded miners). No, Im actually done. When I saw that thing about the second law of thermodinamics I realize where you are comming from and the fallacies you believe in. That theory about energy and money is false and its easily demostrable. Its not science, not even close. But I decided some time ago to not loose time with people that dont want to reason. Anyway, good luck. The 5870 and 5970 are the more energy efficient (cheaper electricity bill). The 5850 and 5830 are usually the best for initial cost per MH/s but it really depends at the price you buy them (and you have to think that if you plan in selling it at some point, the series 6 will be easier to sell than the serie 5, but this is only important if you plan on selling). Im an engineer. I know how to recognize between science and charlatanery.  I as an atheist wish for the same. I really dont understand what all this have to do with monetary policy. Yes, I already said that. Its not monetarely inflationary, it is price inflationary.No. Bitcoin storage is not free btw. I argue that you should not impose a artificial fee on storage. If miners decide that they dont want to support long time savers and want to charge them a more expensive fee, that is alright with me, but there is no need to have it by default. Let the miners decide their business model as they see fit.And please stop putting words in my mouth.It is a historic fact that savings promote long term growth, while economies that penalize savings go into consumption frencies that stop growth.But lets avoid discussing your opinion and my opinion, and let the miners and users decide by themselves.I stopped reading at second law of thermodynamics.There is nothing stopping the miners from implementing this by themselves if they see its needed.Please start the competition. I really do want competition to Bitcoin.
I would say that ultimately reason #3 is the part that is holding all together. Without the army the dollar would collapse. Oil is still sold in dollars because the USA has the biggest military, and the USA economy is still working after so much abuse only because it has the world reserve currency that again is thanks to the military. There is a reason why the USA has bases all over the world and the rest of the countries dont. Im not discussing which system is best. I personally distrust any regulated system. But in the eyes of a lot of people a regulated exchange has more credibility.The FDIC and SIPC are horrible ideas because protects reckless business. The exchanges doing it voluntarely would be a different issue since they would have the incentive to police each other to avoid someone abusing, because they would have to pay for it. Im getting lots of miner iddles. The weird thing is that if I restart the miner they will get work.All this disconnects are probably why the total output of the pool dropped to 1800. The situation is getting ridiculous. AMDOverdriveCtrl is rock solid. As I said you need to set the fanspeed in the GUI in order to be saved in the profile, but you can edit the file and do it yourself.The big advantage of AMDOverdriveCtrl is that it lets you change the voltage, either overvolting fro more speed or undervolting for less consumption, while aticonfig does not. Also, personally I find that being able to save a profile is more confortable and quick, but that is jus me. Consumption? I find it funny how economists come up with this fancy names to explain what was usually called inflate the debt away. I have to admit that "financial repression" sounds very good. It would not redistribute money in the typical sense that word is used. It would incentivate spending it instead of saving it.It would be price inflationary because people would not want to hold it. If you destroy the demand for the currency, even without changing its supply, its value goes down because you are changing the demand.Which is not addressing my point, since I said that said currencies do not last UNLESS imposed by force.With the clarification I hope I make clear what I mean and you can answer to it.But someone at some point will have to accumulate bitcoins in order to make big investments, like expanding the business. You are penalizing this type of behaviour and I predit that a lot of merchants will choose a currency that does not penalize saving if given the choice.I honestly hope that some competing currency to Bitcoin with depreciating or inflationary characteristics appears so you and anyone else can see for yourself.If miners do become annoyed with people having bitcoin savings, they can always refuse to process their transactions unless they give a big fee, which would be similar to your propposal. There is no need to impose it beforehand. If miners really become annoyed as you claim they can already react to it with the present implementation. Yes, so?Really? You really think the reaction to the majority of the people would be: Hey, lets install a mining rig! The ones that wanted to would anyways, and the rest would not anyways. Your proposal is just an incentive to spend bitcoins quickly, triggering a inflationary spiral.Btw, you keep using this languate like tiny cost, small transaction, it needs to be done, etc... The fact that you add a subjective adjective to give the impression that it would be acceptable or that kind of rethoric does not impress me. Its a bad sign when debating someone actually.It changes the game. You might argue that not enough, but it changes the game.Bitcoin can be stolen as well so that cost does not apply here. As for the rest, I might own gold and not be paying any storage. But still, I dont see your point. The fact that gold has the phisical need of being sotred and some people pay for that service does not change the fact that with Bitcoin is not necesary and any competitor that tries to impose that cost will have to fight against Bitcoin, that does not.I dont support the gold standard, and there are a lot of types of gold standard very different from each other. I dont really get your comment.You have avoided addressing the problem of the inflationary spiral. Why would merchants accept a currency that they can not hold for long (or its devaluated) when anyone can easily create a currency that has the same properties except for the fact that it does not depreciate over time. How would your currency compete against that? (there is a reason why this kind of currencies are imposed and do not last long if done voluntarely). If you think it can, you should start your own currency and prove it. I just watched your post history.You say that you dont want to promote consumerism, but your proposal does just that. People would have an incentive to spend their bitcoins in things they would not have buyed in normal conditions. They would buy things they dont really need just to get rid of the bitcoins. That is the definition of consumerism.Also, I believe that your changes go against stablishing Bitcoin as a long term real currency for merchants and customers. Here is why:And then what would be the incentive for saving? If you do that you turn bitcoins into something that nobody wants to hold for very long because it depreciates with time. Therefore it will start a process of people starting to spend their bitcoins as quick as they can, turning into a inflationary spiral forcing merchants to stop accepting bitcoins. It would be the edn of Bitcoin.There is a reason why you only see depreciating currencies as a very local and short term experiments or forced by governments. Its because they dont work. But for the situation to be realistic we have to assume that the honest miners would already be using the same technology. Otherwise your scenario is only valid in the concrete moment when the technology is evolving. Two questions:1) Why are you so obsess on promoting consumerism inside Bitcoin? (Almost all your posts relate to this idea).2) What would stop anyone from moving their bitcoins from one account to other so they dont become "old"?. They would not even have to offer almost or at all fee because they dont care if they stay without processing a lot of time (even better because they will be "younger"). Honestly, I hope some p2p competing currency to Bitcoin appears, so they go down this route (or inflationary route, or any of the ideas that promote consumerism) so everybody can see how that currency collapses and we are done with all this discussions.Please, go start your own currency with this system. Thanks to Satoshi and the open source code its very easy. You dont get tired of throwing this idea around, do you?If this was implemented Bitcoin would be a lot less atractive, it would not take off and basically wold make mining a lot less profitable. The system we got is the system we got, and we have to work with it.I personally think that regulations over the exchanges would be a positive thing as it would give Bitcoin a more respectable appearance from the point of view of a lot of people. And once Bitcoin goes big politicians will have a hard time taking it down. Also, its not like we have a choice: when the government comes down to regulate the exchanges, what are they going to say? No thanks, we want to remain unregulated... I can almost hear the laughter of the regulators. So, as it is going to happen anyways, at least trying to work how it is done.The advantage of Bitcoin from an anarchist point of view, is that it allows for black markets on the Internet, which previously was only possible with cash. F.e. in my country the stimations say around 20% of the economy is black market. Bitcoin will allow this on the Internet. But for that you need a door from and to the system. For the fan setting to be saved in the profile, you have to click the set button in the GUI. Otherwise the setting active will be the one saved.What I do is create the file with the GUI and then edit the profile text file manually and dont use the GUI anymore.Btw, I found that the fan controlled by temperature (the graph thingy) only worked well with the GUI opened. You can save it to the profile, and load it, but it wont behave properly unless the GUI is opened. I dont care because I have my fans at fixed 90%, but others might. I opened a bug at the AMDOverdriveCtrl bugtrack but last time I checked there was no answer. USeast is misbehaving badly. 3 of my 4 workers are idle. I have been promoting Bitcoin among libertarians (including paulites) and with quite success (discount the people stuck with "only gold can be money", these people infuriate me and I am a goldbug...).But at the end, I dont think its useful to target a political group for Bitcoin. I think its better to create useful applications. That will attract people no matter their ideology.Consider the uncle of one of my best friends. He is a social-democrat and he talks about the need to pay taxes and accuses the people who dont of being selfish and inmoral. Well, one day my friend explained to me that his uncle was telling them how cheap he got his new TV. It turns out he bought it through the Internet from a shop in Andorra, which is a little country that has very low taxes. So basically he got it so cheap because he avoided paying taxes. When my friend pointed him that and asked him if that was inmoral, the uncle dodged with excuses. A lot of people have ideologies as a selfish way to feel good, not to help others (even if they claim so). 99% of the people will use whatever is useful and cheaper.Conclussion: Build useful applications with Bitcoin (and I would not bother looking at political groups). Yes. I want to spend my bitcoins, but there is hardly anything I need that is sold with bitcoins, specially here in my country. I found there is a shop selling cat food that acepts bitcoins and will use it but apart from that there is nothing else. O esto: http://www.bitcoin.com.es/ o sino el irc #bitcoin-otc-eu. La M3 no depende directamente del banco central, sino de los bancos y sus clientes. Obviamente el banco central influye su manera de actuar. Y sí, podemos ver ligeras presiones deflacionarias ahora que llega el fin de QE2 y hasta que empieze QE3 (o como lo llamen), pero serán menores que las que vimos cuando acabó QE1.De todas maneras sigo diciendo que no creo que eso afecte demasiado a Bitcoin. Los grandes bancos y hedge funds (aún) no invierten en Bitcoin.
Wherever you choose to save it. I preffer to use AMDOverdriveCtrl itself as command line interface than aticonfig. If you set up a configuration with the GUI of AMDOverdriveCtrl and save it as a profile, then you can load it into the card with this command:Code:AMDOverdriveCtrl -i X -b deviceX.ovdrWhere X is the id (number) of the card and deviceX.ovdr is the name of the profile file you saved. You can even edit the profile text file manually and dont use the GUI anymore.  Elwar, tell us when you are selling bitcoins.Thanks This is the sad reality of what government internvetion produces. A bunch of thieves.Regulations should be removed so corporations stop doing whatever they want. Regulations allow corporations to avoid competition. Al respecto de la política monetaria de la Reserva Federal, la Fed no está contrayendo. Solo ha dejado de inyectar nuevo dinero. De hecho el program QE-Lite sigue operativo, que consiste en reinvertir el dinero que saca de los activos inmobiliarios que compró con QE1 en bonos del gobierno.Y ya se está hablando de QE3, aunque no se llamará QE3 porque será una inyección monetaria diferente a QE1 y QE2. Mirate esto: http://www.libremercado.com/2011-06-24/bernanke-abre-la-puerta-a-otra-compra-masiva-de-deuda-publica-1276427608/Pero más importante aún, no creo que Bitcoin esté aún afectado directamente por las políticas de la Fed, ya que los inversores de Bitcoin no son grandes bancos y hedge funds, que son los que transmiten a la economía real esas políticas. El precio de los bitcoins dependerá más de la fama que obtenga y de la cantidad de gente que lo quiera comprar y usar. 3:30 the previous block and almost 4 hours this one? Are we really being so unlucky or there is something wrong? This is just taxpayer money tunneled to the banks. Let me repeat again: The Tobin tax wont do nothing to prevent speculation. If some channels are closed the financial system will find other ways to use the leverage power that the governments provides them via the central banks.And it will produce an increase of price on the services we use. Its just a scheme for politicians to get part of the money, it has nothing to do with stopping speculation.That said, please go ahead and get the Tobin tax approved, for Bitcoin sake. Sale una web de propaganda, no una tienda.EDIT: La web es http://www.telepienso.com . La añado a la wiki. And here we have again one of AyeYo numerous handwavings, with his typical repressed hostility. Then the answer is no, its not a fiat currency, but I think you wont find an example in history of such a thing because it does not make sense. Why would anyone would accept that currency? And why would the government create that currency if it does not benefit in any way? 1. The Tobin tax wont do anything to end speculation. What will end speculation is having a sound monetary system that does not allow the financial system to leverage "to the sky".2. The Tobin tax is just a scheme for the politicians to get a part of the money, and the ones that will end up paying it is us through more expensive services.All this said, I hope the Tobin tax gets imposed (Sarkozy is a big fan) so people have another good reason to switch to Bitcoin. The more oppressive the system becomes, the better for Bitcoin. Yes. In that case, and only in that case, that gold money is fiat money.The thing is governments try to avoid using gold as money because they can not print it. They only adopt gold as fiat money, because gold is what people was alreaady using and it is a way to get people used to a government money monpolly. Then later they go slowly breaking the tie with gold. History is a bit more complicated than this, but it is a good basic idea of what they do. All value is subjective. Nothing has intrinsic value. http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=16263.0 Julian Assange is quite free market oriented. He has called himself a libertarian, although he is not a "heavy libertarian", for what I got from his opinions. I love them all. The concept is perfect.I absolutely love the concept of the last one, but I think you need to change the size and speed (and maybe color?) of the text. I would make the text a bit more thick, not so thin, and some parts are imposible to read because they fade too quick. But the general idea is brilliant. It destroys your right to contract and makes it useless to create a contract in a currency that is not the legal tender one. Imagine that you sign a contract with me: You do some task in exchange for me paying you 3oz of silver. Now you do the task, and when I comes to pay you, I tell you that Im not going to pay you with silver, but with fiat currency. You dont agree and you demand silver because the contract specifies it. Your only option now is to take me to court where the judge will force you to accept fiat currency to settle my debt with you. You see there is no point on setting the contract in something that is not legal tender since you are going to be forced to accept it anyways.This is a big incentive towards not using any other currency. Add that you can only pay taxes with fiat currency and you have a de facto monopolly. As you say, everything has its goods and bads.But in this case, you are being unfair towards liberty. The government is imposing a monopolly on justice therefore making it impossible for private justice companies to appear and deal with this type of situations. I was a social-democrat raised by a couple of social-democrat parents. I was probably your typical lefty ignorant on economics and guided by emotional rethoric. But I always had a strong anti-authoritarian strike, and disliked when the left would become abusive. With 19 yo I decided that politicians were all corrupted and stoped following politics. That is until I was 28 that I discovered Ron Paul randomly through a Youtube video. I was surprised that a republican, that I was taught was an ignorant crazy jesus follower with lots of weapons, was preaching against the wars and against the abuses of that thing called central bank. That lead me to start researching about central banks and monetary policy and history. Murray Rothbard popped there, austrian economics, then free banking. Through my interest for monetary policy I understood the political philosophy of liberty. It made sense, but it was quite an emotinal ride to change the views I had been indoctrinated with. I was a minarchists, until I discover mutualism. Reading mutualist theory I became convinced that anarchism is a real posibility. I would not define myself as a mutualist or an anarcho-capitalists. Im a market anarchists, a voluntaryist. Both are the same thing. In the present system what gives fiat money its value is that they are the only means to pay taxes (collected by force or thread of) and legal tender laws (same).In general fiat currency is defined as a currency imposed by force, usually by governments. In the present system the specific mechanism are the two noted above.In this case said organization is not a government (it does not imose monpollies by force) and the currency is not a fiat currency.
How would I do it? I like how Bitcoin is now.And you are wrong when you say that people just follow what Satoshi wrote. People like what Satoshi wrote or otherwise Bitcoin would not have the success it has had. If a big part of the people liked another way they would have already started a competing currency. There is nothing stopping you from creating your hashcoin. Satoshi even gave you the open source code so you only need to change a few lines of code and you are ready to go.I really dont know how can I explained more clearly, but Ill try. I am saying that having a price index (no matter what you decide to include or how to calculate that index) does not guarantee you that the monetary system is not creating distortions in the economy. As an example I signaled the roaring 20's. So saying that as long as some price index that you deem appropiate will remain stable is not a guarantee that a monetary system you propose will ensure economic stability.The problem with your hyphothesis is that price has been stable way before the hashing power stabilized. In fact, hashing power is starting to rise again since yesterday.Even if you took the time to analize it econometrically (which I believe you havent) I dont think you will find a clear pattern relating hasing power and price, because basically hashing power does not change almost the supply of coins (big increases accelerate very slightly the supply until difficulty adjusts again) and does not affect the demand. This is why we see in reality that increases in price always leads to increases in difficulty (because hashing power has increased).Both theoretical analisys and empirical data are against your hypothesis. Its important to keep in mind that supply and demand of bitcoins, and thus price, are not affected by hashing power (supply slightly). Instead the incentive to mine it is indeed affected by the purchasing power of bitcoins.Well, Bitcoin is not a system to get rich, its a currency. Its meant to be used to trade. People should understand that mining is a market with a very low barrier of entry, almost anyone can do it, and will be, more and more as time pases, a very low yielding activity due to competition. If you want to prosper in the Bitcoin economy you will have a lot more success trying to create a business than going the miner route. This is also a good incentive.  Yep, the fact that you dont have to go either all in or nothing, but can spend just a part and save the rest, makes it different from the prisoners dilema. Something like this? http://www.bitcoin.com.es/ (its in Spanish and I have no relation of any kind with that webpage) Why not? (honest question). The layout of the site is horrible. I did not know how to continue reading the article and the big add in the middle is anoying as hell.But I like that Bitcoin business are getting free publicity and I loved this comment: I though (hoped) so, but it seems network hashing power is raising again. Its still too early to determine a trend but its picking up again. Check bitcoinwatch. Bitcoin is not a fiat currency. Fiat means imposed using force, usually by governments. Bitcoin is a voluntary currency.Since both those thing are not scarce, why would you back a currency with them? For example, do you thing anyone woul trust a currency backed by leafs? No, because leafs are very abundant.Clearly you need to give it more though. How do interest rates affect the economy? Is is possible for one person (or a group) to centrally plan interest rates? Its not a problem of corruption, it is a problem of limited information.And what would be the result of "democratically" selected interest rates in the economy? How would peple know with their limited information and their personal incentives what are the interest rates needed?That is not price inflation indeed, but if that were to happen with money that would be monetary inflation. Why is that bad? Because it creates bubbles. Check the 20's. There was almost no price inflation, Irving Fisher said the Fed was doing a great job at managing the monety supply and creating the correct monetary inflation to keep prices stable. But hiding behind the price index there was a bubble forming in the stock market due to the monetary inflation that popped in the crash of 1929.Having some price index constant is not a good monetary objective and does not matain a healthy economy.This is very wrong. Bitcoin is inestable because its a small market and when new money comes in it has a big influence. If you start your new hashcoin it will be unstable as well, no matter how much does it "cost" to produce.Also, let me predict that your hashcoin would be accused as well of being a ponzi scheme, because those acusations come from not liking Bitcoin and wanting to attack it some way and from envy, not from really thinking that it is a ponzi scheme.   Ok. I stand corrected. I had enough of your trolling for today. Another day more. Dont try to redefine force. Democracy includes the use of force. But this is not about democracy. Its as simple as saying that you were wrong when you said that fiat money, that is defined as a currency imposed by force, could appear without force. Its false by definition.Yes, suply and demand does not give value to an object. That is correct. So?Yes, this personal opinion is your default mental refuge when a logical argument that contradict your views is presented. You are still not answering. And btw, I dont think force is the defining element of a society law. Tradition or emergent social arrangements (however you want to call it) are an important part of law. But all of this does not answer the issue of the currency. Wrong again. Fiat currency is a currency imposed by force. That is its definition. What you are arguing now is the morality of the use of force, but whatever your opinion on this moral issue, your statement saying that fiat currency can appear without force is still wrong.Its the other way around. Fiat currency (and also democracy) always happens at the end of civilizations. And sadly, history shows that societies almost never scape from the collapse that fiat currency brings about. Once the inflationary forces are in motion its very hard to scape. The collapse can last decades or even centuries in the case of something as big as the Roman empire, but almost never there is a way back.Well, Somalies are better off by a big difference in anarchy than with the previous socialist government they had. And you can check this with the data from the ONU and other international organizations.You are trying to justify the unjustificable. Government spending creates supply. Government taxation creates demand. Then there is a process with relations and consequences, as you say, but it does not change the fact that government spending creates supply and government taxation creates demand. I have never called you a troll.Challenging? Saying that fiat currency, defined as a currency imposed by force, can exists without force? That is challenging? You know you are on the wrong and you are just trying to make it personal (and derail the conversation talking about property rights). Answer to my arguments. Not only acceptable for payint tax. Also, legal tender laws, which is basically a violation of the right to contract.But even if you believe in taxes, why should the government only accept one currency for paying taxes? Why not charge 30% of your wage, whatever that wage is payed on? History is full of examples of governments payed in different types of currencies.The requirement of having taxes payed in only one currency, the government one, comes from the same objective as legal tender laws: create a currency monopolly.Defending yourself, is not the same as agression.Sorry, this is nonsense by definition. If a currency is not imposed by force its not a fiat currency. Its the definition of fiat currency.Wrong again. People need the currency to pay for taxes, therefore creating a demand for the currency. The fact that governments abuse the currency and supply overcomes demand does not mean that taxation creates supply and does not create demand.BubbleBoy if you continue this way I might have to take away from you the title of most interesting troll of the forum. This is false. The demand for government currency is not a voluntary act, but due to the regulations imposed by force by the government.There is some market action that set the value of the currency, but certainly is not a free market outcome, it a completely regulated outcome. There was a better blog post by Tabarok but I can not find it: http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/11/the-art-of-not-being-governed.html Also, cablesaurus accepts bitcoins. Actually there are good examples of market anarchy in Iceland during the middle ages (as David Friedman explains) and in the south of Asia for 300 hundred years. A anarchic society that lived, prospered and defended themselves from invarsors for 300 years... thats hardly the "inevitably collapse" that bonker is talking about. Most democracies dont last half that time. I proppose this post as the hand waving of the day.  
3 bitcoins sent Yes I did, and maybe I shoul have not, but:No, you didnt, you did not answer to the article (neither attacked me). Climate change is not mentioned in the article.You know you only attacked the source of the article without attacking the ideas on it, so lets not go over this more.As long as it makes you think about moral priorities it will be fine. Why has the statist left, the Left, shut up about the wars? Why? People is still dying. En USA ya puedes comprar comida con bitcoins. Para que van a necesitar los dólares? My contact with the Independent Insitute is by reading Robert Higgs blog. Robert Higgs is a great economists with an undoubted honesty.Thats not an ad-hominem. These are ad-hominem:And, btw, yes really. As the article points out, a lot of people have decided to look the other way in the mass murdering the USA government is doing in Irak, Afghanistan, etc... just so they could keep believing in "change and hope" (TM). That says a lot about the morality of those people.Climate change is not cited once in the article.But the thread has been succesfully derailed. Btw, the text is perfect for the reactions it has gotten: Not one response has questioned or attacked the ideas. The responses have been personal attacks for causes not related to the text or directly ad-hominems.The text is spot on. Indeed, we are judged by the company we keep.Honestly, I would much preffer to be seen in the company of people who deny global warming (I am not convinced of global warming myself) than be seen in the company of mass muderers. But since you dont I guess you have other moral priorities.EDIT: Yesterday I quoted a whole article from a socialist blog. I guess that tells a lot about what companies I keep as well. One of those articles that will inspire you. Very recommnded for the Leftists of this forum (Left with uppercase L = statist left).http://lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory217.html Actually, the Tea Party was started by the Ron Paul supporters to get people to fund Ron Paul 2008 campaign. When the presidentials were over, Fox News, in their line of copying Ron Paul rethoric, co-opted it. No es "peligroso". Solo te quita privacidad porque todo el mundo puede asociar esa dirección y las operaciones que haga contigo. Im not for a gold standard, I support competing currencies, but this is not true.While the gold standard was regularly violated, specially during the Bretton Woods era, the different ties of the dollar to gold had some restraining effect on the government. Since the last tie with gold was broken in the 70's, monetary inflation on the USA has gone to some levels that had never been seen before.So, while the gold standard is not perfect and is easily abused by the government, it offered some level of restrainement compared to the present situation. Just to add to Jack of Diamonds response, fiat currencies are backed by coercion and thread of violence, like he said. But usually the population does not accept a monopolly on money easily (we do because we are very used to it and have not seen anything different, hopefully Bitcoin will change that), so what governments usually do to impose a fiat currency is to slowly regulate and ultimately monopolize the existing majoritary currency.Usually gold and silver is used as currency spontaniously, so the government starts by declaring gold and silver legal tender. Then they start emiting notes supposedly backed by gold and silver, until people is used to the paper and they can break the link with gold and silver. This sequence is a extreme simplification and there are particular variations in every case, but still its quite accurate of what usually happens over decades. El nuevo cliente aún no ha bajado toda la block chain de la red. Cuando la baje te marcará los dos bitcoins. Ves que todas las transacciones están no confirmadas? Es porque aún no tiene la block chain. Stop acting dumb because you are not dumb. Regulations have changed, some have been added some have gone. But the net result has been an increase of regulations. That is a fact. You can try to deny reality but that is not my problem.Btw, during the Bush era there has been an increase of the money handled by regulators. So its not only an increase of the amount of the reuglations but also an increase of the monetary impact of those regulations.I know a lot of so called "economists" and the official propaganda says that there has been de-regulation, and they use it as explanation for everything, but if you look at the data you can see that there has been an increase of regulations. unemployed whats the point of this?  Sounds like a great idea. Its not really such a big problem if a mining pool gains over 50% of the total mining capacity. Its not a desirable situation, but the mining power is not from the pool, and so if the pool started cheating the people connecting to the pool would change to another one.In general, so-called "antitrust" laws and other regulations are not used to attack abusive companies, but to defend the position of abusive companies and hurt competition. Sí, totalmente necesario. Yo quiero contactar con agricultores y mercados de comida locales, porque siempre suelen ser receptivos a monedas locales. Y cuando la gente vea que se puede comprar comida con bitcoins, creo que ayudará a la adopción. Ohhh... Where can I buy this bitcoins of yours?  +1 The more speculators the more stable bitcoin will be. Also, the Bitcoin community is learning and becoming better at trading.Greed is not your friend, neither your enemy. Greed just is.

El envío será desde España.Hazme una oferta. No. The best way to fight against capitalism is through a free market. I dont think you meant to say that a country stores USD as their GDP. GPD is the measure of economic activity.I think that all the countries know that the debt ceiling will be lifted and are ready for it or even have arranged some deal with the USA. F.e. at the begginning of the crisis the Federal Reserve bought a lot of the Freddie and Fannie debt from overseas (specially from China), and curiously enough China kept buying USA gov debt. I looked into this a bit. Also looked into the code of RadeonVolt. It turns out the information to get the temperature of the VRM and the current (so you can get the W) is obtained through I2C (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C). But different models have different parameters, so you need to "talk" to each component differently. This is probably the reason why its not working in your card (and mine) and giving you those numbers.There is software who has coded the protocol for nearly all the VRM models (that is how GPU-Z gets it), but its not available in Linux. I think its the only thing missing in Linux now. It does not matter. If suddenly a new miner software allowed the miners to do hashing at double speed, everybody would switch, difficultry would double and everything would remain the same. Lets link the first one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-SkThe second one is clearly better produced and the music is better, but there is something about the first one that makes me like it more.

In other words, probability is a bitch. A typical day in AyeYo life:This morning Joe was awakened by his alarm clock.  Thanks to patents, which remove incentives to interoperability and modular design, the clock was designed to be thrown away rather than repaired.  Thanks to intellectual property law, as well, the company was able to outsource actual production and then charge Joe a 1000% brand-name markup while paying the people who made it pennies. The clock was powered by electricity generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the US Department of Energy  a regulated monopoly operating on the same cost-plus markup accounting system as most other public utilities, including the military contractors who gave us the $600 toilet seat.  Joe then took a shower in the clean water provided by the municipal water utility; Joes water bill reflects a rate structure which provides below-cost water for large-scale industrial use and agribusiness.   Joe watched the news on the kind of legacy broadcast media described by Edward Herman, which thanks to the FCC licensing monopolies is controlled by a handful of corporate gatekeepers.He watched it while eating his breakfast of General Mills cereal, which thanks to government subsidies was produced at some giant mill in Minneapolis, despite the fact that cereal grains are most economically milled on a small scale near the point of consumption. Joe has no idea whats in his bacon, because the FDA (at Monsantos behest) prohibits labeling food as GMO-free.  Most of what he eats is loaded with high-fructose corn syrup, and what little fresh produce he eats is shipped from a giant plantation thousands of miles away, thanks to USDA subsidies.Joe took pills which were declared safe under an inspection regime originally created at the behest of the drug cartel itself, the inflated costs of which serve as a useful entry barrier and thereby benefit incumbent producers.  He paid a 2000% markup on the pills thanks to government-granted patent monopolies.  Joes medical plan stopped paying for prescription drugs because his weak union has been making more concessions at every contract renewal.  The Wagner Act criminalized most of the really effective techniques, so unions like Joes are forced to fight by the bosses rules.Joe drives to work on a government-subsidized highway system, built under the supervision of former auto exec Charlie Whats Good for GM Wilson.  Joes commute takes almost an hour.  Thanks to subsidized freeways and subsidized utilities to outlying developments, its artificially cheap to build monoculture bedroom communities far removed from where people work and shop.  And thanks to zoning laws and other regulations against mixed use development, its extremely costly to live near your employer or be able to walk to a neighborhood grocer.Joe begins his workday.  Hes doing the work of a downsized person in addition to his own, the work environment is becoming increasingly hostile and authoritarian, and the micromanagement increasingly demeaning.  He finds his face sore from the fake smile he constantly displays to reassure the bosses hes got his mind right.  He got no COLA raise last time around, and his insurance copay and deductible are higher.  (It all gets back to the union thing above).  The bosses sometimes drop hints about closing the plant down and moving to China, which is a whole lot more profitable thanks to World Bank subsidies to the road and utility infrastructure the offshore factories need, and thanks to WTO enforcement of intellectual property law that corporate headquarters use to maintain control of outsourced production overseas.Joe pays his bills with legal tender created by banks, under the state-granted power to loan the medium of exchange into existence out of thin air and then charge interest on it.After work Joe finds his kids back home from the public schools, where theyre being processed into human resources who will cheerfully take direction from some authority figure behind a desk for the rest of their lives  just like Joe does.  While they were there, the kids were taught about the wonders of Our Free Enterprise System  (suitably adjusted, of course, by government action to protect us from corporate power run amok).When Joe goes to sleep, if hes a conservative, he will thank the beneficent Free Market for all the good things he enjoys.  If hes a liberal, hell give thanks for the interventionist state as a bulwark against unbridled corporate tyranny.  And hell get a nights rest, preparing for another day of serving the unholy corporate-state alliance that rules his life from cradle to grave.Source: http://c4ss.org/content/3392 Thanks. Looks very intersting. Another satisfied cablesaurus costumer here. And you can pay with bitcoins. But this is assuming same growth. And 120Gh/s for half BTC with GPU technology does not cover electricity expenses even at the cheaper rate of 8 cents Kw I think (I have not made the math really), so its not going to happen. Inflation benefits the people that have more wealth because it props up their assets, while it goes against the people that earn a wage (usually the middle class and the poor) because it devaluates their wages. The basic mistake you are making is believing the wealthy keep their wealth in currency. They dont.You are advocating a policy that would go against the same people you claim to be defending. I dont know where all this is coming from and its not the same time I have heard this "theory". The ones promoting this theory and making people believe it are geniouses. In spite of what the oficial propaganda says, the regulation in the USA has increased in each of the last decades. And this is a full article about assignats in case anyone wants to dig a bit dipper: http://www.financialsensearchive.com/editorials/casey/2006/1228.html Goldmoney and Max Keiser have produced a very good video of the monetary events that played a basic role around the French Revolution.Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zvNV-vkEzcPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4aRuiO1OuQIts important to note how once the inflationary spiral has started, very few people realize the real cause of prices rising, the monetary inflation, and keep demanding more monetary inflation as to pay for the higher prices, leading to more distortions in the economy and making the problem even worse, until the final collapse. I think Satoshi has a very black sense of humour. According to Bitcoin Watch it will go up but not as much as the two previous rounds:Difficulty    1,379,223Next Difficulty in 1399 blocks    1,475,861 And to add to what you say, having 50% (or whatever) of the currency would only grant them control for a while. As time passes and they need to operate to control the currency they would end up loosing control of it, because they dont have the monopolly on the emission of that currency.
The USA postal service already sets the prices of international orders in SDR's. I have not removed any post on this thread. Not one.

The text that I have added instead of the insult is very similar to the text that I have added when removing insults in other threads. I have allowed all kind of vocabullary, like libertards and similars, I have only removed 1 direct insult.I dont know if you are getting the impression that I have removed some post or something. I have not. I have only removed 1 word, that was an insult. Thats all. Do you still consider its heavy handed moderation?Maybe I should post my opinions from a different account so as not to give the impression that I am bullying. http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=23242.msg295321#msg295321 Brilliant. Im quoting this here so anyone can see how ridiculous you are. Why would anyone answer with a long answer to a thread were basically some nicknames have gathered together at the same time to throw some insults using a propaganda article?Specially when I lost my time writting a critique post about Keynesianism to one of those nicknames in another thread just to discover that person has no idea about keynesianism, takes it as faith, and was not only unable to answer (which is fine, not everybody has to be an expert on economics) but decided to ignore my post and go in a nonsense rant as if he knew what he was talking about. Am I supposed to take this kind of behaviour seriously? Am I supposed to keep loosing my time?Why not? Criticizing the whole thing would be a endless task. If you are willing to pay me I can write the whole critique."It generally does": So basically you are acknowledging my point that it not always does.How did consumption in housing "help" the economy in the USA, Ireland or Spain? What type of consumption has happened in Sweden? Is it sustainable or only a small bubble created by the central bank? Will the capital created by the entrepreneurs due to the signals produced by that consumption be productive in the future? Or will it be waste because that artificial consumption will desappear when the artificial conditions are not there?Consumption is not an abstract blob of data. Consumption means that the people has consumed some specific types of products.Greenspan kept lowering the rates at any sign of economic downturn, to "stimulate" the economy. He create the housing bubble.Yes, I like a lot the example of Sweden in the 90's and how they handled their housing bubble. You know why? Because they liquidated their debt. No need for massive increase of government spending in the economy (wrongly called "stimulous"), just liquidate the debt.Basically, the way these kind of things are solved in a free market is by letting companies go bankrupt. The debt is liquidated and the remaining assets can be realocated. But because Sweden (and any modern occidental country) has a comletely regulated banking system that allows the banks to overextend credit way beyond what the free market would allow, this solution would be very painful (quick and effective, but very painful). Therefore the government took care of the mess it had created. And honestly I have to say is one of the more responsable actions by a government I have ever seen. They basically said they would not pay for the banks debt, so basically the debtors lost it, and also liquidated the position of the shareholders. They only went in to save the money of the depositors. Once it was done they sold the banks back to private owners to recover as much money as they could.The key here is that they liquidated the debt, so the economy could start over.Realize that both lowering interest rates and massive government spending goes into the other way. It tries to keep the debt obligations being payed by devaluation of the currency. Its a slow default, so its a slow recovery. Liquidating the debt in a quick default allows for a quick recovery.Also, its worth noticing that by lowering interest rates and government spending (the keynesian solution) you are helping banks and the politically connected while hurting the poor. Instead, by defaulting on the debt you are hurting the banks and the investors. This is the reason why the keynesian solution is almost always the choosen one. Iceland is the best example of what one should do. Default on the debt and start over again.The austerity mesures without defaulting on the debt will never ever work, and in reality are condenming Greece to years, maybe even more than a decade, of stagnation. The only objective of the EU is that the bankers get their debt repayed. Its a real shame. Can you try to argue without putting in my mouth words that I did not say? Why do you need to be dishonest? If you are right, you dont need to be dishonest. That you are manipulating and adopting a trolling attitude shows that you are insecure because probably you already know the article does not hold.I did not say the article is fustrating or that the article "works in real life". What I said is the article is a bunch of non-sequiturs. This article is quite ridiculous. Anyone with a bit of critical thinking capacity can see it. Lets take for example the part on monetary policy. It almost does not explain how this aggressive monetary policy is good. If you take the explanation of the situation and the rethoric out, this is all that is left to explain why this aggresive monetary politcy is good:First of all, the first sentence is a typical form of propaganda. This is clear. Period. Nothing to discuss here. Is typical rethoric from a cult.Then you have the typical falacy that lower rates call always create more consumption, and then the even bigger fallacy that more consumption helps the economy (how did that work for Greenspan and Bush?).Have you consider that the reason why this abuse by the central bank did not have a worse effect and the economy did not suffer too much from it, is that there was no housing bubble in Sweden? No, lets compare a Sweden without a housing bubble with a USA with a housing bubble. Yeah, that makes sense...How about Germany performance when the ECB wasnt as aggressive as the article suggest a central bank has to be? Oh well, Germany did not have a housing bubble and they are doing good. While Spain also under the ECB policies is doing very bad, and, surprise surprise, they had a housing bubble. So the countries that didnt have a housing bubble are doing a lot better than the countries that had a housing bubble, all with more and less agressive monetary policies. But hey, its the agressive monetary policy, no doubt!The whole thing is propaganda, and anyone with a bit of critical thiking can see it. But I dont think you want to really discuss the issues, nor the rest of your "budies" want to rationally discuss neither. This thread was just opened for name calling, so you can proceed. The way to create a community is not to insult people.Also, I dont know how you can call crackpots to the people that predicted the housing bubble, while a majority of keynesians did not see it coming, including Krugman. Krugman specifically called for the creation of the housing bubble. So if someone has to be called a crackpot here are the keynesians.The real problem with keynesianism is that its not scientific, but that is another discussion. If this ends up happneing Im going to blame you. I read the whole article. It starts very good, but it ends badly. You dont need a central bank to have reversible transactions. In fact, Bitcoin has implemented a system to have reversible transactions. The joke of the day.http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/06/world-bank-taps-lehmans-ex-risk-officer.html I recomend to some of the poster here to stop insulting to other members of the community.Regarding the article is a bunch of non-sequiturs. I would appreciate if the op would bring a serious economic analisys and not the economic political propaganda. Indeed. The people with better job position get higher wage increases every year, probably equivalent to the real rate of price inflation, while the rest get their wages actualized by the offical government price inflation rate.I never said that they dont pay interest in the bonds that they sell to the general population. The government does not pay interest (or more accurately gets the interest payment back) from the debt monetized by the central bank. Yes. Its very important to understand that fractional reserve with a central bank (or similar regulation) and fractional reserve without a central bank (free banking) are completely different monetary systems. People tend to talk about fractional reserve in general without taking into consideration if there is a central bank or not, and that leads to a lot fo confusion. Shiny bitcoins!! Life can be tought...After reading that book, I recomend to read something from the free banking school (something from Lawrence Whilte or George Selgin, I personally prefer the style of the later), because IMHO its an advance on monetary theory from Rothard. Free banking is in my opinion the most important advance in austrian theory of the present day austrian schoolars. Im guessing that the rest of Europe will be similar. Btw, can I buy two pairs with the offer? How much for your internets? Let me guess: You are french.
Yes, its the federal funds market, and its rates are heavily influenced by the central bank. Only the banks of the Federal Reserve system and certain institutions (like Freddie and Fannie) can access this market.Right now Bernanke has the federal fund rate at almost zero (between 0 and 0.25%). You can check their daily value here: http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/omo/dmm/fedfundsdata.cfm Short term the central bank uses repos to correct slight deviations of this rates, but if that is not enough it has to raise the rate or do open market operations to inject more money. Right now we are in a special situation because the banks are loaded with money (check the excess reserves) and they have no need for borrowing from the federal fund market for their operations. Right now most of the action comes from the other institutions that lend the banks the money they have around without use overnight to earn some (minimal) interest. Why do the banks borrow this money? Because they can deposit it as excess reserves and earn a 0.25% that the Federal Reserve pays them. So while this situation goes on, the federal fund rate wont go over the excess reserve interest rate that the Fed is paying the banks. Note that this is a way for the Fed to give "free money" to the banks.Different countries work in different ways, but usually the banks settle their balances once a day.Sorry, Im not from the USA and I can not give you specifics on how exactly the banking clearing system of the USA works, but there is the wikipedia page that might help you get started: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House (according to the wikipedia is regulated, which is not a surprise at all).Btw, there were free market clearing houses that restrained member banks from expanding the money supply. See the Suffolk bank in the USA druing the XIX century. What about international delivery?Can I suggest that you include information about international delivery in your offerts? It would make things easier for a lot of people. The only way for price inflation not to happen is for Bernanke to remove the liquidity from the banks. And the Fed is signaling already QE3 (which will be different form QE1 and QE2, it will be similar to the Operation Twist from the 60's and probably wont be called QE3 but its still money printing to buy government debt). The Fed really can not remove the liquidity from the banks, the only thing it can do is to control the rate at which that liquidity enters the market. That is why I have been predicting stagflation but not hyper-inflation. We need some channels were people dont need to get out of the Bitcoin economy. That is why I think its so important to get food business to accept bitcoins. If I earn bitcoins and can use them to buy food, there really is no need to change them back to a government currency. And as the business that accept bitcoins grow the food business can use them to buy computers, etc... Once we create some "circular flow" there will be no need to use the government currency. The problem is that then you probably can not trade in that jurisdiction anymore. Obviously its not unheard for some people to not pay the debts. In Europe a lot of people, specially inmigrants, have fleed the country leaving the unpayed mortgage behind. But they can not expect to come bank ever. Some people might preffer to pay the debt than to go away from their home, family and friends. Yes, I agree.What? There was massive inflation due to the monetary expansion of the Fed to pay for IWW. Scratch that, I read the two wars and though you were talking about IWW and IIWW.In the present moment there already is price inflation. The thing is that the credit crunch has produced a contraction of the debt producing deflationary preasures that have countered the inflationary preasures. But the credit is leveling so the deflationary preasures are fading, and the price inflation is starting to signal what is about to come. Monetary events are very slow. They can take years to develop.Some people still trust that Bernanke will be able to remove all the liquidity from the banks "when the time comes". But I have written articles (not en english, sorry) showing how Bernanke can not remove the liquidity, just delay when it appears in the market (basically through playing with the interest it pays on excess reserves). Funkypala, welcome again.There are ways to enforce contracts through private institutions. First, you have ostracism. If someone violates a contract he/she will find it hard that other people trust him/her and trade with him/her. So there is an incentive to respect contracts. Second, you have the legal system, the courts. This legal system can be a government monpolly or private. It would be a long to discuss both systems, but basically the bank can use the legal system to enforce the contract. This is a incentive to not have very extreme fractional reserve banking. And that is what happened when banking was not regulated. Because banks were afraid of bank runs they kept a higher ratio, the were more prudent. Now, with regulations, they are protected from bank runs (specially because of central banking and FDIC) so they can go as low as the regulators allow them, which for example in Europe is 2% and in the USA a bit higher. The government regulations have taken the control away from the costumers. Bernanke at some point said that he wanted to change the regulations and regulate the rate to 0%. Imagine that... Mouse, I agree with you. But the Bitcoin community is very big and there are people with different opinion regarding technology. Its how it is. The problem is that bitcoins are pseudo-anonymous and political donations are striclty controlled. BTC Economist, your trolling has been low quality and repetitive lately. We demand higher quality and more entertaining trolling. Hahahaha. You broke my irony detector. Overclocking is simpler in Linux than in Windows. You have a graphical program AMDOverdriveCtrl that allows you to change the voltage, fan speed, gpu Mhz and memory Mhz (ignoring bios limitations, no need to flash bios). You can use the same program in console if you prefer so or use aticonfig. Social-democrat: Social-democracy will help everybody.Other: Then why does it always concentrate the wealth in a few hands and hurts the poor?Social-democrat: Because this is not a real democracy. We need a real democracy. "History of Money and Banking from the Colonial Era to the IIWW" by Murray RothbardPerfect to understand how different monetary systems work in reality. Also in pdf. No. Difficulty went up, so we are supposed to produce less bitcoins (which is what is happenign). But luck is calculated for each difficulty level. So we are producing less bitcoins now because difficulty went up, but given the expected median production at this difficulty level we are being lucky. I think this answer says everything people need to know about you. Its very simple to understand the difference between what someone claims and what they really offer. I know you need to act all cocky and aggressive because of your insecurity, but if you drop the attitude you will understand it. Then your mind is wrong.Btw, communism is a very hierarchical system, is political darwinism. This is not true. This is what the USA government accused him of. But just check the 5 dollar notes and tell me they can be confused:And why would he want to pass something more expensive for something cheaper? It would be stupid. It was just an excuse by the USA government.
Do you realize that difficulty is a direct function of hashing power? If hasing power decreases dificulty decreases as well.Mining will be a very low yielding business at the end. Its too easy to get in, so obviously competition is will be fierce.   But you are asuming that there will be people willing to sell at 5. If those people were there before the price would have gone down already. Lets actualize your example:You have 10 bitcoins. You sell 5 of them:1 for 91 for 81 for 71 for 6 1 for 5Filling up a bunch of people's buy orders. You now have 35USD and the market is sitting at 5, meaning that the last transaction was at 5. Now you start to buy and someone due to the "panic" is willing to sell at 7, the rest only at 9. So you buy 1 bitcoin at 7, leaving you with 28USD then you buy at 9. With 28 USD you can only buy 3 bitcoins and are left 1 USD.So you started with 10 bitcoins, and end up with 9 bitcoins and 1 USD. You lost.As I said the only way to win in this situation is to create a panic, play with the psicology of the people and make them sell. But this is risky because if people dont buy the panic you are the one losing money. I would not upload my private keys to the internet no matter how much encryption. That is just my personal perference though. 1. Bitcoin is not a fiat currency.2. The only way you can profit from doing what you propose is by playing with psicological factors, like creating panic and make that other people sell along you, so you dont have to masively sell. This is why we had so many trolls trying to create panic here in the forums. But this is a very dangerous game because you never know how the people is going to react, the psicology is always different, so you can end up loosing big time. Its quite risky. I really dont understand why anyone would trust the present financial system. He was arrested because he was running an alternative currency that was starting to take hold. Nothing else. Basically yes, savings tends to be investment.But for this to happen you need a financial system, which Bitcoin does not have (yet). Just to be clear, nobody is saying that debt is always good, nobody is defending the present monetary system, comparing the present levels of debt and specially the way it comes about to slavery is quite accurate. Nobody is disagreeing with you there. I personally try to stay away from debt as much as I can as well.The problem is that some justifications you are giving are objectively wrong, false. That is what the people here is trying to point out. This is false, as several people have noted before in this post. Re-read the answers. LibreMercado is the economic section of the 4-6th more visited news website in Spain (depending on the metric), and has published an article about Bitcoin: http://www.libremercado.com/2011-06-26/el-fenomeno-bitcoin-la-moneda-electronica-de-internet-1276427764/ Acaban de publicarlo: http://www.libremercado.com/2011-06-26/el-fenomeno-bitcoin-la-moneda-electronica-de-internet-1276427764/Se aceptan opiniones. Usually real interest rates are lower under inflationary system becuase usually the newly printed money comes in through loans. Because banks have more money to loan real interest rates are lower, at least for a while (during the bubble phase, when the bubble pahse is over interest rates skyrocket).While it could seem that more loans is better, its the contrary. Inflation stops growth because it creates malinvestments. Thank you, I was too lazy to write down the whole example.What it is true is that under a deflationary system there is less incentive to go into debt so usually there is less debt in a deflationay system that under a inflationary system. Inflation promotes debt. But there are other factors that influence as well. I did not see the option of paying with bitcoins. Yes, there can be interest in bitcoins, and there will be interest in bitcoins.No, interest are not bad.No, you dont need inflation to pay for the interest. As an example, you can pay a loan of 1000 bitcoins with a money supply of 600 bitcoins. Money circulates. The thing is that even if they create a device that generates 100 MH/s for $600 but consumes lets say 25W, its going to outprice the GPU's anyway, because long time the investment will be worth it and the GPU wont be able to stay profitable at 100Mh/s at 25W. Thats a MH/J of 4, and the most efficient GPU's can only do slightly above 2. As people buy more and more of this ASIC's the difficulty go up and at some point the gpu's will generate bitcoins at a rate that wont pay for the electricity they consume.I dont think the thread for the GPU's is pure hashing power. The problem will be power consumption efficiency. No, it wont happen. The political system would loose legitimacy in the eye of a lot of people, and they need all the fools believing in "the best interest of the nation", the "greater good" and "I do it for your well being" to stay in power.This is why de-centrallization is so important. They can easily streak down one central point, but they really can not go against everybody. The only thing cool about reddit are the subreddits. The more mainstream subreddit are just a bunch of kids trying too hard to appear cool on the Internet. Yes, its not really viable at this point. But in the future it will probably happen (Im pretty sure it will happen).
Probably the difficulty rise outpriced a bunch of miners. Ill sell for 49.98. If you trust the bank enough you could have an anonymous account just controlled by a private key. IF you trust the bank enough (big IF, but there are some examples in reality).Stop trolling. That you engage in some contract with the bank does not mean their notes become legal tender. IT just mean that you accept them, not everyone else. Legal tender means that the bank notes are forced upon everybody. I dont know if all is relative, but certainly value is relative. Propaganda plays a big part in both countries. A lot of chinese think that the dictartorship is great. Even during medieval times, intelectuals and peasants said that the monarchy was great. Propaganda USA style is not the only type of propaganada.And while propaganda plays a role in keeping the people using fiat currencies, the final argument is always the bullet that is backing fiat currencies. Without them, a lot of people would stop using them and there would be a cascade effect. How is time valuable outside of some human deciding its valuable? There is no difference at all betwen an speculator and a user. Its just that some people like to judge the motivations of other people in the market. What they deem its good are labeled as users and what they deem is bad are labeled as speculators. And because everybody judges in a different way, you have all type of cracy clasifications. Its a useless distinction. Everybody is a user, just with different motivations. The business that have handed the info to the government have usually lost a lot of their client base or at least their gorwth. That people you are labeling as a minority, reality shows they are a majority. The IMF has a criteria for developed nations and another criteria for undeveloped nations. It has always been this way. They can try to hide it as a change of theories but it is just bullshit.The IMF is the political hand of the USA and to some degree of their EU allies. Nothing more, nothing less. This is nonsense and contradictory. Its like saying you want to have fire and water together. It might serve you to keep your mind happy but its does not make sense. Its a contradiction. There is nothing wrong with fractional reserve banking. The problem is when you have fractional resrve banking + central bank (or similar regulations). Then you get all the problems. But fractional reserve banking alone is not a problem, and its even positive because it helps the allocation of capital and stabilicies the swings due to changes in the demand for money.I recommend this blog as an starting point to learn why free banking (fractional reserve WITHOUT a central bank) is positive: http://www.freebanking.org/ Also, this article by George Selgin: http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=774No. It depends on the system. Under a free banking system (fractional reserve WITHOUT a central bank) the banks tend to only accept gold (or in this case bitcoins) as base money, they dont accept notes of other banks.Accepting notes of other banks as base money only happens when there are regulations, like we have now, that protect the banks (FDIC, central banking) and allow them to overexpand the supply of money, creating debt and inflation.Actually, history shows that free banking system (fractional reserve without a central bank) are remarkably stable and wihtout too many bank runs. The banks know that there is no one to protect them and are forced to behave because of fear of going bankrupt. Fear and greed always balancing each other. If you take the fear away with a central bank, fdic, and other regulations then banks start to misbehave and you have things like the 2008 collapse you mentioned.Fractional reserve alone is not inflationary. Once banks reach the zone of equilibrium they mantain the reserve ratio in a range, thus the money supply remains stable, only reacting to changes to the demand for money (this is a positive effect of fractional reserve). No hay ninguna burbuja en el oro y la plata. La gente está huyendo de las monedas de los gobiernos por las accines que han tomado y las consecuencias que tendrá. Please no more threads about RBE. Ask this in their thread. You should not take it personal. Its imposible for the moderators to know who is for real and who is a troll. During previous events similar to the one that is going on now, there was a heavy influx of trolls. We are just trying to keep the forum somehow safe. Nothing else. Higher than the CPI, not the real price inflation. Please show us your method to determine the price. If you have find a way you might get a Nobel.Then show us your method to read the mind of people over the internet. You might get several Nobels. Yes, there is something like that to the system, but there are important things to take into consideration.First, debt is not inherenlty bad. If you work and get money it is completely legitimate that you lend that money to someone because you believe in his project. And the same way you get some money when you rent your house or your car  or whatever, you get some moeney whe you rent your money. You are refusing to use your money for a while in exchange to getting some more in the future. This way people that have a good idea but not the resources can still devlop their project and become more productive. The problem is when you are not lending your savings (that you worked to get), but when you are charging interest for something you created out of thin air. And apart from charging interest from nothing you are competing unfairly with the people that is working and saving. Also they create all types of distortions on the economy because now everybody thinks there are a lot more resources because they see more money (bubbles).Answering to your questions, yes. Basically the present system is designed to benefit banks and politicians at our expense. Banks can lend out much more money thatn they could without a central bank, because they know that if they go too far with the reserve ratio there can not be a bank run because the central bank will cover them. So they loan out all they can and earn interest on that. And the politicians get a lot more money than they would with direct taxes only. The central bank monetizes the government debt, lowering the interest rates, and basically giving fre emoney to the politicians. Because people has a hard time asociating the rising prices with this actions because they take even years to develop politicians get awya with it, when they would not get away with rising taxes.And obviously, we are the suckers here because we pay all this with higher prices. And specially the poor and middle clases. Because the people who is closer to the money source (bankers, politicians and their corporate budies) get to spend the money when it has not yet circulated and the prices have not yet rised. The ones at the end of the chain (basically wage earners) get screwed because prices rise when their wages have not yet actuallized. Basically the further away from the money source (the central bank) you are, the more screwed you are.Exactly.The government still demands credit from other sources than the central bank because the limitation of printing money is rising prices. If you print too much it will get to a point when even the dumbest person will realize what is up and will revolt. In fact, there are numerous revolutions and government collapses that are preceded by rising prices due to the government trying to print its way out of whatever mess they created. In a sense, its kind of what every government is trying to do right now. You dont really need the genitals, just the shape of the body pounding. With that you can make the machine follow the rythm, changes in the rythm, pauses, etc... that the guy (or girl) is following.Wonder if this thing would have even more success with woman. I have heard quite a few times from (mostly heterosexual) woman that they would like to know how it feels to penetrate another woman. Are you a engineer or a computer science guy? Do you even know how this things work? You know, this is actually a great idea. I can imagine the guy with a flashlight (or however they are called) moving like he is fucking the girl, the kinect reading his movements and transpiting them to the webpage so the machine follows the movements of the guy (or girl). It would be like the first step towards internet "real" sex, kind of like virtual reality.That said, I dont know how lazy are the people that connect to this services. Maybe they just like to watch and not move. Who knows.EDIT: And philosphically speaking, where is the limit? where does the sex worker stops being a stripper and becomes a (virtual?) prostitute? Not that the distinction matters, but Im curious.
He is not saying the machines are or will become the dictators. He is saying that the people that program the machine (or whoever decides how the machine is programmed) is in control.If you answer to what he actually says, and not to what you imagine he says, the conversation will be more civil and productive. Honestly, there is no point arguing with this people. I have tried in other forums and they keep repeating the mantra. Logic does not work on them. They have a dream and they will follow no matter what reality says. Its sad, but I guess some humans work that way. I could do this. When I googled "manufacturing engineer" I saw pictures of robots building cars and big automation stuff. But this is a small project and its doable. Im sure I would have problems with the mechanichal parts, but since its already designed it should not be difficult to put together, and getting the electronic and programming parts working is my thing. No problem there, I could even do it wireless so there are no cables going around.What I dont understand is the business model. So you dont want to produce and sell this things, you want to lease them? It might work for a while but you are just screaming for competition if the thing has success. Its not that hard to build for a company that has a couple of half-competent engineers.But lets assume that business model. What I dont understand is this: Why do you need a box to have authentification in itself? Why not charge a monthly fee to the business that its using them. The business would pay a fee to have the machine for a month, it would connect the machine to the computer (USB, serial, wireless, ...) and a computer program would connect the webpage server to the machine so the customer could control the machine from his (or her) web browser. The programs would be included with the lease of the machine. eleuthria, is there any chance we will get at least the option of having the workers arrange how they were when they were created?Is a Nvidia card profitable anymore? I mean doesnt it cost more the electricity it consumes than the bitcoins it produces? Then it seems Bitcoin could help. What I dont understand is what is stopping you from getting their money, buying the computer (or whatever) for them in New York and then send it to Venezuela. If the problem is on how they wire you money then Bitcoin might help, the only problem is how do they buy bitcoins. I dont know if there is anyone selling bitcoins in Venezuela. You would not have problems changing bitcoins for dollars to buy the stuff and maybe you can even find a shop that accepts bitcoins. But how is that enforced? I guess the shop does not control if you are buying from Venezuela or wherever. Probably the government checks the goods when they go through the fronteir and checks that they are not more expensive than the limit.In this case the form of payment is kind of irrelevant. If this is not the case and the control is in the money part then Bitcoin might be of help.Saludos desde España  How does the government enforce those regulations? Depending on how they are enforced and where the control is Bitcoin might or minght not be of help. This is the correct answer. It is not the computational power that gives the new bitcoins value. If it were playing a high graphic game should give you money because its uses a lot of computational power. The coins come from nothing as a reward for those who are keeping the network safe (that is what mining is about).Th eonly detail is that fiat currencies are not based on confidence. They are impose by force by the governments. I assure you that its not confidence that holds them in place, its the violence or thread of violence of governments. When a fiat currency has stopped being the government currency and has had to compete they always collapse, because nobody trusted them but were forced to use them. F.e. people say that Andrew Jackson closed the central bank of his time, the Second Bank of the USA. What he did in reality was to remove the charter they had and let them opperate as a normal bank. He did not really close it, he just removed the government regulations. The bank went bankrupt, even when they tried to get some state to regulate for them. Guys, weve found Satoshi. Hes confesed. This comic could not have a better timing:On a more serious note, how do you explain that TradeHill has been trading for days after the MtGox hack, and both volume and price are rising. Never let reality spoil a good joke. Why? I and Im sure a lot others had the workers in order and now they are in disorder.I know you are just trying to improve the site, but maybe making it optional would be better? Perfect refrigeration, maximum overclock. But it does change because difficulty changes every half month (+-4 days...), so if suddenly a lot of people is mining like is happening now there will be temporarely an increase of production and probably and increase of supply (assuming the same ratio of miners that sell). When the difficulty adjusts and miners stop investing in more hardware then the supply stabilizes (reduces from the frenzy).There is a temporary increase of supply if a lot of people starts mining. https://clearcoin.appspot.com/ Yes, sometime the government is unable to impose a currency for a while because it does not have enough control or the population is very wary against the idea. But its not because they dont want to.  This is not exactly true. Mining is the supply of bitcoins, but you are leaving aside the demand. If for some reason people stopped demanding bitcoins, difficulty could go up and price down for a while. Obviously this would discourabe miners and its expected that some stopped mining, thus bringing the difficulty down.But its silly and dangerous to believe that because difficultry go up price will go up. If difficulty goes up, suppy will be reduced. The price will depend on how demand reacts. Well, we are making progress. Trolls dont think Bitcoin is going to collapse, now the problem is that they will stay stable.When it was volatile they were bad because they were volatile, and now that they are stable for some days, they are bad because they are stable... Some people are never happy. I love how they call them polymer money and not plastic money. Central banks are masters of PR. You know this is going to be quoted and your post linked as proof, right?
Hehehe, nice, very nice. This is true, and this shit can happen anywhere. But those three cases happened in a regulated market, not in a free market. Because of regulations those people could leverage to some levels that the free market would have not allowed. Governments have always offered gold-backed money as a way to get the population used to a money monpolly. And they never wait to long to start abusing it. Real money crowds out bad (Gresham law) ONLY IF there is a fixed exchange rate between the two. If they are feely allowed to float Gresham law does not apply. This is why you can still buy gold.Gold and silver did not stopped being used as money because people hoarded them and disappeared from day to day use. Governments regulated to impose their currency, removing any competition. I just looked up the term "manufacturing engeneering" and I understand now. We dont use a similar word for that in my language, so I did not understand.Friendly advice: Drop the attitude. I really can not tell if you are being ironic or not. Anyways, it would be a good idea to list the required areas of expertise. A mechanical engineer has a very different set of skill than an electronic engineer.Yes, this is absolutely true. And thanks for not mention the compulsive masturbatory disorders. So basically these ethogens are a way to get high but camuflaged as relitious use? Why would a government impose as legal tender a currency that it can not print and therefore can not profit from it? I didnt. I got 11.6 in my regular linux HD install. Im playing around with LinuxCoin but I am still not using it. When LinuxCoin includes 11.6 Ill give it another try. You might want to specify what kind of engineering is required. Engineering is very broad with a lot of specialities and different types of skills. Tomorrow more. I have to write an article about the end of QE2 and the posibility of QE3 due today. Yes it does. What I said is 100% accurate.It is because when the central bank monetizes government debt its roughtly equivalent to the government printing money. So a big part of QE1 and all of QE2 is basically financing the government with newly printed money. Its exactly what he wants to do and it is exactly what already happens. The problem is that there are several stages in the middle making the process complicated.And again the government debt that the Federal Reserve holds does not reperesent an expense for the government because the Fed returns its benefits to the same government (weekly). The government does not pay interest to the bank.These kind of manipulations is why I say that the guy is a nutjob and dishonest. And he will hate Bitcoin because he wants the government to force a monopolly on money onto the people, because its the only way to have a inflationary currency.Anyway, I am done for today with my humanitarian task of trying to warn people of the charlatans that are trying to fool them. Do your research and decide.PS: You might want to think about why it is better that the government finances with inflation, that is not controllable by the people because it has long term effects and people dont see them, than with direct taxation, that is more controllable by the people because people see right away how much money they have to give away. Financing through inflation is much more undemocractic than financing through direct taxation.PS2: And while you are doing your research check the examples of nations that applied his theories. They all hyperinflated. I lump them together because Krugman is a Fed apologist. He might disagree here and there with some of their policies, but he wants and defends a central bank system. He is an apologist of the system.Btw, price inflation does not create sustainable jobs. Its not something the Fed can do.There you go: http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/27/commodity-prices-and-inflation/Actually, he didnt call the housing crisis. Krugman always writes one thing and a couple of week later he writes the contrary. When the time comes he chooses one as proof he is right. Check this video @ 2:55 (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnekzRuu8wo) Krugman says that he does not know if there is going to be a recession or not, in December 2007, when we were less than a year from the crash. How is that calling the housing crisis? He didnt. In some of his writtings he said there could be a crisis and in some others he said that maybe not. So when the housing crisis arrive he said: Hey! I called it. Its how he works.Btw, Krugman also said after the dotcom bubble that the USA needed lower interest rates and more investment in housing... How did that work? I dont understand why he is getting away when he is guilty of helping create the housing bubble.The problem is this is nonsense. Its long to explian so if you are interested we can go in more detail into this only.No.This does not answer my argument. Taiwan is so small that its monetary policies do not have influence over a commodity market. But I have to admit that I dont follow Taiwan monetary policies with detail so I really dont know what they are doing. Anyway, its not important.The dates are not chosen conveniently. He is just showing the period choosed by the Fed to reduce its balance. Its not David Rosenberg choosing the dates, so there can be no dishonesty on his part. He is just saying that when the Fed was easing the price of petrol was going up. When the Fed stopped easing and contracted the balance sheet, the price of petrol started going down. Finally when the Fed started easing again the price of petrol started going up again.This is not random.Depending on the monetary aggregate you choose, but its just a matter of definitions and its not important here.Yes, they are volatile and you can add some populism, still it does not explain why they went up when the Fed was easing, went down when stopped and went up again when the Fed started to ease again. You can decide to ignore the empircial correlation but then you wont understand what is going on.I know the history. And I am not denying that there were some disruptions on the supply due to conflicts (that is what I meant by geopolitical events) but there was no peak oil (and I dont deny that we might get some day to peak oil or that we might be close, its just that we werent at peak oil back then). But the USA had been manipulating the price of gold since the 40's even before Bretton Wood, and finally it could not respond to its obligations and Nixon defaulted. This was expected since Bretton Woods was flawed. But the point is that the rise in the price of gold meant heavy price inflation for the USA. The arabs said publicy at the begginning fo the 70's that they would peg the price of oil to the price of gold, and so it happen. The USA government tried to blame them and said they were a cartel, but it is completely understandable that the arabs wanted something that they deemed worthy in exchange for their most precious resource and refused to accept a currency that the USA government could print "at will". Then you have Nixon asking the then chairman Burns to print more to create a mini-bubble to win the election and it was the perfect storm: Stagflation. Yes, the only difference is that the movie demands no fractional reserve while now its allowed. For the rest, we are in the system they demand. He makes it like he wants a different monetary system, but its not like that.I dont understand what you mean.The part of the Fed that controls the money supply is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Bernanke and the rest of the gang) and it is a federal government agency. So the government is already controlling the money supply.As I say the guy shows half truths and lies to give the impression that we are in a system that is very different from what he wants, but appart from not allowing the banks to perform fractional reserve, the monetary part is right now how he wants it. BubbleBoy, you are the troll with more knowledge in this forum, but you have serveral mistakes in this post. Your monetary policy part is lacking. Its sad the effect the nujob movies has on the people. Look, you are probably not a bad guy, but you should not talk like this to people you dont know, who know a lot more tahn you in monetary policy and that are taking time to explain to you how a nutjob has fooled you with a very well produced movie.Yes, the Fed returns its benefits to the Treasury weekly (and btw that link is irrelevant to this issue).   In spanish, wage is called "salario", and that comes from being payed with "sal" (salt). No. The interest payed for the bonds are benefits of the Fed. Those benefits are returned weekly to the government. Its like they are not payed.Look this has been discussed in this forum, and I really dont want to go through the same again. The videos are very well done, but what they explain is false. The guy is a nutjob that does a disservice to the people, like me, who want to end the Fed. Also, gold has some qualities that Bitcoin does not have. On the other hand, Bitcoin does have some qualities gold ddoes not have. They are complementary.
Are we suppose to tell the truth to make the life of a hacker easier or lie to confuse him? I use paypal and have used moneybookers. The difference is that those services are part of a company, are centralized and would answer if there is a hack. I think I could recover what I could loose (maybe Im wrong). But this is not an option with Bitcoin (it has other advantages but not this one) so you have to be extracareful. Lo he visto. Ya sabes que no era a este al que me refería.  The Fed already returns its benefits to the Treasury. So when the Fed monetizes government debt is roughtly equivalent to the government printing money. We are already more or less in the system the movie demands. Problem/solution 1: It has been discussed forever (use Search) and yes, people more or less agree.Problem/solution 2: Its not really a problem. Mining is supposed to be a specialized subset of Bitcoin. Bitcoin should attract the people because its useful as money, not because you can "mine" it. If you keep expanding the period of mining you are just attracting the wrong type of people while at the same time breaking the confidence on the currency. We dont need no more mining, we need more Bitcoin business. The movie is very misleading, has big errors, just like the previous one from the same guy. EDIT: Also, this does not explain why the Fed and Krugman said commodity prices would not affect consumer prices and called names to the people saying the contrary, while now admiting that commodity prices have indeed affected consumer prices.You mean the rest of the currencies that central banks are also printing like crazy? Have you seen the balance sheet of the ECB? Bank of England? Any of the BRICS? Saying that commodities are going up in the rest of the currencies supporst the idea that its due to monetary causes.But the best indicator is this:Source.So now there are two options:1. The monetary expansion of the Fed is promoting speculation and inproductive consumption, that stops when the Fed stops injecting money (more like expectations, but lets simplify a bit).2. The price of petrol is mainly affected by supply and demand, so on April 23rd a new petrol field was opened making the price go down, just to be closed on August 27th when prices stopped going down... Or maybe people stopped using the car between those dates as well.Now you tell me which one you think is the correct one. The Fed propagandist are selling a story that is basically nonsense. There might be some changes in supply and demand, because there are always changes in supply and demand, but a big part of the price is due to the influence of monetary policy and the expectations it creates.The "so-called" oil shocks were in big part due to monetary policy mixed with geopolitical events that had a resonating effect due to the monetary policies of that time. So the Fed and its propagandists (Krugman and the rest of the gang) denied again and again that commodity prices were going to affect consumer prices. They said it was not an issue and accused the people warning about the rise in commodities and how it was going to affect the economy as fear-mongers and economic ignorants.Yesterday the Fed admitted that the price of commodities have pushed the price of consumer goods up.The Fed also said taht this rise in prices will not last. I think we could not get a better confirmation that prices will keep rising in the future. Stagflation here we go!http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/06/federal-reserve-admits-price-inflation.html A guy at the IT department of ABC has been caught using bitcoin miners in the company hardware. The rest of the piece is a pretty nasty hit-piece on bitcoins.http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/secret-money-abc-virtual-currency-racket-probe-20110623-1ggp6.html Yep, something is going on. Its not that few people need it. I, for example, would not trust the browser with access to my bitcoins. I think its too risky. What you should try to do is convince a community of farmers to accept bitcoins. If people can buy food for bitcoins then they will have a powerful reason to use bitcoins, sepcially during a collapse. Computer hardware and music. Actually no, its not the same with fiat money. Fiat money is imposed violently, usually by the governments, and that is why people use it. If people were given the choice of voluntarely choose their money I highly doubt the government money would survive. That is why they impose it violently. I got it working now and 11.6 does allow you to overclock outside of BIOS limits. The problem is that I was not installing the drivers properly. The driver seems stable in Ubuntu 11.06, but I guess it has different versions of X and other software. There are two types of XFX 8570. I own one of each. There is one with the fan at the back. This one is fully tweakable and a very good card. Then there is the one with the fan in the middle. This one can be tweaked as well, but it has less sensors, it gets hotter (like 10ºC hotter under the same conditions) and I would not recommend it. Im more of a C and embedded programmer (I studied electronic engineering). I have experience in python, Vala and some Java also. I dont have proffessional experience in web development. All I have done in the web is put up a Drupal blog: http://www.errorespuntuales.es/ The design is mine and Im very proud of it since its not "my thing" (the logo was not my decission). Yes... and a lot of things flow too, even literally.What I want to say is that to you f.e. a shovel is not a means unto itself neither I guess? Because it is used to dig wholes. But you could say the wholes are for something else. Where do you draw the line?You could even say that eating is not a means unto itself, its just a way to stay alive. Its all a matter of definition and subjective opinion, so discussing if something is a means unto itself its rathe pointless. That is what I am trying to say. Yes I agree. But I wonder why you make the distintion. Facilitating trade is just another function. After dacoinminster I am ashamed of only proposing one idea, but here it goes:A graph of bitcoin-usd exchange price, and with an arrow pointing at different positions over time, texts saying "Bitcoin will collapse soon", "Today is the last day of Bitcoin", "Bitcoin collapses and will never recover", etc... all while we see the price of the exchange oscilate but with a upward bitcoin trend.
Facilitating trade is not an end unto itself?  1. Legal tender laws dont forbid other currencies. Legal tender law forces you to accept dollars (or the currency of the government of each country) to settle all debts. This is actually attacking your right to a contract. F.e. Imagine you sign a contract stating that you will do X in exchange for an amount of silver. You do X and when it comes to pay you the person refuses and offers dollars. You dont accept since you want the conditions of the contract. The courts will rule that he/she can pay you in dollars instead of silver because its legal tender, and therefore good to settle any debt.This is why (almost) nobody signs a contract in anything that is not dollars in the USA. If you do it does not matter because the other person can settle in dollars anyway, so everybody ends up using dollars.2. The government does not forbid compiting currencies directly. What it does is give tremendous advantges to the dollar, basically legal tender laws and forcing everybody to pay taxes only in dollars. This is enough to create a de facto monopolly, but it looks nicer and less facist.3. Liberty Dollar was taken down because it was accused of copying the government money. They said he wanted to fool people into believing that the Liberty dollars were Federal Reserve Notes. They were not charged for operating an alternative currency, since its legal. The acussation is obviously an excuse to take down a competing currency that was starting to take off. Its one more prove that they will do anything to impose a monopolly on money, but they will try to do it in the nicest way so they can say that they are not imposing the dollar. Alternative currencies are not ilegal. Youve said very well what I was saying, that Bitcoin will be volatile for a while. And that is why it will be difficult to think in bitcoins for a while. Well get there, eventually. ? Are you a troll? Right, dont take literal. Bitcoin will always have some price deflation. What I meant is that with the price going from $30 to $6 in a couple of weeks... well, its hard to do economic calculation. When bitcoins stabilize a bit more and start being price deflationary in a more constant way, then it will be a lot easier to start thinking in bitcoins instead of dollars, and people will do it automatically. Right now its not doable. Bitcoins also exist. Just saying... I dont get it then. My XFX 5870 wont go over 900Mhz with 11.6 drivers. Are you using some special command or something? Yes, AMD cards will hit a wall too. But right now AMD is the most efficient hardware to mine, so everybody will hit the wall and it will get to some kind of equilbrium where the people with the higher electricity rates are priced out of the market and the more efficient stay but with very low rates (obviously if new hardware is discovered then situation changes). And you can imagine that Nvidia being so inefficient will be priced out quickly even with very cheap electiricty rates. Maybe they are alredy priced out, I have not made the math. What? That looks like the best part of the project!  Seriously, I think this has a great potential. I am a programmer but not a web programmer. If I was I would love to join your team. The problem with Nvidia is that you might end up paying more for the electricity they consume that what you get worth of bitcoins. You will have to do the math, use a bitcoin generation calculator, but keep in mind that the difficulty goes up every 10-14 days. Im using this http://www.coolermaster.com/product.php?product_id=6662 . It has 8 pci-e connectors, 1000W and is powering 4 OC 5870 with ease (a total of 805W). It has an efficiency of 90-92% (which is an important factor if you are going to run it 24/7). Its very quiet too, but this is not important in this case with the 4 cards making a lot of noise.Worth the money. I would recomend Russ Roberts from Econtalk (http://www.econtalk.org/). He did a whole podcast on Bitcoin. He is also the co-author of the videos Hayek vs Keynes (Round 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk, Round 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQnarzmTOc) I dont know if you are done with this, but it seems to be a false rumor. I just tested it in my XFX and the 11.6 drivers do NOT allow me to go beyond the bios limits. I just installed Catalyst 11.6 on Linux (Ubuntu 11.04) and my XFX is still limited by BIOS settings. 11.6 does NOT allow me to go beyond bios settings.Ok, I stand corrected. It does work. You can get the GA-890FXA-UD5 that is way cheaper and has 4 long pci-e slots and 2 pci-e x1 slots. Since you are going to have to buy adapters anyway, it does not matter if they have to be x16 to x16 or x1 to x16, and the card is way cheaper. This make absolutely no sense, as I have tried to explain to you. You need to go deeper into keynesian though to understand its flaws. You just took a quick course and took it as faith and that is a problem.Even in the case that you are paying people less, you are also producing cheaper, thus the level of consumption of the people does not get affected. In reality what happens is that because prices are somehow more sticky than other prices, the prices of the goods go down quicker than the wages, thus benefiting the poor people. Keynesianism is the contrary.But this is another problem of keynesianism: not taking into account how the political system works. You can not give power to the government and then when the political system does not act exactly as you have prescribed complain. Politicians have their own self-interest, and if you give them power they will use it, not necesarely how you have prescribed. Maybe the only realistic solution is for the politicians to not have so much power. Not true. The phatk kernel is optimized for the 2.4 SDK. I get better results with phatk + 2.4 than with any other combination. Te aseguro que será en buena luz  So what do you need?
Yeah, I know drivers are always an issue. If it was just a normal update I would not ask for it, but I think not having to flash your cards is worth it. This was actually the only thing that was missing in Linux for mining. Now you can use AMDOverdriveCtrl without stupid limits.Well, one thing is missing in Linux and its being able to read the current and the temperature of the VCC's. RadeonVolt does it, but only for some 5850's. I wish there was a way to do it for 5870's. Nice webpage you got there. Be sure to include your service at: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade They wont accept 0.000025BTC for a t-shirt, they will accept 25 uBTC (microBTC). Sounds much cooler, doesnt it?  I completely agree with you, but this will only be posible when the bitcoin exchange price stabilizes a bit.The stabilization might be happening already, who knows. After the rise up to $30 and the correction back to $20, we might see some stabilization of the price, although we dont know yet because all the last events have been moving the price. When the air clears will see. A banner for the signatures would be great. I would put in mine. Its possible but:1. The USA government is not the government of the world.2. It would be really hard to make people check the bitcoins they get. It would be basically unenforceable. I just read that the new version of the linux Catalyst drivers, the 1.6, lets you overdrive the cards over the bios limits. I dont know if they are included already in Linuxcoin, but if they are not it would be a nice addition since it removes the need to flash the bios of the cards.EDIT: For reference: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19776.msg258398#msg258398 Yeah, BTCGuild got very lucky. But we were coming from a very unlucky rally, so its only fair. I dont think its Ubuntu specific. The user/password part is part of linux (kernel). There is always the option of inflating like hell to save the greeks. In fact, that is exactly what the ECB wanted to do but the european population dont want to pay with higher prices for the mess the greeks got into (which is understandable). But the european politicians and the bankers want to save the greeks so they can keep paying the debts they own.I have always said that the ECB will talk tought to keep the central-european population happy, but at the end of the dayt it will bail out the PIGS no matter how much inflation it has to create. It will talk tough, but it will NOT act tought.Either way, default or inflation, Bitcoin is a very good option. I have met a greek in the OTC chat room. There is an european one: #bitcoin-otc-eu . I am sure you can find someone from Greece there. 1. You still have the OTC market.2. There are ways to hide your bitcoin trail. Pues claro que tiene crediblidad. Pero que salga en un diario económico y en buena luz pues ayudará sin duda. Los mineros en realidad están procesando las transacciones de la red Bitcoin. Sin mineros Bitcoin no funcionaría. Debido a ese trabajo se les recompensa con algunos bitcoins de vez en cuando. Then maybe Jessy Kang idea about closing the Economic subforum is not such a bad idea. I really dont know exactly what but something eneds to be done with this forum. I know. I was thinking about it more like a PR move than anything.I do believe that this forum is not making a great service to Bitcoin. Minear ahora mismo está en un momento delicado. Si la dificultad sigue subiendo como hasta ahora será imposible recuperar el dinero que has invertido en un nuevo equipo. Además está el peligro de que una compañía y otra gente han anunciado chips especializados para Bitcoin que dejarían a las GPU's obsoletas para minear. En teoría llegarán a finales de este año principios del próximo, pero tomatelo con excepticismo porque luego veremos lo que pasa realmente.Yo te diría que si vas a comprar solo la tarjeta gráfica y ponerla en el ordenador que ya tienes, probablemente te salga a cuenta. Si tienes que comprar el equipo para montar el ordenador deberías pensartelo muy mucho. Sobretodo hacer los números bien asumiendo que la dificultad va a seguir subiendo y subiendo. Me ha llegado el rumor de que una publicación económica española está a punto de publicar un artículo sobre Bitcoin.Cuando lo publiquen lo linkearé aquí. Que un medio económico publique sobre Bitcoin en castellano ayudará a darle credibilidad.EDIT: Se acaba de publicar el artículo: http://www.libremercado.com/2011-06-26/el-fenomeno-bitcoin-la-moneda-electronica-de-internet-1276427764/Ya me direis que os parece. PORN.Remember the Internet was made for porn! We need the same for Bitcoin. Once por is onboard the rest will follow.  According to you we are tainting the project... But I guess we should not get offended by that.Anyways, I was thinking on having a sign at the top of the political sections saying that the opinions in the forum are not the ones of Bitcoin (or something like that). Would that help towards PR?EDIT: Btw, I write for a economic publication here in my country (not in english) and always try to write in an understandable and clear way, even when talking about complex monetary issues (my speciality inside economics). I am trying to do something similar in the economics subforum but this forum is too much of a mess to have a nice economic conversation. But it is important to me to explain things in a easy to understand way. People usually use complex words to hide their ignorance or failed theories. I dont think Im more intelligent than anyone else, I trully believe that if you expalin things properly, anyone can understand even the complex issues, if they have the interest. Actually, I spent several coins when they were between $25 and $30. Im very happy about it. Hopefully all this will teach everyone that hoarding bitcoins forever its not such a good idea.
Gold has a lot of industrial uses, just not at these prices. For example, gold is a very good conductor and would be used in electronics a lot if it was dirt cheap. But people value more gold as money than gold as conductor, thus is used as money.I dont know where you are getting this. Bitcoin has been a good store of value. And the long term or short term stable prices I dont even know where you are getting it. I have answered him with respect and education and he has censored my comment. Amazing. I think you are indirectly refering to me and its offensive. I have dedicated a whole post to criticize one aspect of Keynes theory and you have been unable to answer. You have been answering the whole thread with generalizations that dont say anything, that its just like political discourse, and now accuse me of not being able to say something of worth?You dont understand the ideas of Keynes and yet you support them but accuse others of being ilogical. Yes, I have found that AMDOverdriveCtrl lets you go outside the BIOS limits on the lower side, but never on the higher side. Ok. Its ok to not know economics. I am ignorant of a lot of stuff. You should learn more about Keynes theories and you will realize that he is basically wrong, and its not a matter of politic believes. Keynes is just wrong, no matter your political believes. Well, yes and no. You dont need a World Court to have global justice. In fact, you need to not have a World Court to have justice at all. Any centrallized system is created to abuse, and a centrallized court is no different. Different districts or judicial companies can opperate and agree in collaboration and competition and solve the global issues.Regarding problems like acid rain and sulfur emissions, it is true that this are difficult problems to solve, but they are also difficult using other methods. They are difficult because they involve a lot of people. The best way to go about it would be to form associations so people could so together. I was implying that you are pissing on us by basically not answering and saying that Keynes had very good intentions. That is unknown and basically independent of the validity of his theories. I substituted ironically the name by Stalin to prove that your same words could argue that Stalin had very good intentions... You are basically not answering anything, just handwaving.And regarding my previous posts, it basically proves that the idea of slack capacity and lack of demand causing a crisis is wrong. And those are cornerstones of keynesian though. Without them you can not justify all that you are saying. But I get the impression (maybe a wrong impression) that you only know the surface of keynesianism, so you really can not answer. Do you realize you have not say anything? Its just a big handwaving.And you have still not answered me. A lot of the banks went bankrupt during the 1929 crash and the following years. If they caused they are stupid.The Great Depression happened because there was a bubble on the stock market, the bubble that created the roaring 20's. Bubbles always pop. Do you realize that we have governments all over the world and thefts are happening left and right? (In most cases by the same people that has promised to protect you). Very well said. Honestly I feel ofended by your tone here. Tainted? Tainted by what? A ship of unfriendly passengers that is taking on water? Bitcoin is at the moment the most succesful alternative currency of the last 100 or 200 years. That might have something to do with the ideas that founded it (and its ok that you dont understand them, I was a social-democrat until I was 27). Now, it is true that we need more merchants on board and it is true that its going to take some time and efforts. But it is not the politics behind the community that is creating the problem, its the very same nature of the currency. Its the part that you dont really understand about monetary policy (and this is ok, Im ignorant about a lot of stuff, life is short) that is making Bitcoin successful while at the same time is worrying a lot of people at the top. Both things are unseparable.Dont take this the wrong way, but I feel you dont undertand how a currency system works, specially regarding the nature of Bitcoin. A decentralized and pseudo-anonymous fork will have the same problems with the politicians and other critics that Bitcoin has, no matter the political ideas of the people behind it. And if the "fork" is not decentralized (it wont really be a fork then) it will just be another Paypal system, and I dont think there is much market for another competitor. How are you going to make a fork with the characteristics that make Bitcoin great, but at the same time without those same characteristics because it worries some people?At the end, p2p file sharing also worried a lot of people at the top, they fought it, but it is here to stay. Because of its decentralized nature, nobody could fight it. Now everybody listens to more music and the bands have seen more interest for them playing live. But at the begginning a lot of people said it would not work because nobody would go with it. Bitcoin is the same and has the potential to bring a new era of trade and welfare for everybody.You might not want to take the lead in some market, thats understandable and completely fine, but keep in mind that being the first business to operate in a new market gives you a name recognition that is a lot of times an unbeatable advantage (just check MtGox). You might not be willing to take the flag that might come your way (and again its fine, its your decission) but the person that do, will be in a great position. I have a friendly prediction for you: In the future you will regret not jumping onboard and be the first business in your sector that opens to the Bitcoin economy. Jessy Kang, I liked your threads around the forum, but I think you are wrong on this one. Just for the record, I, as a market anarchist, was supporting that the bitcoin exchanges should be and actively look to be regulated (here and here) Im a market anarchist but I am pragmatical and aware of the world we live in.Bitcoin needs the political influence, otherwise it will loose all credibility. Why? Its very simple.Bitcoin, as we all know is a decentralized currency, and the implementations of the rules rely on the majority of the network. If a big majority of the people using Bitcoin changed the rules the rules would change or at least there would be a fork and two different Bitcoin currencies, the one with the new rules and the old one. We have seen already in the forum people and crancks with weird ideas about currencies saying or even demanding that the Bitcoin protocol should be changed or otherwise it will never work (according to their more or less lunatic economic theories). If the Bitcoin project looses its heart, the sound money influence, and a majority changes its rules towards a more inflationary currency Bitcoin will start to decline until it collapses. The funny thing with inflation is that it produces a long term destruction process that its not obvious initially, so people not well versed in economics or without personal experience in a inflationary collapse, go along with it and dont realize what they have done until the collapse is happening.If we do what you are asking Bitcoin is probably doomed.Now, you are right in one thing: This forums are bad PR for the Bitcoin project. But it is not because of libertarianism. I have the same opinion that the forums are not right. For me its two factors: the afluence of people only interested in getting rich quick and a massive attack of trolls. Go check the forums when Bitcoin was starting. I was there and I can tell you it was much more civil. Now the forum lives on histeria, its even stressing. I believe that the trolls are doing their job mocking everybody, confusing people and basically getting everyone angry. This tension is transmited and we start talking to each other more aggressively. Its not good. I myself am guilty of this, and regret the tone of some comentaries I have made lately.We agree something needs to be done. In my opinion the forum deseperately needs more moderation. Specially not allowing anyone to start new threads with similar tematic as another (basically if anyone starts a redundant thread just join it together with the original one). We need to regain the civil discourse that we had at the begginning. This way people will be much more calm and the way they expose their ideas will be more paleatable to other people. I dont think he is talking about completely abolishing property rights. He is proably talking about some form of "weak" property rights, like right of exclusive use or similar. This is just a troll. Ok. So I finally got things working with LinuxCoin with persistance in my test computer. But when I rebooted my mining rig into LinuxCoin it started to load it and then hang with a black screen.Is there a problem with installing LinuxCoin in one computer with a determined hardware and then move it to a computer with different hardware? The currency is unstable because it is a small market. Look at any small market and you will see similar stuff. It hardly has to do with being open 24hours a day.But maybe I am wrong and you are right. If you really feel like a non 24hr exchange market is the way to go you can open one and maybe you will find out that a lot of people think like you and will use your service. CSS might not have complex syntax, but it is boring and over-engineered as hell. In addition to what bitcoin4cash has linked I want to point that when pollution started to be an issue in the USa people naturally went to the courts to sue the ones that were polluting their property. And the courts where handeling it. Its common sense. But the government got in the middle, took away the environmental property rights from the people, promising it would regulate and take care of it. The regulatory system has obviously lead to a corporate takeover. If environmental property rights were applied the BP gulf oil fiasco would have never happened (and even in the case it would have happened BP woold be bankrupt now and the people compensated). USWest is not working for me. I had to change to USCentral.I seem to choose the server that will fail next. I was in UK first and it went down, changed to NL1, and then when it starti failing changed to USWest, which is the one failing now... So proabably the next one failing is USCentral. You have been advised...
Sorry to hear that. You are right, but we live in the world we live. I dont think there are other options. Governments are going to get into Bitcoin related companies whether we like it or not. Its not a choice, its just a matter of how and when, so you might as well look for the best "deal" (and yes, its going to be nasty and governments are not going to play "fair").Lets be realistic: One exchange going heroic and figthing against the system is not going to acomplish anything. Probably its going to be contraproductive because it will give bad press to bitcoins. Let them regulate the exchange so people have a easy way to get into bitcoins and we can fight the system from within. I am a market anarchist but I think its good that they want regulation of the exchanges. How can that be? Some people will distrust bitcoins, and some others will try to attack it. By seeking to be regulated they are shielding themselves from this types of attacks. Also, its not like the governments were going to let them be. Governments were going to go for them anyways at some points, so you must as well do it on your own. And remember that Bitcoin is imposible to regulate, they are just regulating the exchanges.Btw, I am still shocked that Peter used the concept of intrinsic value when he knows very well instrinsic value does not exist. I know. There are a couple more fuck ups in that video. But that is what you get for watching mainstream media. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtDUQYUh-vUAnd a bit of FUD from the government tv CNBC:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCy6mw39nrA Why do you need to format from windows? Why not use unetbootin from linux also? Ok, this thread is officially retarded. Enjoy. Ok, stop pissing off and be honest. The dollar is only accepted because the USA government imposes it by force. Ive seen enough of this. IOm done. Go and start your own currency. Is this a joke? Inflationary currencies are being accepted because the government forces them.The USA had three central banks before the Fed. Everytime they lost the monopoly on money imposed by the government and they tried to stay in business they went bankrupt. Dont tell me that people accept inflation voluntarely, people are forced to accept inflation.Yes there is, because people know that this currency will lost value if they hold it so they will just drop it until nobody accepts it. The only way for an inflationary currency to work is impose it using violence. But please, start your own currency and prove me wrong. Being an influence of Keynes is nothing to be proud of, on the contrary. They would be worthless because there would be no demand for them, regardless of their number. But please, prove me wrong. Start your own currency. You can and its very easy. Attracting people will take time as it did with Bitcoin. But its doable. Do it and prove me wrong. Start your own currency. And Peter Schiff calls himself an austrian? Intrinsic value Peter? Really? Aral with all my heart I implore you to leave Gessell aside and study real economics.With your system bitcoins would become worthless and nobody would use them. They would not circulate because nobody would accept them. But you odnt have to believe me. Go and start your own currency. Its a small change in the code, its very easy. Go and do it. I have 3 GPU's (and one more pending to add) with a Sempron 140 locked to one core and its running fine and dandy. You can use AMDOverdriveCtrl headless. Basically you create on your own or use the GUI to create a config file, edit the config file how you like it and then:Code:AMDOverdriveCtrl -i 0 -b device0.ovdrThe device with id 0 gets configured with the parameters in the file device0.ovdr, including the fan temperature to fan speed curves. My 3 miners are pointing there and working fine. Exactly. Not to mention that basically bitcoins would be worthless and would disappear since nobody would want to hold them. Why hold bitcons when they devalue in time, when you can hold gold or silver. Its fucking retarded.I hope this guy starts this new currency so he realizes for himself what happens. You and everybody else. The state of the forum is sad, but I think this thread is a new low. +1 Please go and start your currency. AngelusWebDesign calm down for god sake.These type of events have happened in the stock market and in other dollar denominated platform and the answer has always been to undo them. It was not a client doing them, which would have been fine, but some hacker. This has happened in other markets and it was not such a big deal. Calm down. Nl1 (nl.btcguild.com) is not working propperly. It leaves the miners idle most of the time.
Are you trolling me? You first said that politicians and bankers did not removed gold as money and now you say the did.This does not make sense from an economic point of view. The nominal value of money is arbitrary. Oh come on. You are now pissing on us.Yes, the kings tried and sometimes got away with devaluating the purity of the coins. So what? This is false. The Balcksmiths started loaning the money in fractional reserve system with the knowledge of their clients. Previous to fractional reserve the blacksmith were not paying interest buy charging a fee. Suddenly the blacksmith starts paying interest instead of paying a fee, and people dont even question why he is paying interest now and where does he get the money? It makes no sense.Gold has not failed as a currency. Gold was removed slowly from the monetary field by politicians and bankers because it didnt allow them to inflate the currency as they wanted. But gold as currency has not failed. Define people hold back money.What people usually mean by this is that people dont spend and consume. But when people saves, they send the money to the bank, that loan it out through fractional reserve banking, thus promoting investment and (usually) creating growth. So by not consuming and saving more growth is created.This does not say much about the theory. I have read the same point several times.You are basically saying that the more the money circulates the more rich everybody is, which is obviously false. Its a common falacy. I dont want to come as aggressive, sorry if you got that impression, its just that one gets tired of hearing the same failed theories again and again. Fail.Stopped reading here.This would force people out of BTC since nobody would trust it. By a crash I mean that a lot of people are going to realize that their investment in computer hardware has not been profitable and that hey are never going to recover the money they invested in it. Also true.But I really think people dont realize what Bitcoin and this community has achieved. Think about it: Bitcoin is the first alternative currency that some hackers deem valuable enough to try to hack it and even create a virus for it. No other currency had been able to compete with the dollar and "achieve" this. Stop a second and think about it. Its amazing what we have acomplished. There is still a lot to do in front of us, specially creating business in the Bitcoin economy, but if you stop for a moment t think about it its actually unveliable. I would have never imagine that Bitcoin would be where it is now a year ago. Agreed. People is going to keep adding capacity until there is a big crash in mining.I have. Never have been scammed in bitcoins. I have been scammed in pounds and in euros.This is not an issue. The websites actualize prices automatically. Its really only a couple of lines of php. That would be too easy for Satoshi.   So people wanted Bitcoin to compete with the dollar? Well, Bitcoin has attracted so much attention that one of its main trade websites has been hacked. Until yesterday the only trade places that had attracted attention and had been hacked in the USA operated in dollars. F.e. Citygroup was hacked two weeks ago (and as MtGox tried to keep it secret): http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43335996/ns/business-personal_finance/t/thousands-citi-customers-risk-after-hacker-attack/So yesterday events are another small step of Bitcoin towards competing with the dollar.PS: This is obviously true, but its also half a joke. I have not traded in MtGox and I dont think I will at least any time soon. I personally hope that people move to other exchanges and create enoug liquidity there so they become a viable option. This. I was not trading before and I wont be trading after. This is exactly my fear. The panic happened in the previous "cycle" and now people have learned that if they hold and let others stop it will be fine, like your post shows. So everybody is expecting the same result as previous cycles, so everybody keeps adding more capacity...This is only one reason on why it could go in a different way as in the past. Previous gains dont guarantee future gains. MtGox credibility is going down quickly and I dont believe that statement. Its basically a leap of faith because they offered no proof. I think that its way more probable that difficulty stops going up so quick than the price going up.The last events (for lack of better name) are not going to do good to the Bitcoin economy. Also, the rise in price atracted people that were interested just in earning money by mining and not in developing the Bitcoin economy, therefore this people want to cash out and wont let the price of bitcoins in dollars rise too much. Passing through this will take time and a lot of demand. Long term bitcoin is bullish, but short term not so much.Right now we are in a critical moment for mining. Trading websites have been hacked. They have reverted the trades, and nothing big has happened. I dont see why it would be very different in this case. Hopefully this will make people go towards more serious exchanges. I bet that computer is not very profitable in regard to consumption MHas/J though. People here is not that extreme. With the MtGox debacle a whole legion of trolls appeared in the forum creating amplifying the whole thing and creating the appearance of histeria. Beware of the trolls. Dont believe everything you read. Yes, and having an honest and omnipotent politician would make government viable.The problem is that neither of those exist, and that is why you want decentralization. You can use AMCOverdriveCtrl from the command line using configuration files. Use the option -b.
What people is speculating is that to avoid the $1000 limit of MtGox he sold to drop the price to 0.01 so he could remove as many bitcoins as he could. Are you going to address my points then? Its not regulating. Its a private business deciding what to do. He just has to fulfill the contract with his costumers.On the other hand, the costumers are free to change business and take their business elsewhere. Honestly, after this, anyone using MtGox deserve what he/she gets. Yeah, quick rounds are a bitch for the people who does not have a tons of MH/s If that does not sound as keynesianism to you, then you should learn keynesianism, because Keynes was the figure that introduced aggregates into the economic theory.I would answer what you have stated because its wrong, but I dont think you know enough about keynesianism and are just following some "talking points" instead of understanding what keynesianism is. The trolls are at full swing with this. Beware the trolls. Troll. Why would anyone sell 261.000 bitcoins for 1 cent instead of cashing out slowly? Makes absolutely no sense. Do you ship to Europe? What price? I might take this offer if you do. I have switched my miners towards nl2 to get load out of the others. Now the Last Share stat does not work. It shows always 1s. The Shares (Stale) stats seems to be working. Economics is just too broad subject, I was giving you the upper hand by letting you choose an area.You want me to choose: Aggregates. This is one of the big fuck ups of keynesianism. It leads to the idea that the crisis are created by lack of demand and the idea of slack capacity, which is basically nonsense.The idea that the present crisis has been caused by a lack of demand (as keynesians like Krugman have said) is evidently wrong. The USA had a wrong sturcture of production, basically producing too many houses and sectors that gravitated around the housing bubble. The fact that the demand fo rhouses has decreased is a good thing and does not mean that the general demand (such thing is a concept, it really does not exists) has fallen. What its happening is that the demand is re-arranging for what the people really need and want. The problem is the productive capacity is not producing those types of goods (it has capacity to produce too many houses). The demand and the supply are descoordinated.There is not slack capacity. There is basically malinvestments that need to be purged. If you believe there is slack capacity you bascially believe that you need to keep building more houses (and asociate industries), because that is the type of capacity that exists. You are very clear. And you have this detail wrong, although it does not change the big picutre of what you are saying. Banks lend the money out first and then look for money of the Fed to keep the ratios. So the money is lent first by the banks, and later on the Fed creates the money to cover the operations, not the other way around.I still dont understand what it has to do with the labour theory of value. Austrian economics is only descriptive and with some capability of prediction, like any other science its amoral. Recognizing the morality or inmorality of some arrengement is not the task of austrian economics, the same way recognizing the morality or inmorality of an arrengement is not the task of physics or medicine. Science should describe an arrangement and predit its results. The task of saying if it is moral or inmoral belongs to morality/politics/philosophy. What part of economics are you interested on discussing?Here you have answered in American. In European "Social Democracy" is something else entirely, I don't think it's currently possible to articulate the concept in American.[/quote]Im from Europe. I was talking about the general concept of social-democray. Social-democray is corporatism. My main doubt is what has the Labor theory of value to do with all this?There are a couple of things:Central banks dont try to control price inflation, one of their tasks is to create price inflation, usually with a target of 2%.Its the other way around. Banks lend out the money first, and later on the Fed creates it to cover the banks. Yes, I think. I can explain you logically why keynesianism does not work and the main points why keynesiansim is wrong.Social-democracy is just a kind facade for corporatism, so yes, I think its pretty accurate to say that a big part of the USA democrats are social-democrats.Social-democracy just increases the power of the political elites and their allies, increases the gap between rich and poor, diminishes the standards of living, and usually tend to collapse or degenerate promoting warmongers to government. To overclock in Linux is better to use AMDOverdriveCtrl. Google it. Ron Paul does not deny evolution. Your opinion is probably based on a manipulated youtube video. I recommend that you go and find the complete version of the video. Ron Paul is saying that evolution happens but that there had to be an initial point for live and he believe god did it. He is religious and believes what many religious person do, including f.e. Obama (who believes exaclty the same as Ron Paul in this issue). Generalizing much?But Liberal in the USA does not mean the same as it means in the rest of the world or what it used to mean in the USA. Liberal in the USA is basically social-democrat while european liberals oppose social-democracy. If you want to refer to real liberalism in the USA you have to use classic liberal, as opposed to progressive liberal. This happened because duting the last part of the XIX century begginning of the XX the progressive movement highjacked the Democrat party, that was liberal (supporting free markets and individual liberty) and changed its program. But the word liberal stuck, thus chaning the meaning in the USA.
Ron Pauls supports net neutrality, that menas he is against the law with the orwellian title of Net Neutrality. That law is nothing else that the government starting to regulate the internet and anyone supporting net neutrality should oppose it. Not necesarely. A lot of people dont have the knowledge or can not be bothered going into mining, so even if mining is more profitable at some point they will be buying. In the same way, even when buying is the most profitable option people can make long term plan and decide to go mining. In reality, nobody knows what will be more profitable, mining or buying. All people do is decide whether mining or buying is more profitable under the present circusntamces, but nobody knows what will be the future circumpstances so in reality nobody knows what the answer is. Its not as simple as you are painting it. Mining is profitable right now if you have the initial investment paid. But if you expect to get the initial investment back that is another issue. You should not ask age, gender and how many bitcoins someone owns. I understand your commercial interest but I will not answer those type of questios. I left the first option on all those questions and answered the rest. I value more a bitcoin in 5 years than anything a bitcoin can get me now.EDIT: Actually its not true, since I have used my bitcoins to buy several stuff, but it sounded cool.   Can you tell us your rig and your Kwh rate? That is a "risky" prediction given that some company has already announced they will have them in September-October. Although in this kind of projects, delays are the norm not the exception. You are confused. That is the best part of sex.  They will throw you in jail. What a relief... Haz una cuenta en otra pool y "minea" allí hasta que slush vuelva a funcionar. Nice handwaving. But it means the car designers and car marketing guys have a hell of a task in front of them. Ron Paul has introduced laws to remove the monopolly on money from the Fed and allow competition of currencies, so yeah. Just a suggestion: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper You will like it. No, AMDOverdriveCtrl is a front end for the AMD ADL library (which I suspect is the same one aticonfig uses). If your card bios is limited no tool in linux will help you. You need to flash the bios if you want to go further. And to do that you need to do it in windows. Once the card is flashed you can go back to linux. The point of the ASIC's is lower consumption. How can a 7XXX compete with a device that consumes 10 times less energy for the same bitcoins? ASIC's will make GPU mining obsolete. And dont forget about how monetary inflation affects investment and the capital structure, thus changing production, that will end up affecting the prices as well. 1. Backing Bitcoin would require a central authority and being decentralized is one of the key characterisitcs of Bitcoin. Without decentralization Bitcoin would loose value, not gain it.2. If you still think its a good idea, you can go and start goldcoins, silvercoins, ricecoins or dollarcoins. Let the market decide which one it prefers. But I would take a good look at what happened to Liberty Dollars.Bitcoins also have some physical unique properties. It "backs" itself, as its price its showing. http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19144.msg241480#msg241480 Im just speculating here, but the limitations AMD introduced for windows are probably due to limitations on windows, and not done on porpouse. It does not make any sense to limit to 4 cards in windows and allow 8 in linux, and then force the use of dummy plugs in windows but not in linux. I find it hard to believe that AMD is doing that on porpouse, I dont see any reason, so its probably due to some limitation of the OS.
AMDOverdriveCtrl It depends on the demand for bitcoins as well. If the demand is weak, the price wont go up no matter what the miners do. Nobody has mentioned yet the risk of the ASIC that different groups have announced for the end of this year begginning of the next one. When that hardware is ready your GPU wont be able to compete and will be an obsolte investment. And the prodcution is halving every 18 days because of the increase of difficulty. If you are not able to break even under those conditions by the end of the year, you should think very carefully what you are doing, otherwise you are going to loose money since you wont be able to keep your GPU generating (profitably).There is only two things that can change to make mining profitable. 1) The difficulty stops growing so much giving miners some room to get more bitcoins. 2) The price rises consierably, to $30 and beyond.(This part is speculation obviuosly) Regarding 2) I dont see that happening for a long time, probably until 2012 because the initial rush because of the press has happened and there is a lot of people looking to unload in the $20 range and beyond. It will take time and a lot of demand to break that resistance. Also, the kind of people the rush has attracted to Bitcoin is not people looking to improve the Bitcoin economy, but a lot of those are looking for a quick and easy way of making money, so when the price rises to those levels they will sell.Regarding 1) is the part that I see more posible to change. I still dont understand how anyone can be buying dedicated miners at this point, so it makes sense to me that at some point not so much capacity will be added to the network and the difficulty will stop growing so much. I really dont understand some people that are buying and buying GPU's right now. What are they going to do with their 50+ gpu farms when the ASIC chips make their hardware obsolete? The second hand market wont be abel to absord so many gpu's going on sale all together. But again, its not guranateed that the difficulty will grow slower, for all we know it could grow even faster. But I think its more probable that we see the difficluty slowing than the price rising a lot in the rest of 2011.But anyone has to keep in mind that if there is not a big change in the difficulty trend or in the price, buying a dedicated miner right now is NOT profitable, you wont break even. Anyone can do the math. Mining is not fine. We are in a very delicate moment. If you are using Linux try AMDOverdriveCtrl. I could set the voltage lower at those speeds, so you have less consumption and less heat. This video by George Selgin about the record of the Fed compares data from the XIX century when USA had no Federal Reserve with the data of the XX century with the Federal Reserve, focusing on production and stability of production (the cycle). Highly recomended.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLynuQebyUM Have you tried going down to 335? A lot of people here (including me) have gotten the 5870 to 335 -333 without affecting hashing speed. What about voltage? You are allowed to troll because you entertain us, but dont dare mocking productive members of the bitcoin community. I cashed some out (like 50 bitcoins) ... to buy a mining rig.  So it all stays "home".I have also bought things with bitcoins and given some tips. Im using a 1000W one with 8 pci-e, but you dont need it to have the 8 pci-e. You can use one with 6pci-e and use 2 molex adaptares. The cards come with one each. What it needs is a moderator to send all the threads of sell sell sell and buy buy buy to the trading section or wherever. I have a system very similar to yours and pulling 800W. It depends on how you overclick obviously. I have set the voltage down a bit and the memory clock down a lot, while the gpu up a lot. Well said.  Was this written to scare someone? If it was, you failed. Probability is funny like that. I still find that it is counter-intuitive. Decissions are always taken by the emotional part of the brain. Without emotions we would be unable to make any decission. This is neurology. Emotions are not a bad thing, on the contrary, are a good thing. But some people are more emotionally capable than others.Sorry, but you said nothing. You said that you want one and the other. If I am not mistaken bitcoin probability is independent from round to round. Why the dollar? The dollar is doomed. We should link bitcoins to the euro. Or the chilenan peso.  HiIm trying to get LinuxCoin working but I am failing. This is what I do:(Im basically following this instructions: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=7374.msg136868#msg136868- From Ubuntu, I create a 1Gb FAT partition on my USB and leave the rest unformated.- Using unetbootin I install LinuxCoin in that partition.- Reboot into LinuxCoin.- This order: "fdisk /dev/sdb" ask me to reboot again with a warning about some DOS something being deprecated. I suspect it has to do with the format, because this info is different for me:This is the example:My System is FAT32 instead of Linux. If I try to run the next order it fails.- I reboot again into LinuxCoin and "mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2 -L live-rw" now works.- Reboot again per instructions, check if persitence works by saving a file in the Desktop and resbooting. It does not.Any idea? Murphy's law: If you would have gone solo, you would have not founded them.
What's the MHash/J of the 6990? 1. I doubt anyone becomes a tycoon by throwing money away.2. I highly doubt anyone could buy all the bitcoins even if he wanted to and accepted the incredibly high prices that it would have to suffer as supply disappears.3. Ignoring that its not a realistic scenario, what is the point of this speculation? You being paranoid does not mean they are not after you.  It sounds like you should defend the free market then. The hit pieces are getting bolder. I can smell the fear from here. Human milk is animal milk. Im getting stable speed of 441Mh/s on a 5870 using a pci-e x1 to x16 extender (the extender has a molex to get the energy from the PS directly and not from the motherboard, got it at cablesaurius). Those might be the drivers at this point, as libertarians ideals and geek interest were the drivers when bitcoin was just an idea. But when/if the Bitcoin economy develops due to those drivers, Bitcoin will become a very real and efficient way of sending money around the world and as it grows more merchants will see the utility of accepting it. Yes, an attacker could see that you transfered money from one account (the "rich" one) to the day to day account, so what? It would be extremelly difficult for him to attack you just in the precise moment you fire up your computer with the USB and the minute you need to transfer funds to your day to day account to use them. Specially since he/she has no idea when are you going to do it and it could be months or years for you to use that USB. And then he would have to detect the new computer, find out the operating system  and hack it in a few minutes. And if you are very paranoic you could to it in your neightbour computer that has a different internet conexion.There is no system 100% secure, not even the network at the Pentagon, but the odds of someone fucking you if you do this are very very low. Without private property people are still greedy.For example, if you choose to decide everything in an assembly, apart from being poverty exploitation because its so inefficient you are condenming everybody to be poor, the more rethorical and politcally skilled will do better than the rest. Its political darwinism. So you will still have greed.PS: Btw, a system of assemblies still needs to have property divissions for the different assemblies, unles you are decided to condemn all humanity to starve to death by having a unique world assembly. Whose talking about laundering money? I am just talking about securing your bitcoins.1. Security copies are a must, and that is independently of anything else. You can use this USB method and still have your wallet saved in other way or even encryupted in some online storage service.2. Yes, if they break into your home they can steal you from you. You might want to have your bitcoins somewhere sfe. Its always a trade off of security vs commodity vs cost of keep it secure. But this is true for any kind of money, not only Bitcoin. I bet you pussycoins would go higher than gold in a couple of months.  Dambisa Moyo's book "Dead aid" is very good in this respect.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFABdPOpr2AAnd she is hot.   It depends on the card manufacturer. I had a Asus 5870 that allowed me to go to 1200Mhz core speed without wihout flahsing (in reality I could not go over 1010 without the card becoming unstable). And then I had a XFX 5870 that only allowed me to go to 900Mhz core speed, and had to flash it. They did not agree on it. USA had the industry intact and the military might to impose the dollar as reserve currency while Europe was devasted. In fact, the USA government had been trying to impose the dollar on other countries for decades, from late XIX century, early XX century. It all started with the progressive movement when they created the american imperialist mentality. Their moto was: "Extend democracy over the world". The USA imposed the dollar on Mexico, Cuba, Philiphines and more. They even tried to impose the dollar in China but failed. Most of this efforst were supported by military actions, basically totally or partially invading those countries.So at the end of the IWW the USA government and the interests around it saw the perfect oportunity and imposed the dollar in the world. There is a reason why the USA has military bases all over the world.Thinking that the rest of the countries agreed to use the dollar is extremely naive. In fact, most of the countries have complained about the dollar as rserve currency, but at the end nobody dares to do nothing about it. Corporate world is just an expression. Promoting USB memory sticks with a linux OS and a bitcoin wallet is better idea.You have two wallets, the day to day one in your normal computer and the "rich" one, with most of your funds in the USB. When you want to transfer funds from the "rich" wallet you turn off the computer, insert the USB and turn on the computer so it loads the OS from the USB. Then you transfer the funds, close the computer and remove the USB. Bitcoin is a community not a company, but marketing wise it would be a good idea to look at some ideas from the corporate world on how to handle different issues. The attacks on Bitcoin are getting anoying. Hahah, trolls are getting certainly creative.PS: Just in the 0.1% chance you are for real, you didnt cause any problem, I was just curious. Thats hardly centralization. More like speciallization and it makes sense. Less electricity for the same task.
Buying a AMD card instead of a Nvidia card so you can mine makes all the sense. Buying more cards to mine is up to you. Do the numbers, electricity cost vs expected difficulty and bitcoin exchange price. Bitcoin difficulty went up around 50% recenlty after only 8 days since the previous rise. Now it seems there is going to be another rise of around 50% in 10 days and that could get higher if more mining power is added to the network. 2-3 months ago the answer was mining. Right now it seems the answer is trading. Buying new mining rigs is getting incredibly risky, since the competition is crahing the margins at alarming rate. Also, you have all this talk about fpga's and dedicated bitcoin mining chips coming soon, which would basiclly render any hardware bought now obsolete for bitcoin mining. Bitcoin price depends on supply and demand. There will be price deflation if the demand for bitcoins goes up more than the supply. Since the suply of bitcoins is very limited and will be more and more limited as time goes by, IF the Bitcoin economy develops thus increasing the demand for bitcoins, it is expected that bitcoins will be price deflationary. But it is not a given. And certainly it is not a short term process. +1 I agree that is the dynamics of Bitcoin mining, but I fail to see how it is a Tragedy of the Common. That miners become more efficient is a desirable outcome. Let them give you a way to buy cheaper bitcoins. If this were the case, why would you complain? Why do I get the impression that some people think that saying something has subjective value means its less important and saying it has objective or absolute value makes it more important? For me it would be the other way around if objective/absolute value even existed. Subjective value is not a less important value, its the only one, but if something else existed, subjective value would be the most important because its what we humans need and want. What can be more important than that? What kind of value could be more important than subjective value if some other type of value existed? I also wonder why they dont redirect. Do you think the dollar is a failure?Well, there has been thefts in dollars for values order of magnitude higher than the Bitcoin theft. It just happens that th peress has given a lot of publicity to the Bitcoin one, while it almost never reports the numerous dollar thefts.So do you think the dollar is a failure? (I do, but for other reasons). It was RBE: http://www.techpowerup.com/rbe/ Just follow the official tutorial, its all explained. How do you know the coins were really robbed? I actually believe that they were robbed but how can you be sure so as to try to organize a blockade on somones money? I just solved it this morning. I used SBE and winbios (or something like that) to get the bios from the Asus, copy the limitations, then mix the limitations of the ASUS with the bios of the XFX and reflashing the XFX. Works like a charm. This depends on the software you are using to mine. F.e. poclmb goes better with 2.1 and phatk goes better with 2.4. I get better results with phatk+2.4 than any other combination. Yes, government is there to protect you, specifically you. The politicians of your country went to bed yesterday thinking in ways of making your life easier. Good luck. Well, not all the cases were like this, although this you explain would not surpirse me. But some places their own governments were fucking the people and the multinationals just went there to get cheap labour.This you are describing is what happens in a social-democracy. Political darwinism. In social-democracy the people with money can and do use it to screew the poor and the middle classes. If the government can not intervene or directly there is no government it can not happen.You need a reality check and a history lesson. How? Are you saying then that the change is real and not due to sherenigans because of the difficulty change. If so, what has caused that rise and fall?I had never GPU mined until one week ago. Quite low, never over 60º. Its getting hot here too but I run it without a case in a room with two windows open and a 20W fan next to the whole thing. Here you go:Adapter 0 - ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    995           335             Current Peak :    995           335  Configurable Peak Range : [600-1200]     [335-1400]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 1 - ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    1005           335             Current Peak :    1005           335  Configurable Peak Range : [600-1200]     [335-1400]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 2 - ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    1005           335             Current Peak :    1005           335  Configurable Peak Range : [600-1200]     [335-1400]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 0 - ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 55.50 CAdapter 1 - ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 56.00 CAdapter 2 - ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 56.50 CVoltages are (0)1.070, (1)1.072 and (2)1.070.I will post pictures of the whole thing when I  get the fourth.EDIT: The fasn are running at 95% (dont like to run them at 100%) and if I turn the big fan off the temperature raises like 10º, never over 70º, although the fan has been always on when it has been hot. Actually, the big fan is on for the rest of the parts of the card that seem to run very hot. Does anyone know how to access the rest of temperature sensors of the 5870 from linux? Thinking about it I think that at 1005Mhz if I pushed the voltage higher it would run for a while and then crash. You might want to test at 995, 1000 or even 1005 at lower voltages, like 1.070v for me. At 1010Mhz and 1015Mhz it would run for a while but there was no way of making it stable. Also, by lowering the voltage you get better consumption theoretically.If this does not work its very weird because I could have gotten a couple of mega-asus, but Im almost in the same situation with the XFX. Im setting it with AMDOverdriveCtrl.
Hi, its weird. Im using Ubuntu 11.04 with SDK2.4 phoenix/phatk. I have 2 Asus 5870 with 1005Mhz core and 335Mhz memory with 1.070V (one needs 1.072V) and they have been running fine for 3 or 4 days now. Today I got an XFX 5870, had to flash it with the Asus limits because it would not allow to go over 900Mhz by default. Now its running with core at 995Mhz and memory at 335Mhz with 1.070V and it has been there for a couple of hours without a problem. I pretend to push it to 1005Mhz slowly.I understand some differences from different vendors, but needing 1.250v to get 975Mhz seems too big of a difference.EDIT: One on the Asus was taking care of the screen (with Gnome-Unity) and it was fine. Now the XFX is taking care of it, but I dont think it makes an impact, I mainly use it through ssh and the screen is off all the time. Is there an advantage of using traditional gnome from unity while mining? Why do you have the voltage at 1.250v? Is your 5870 unstable with less voltage at 975MHz? Ok, my bad. If some mod see this just delete. Computational power of the Bitcoin network, green 1 day stimate:Closer, green 8 hour estimate:Does anyone know where the spike of computational power came and why its going down? It might be random but there is the overloading in USA central and weve been almost 4 hours without finding a block. This. Maybe if you are running it with pci-e extender with a molex from the PSU it could work. Well, this is a bit naive. What the USA has prove around the world is that you dont need to back up your money with gold if you have the biggest army. The USA government did not imposed the dollars only through lies and faith... I have two Asus 5870 and the memory can go as low as 200Mhz with AMDOverdriveCtrl. The sweet spot for me is 335Mhz. But I just got a XFX 8750 and while I can get the memory to 335Mhz, it wont allow to push the core speed more than 900Mhz. It depends on the vendor. Yes, the interventionists are ignorant. Thats not news. But my point is that libertarians should not defend sweatshops just because interentionists attac them. We should denounce violations of individual rights when we see them, no matter whos side that puts us on. I think too hard working is a good thing. It keeps you straight.But how would have your ancestors felt if the government would have taken their land? That is a violation of their property rights and has nothing to do with your ancestors being lazy. The problem is that this is not true. The bankers adquired control of the money supply through government intervention. Some times the government intervention meant imposing some kind of gold standard (never a free market gold standard, and btw I dont support the gold standard). In the free market the bankers never managed to control the physical gold. They used all kind of regulations to control the money supply, sometimes under the name of godl standard.The problem with the idea of "gold standard" is that it can refer to may systems who are completely different from each other, just because they have some kind of relation to gold. But, f.e. Bretton Woods, a "gold standard", is more similar to the present system, than to a gold based free banking system, that could be called a gold standard too. In reality, "gold standard" means nothing and everything because each person refers to a different thing by it. Yes, but this is not the case. And I agree that denouncing industrialization of those countries is stupid, but a real libertarian would denounce the violation of the individual rights of those people that foced them to accept those conditions.Also, in a free market there would be much more welfare (in the sense of people enjoying a better standard of living) and hiring people for those jobs would be more difficult, promoting automatization of those kind of jobs, or higher wages for the ones that needed a human. +1Or point to that telecommunications company at France whose employees sucided a lot too. I guess social-democracy does not work as proven by France...   While it is certainly better to work on a factory than being forced to prostitute or die of hunger, the problem is taht the sweatshops are not a product of free market. In the majority of those countries there is no respect for property rights, the governments have confiscated big parts of the land and distributed among a few people. This situation sends the majority of the people into poverty and forces them to sell their labor cheaper than they would in a free market. By removing all their options they take their bargaining power for better wages.It is true that girls working at sweatchops statistically get schooled more and get independent quicker than the ones that reamin in the country side, but again, this does not mean that they could not be in a better position if the governments would not have violated their individulal rights so they had better bargaining power, or maybe even save and start their own business. Ok, you are right. But I did not insult you. The thing is that I believed the nutjob because his movies are very well done and seem very real to someone not educated enough in economic and economic history. He sells you a dream and then become uncritical to him becose you get addicted to that dream. I felt so ashamed when I started reading economic history books that I just cant understand if the guy is very dishonest and has an agenda or he is really a complete nutjob. Its confusing people with stupid ideas and stopping real change. Please read a real history book.Who knows? maybe the southern states would have get independent as its their right under the constitution of the USA. Maybe the slaves would have been freed like in Europe by paying the slave owners, which would have been cheaper than the war and would have avoided a lot of deaths.Btw, why The Money Masters does not explain how Lincoln passed the National Banks Act at the end of the civil war which centrallized the credit around teh big banks of New York? Because it does not bode well with the nutjob wanting to promote Lincoln as an anti-banker and insinuating his death was because he opposed the bankers, when in reality Lincoln gave them control of the credit. No, a nutjob is a nutjob. There is people I disagree with who are not nutjobs. Bill Still is a nutjob. I am still ashamed that I believed tThe Money Masters when I saw it. Im glad I decided to learn more about central banking and started reading history books about it so I could learn what really happened and the lies that are on his videos. Believe it or not I understand the feelign of enlightment you get after watching those videos. I went through the same. The problem is that its false, and if you read some history books you would realize.I already asnwered to this. Its amazing the capacity of this videos of making people incapable of logical thinking. Let me quote myself:The debt in the present system does NOT come from savings. Please take a moment to understand this. It comes from the banks enjoying the monopoly on credit that the government has granted them. Please read and try to use the logical part of your brain. Forget about the stupid dream the charlatan has sold you and use your rationallity.Another fallacy promoted by the nutjob. You could pay a debt of $11.000 with only $10.000 in the money supply because money circulates. Lack of money is not why credit crunches happen. You are learning stupid ideas from the nutjob.Well, you are making some sense here, but its not that simple. First, the gold was not confiscated by the bankers, Roosevelt did it. Second, he could not remove the gold standard because it would have created big distrust towards the dollar and heavy price inflation. Back then the gold standard was not a free market system, but a government regulated gold standard, usually called the gold-exchange, and the politicans and the finantial elites were beneifting from it so they wanted to keep it. But in reality as you say it was all a sham because they end up devaluating the dollar so they could keep printing. Its funny how governments always use inflation to pay for wars and yet some keep defending it. It will be use for good, it will be used for good. They are sold a dream and loose the habitility of thinking critically. Ok, you follow the nutjob. That movie is pure nonsense and the peole who follow him become ilogical. I have dealt with the few of you enough to know there will be no logical discussion. For example, you are admiting that your early point about inflation distributing the wealth was not true, but then keep defending inflation because supposedly it keeps money in the economy and that magically creates new resources. And you dont care that it hursts the people who earn a wage! Anyway, good luck. It would be better if you could temporarely move your files to somewhere else and then install Ubuntu and copy them back, but you can probably install Ubuntu in just a part of the hard drive if that is what you want. The Ubuntu isntallation will offer you that option.What you might want to do is buy a USB device of at least 4Gb and install Ubuntu on that USB.Welcome to the forums 
Charity over the Internet is very complicated. Scamming is very easy.I dont see how you can do charity outside of your local zone and be effective, but I will be glad if wrong. I, for once, agree with you. The problem is that he is lying. Technological improvements is not what created this crisis and/or is causing the unemployment. Both are caused by the capital structure distortion (the housing bubble). Yes, there is a study from some local Fed from around 1992 that studies this issue and shows how the money expansion comes frist from the banks and the Fed comes later. Please read again what I said.Wikipedia? There is no intrinsic or absolute value. Value is subjective. According to that definition all money is fiat. It makes no sense.Not this stupid fallacy again... Why do people believe this nonsense. Let me explain again:This "theory" is based on the idea that wealthy people save their wealth in money, therefore if there is inflation they will see their savings eroded. The problem is that in the real world the weatlhy people dont save in money. They basically invest, even with diverse degree of leverage. Therefore inflation benefits them because their assets go up in price, while the wages of the workers go down in value (because they get actualized late). So basically inflation is what concentrates the wealth in a few hands and fucks the poor.By the way, you can check this empirically as well. Since the 70's there has been more inflation and the gap between rich and poor has increased. During the 2008 deflationary crash the gap diminished. Its because the wealthy save in assets not in money!!!So please, can we stop this nonsense? Who the fuck is promoting this lie? Its evil, it says that the workers benefit from what its hurting them. Whoever is promoting and teached you that idea is pure evil.Yes there is a debt problem, but that is not how it happens. The excessive debt happens because the government regulates the banking system allowing the banks to overextend credit. The debt in the present system is not based on savings, its based on the government money monpolly and the banking cartel it creates.Yes, and that happens because the government imposes a money monopolly.Do you realize that all bubbles tend to happen in capital intensive sectors? How do you explain that?I dont see how this is important. The government could tax and build the tractors. The real important issue is if the tractors are neeed or not. Financing them through direct taxes or through the inflation tax has some implications but at the end of the day the big issue is wheteher the tractors are needed or the resources are better spent somewhere else.You seem to think that just because the money was printed the resources appear out of nowhere and it does not affect.Can you point one example in history when money printing was not abused?Again, history is not on your side.It is. You are not letting the price system work. Certainly is not stalist communism, but it does affect the price system and distorts it. It is central planning.Then go and try it please.It does not matter what the money is, all that matter is that nobody controls the quantity. Some hours ago I got an odd share numer so I guess it did not yet. I am very happy with AMDOverdriveCtrl but its lackign some things. You can not check the tempreatures of the card other than the core and it does not tell you current as for example a windows program like gpu-z does. Its the only thing Im missing in linux. Google AMDOverdriveCtrl. Also you are not counting electricity. I have not read the book, but from talking to people that has read it, I think its mostly true, just some things are debatable. But at the end it was written some decades ago, there are new discoveries and no book is perfect.It is true that the manuscript to create the Fed was written in a reunion of politicians and bankers at Jekyll Island. Some of the people at that meeting have written about it and explained how they went incognito. But keep in mind that the bankers were trying to get the government to create a central authority to manage money way before that. During the first decade of the XX century they managed to have the Treasury act as a sort of central bank for some years. And the USA had three central banks before the Fed.The meeting at Jekyll Island was in 1910. You know what the Fed did at 2010, a hundred years later? They celebrated a meeting at Jekyll Island. You know what the name of the conference by the Federal Reserve of Atlanta? 'A Return to Jekyll Island: The Origins, History, and Future of the Federal Reserve'. These suckers have a wicked sense of humor.Yes. I actually believe governments exists to favour special interest. Its not a situation that can be ammended, its what governments are.Well, they are separate things even if they "love" each other. The government has its own dinamics and while its objective is to pander to the special interests, it has to give the appearence of worrying about the people. So its a "game" of smoke and mirrors, and while the people get usually the short stick, some very few times you can get something out of it.Absolutely.Just a detail. The banks create money first, and then, later, the central bank creates money if the banks need it to cover the reserve requirements. So basically its not the central bank that creates money first, but the commercial banks, and later the central bank creates the money so they stay solvent. Supposedly the central bank will only create money and give it to banks that have worhty assets, but we have seen during this crisis that "worthy asset" is a extremely relative concept when it comes to save the big banks.At the end what you say is more or less correct, because if the commercial banks know they dont have the central bank covering their backs they will not lend so much money. So even when they commercial banks are the ones lending the money first, they only do because they know the central bank is behind them. And you compalin when I say that you are not being honest? Is this a proper answer for you?Anyway, Im not interested in discussing with you anymore (as long as you are going to keep deflecting and not really answering).By government unions I mean government regulated and/or financed unions.Again, what this has to do with what I said or with the fact that the USA pseudo-free market of the late XIX century increased the wages of the workers more than the european proto-social democracies? You are being dishonest.This is the funniest part. The authoritarian left receives more corporate money than anyone else and you are complaining that its demonized? Get real please.Anyway, as I said, Im done until you want to have an honest discussion. I dont want to discuss this here, but do you realize that having value to humans means that they have subjective value and not objective value?The problem with this is that if they are free people would register all the domains they could to try to resell them or benefit in other ways. Having a cost for a domain means that people will prioritize and would tend to choose only the domains they needed (or at least the "hoarding" of domains would be more difficult).I am still thinking about it, but maybe the best way for namecoin, if they want to be a DNS service and not money, would be to increase the difficulty of the network as more domains are registered. That would mean that as more people register more domains more computer power is added, so everyone with a domain would add their part (or pay someone to do it for them). As explained and discussed above, not all the money in the present system is debt based.The governments does not pay interest on the money it gets from its central bank. Yes the government pays interest on the bonds the central bank buys, but the central bank returns the benefits it gets to the government (including the interest it charges to the banks), so for all practical matter the government is not paying it.This is exaclty what its already happening in the present system.Bitcoin is not a fiat currency. Fiat means imposed by force, usually by the government.If you define fiat as a currency not backed by anything, then gold and silver are also fiat, since they are not backed by anything. This definition does not make sense.Milton Friedman was very wrong regarding monetary policy (he was right about other things). There is no reason why there should be a 2-3% inflation rate (why not 1%?, why not 5%?). There is absolutely no reason in monetary theory why it should be this way.Do you realize that money does not have a direct relationship with the amount of products and services in the economy because prices change? What you mean is that you want some price index to remain relatively constant. There is no reason why this should be this way.Also, do you realize that "to create new things such as useful infrastructure" money has to "chase after the existing products and services in the market"?This is a fallacy. You are presuposing that the government without a price system can decide what is good and bad investments. There is a reason why there is a market and government central planning does not work.Again both things create new infrastructure and chasing existing goods and services go together.You can go and try to create an alternative, but there is a reason why the system your propose has never emerge from the civil society and the examples in history are all imposed by the governments using force. And btw, they have all hyperinflated creating big poverty. Are you aware that the progressive founders were eugenicists (also Keynes) and the free market supporters were against it? You are doing it again. The discussion was about the late XIX century and you are changing it. Its dishonest. But Ill answer anyway:First, its normal that government unions are going down. Workers are realizing that government unions answer to the ones that pay them: the government, and not to the workers. During the industrialization some workers started to organize and protest, sometimes in very creative ways, to punish the industrialists that were exploiting them by not paying them the free market wage. Some industrialists and their government cronies realized this so they started to organize government unions so they could manage the anger of the workers in a way that was useful to them. That is why they organized government unions, financed by governments and therfore that answer to the politicians and not to the workers.Its a law of life that the one paying is the one in control. If you have government unions, they will answer to the government. If you have workers unions, they will answer to the workers. Workers are realizing this.Second, this is the graph of the spending of the USA as a percentage of the GDP. Look at this and tell me the USA is not becoming a social-democracy:Its almost at european levels.So now you are denying reality. Check the data. The USA pseudo free market increased wages more than the european proto-social democracies. That is a fact, whether you like it or not.Bla, bla, you are brainwashed, bla, bla, you dont understand my enlightment, bla, bla...I have already said this but here goes again: Yes, during the XIX century conditions were worse than they are today, technology and production has improved. And you know what? During the X century conditions were even worse than during the XIX century. You are being dishonest by trying to compare periods with different technology and conditions. You can not compare them, unless you want to be dishonest.The fact of the matter is that given the conditions of that time, the USA pseudo free market increased the wages of the workers way more than the european proto social democracies. That is a fact, no matter how hard you try to ignore it so you can keep going on thinking the way you do.This happens in Norway too. Its what social democracies do: screew the poor while benefiting the rich. Its political darwinism.Do you realize Im not anti-socialist, but in fact regard the socialist ideals as a good thing? Im not a marxian. I agree. I think the best thing that could happen to any nation is getting rid of the central bank.Btw, the guy that will replace Trichet at the front of the European Central Bank is an italian that, surprise surprise!, is an ex-Goldman Sachs employee.  The funny part is that the germans wanted Axel Webber as head of the ECB. Webber is much more hawky than the itailian GS one. But Merkel, the german canciller, started talking with Webber about what they wanted from him, and he decided to quit from the ECB and returned to the Bundesbank.  Merkel did not talk about the issue for weeks, and finally accepted the italian GS one, that is much more inflationary and will keep the european countries alive inside the system by printing money so they can keep returning the money to the banks instead of defaulting on it (although there might be some partial default because the debt is so big is just unpayable, the german banks are getting ready for this, with the help of the ECB of course...) And bordel owners, dont forget bordel owners. Mining was a man thing, there were almost no woman and the miners needed to spend their littel earnings to get some pleasure.  But I though that registration costs are fixed in Namecoin, since you need to spend a fixed amount of Namecoins to keep your .bit domain. I only checked Namecoin superficially so correct me if wrong. But if I am right, this would mean that the price of registering a domain would become prohibitive if Namecoin starts being used as money. So you are accepting my point. Not all money is debt in the present monetary system.Btw, it is false that the government is the slave of the banking system in the present monetary system. Both bankers and politicians benefit from it. The bankers because it allows them to emit much more debt than they could in a free market and the politicians because they get to emit more government debt and allows the government to spend more than it could only through direct taxes. The ones being screewed are the rest of the citizens that pay all this through higher prices. Its not all debt.Yes, there is the Primary Dealers system in the middle, but the Primary Dealers are government licensed institutions, so they know where their aliances are. The fact of the matter is that when the central banks buy government debt (and they do continuosly, but at alarming rate during this crisis) they are financing the government (even if they dont buy the debt directly to the governmetn, because by buying government debt they artificially increase the demand for government debt, thus decreasing its interest rates, allowing the government to issue more debt).So no, wheteher the central bank can buy the government debt or through a Primary Dealers system, its not all debt. Nothing has intrinsic value. What you wanted to say is that namecoins has another use apart from bieng money while bitcoins can only be used as money.The problem with Namecoin is that if it does become money its value will skyrockedt and it wont be used for domains, therefore rendering its porpouse useless. It could also cause a panic when people realize its original poropouse is lost.
Yes, thats the bank side. I was pointing out that its not all that way (it would have collapse if it were). Im mining, so from a short term selfish point of view, I want it to be as profitable as any other miner. But I am completely aware that mining will become a very low yiedl activity as new miners comes in. Its only a matter of time.But for the Bitcoin economy this will probably be a good thing (and so it will be a good thing for miners long term, because its important to remember that if the Bitcoin economy does not develop mining will make no sense). When mining has only a marginal profit, the mining frenzy will stop and people will see Bitcoin again as a currency and not as a way to produce free money.Btw, its important that we focus on selling Bitcoin as a currency, as something you can use to buy stuff, and not as a scheme to make make easy money. I have to agree with Findeton. The movie "Money as debt" is not that incorrect, its just dishonest because it hides very imporant parts of the monetary system, and gives a skewed view on how it works.Not this again... Can we stop the stupid internet meme that the Fed is a private institution? I dont like the Fed, I want it closed but saying false things like this only takes credibility away form the anti-Fed movement.The Fed is a mix government and private, but the decission over monetary policy are taken by the government parts. You can argue that the Fed (and the rest of the government) is corrupt and I will agree with you, but that does not maket it less government. In fact, being corrupted defines what a government is. You can subjectively cherry pick your dates, but the reality is that Bismark was the one who started the government programs to keep the poor in line, that we understand by social-democracy. This is a historic fact accepted by all historias.And the facts are that the psuedo-free market of the USA gave better conditions to the workers thatn the european proto-social-democracies.Why you do this? You are dishonest, you dont want to help people. We are discussing late XIX century, not the present. In the present the USA is a sort of social-democracy and therefore screews the workers.You are not going to get away that easy. I would like to know your answer to the fact that the USA pseudo-free-market benefited more the workers than the european proto-social-democracies.Let me remind you that Norway has a lower corporate tax rate than the USA and a higher tax rate for workers. How is that socialism? You want to be more like Norway so I assume you want to lower taxes for corporations and raise taxes for workers? Defenders of neoliberalism say the northern european countries are an example of neoliberalism.[/quote]Right, if a magazine says it, it must be true. As I said northern european countries are far from socialism. European socialist renegue of them just so you know.Also, do you know that the northen countries have been moving away from regulations and welfare since the 80's-90's? During that time the socialists were in the government and basically increased welfare driving the countries towards stagnation. People started voting the conservatives and they scale back in welfare and the countries started to grow again. But hey, it must be the welfare that is producing growth if a magazine says it!And Norway is not a good example since they have lots of petrol. Its easy to do things when you have petrol. The dollar or any other fiat currency is not based completely in debt neither. If they were they would have collapsed years ago.The trick is that the central bank monetizes government debt which is roughtly equivalent to the government printing money. HiI like to buy 3 rings from you. What price can you offer me? Also, I would like to know the price of the bronce one, if you can do it. What would be the price of shipping to Europe?   How is the exchange USD-BTC going down a recession? The "elites" never usurped gold. They created a government regulated gold certificate system that they controlled. F.e. in the USA receives the name of gold-exchange standard. But your electric bill will.Unless of course you are doing it at work or something like that. Whats the porpouse of this? Is as bad to try to troll to bring the price down or up. There is not much difference. His answer comes from the fact that this question gets asked constantly. For example, 4 or 5 threads under this there is this one: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=15571.0And the answer is that nobody knows. AMD 7890 "Bitcoin edition" coming soon...   Thats interesting then. Setting up an Android market with Bitcoin is a great idea. Does Android have any other limitation in the software that can be installed? No.But if this things keep happening the exchanges will auto-impose some rules. We have seen already big complains about the darkpools in MtGox and people moving to the Hill. The forum has changed the rules for people who registers to avoid troll-flooding to move the price. Etc... Im not sure but I believe Google has a key that can remove any aplication from any internet connected Android phone. How do you explain that in the same period you are criticizing the wages of the workers went up more than in any ohter society, including Europe that was already implementing social-democracy?And the system back then was not perfect, but comparing this period with the technological advances to that period is not honest. Compare that system with systems in the same period when they all had the same technology (or access to it) and you will see that the aproximation to a free market that was the USA increased the wages of the workers a lot more than the european socialdemocracies and any other system in the world. If you dont believe me please check the data and see by yourself. Bitcoin has created the technological class. Nerds of the world unite and rule!! There is Bitcoin my email already that can be used by going to a internet shop, but its not very useful for micropayments. There is also Bitcoin in paper, but I dont know how easy to accept that will be. Obviously. But the only way to stop inestability is for more merchants to accept it. Its a snake that eats its own tale. When more merchants start accepting it, it will stabilize more and other merchants will join which will stabilitze it more... etc... The contrary is true as well.Paying with bitcoins were you can and choosing merchants that accept bitcoins over the ones that dont when posible also helps convince the merchants that accepting bitcoin is a good idea. If a merchant starts accepting bitcoin and then no business comes that way...  Im trying it with an Atom 330 that is reported to have SS2, but I get better results with c and cryptopp (almost identical results with both).
Yes, doing the maths is a good idea. It will give you a more clear vision of what could be. Im doing it.The problem is that at the end of the day all your maths could account to nothing. The bitcoin price exchange could skyrocket again and give you record profits as the new miners take a while to set up new rigs. Or the bitcoin price exchange could collapse and you would eat all the hardware.You can do all the maths you want to get a clearer vision of the "what if", but no math is going to tell you what is the right decssion. Thanks. Git branch is working now. A small contribution is going your way. The problem is that it is not that simple. To calculate you need to know the difficulty of mining and the exchange of bitcoin and the currency you pay electricity with (dollar, euros, ...) for the next months. And if you knew that you would probably make more money speculating.The difficulty changes (roughly) every 14 days and depends on the power of the Bitcoin network, which changes as new miners and new rigs are added. Can you tell me what difficulty is going to be in 2 months? In 4? In 6?The exchange ration changes even more. Can you tell me what the exchange ratio is going to be in two months? In 4? In 6?Basically you can not do the maths. You can speculate and make your guess, but at the end of the day its not guaranteed. Mining is risky. You can end up eating your hardware if the difficulty goes up a lot and the exchange does not. And the difficulty is going up a lot in the next iterations. But you dont need a laptop for this. Just get a USB memory, install linux and boot from there.As for the other suggestion is way too complicated for the average user. Mmmmm. How are you going to connect to the Bitcoin network with a non-networked laptop? If Bitcoin goes big, I can see a lot less poverty in the world. I dont know exactly how it will develop but there will be a lot less people suffering.Why am I saying this? If you check history when humans organize around stable sound money there is much more progress and less "elite power". When human societies organize arond inflationary money suddenly discoordination starts to happen which leads to production problems making people poorer, and the gap between the middle class and the poor with the rich increases. +1 You can send them the code if you want it so badly. Or you could ask nicely and wait for the developers to volunteer some free time of their life into this. Just as a remainder, always back up the original bios before trying to flash your card with a new one. At least you will be able to get your card to the oringinal condition. It doesnt matter. If you create a system that is managed completely by assemblies it would be even worse in a lot of senses. Assemblies are slow, suffer heavily from imperfect inforamtion, dont have a price system and worse of all heavily promote political darwinism.Having a system run by assemblies is basically imposible and would drive any nation into extreme poverty. Its poverty exploitation. Its working for me. When other pools go down and everybody comes, statistics go a bit crazy, but they usually solve it quickly. So you suckers are the ones that are making BTCGuild misbehave? You are freeriders. You dont belong to the great pool of BTC Guild. Only natives of BTC Guild should be admited. You are not original BTCGuilders! Go back home, we dont want you here! Buhhhh! Its magic! Very nice. Please, let us know the results, Im very curious about it. Uhhhh, be afraid, be very afraid!!PS: George Bush is looking for a new propagandist. Yes, it will always have some subjective value as long as humans exists. Its imposible for anything to have objective value. For something to have objective value it needs to have value independently from humans. Its imposible, because by definition value is what we value, its subjective. Im saying that all value is subjective, including the food value.Objective value means that its value is independent of the needs and wants of humans. That its value is inherent, not dependent on any human.For me its obvious that is imposible. Value will always come from the needs and wants of humans, therefore is subjective. According to this way of thinking, the Nvidias have a lot of potential too. Graphic performance =/= mining performance.The only way you can know if the PowerVR are good for mining is trying them. Different graphic architectures have different mining performance. If you do Im interested in knowing how they do. Do you realize you are justifying that food has subjective value? You are saying that food is valuable to humans because we need it. That is the exact definition of subjective value. Its a server with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. I guess its "old". Ill try the tarball, thanks.EDIT: The tarball worked.
You can find some, but not at 155 euros. More like at 200+ euros. Still worth it in my opinion, its a very good card, but your stimations are way off. You are going to make a lot less money than you expect. Food has only temporary value as well. I just showed you that at some point food was less valued than a car. That is exactly the point, value is subjective: It depends on the needs and wants of a person, its not absolute.This does not contradict at all that value is subjective.I agree. This does not contradict that value is subjective.You are defining absolute as subjetively valuable for all humans. Absolute value means that it does not depend on the subjective valuation of anyone. Yet, you keep repeating that food is valuable because people need it. That means subjectively valued by people. You know now. PS: From a fellow ex-social-democrat, now turned libertarian. Social-democracies are evil, they hurt the poor. This is aparently a very intuitive though, but only aparently, because it does not describe reality.Lets try a very simple though experiment: Imagine a farmer with all his food necesities covered for months. Suddenly his daughter gets ill and he needs a car to take her to the doctor. But he does not have a car. Now someone comes and offers him a car and a lot of food. What do you think he will value more in that moment? Supposedly food has absolute value while the car does not, right? Still, he would choose the car. How can that be if food has absolute value?In reality, what do you mean by food having absolute value? I actually tried ./configure just for the sake of it and does nothing as expected. Autogen is failing. Im getting this error in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS when running autogen.sh:~/cpuminer$ sh autogen.shconfigure.ac:15: installing `./compile'configure.ac:4: installing `./config.guess'configure.ac:4: installing `./config.sub'configure.ac:6: installing `./install-sh'configure.ac:6: installing `./missing'compat/jansson/Makefile.am: installing `./depcomp'Makefile.am: installing `./INSTALL'configure.ac:96: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.      See the Autoconf documentation.Any suggestion? I know what you mean but individualism was left-wing when it started. Originally, being a lefty meant supporting individual rights, being a clasic liberal (as opposed to a progressive liberal). Everything gets co-opted in this world... American liberal is social-democrat. Thats not the definition of socialist. I think you mean you are a social-democrat. http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=7760.1180 My miners are going idle very often because of server connection problems as well. No.Long answer: Value and price are different things. Price is the reflection of value. But things can have value and no price, for example something with emotional value that you refuse to sell (although some would say that the problem is that nobody has offered you a high enough price). Anyhow, the price is maybe the best reflection of value.As someone has stated before, value is subjective. Value is a human decision, and its different for everyone. Without a human valuing it an object has no value.And now answering your question: there is no absolute price. Everything floats in respect to other objects. You are always pricing things in another object. F.e.: I will change you one caw for three sheeps, I will change you this car for a sex night with your girlfriend (interesting valuation here), I will change you a computer for a $600, I will change you 10 euros for 1 bitcoin, etc... Because this can be a mess, people end up using one object as means of exchange and exchanging everything against this object. This has been many things, like tobaco, sea shells, salt, spices, etc... but universaly and cultures without contact have end up selecting precious metals, specially gold and silver, because of its qualities. This object its what we call money. The benefits of having a few objects acting as means of exchange is that it allows for economic calculation and a pricing system that is what allows economic coordination in the division of labour and allows human progress. The numbers are way off on a lot of them. I doubt that the 5870 consumes 270W. The guardian one is funny. The end did not need to be like that, but apart from that it was funny. Why is money a special product? Indeed.I had 3 computers at home and was mining with the least powerful one, an Intel Atom I have as home server, and at reduced speed because I did not want it to consume too much energy and slow other server tasks. I was doing it just to collaborate with the project. And when the "GPU revolution" arrived I just stopped mining because the Intel Atom grahpic card did not had opencl and I did not want to keep the other computers on. If only I had known...I actually gave a friend 50 bitcoins when they where like $2 each, and now its a $1000. I have been giving bitcoins away to get people onboard all the time. It was different back then. Ive been looking at the code of radeonvolt, its not complicated, but to get the info you need to know the graphic card protocol, which I dont, it takes time and its boring as hell. And for someone who already knows it, it would be quite easy to provide it, or even hack radeonvolt to accept more types of cards...I would actually pay some bitcoins to someone willing to actualize radeonvolt or AMDOverdriveCtrl (or a new one) to provide that info. Maybe we can start a bounty.EDIT: I have checked the AMD ADL Library (the one used by AMDOverdriveCtrl) and it does not allow to access current or other temprearture sensors. It actually allows to access what AMDOverdriveCtrl is already showing. To get the rest of the info you need to access the card (via i2c I believe) and its probably different for every model.If anyone is willing to upgrade radeonvolt (or AMDOverdriveCtrl or a new one) to read 5870 cards I am willing to give 5btc bounty. Perfect information does not exists, but there is better and worst information distribution. Talking about perfect information is just derailing the topic.Also, free markets does not imply the existance of perfect information. That would be silly. Free market can exist and have existed. Let me answer with a question:I decide to store some type of computer cable, and suddenly the manufacturers stop making it. Now there is a lot of people that want that cable replacement and a very reduced supply, therefore the price goes up. Am I stealing from someone? I think we agree, just using somehow different language.
I have bought from cablesaurus (using bitcoins) and Im very satisfied with the service. I know of gpu-z but there are others. There is also the issue of the rest of sensors.I guess I could look into the code of radeonvolt to see how it does it and try to adapt it to my card... :snooze: Now seriously, there are ways to get the info, its kind of sad that no linux frontend (GUI or comand line) to get that info exists. I know I am getting repetitive but it would be great if we could get someway to get the consumption and the rest of the temperature sensors in Linux.With AMDOverdriveCtrl you can see the voltage, but it does not tell you the current. You need both to know the consumption. The cards measure it because windows applications allow you to know.There is this application called radeonvolt but it only works with a few selected cards.Anyone has a solution? Yes. I was checking now and the utility he recomended uses AMD ADL API, which I believe is the same AMDOverdriveCtrl uses. So basically both programs are frontends to the same AMD API. There should be no difference.AMDOverdriveCtrl lets you save the profile once you have a configuration you like and then you can load it with the -b option, for example:AMDOverdriveCtrl -i 1 -b profilefordevice1.ovdrThis will set up the device 1 with the configuration on the file profilefordevice1.ovdr (that you should have created with the GUI previously) and exits, allowing you to start the miners. No need to have the GUI running. I actually have a script that sets the cards using taht comand and then launches the miners. But paying taxes is not about welfare. Government is about power, not welfare. Welfare is just the excuse the government uses to get your money.Thats actually one of the points of the article. This does not make sense. AMDOverdriveCtrl uses the ATI official API. Why does AMDOverdriveCtr gives, according to you, more inestability? Hazek, users complaining and demanding a better service is a important part of the free market. Its important feedback for MtGox. Right, but two things:1. I dont know why, but I just dont like seeing people suffering, specially if its by some random shit out of their control. So helping the less fortunate is something that comes out naturally. I know we like to joke around, act tought and stuff, but usually 99.9% of the people is this way.2. Humans are social animals. And the rules of society are social contructs, social conventions. We can agree that respecting individual rights is the best way to organize society because it creates maximum wellfare and progress. But if some part of society suffers big poverty, they are not going to accept the social conventions, they wont see the reason why they should. So helping the less fortunate get their shit together again and become self-reliable is in your own interest.PS: I hate welfare that just makes people addicted to more welfare. Help should always be directed at getting people out of the whole. LOL A lot of people here wont mind, but I think the general population does. Yes, Bitcoin is a young and small market and, like any young and small market, you can move it if you have enough money. With time and more acceptance this will change and it will be more difficult to move by one person.Thanks for sharing your insights. Yes, AMDOverdriveCtrl lets you see an set the voltage, but to know the consumpton of a card (and anything) you need the voltage and the current. I know some linux tools show the current and the rest of the temperature sensors. I would like to access that information in linux. I dont see nothing wrong, but there is something weird:DISPLAY=:0 aticonfig --od-enable --adapter=allWhy adapter=all? You want adapter 0 right? Also, once you do od-enable once you dont need to do it again, ven after rebooting the computer. I think you can delete that line. Try without it, maybe it does a difference although I doubt it. What about power consumption? Im not completely opposed and I see that what you say makes sense, but the italians had a very inflationary currency and they exchanged 1000 liras for 1 dollar and the dollar went ok...And about moving the decimal, how would you do such a thing? You would need everybody or at least a big majority to agree. It would be the same as chanign the rules. The danger is a split of the chain and having two competing bitcoins, which in my opinion would take credibility away from bitcoins at this moment. On the other hand, it its done successfully and the community shows that its capable of such transitions it would be a big boost of confidence since it would shut up a lot of complaints. Its risky. I misunderstood what you were saying.What you explain here is easily solved by talking of milibitcoins or microbitoins. So you get 50 mbtc (milibitcoins) with 1 dollar. The official client can be changed to show milibitcoins also (or make it optional, but show milibitcoins by default). You should post the script so we can give you an opinion.Also, did you try to launch the cards in different order? Are you sure its not a particular card failing, the one you launch last? I was thinking on using them to buy stuff. Am I that weird? According to the experiments of behavioural economics people is sensitive to transitions in the value but not so much to nominal value itself. For example, in inflationary environment people will prefer a rise of 2% with the CPI going up a 4% (your real wage goes down 2%) than no rise with a CPI of 1% (your real wage goes down 1%), because people can not control the CPI so they try to stay ahead by demanding the maximum they can get. But people adapt to a nominal price level quite quick. For example, 10 years ago your wage and the prices were way lower, but people have adapted to the new prices and see them as normal. Yeah, the 5870 does around 350 Mh/s without overclocking and 445Mh/s OC (maybe others get even more). If you lower the memory speed, keep the voltage low (I have 1'080 while maximum non-OC is 1'136) and the heat is low, why should it be a problem?
Do you know how to measure the consumption of the cards in Linux? I tried radeonvolt, but it does not work on my 5870 card. Then you dont want to create a union like the op, you just want to distribute information. And we are in agreement that the information could be useful and create some difference in the market. But its very different of what the op proposed. Im getting 445 Mh/s with 5870 @1005:340 (one needed 350, dont know why) with a very small overvolting with voltage between 1'080-1'075 (depending on the card). Using phoenix, phatk kernel with 2.4 SDK in Ubuntu. The card with higher temperature is always under 70º, usually around 60-65 (no computer case). Fans at 90%.I have gotten some to over 460 Mh/s with more voltage and more core speed, but they crash after a while. Stable 445 Mh/s is the max Ive gotten. This is not true. There are times that given the legal framework are remarcably stable. You can pay interest without problem in a price deflationary economy. You just need to invest the money in a business that generates income (which is the point of a loan). That is the problem on why nobody is lending in bitcoins right now, because its hard to generate a business that generates income in bitcoins. I think its a big mistake to compare Bitcoin with stablished markets. Bitcoin is young and small, its going to be very volatile, both up and down and its going to beahve like a young market not like a big old market. Nobody should be surprised at the events of the last days and weeks. But voluntary unions, that is non-government unions, are not inmoral, they are just a bunch of people voluntarely agreeing to comply with a set of rules. There is nothing inmoral in that.The problem is that they dont work in price fixing, as history shows. They might obtain some small victories, but they dont last long. For once, I have to agree with you. Im happy bitcoins went down. It was not normal.But it has to do with the day because the weekend certain services are closed and can affect the Bitcoin market. I still think it should be open 24/7, but at the end its the decission of the exchanges. Bitcoin is a young project and a small market. Volatility is spected, it should not be a surprise. Only with time and more acceptance will volatility go away. 4.How do you know that a union member is not selling at free prices on your back?This is actually what would probably happen, because its what happened with non-government carterls. They all failed because the members were loosing business to the competition and to avoid it they would sell secretely at chaper prices. Then the rumors go around and other members of the cartel tired of not selling start doing the same... and finally the cartel breaks. It makes no sense to me neither. The way it was before was better. And even if they do get their act together, how will they know merchants will accept their new bitcoin instead of the old one? If you are a merchant would you accept a currency whose supporters are inflationists or a currrency whose supporters want sound money? Actually, the people that supported eugenics were in general big intereventionists. Keynes and the early progressives supported eugenics.How can you attribute something to libertarianism, when its attributable to the ideology you defend? Its not a form of regulation. He is not forcing anyone to participate. This. And the guy has written a whole paper about bitcoins and makes mistakes like this... You are not very original, this has been discused and answered forever.And then you will have two currencies. The old system and the new system. The new system is more inflationary and people wont trust it and it will die. I actually think that the miners will see this and wont even go for the change in the first place. The words used for this kind of arrangements are "union" and "cartel". They are both basically the same thing, but for some reason the word "union" has a better emotional acceptance.And please, dont let my words discourage you. Go and form the union/cartel. But whether you like it or not, mining will be a very low yielding business at some point, and there is nothing you can do about it. Competition will crash your union/cartel badly (if you dont receive support from the government obviously). Please, form the union. It will be curious. But I hope you know you are going to fail.Without government regulations you are going to have a very hard time manipulating the price and will end up failing. Europe gets destroyed by a nuclear bomb in 2015 and thats why it does not appear there? Bitcoin forum is private. They can change the rules and there is nothing wrong about it.
The initial value for bitcoins was based on the entrepreneurship of the first miners. You could do nothing with bitcoins back then, not even change them for dollars or euros, but this miners were entrepreneurs with a vission for bitcoin and that gave bitcoin value for them. Im using phoenix with the phatk kernel with 2.4. Phatk is designed for the 2.4 stack, and for me is faster than any other combination. I use VECTOR IBF_INT AGRESSION=12 WORKSIZE=256Worksize=128 worked better at stock speed and light overclock, but when I overclocked over 1000MHz it was better workize=256. Keep hoping. According to history democracies always devores itself, ending in chaos and violence. http://dailycaller.com/2011/06/09/how-libertarianism-helps-the-poor/ It depends on the miner kernel you use. I have better results than anything else with 2.4 + phatk kernel. So for me, the 2.4 is the fastest. Troll. You need to learn economics and stop ashaming yourself. Value is subjective, nothing has intrincsic value. This is Economics 101. Im done here. Without good money to properly coordinate the production people die. There is no sspeculation involved in that.As I said you are imposing your subjective valuation onto your economic analisys. Value is subjective. Something useful as food might be more valued in some situation and less in others. And something useful as money might be more valued in some situation and less in others. Stop trying to impose your subjective valuation as "the truth". Value is subjective and you dont know what will retain value because it depends on people's future valuation. You can speculate about it all you want. Intrinsic value does not exist.EDIT: But let me explain you what you are trying to do: You are judging some valuations over others. You think that people valuing a car for transport is better than peole valuing gold as money. But your subjective valuation is not science, its only your subjective valuation that its blinding you. We could argue all the day about what adds more value the transport that a car provides or the economic coordination that gold as money provides... but you know what? our subjective opinion does not matter when its time to analize how the economy works. The fact of the matter is that it happens that way. We value a car and we value gold. And each person asign it a subjective value given their situation and their knowledge. You are implicitely deciding that you are superior to the rest and can decide that one is better than the other. You are not better than te rest of us. Peopel have their reasons to value gold as money. If you dont, fine, don use it. But it does not matter when it comes to analizing the economy. And so does the value of a chair, and so does the value of a shirt, and so does the value of a car, and so does the value of a tv, and so does the value of a plain, ... Value is subjective, its Economics 101.No, you are terribly wrong. ALL of gold value is because people asign it that value. Just like happens with anything else. Value is subjective.People value things because of different reasons (and the task of economics is to analize not to judge. Judging is the task of moral/politics). Some people value gold for jewlery and some other value gold for money. And the main use is money. Those are the facts. In my subjective opinion the use of gold as money is far more valuable and benefitial to humans than its use as jewlery, but that is just my subjective opinion. You can have your subjective opinion, but it should not blind you when you are analizing the world.I dont want to think you are being deliberately dishonest. Fiat money is not based on faith or trust or that "people asign it a value" (and nothing has intrinsic value, value is subjective). Fiat money is imposed using force by governments. Thats the reason why people use them, its not their own voluntary decission.What am I supposed to understand?You just discover value is subjective. Congratulations.Actually no. Bitcoin was designed in a very clever way to have the characteristics that good money has, but for the internet.You can theoretically use anything as money, but some objects make very good money while others make very bad money (with a full scale in the middle). This is why some things get selected as money (like gold) and others dont (like perishable food f.e.).Actually it does. And that is the reason why it was choosed by different cultures around the world that never knew each other. Ill let you investigate what this characteristics are.Which is completely fine. Being money is a important and useful role to play. No. Gold is useful as money. Its a very important role to play, because money is essential to coordinate the production of people that dont even know each other and allows human progress. How is that not important? How is that "based on nothing"?Gold has some nice qualities that make it suitable for money. That is a very important role. And so does Bitcoin.And you are wrong again. Your chart proves that people is using gold as money, and it makes sense since the governments and their banking cartels are trying to pay off their unpayable debts by printing the pieces of paper (or electronic accounts) that they force us to use as money. How is this posible? Actually, the forum is full of threads talking about it.Also, the forum was down for a while. The thing is that you have to sell at higher prices and when you switch from selling to buying the price starts going up again, so its not clear how anyone could make money that way. At least its not that easy. No, its not normal. Its actually a very fun weeked  Because its written by journalists. Its that simple. Read some newspaper articles about something technical that you know in depth. 95% of them will contain important errors. We kind of agree, but I dont think gold as jewlery sustains gold at these prices. Its monetary use is what sustains gold. Do you really believe that a drop of 90+% of its price would really not be a big deal? The real advantage of gold in this issue against bitcoin is centuries and centuries of tradition. Situation A:You own 0.1 bitcoins and the price of a cup of coffe is 0.05 bitcoins.Situation B:You own 1 bitcoin and the price of a cup of coffe is 2 bitcoins.Do you realize you have more money in situation A than in siutation B, right?The nominal value of money does not matter (transitions between nominal value is another issue and do matter becuase the market has to adapt). I think you are wrong.First of all, bitcoins are physical too. Electric and magnetic fields are physical.Second, the current valuation of gold is far far away from its utility as conductor or jewlery. The current price of gold is only explained by its monetary use. If gold stopped being used as money its price would probably drop by more than 90%. Is that so different from bitcoins? Yes if bitcoins stopped being money its value would drop 100%, but if you loose 90+% of your wealth its still a fucking disaster. So not so different gold from bitcoins.The fact that originally gold started being used as money because people valued it as jewlery, and bitcoin was orignally valued by enterpreneurs with a vission is quite meaningless. Both gold and bitcons had an original value.You are 100% correct in this one and it is very important for the Bitcoin community to start promotng itcons around merchants.100% correct again. AMDOverdriveCtrl --help will give you the comand option to select the card you want.
Wait until the see the electricity bill... they might even ask you to go back to playing computer games. Great, great idea. I just want to point out that the exchange of btc-usd going down is not a recession, its just the exchange of btc-usd going down. Prices change, its normal and positive, not a recession. What about power consumption? Sounds amazing. I watched the same and did not like it a bit. I really hope they are just working Bitcoin as a trojan horse, giving the most kind face to the authorities so they let Bitcoin exists and it becomes big enough so they can not go down on it because there is a big mass of people using it and the political backslash would be considerable. I used bitcoins a couple days ago to buy some computer hardware. If its any consolation, the australian housing bubble will pop at some point, so you will be able to buy a house cheaper. The main page, btcguild.com is down. It shows the apache "It works!" message.EDIT: I take that back. It seems http://www.btcguild.com works fine, but http://btcguild.com has not been correctly redirected and shows the "It works" message.Same here, just before it went down. I did not know about AMDOverclockCtrl and it has solved all my problems. Thanks. I belive there is a Bitcoin module for the Ubercart module of Druptal. Just commenting so I can follow the thread.I would donate some bitcoins for this and would probably buy them. I was not expecting to find a krugmanbot in this forum.Krugman was not a bad economist, but now he is a political hack, a sold out. He has consistently lied and defended the status quo and the central bank by lying to the people that read his blog. For example, his big prediction during the crisis has been that the danger was price deflation or at least some kind of 0% price inflation ala Japan. He said at the end of 2010 that he saw no danger of price inflation and the danger was still price deflation. After 3 or 4 months price inflation jumped up.But the part that shows more about Krugman is that he blocked long comments in his blog posts because he was getting hammered and riduculed even by fellow keynesians showing how ridiculous his arguments were. So he decided that was not acceptable and shortened the accepted lenght of the comments so no argument was posible. The guy is a political shill with no self respect.PS: Btw, I would qualify as a goldbug and I have been predicting since the beginning that we wont see hyper-inflation, but stagflation (as we are seeing). As have many other goldbugs. This hyper-inflation thing is just another strawman from Krugman to rally the krugmanbots. If this were true, the government would have been shut down long ago.   For me the best are 5870 and 5970. Best Mhash/J ratio. Its your pool and your policy, but other pools just require a username and password for registration and allows to optionally set up an email. Very nice, but are you not worried about the cards getting very hot in direct contact with the wood? Why do you require an email to register? Why not just a username? Thank you. I was waiting for permission. We had a DDoS attack, but the pool is not down at this moment.[/quote]I can not access your webpage at the moment. Tried three times. Does this mean miners are going solo because the pools are going down or misbehaving?
Same here. BTCGuild giving me a lot of Miner is iddle. Like 30% the miners are at 0Mhash/s. It was working fine for me all day until last time I checked some hours ago. How do you know that gold and silver did not behave this way in some culture when they started to be used as money?You are correct that the Federal Reserve notes are completely different, precisely because they did not rise from the market. Good question with complicated answer. In general yes, but I dont think its guaranteed. At the end, the market is just a concept, its the concept we use to describe all the volutary trades. And that this trades happen depends on a serie of social conventions (like any other system). At the end any system is as good as the respect for the social conventions that make it happen (as you being an anarchist know very well). If people feel explotaited and dont feel that its in their own benefit to respect the property rights system at the end it will fall. Its necessary that everybody participating in the system are very aware of this and help each other. Not all the left sees taxation as necesary. The statist left does, not the anarchist left.The problem with not allowing property or some sort of soft-property system is that then production becomes inefficient and you just cause poverty. This is why I think some level of inequality is inevitable, while not desirable in excess. No. But I know someone who grows his own food, so I might ask him. Its a very good idea, I really want to use my bitcoins to get food, specially if its fresh.  That's clever, at least I will know the extra-charge that the GPU adds from idle to 99% load, and what to expect from adding new gpu's.Second screen, but I am probably doing it wrong as I said. There is the voltage and amperage and some forum posts found with google said that was the consumption. One can only hope.Btw, I have checked your community garden initiative and its very interesting. Too bad I am in Europe. Do you know of someone doing the same or interested in doing the same around South Europe? I would be willing to invest bitcoins. I too believe that great amounts of inequality is not a desirable option (some amount of inequality is inevitable IMO). I also agree that the property interpretations rest on axioms that can not be proven, and ultimately are argued on utilitarian grounds (which are always subjective).But I think you are wrong when you say that the accumulation of wealth comes basically from the capital holder using the capital. Even Karl Marx explains how the financial class abuses the capitalist class regularely (to use Marx terms). The weatlh grabbing through currency manipulation is very real and important and has been one of the big factors in the last decades for the increasing inequality we are seeing. The middle class and the poor always are screwed by inflation, while the more pollitically connected benefit.I was just pointing out that the system you propose would lead to more inequality. You have to consider also that such a currency would be difficult to promote if not by violent means. Who would preffer a currency that devaluates or has a limited time use, if he/she can choose one that does not if its not forced to? Usually the free market solution tends towards the more egalitarian outcome. I have though of measuring the watts that go through the cables, but if I am not mistaken, the motherboard is also supplying power to the cards, so you would be missing that part, right? I was thinking that maybe there is a program that gives you a measure (even an aproximation). I have used gpu-z to get the current and voltage but for a overcloacked 5870 with 99% load it tells me that its using 100W, while this card should be taking around 200W, so Im obviously doing something wrong.Yes, but the point is to know how much an overclocked card is consuming. Does anyone think that AMD (or Nvidia) is taking note of the Bitcoin mining needs?The article says it will be 28nm technology. Even if its only a reduction of consumption and nothing else, the cards might still be interesting. You have defined value in a way that its not possible to argue and that its impossible to test in reality. Your "value" concept is an axiom and its also worthless to understand how the economy works.What everybody else understands as value works as I have explained. I lean towards left-libertarianism but:This would not work. You are distorting the capital structure and producing inefficiencies.Also, its false that this discourages hoarding/savings/capital concentration, on the contrary it promotes it. How? Its very simple, by assuming that devaluating money you are punishing the people that have more you are assuming they save in money... which is a big big mistake. Usually rich people save in other type of assets, like land, houses, stocks, etc... These assets are less liquid than money, but are a good way to preserve weatlh. Therefore by devaluating money you are just increasing the value of those assets, thus benefiting them. And at the same time you are punishing the people that earn a wage because our wages dont actualize for a while, while price inflation is eroding its value. Thus what you are doing by devaluating the currency is taking from the wage earners, usually the poor and middle class, and giving to the people who owns assets, usually the more rich.You can see this in real life. During the last 150 years the USA has gone from a more stable money supply to a more and more inflationary one, specially since the 70's. Since then the gap between the rich and the poor has been increasing. More inflation -> bigger gap between the rich and the poor.Actually, if you understand how the economy works, Bitcoin is a very mutualist currency. I dont see how any currency can really be communistic (apart from considering the hour system a hour standard and work hours currency, but then any other currency is not acceptable, so its the same result). I hope it goes down more. In the future, you will clearly see that the market is efficient and tends to eliminate the enterprises that opperate at a loss and forcing producers with high prices to lower them or close, thus producing the long term effect that the price tends towards the cost (note the use of the word "tends").This does not mean the price IS the cost. If you say that the price is the cost you can not explain why people buy and sell way over and way under the cost. You are basically confusing a market process with how the price is formed.PS: Btw, the Bitcoin economy is still young and the process of the price towards the cost has not fully developed so you wont probably find for a while what you are looking for. Nvidia, there is your answer. Si no tienes una tarjeta ATI no te vale la pena. Te costará más la electricidad que lo que generes.Si es solo por curiosidad en el subforo de "Mining" hay un "sticky" donde se linkea un tutorial para minear con Ubuntu 11.04. I have been around bitcoins when you could not exchange them for dollars or euros. Its normal for a young currency to have this kind of behaviour but it will stop at some point. I think and hope a big correction happens soon. Im very curious about the reaction of the Bitcoin community and hopefully a lot of the people that has come for the pure speculation will stay and decide to start trading in bitcoins. The real test for Bitcoin as currency is coming. Sorry if this has been asked previously (I used search with no success), but how do you measure the consumption of one graphic card? You are right, but the thing is: If I created a new Bitcoin wallet and send some "linked to me" bitcoins, and then spend those bitcoins from that wallet, how is anyone supposed to know Im the owner of the new wallet and not someone else? How is anyone going to prove in court that I am the owner? Its obviously not as secure as a mixer, but I think it still provides some legal protection.
This. I really dont understand where the debate is. I hope you are right and bitcoins goes down in price. Yep. I have been thinking about how to mix the ideas of free banking with bitcoins. One way could be through gold and silver merchants acting as liquidity stabilizers, but still it does not have the flexibility of fractional reserve banking. I am curious about how the bitcoin banking system will develop.Btw, at the begginning of the Great Depression the Federal Reserve tighten the money supply so it can not all be attributed to people panicking and demanding cash. It is true that after a short initial period of tightening the Federal Reserve started loosing up like crazy. But the problem is that during the crash of a bubble people will panick and save more cash. Its an unavoidable consequence of the boom and bust produced by central banks. Even when central banks try to avoid this effect they can not, because when the bubble crashes the banking system becomes broke and freezes the credit channels, making the efforts of central banking almost useless (as we are seeing during this crisis). This is why keynesians always demand government spending through monetized debt, because its the only way to save the banks by avoiding any kind of deflation. The problem is that these mesures produce distortions on the capital structure prolonging the crisis, perpetuate the central banking system, concentrate the banking system in a few hands and make the middle class and the poor even poorer. Its an unavoidable cycle if you have a central bank.PS: Count me in the camp of the one that spends when bitcoin goes up in price. To the ones that keep saving their bitcoins when price goes up: you should think that after the price goes up, it usually corrects down. At some point bitcoin is going to suffer a major downward correction, so you should think about starting to spend your bitcoins. But this is like saying, dictatorships are not inherently evil, its just that dictators abuse. Well, that is the issue, and that is why dictatorships or fiat currencies are bad. What you say makes sense, but its probably true for people just using their linux desktops to generate bitcoins. If someone buys a dedicated rig and puts 3 or 4 expensive ATI cards in there, he/she is probably going to spend the time to set them appropiately specially since its a one time effort and then you just enjoy the extra-performance "forever". It would be silly not to. Bitcoin will autoregulate, just not necesarely the way you like it to autoregulate.Anyway, good luck with the new pool. Its a good idea. What miner and flags are you using? If you are on linux, you need to flash your cards under windows and then run it on linux. For the same conditions for the card linux is faster than windows. I agree with the sentiment of your sentence, but I want to stress that growing GDP, that is an increase of the economic activity, is not always growth. Its a perverssion of the language and the economic concepts that has created a lot of damage. Growth is producing what people want and need. Therefore not all economic activity is growth. F.e., the housing bubble was pushing GDP up because it was creating economic activity, but it was not growth, since we were using resources (both material and human) into building things people did not want in that quantity (houses). That was not growth, they were malinvestments. Thanks for writting this. Its very important that bitcoins become more accepted by traders. Accountable of what? What contract or oral promise did they break? Im honestly interested on knowing what do you think they are accountable of. With a bitcoin sign as background would be perfect. You might want this post moved to the marketplace sub-forum. +1 Just yesterday I made a payment in bitcoins. BTCGuild got a block after only 4 minutes yesterday evening and then spend 3 hours and a half for the next one. It was lucky and then very unlucky and I feel today its been an unlucky day in general. You really can not say by mining only one day. I have exactly the same problem.I am using Ubuntu 11.04 (had the same problem with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS), phoenix with phatk, two 5870's. It happens more when I overclocked it more (temperature always under 70). HiI just started playing around with two 5870, but I am having stability issues. I first installed Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and followed the instructions here to install the drivers and the miners. But the system was not stable, it would freeze randomly with some tame overclocking configuration (temperature was always under 70 degrees, usually around 55-65). So I installed Ubuntu 11.04 thinking that maybe the "old" sotware of the LTS was causing problems with the drivers. I am having the same exact problems.I am using phoenix with the Phatk kernel and overcloaking the 5870's to 1000:1000 (gpu speed:memory speed) and the temperature never goes over 70, staying around 55-65. Curiously I get the freezes if I set the memory speed under 1000. I get 424 Mhash/s.Also, I have tried to overclock the gpu over 1000, even trying 1025. One works fine and I get over 430 Mhash/s, temperature is fine, but when I launch the second one (also at 1025) the whole system freezes and I need to reboot. Its not one card since I have tried in the inverse order and the result is the same. Both cards alone do 1025 fine, but when the second starts the systme freezes. My rig is using a single core AMD cpu, can that be a problem because is not able to handle both gpu's? Does adding more cards will create problems for this cpu or is cpu power not an issue for mining with the gpu's?Im guessing that the 5870 can go over 1000 Mhz because the temperature is fine. Any advice on what to do or test?PS: I am using Phatk because I read its the quicker, but I have also read that Hashkill is very good on linux. Any comments? Is Hashkill better for linux than phatck? Are you a troll? I did not even mention once fractional reserve banking. I did not state that fractional reserve banking was or not possible with or wihtout a central bank. Is this some kind of message you have stored in your computer that use for everybody or are you directly crazy?Yes, that was the issue, until you changed it here as I denounced. So you changed the issue, I called you on that but decided to answer you anyway, and now you accuse me of chaning the issue... I have no words.Baseless statement. A price deflationary monetary system does not choke the economy as seen in history. You keep disregarding reality.No, the USA did not mantain a 40% gold standard until the winter of 1933-1934. The Fed did not keep a 40% gold way before that. Please learn some monetary history.The Great Depression did not end until the 40's. What some keynesians like to point as "prove" of their mesures working is just some statistics improving because of the government manipulations. But those manipulations is what caused the economy to stall until the 40's. There was no recovery, just some statistical improvements in the same way Obama likes to point out to some statistics as "prove" that the recession is over while everybody knows we are in a depression.The situation in the UK was extremely different than in the USA, because the pound was overvalued during the 20's because of the decission of the Bank of England to return to a gold ratio it could not mantain after what he printed for the IWW. So it made sense that the economy benefited from loosing that stupid position that the central bank kept for so long.The situation in the UK and the USA during the 20's was completely different, and comparing them just shows your historic ignorance again.Yes, Keynes is well known for changing his economic views constantly. In fact, weeks before his death, he said he did not agree with a lot of what the keynesians were saying. How is constantly changing your views in contradictory ways a good thing? It shows that he did not understand how the economy worked.And any quote of Keynes after 1930 too.I am sorry to tell you that the one having selection bias is you. You can check the statements of Mises and Hayek predicting the 1929 crash. If you dont like reality and prefer to ignore it its not our problem.I just wanted to answer you for the record, but I think you are just a troll so this is the last answer.
No problem.  Someone trying this would probably affect the price of bitcoins in a big way, but would also end up loosing a lot of money. The price of bitcoins would collapse quickly until it reached a new equilibrium not allowing the seller to regain all the money he payed for bitcoins. You can see this dinamics all the time when someone tries to corner the market. If they want to sell quick, they end up loosing money. Yes, Lew Rockwell dot com (who also manages mises.org) has published a couple of very favorable articles about Bitcoin.As a supporter of the austrian school of economics and a very early supporter of Bitcoin I wish a few austrians were not so caught up with gold. Gold is only useful because it allows monetary stability and that was the reason it was choosed by the market. But the market can choose more things that gold, like bitcoins. Also, gold and Bitcoin are complementary. I would not put all my savings in gold or bitcoins, but a mix of the two. Bitcoin is way more useful for internet transactions and its cheaper to store, but gold is probably more secure and it has a lot more tradition. They are both completementary. I am ashamed of some of the stupid reactions by a few austrian economists to Bitcoin. Hopefully they will come around, becuase austrian economics explains the dinamics of bitcoins like no other economic theory can. First of all, I dont defend a government imposed gold standard. I defend competing currencies, be it gold, silver, bitcoins a combination or whatever peole like to use. Monetary freedom.Second, why dont you answer to my post instead of ignoring the corrections I made? You just changed the subject to the Great Depression without answering anything I said. Its a lame tactic to avoid debate when you dont have an answer because your theories dont hold.Third and most important, talking about "the gold standard" is terribly vague. The monetary systems that people label under "gold standard" are extremely different and only someone very ignorant about economics would join them together and treat them all the same. There are times where people used gold as money without any government intervention. Then governments usually start the shenerigans by imposing some type of specific gold coin, to later on create a central bank with paper (suposedly) backed by gold. But each monetary system is completely different (even when they all are using gold in some way) and its stupid to treat them all the same.Specifically for the period of time you are mentioning: When the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 it wasnt that bad actually. It could only create dollars if they were backed by so called "real goods" and 40% of gold. Obviously this was only temporary and not 5 years were gone when they started changing the law so the Fed could expand. The first big expansion was for IWW where the Fed doubled prices in the USA in 5 years (if I recall corectly). To pay for the war the government gave the Fed the power to buy government bonds. Housing bubbles appeared all over the USA, specially in Florida. Finally the bubble popped and there was the crisis of 1921-22. This is a crisis keynesians dont like to talk about and ignore it because the government lowered taxes and reduced spending: the crisis was over in a year and a half, even when it started worse than the Great Depression.Then the Fed finally got definitive powers to expand and it created the roaring 20's with a big stock market bubble that popped in 1929. How is this the fault of gold? And how is this related to other type of monetary systems like the ones I have explained earlier? Its stupid to group all the monetary systems that use gold in some way together because they can be very different.For the record, during the 20's Fisher congratulated the Fed for its great job at managing the economy and during 1929 said that the collapse would not happen, that it was only a plateau. In 1927 Keynes said that they had now the hability to control the economy and that crisis were a thing of the past. Hayek and Mises said there was a bubble and that a crisis was coming. Mises even rejected a job at a big bank and remained in his professor job (earning a lot less money) because he said the bank would fail and he did not wanted his name associated with all that. His wife was not happy, but the bank end up failing 2 years later. There is unwritten law in economics: When a keynesian says they have now control of the economy and crisis are things of the past, a big crisis is coming. So you think "experts" are never wrong? And you think people can judge the arguments of the "experts"? So if I explain to you a problem regarding some electronic engineer regulation you are going to be able to know if I am cheating you or not? You think Joe Sixpack has the knowledge to decide between the arguments of two experts? Let the central bank buy all the bitcoin at ridiculous high prices and then we can stop usin bitcoins, start a new chain making all thebitcoin the cenral bank bought worthless. I wish they were so stupid. If you are not willing to loose money dont invest it. After the absolutely abnormal rise of bitcoins this last two weeks its more than normal that the price is not going up for a while. Im actually very surprised that it has not gone down to $15 or so. It would be a normal correction. Im not very good at short time trading, but if it stays around $18-$19 and does not correct more it will be a very bullish sign. Why do you think "experts" know what they are doing and/or they wont be corrupted? You have two periods during the USA XIX century. One, after Andrew Jackson closed the Second Bank of the USA (the central bank of the USA back then) until the civil war, and then after the depression that the civil war brought until the beggining of the XX century, although during this last period there was the National Banks Act that centralized the credit in the New York banks and allowed for some expansion of credit and some bubbles. But it was very tame compared to what a central bank could do, so there was still price deflation. Its very important that you keep in mind that a lot of the statistics during this period are just bullshit. Because the data of this period was not precise lot of economists applied models to extrapolate the data and they pushed their own view with the model. Even keynesians like Cristina Rommer (worked for the Obama admin) admits that the data was grossly exagerated for the worse. If you want to get a good picutre you need to look at big intervals like 10 or 20 years.Canada during big periods of the XIX century had a price deflationary economy. Scotland during the XVIII and XIX centuries. Etc... Honestly, I have started mining now so it goes against my short term interests, but deep inside I hope Bitcoin collapses and a lot of the people that is in here not for the community or the currency and just purely for the monetary gain go away. Nothing wrong in wanting to earn money (I do), but Bitcoin is much more than that. If Bitcoin crashes to some degree and some people get caught on it, maybe we can focus 100% in Bitcoin as a currency and have a nice community here. There are plenty of examples of how price deflationary economies grow and thrive. In fact, it is inflation that stops growth because it creates malinvestments.The problem is that keynesians ignore the empricial evidences and keep repeating the same nonsense. If Bitcoin works or it does not it wont be due to price deflation. There is a place where this has been discused already: http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=583.0Dont start new threads, use the old one. Yes, my mater. Without you there will be no roads and people will start killing each other. Thank you for using violence against us...   We are making fun, but this is going to be a real life test to see if TOR is really as anonymous as it claims it is. Same can be said with for Bitcoin although Bitcoin only claims to be pseudo-anonymous (you have to actively follow some rules to be completely anonymous). You might want to try the european over the counter chat room: its in freenode as well and its called #bitcoin-otc-eu Its being discussed in the general subforum: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=12456.0 Dont forget Liberty Dollars. This is an interesting idea on how governments could attack bitcoins, but you have to realize if governments push up the price of electricty just to punish bitcoin miners, they would be punishing everybody else in society. People would not like it, industry would become expensive, etc.. Its not viable. http://guifi.net Check the map to see how big the network is. But if I am not mistaken a PAC can not directly support one candidate, so you would not be giving yor money to Ron Paul.
Makes a good point?  So now a bunch of falacies are good points? Come on.But Ill bite:By now anyone should see that this person is dishonest (or completely indoctrinated) because this ad-hominenm attack is the first thing he does. Libertarians are a bunch of geeks with no friends and no real life and bla bla bla... This is the level of discussion? Really?Now he makes a false asertion. He obviously does not point out any example because he can not.For example, Greece is one of the most social-democrat countries in Europe (government spending increased, teachers and other government employeesget pay a lot more than the general population, the government had and has nationalized banks, etc...) and they are crashing.Lets take the more extreme example of Somalia. When Somalia had a socialist government they were a lot worse off than they are now in anarchy.All the real life examples show that the free market produces better results than socialdemocracy. What is seen in reality is that socialdemocracy is corporatism.EDIT: If you are going to say that Sweden is a socialist country and bla blah blah, let me remind you that Sweden has the corporate tax lower than the USA and the tax for workers way higher than the USA. In fact, neoliberal economists point to Sweden as an example of neoliberalism.The problem with this again is that it does not check with reality. Its a fantasy. Big corporations want MORE regulations and lobby for it. Regulations have been increasing in the USA during each of the last decades (just go and check the government data). You would only think regulations have decreased if you believe the propaganda of the corporate media, that is promoting this false idea. And because there are more regulations big corporations have been able to avoid competition, run wild and fuck the consumer.There is corruption because there is democracy.Another ad-hominem showing how arrogant he is, even when he is out of touch with reality.Here he is showing his ignorance. Hayek stated that there is no way to prove a theory 100% right, but there is a easy way to disprove a theory, just show one empirical evidence that proves its wrong. I can show you empirical studies in the austrian tradition, for example: http://www.gmu.edu/depts/rae/archives/VOL14_4_2001/5_keeler.pdfPeople died for dictators and kings too... I guess that is reason enough to defend dictartoships.Falacy after falacy.People in the middle-east are protesting because the price of food and other basic stuff has skyrocketed. You would only believe its "for democracy" if you are a mindless drone and believe the western corporate media. There is a reason why the corporate media promotes the idea of democracy all the time. And btw, egiptians dont know it but prices are going up in big part due to the action of the actions of the western democracies.I guess a National Socialists could always defend Hitler saying that Stalin killed a lot more poeple.Falacy after falacy.Also, we have stated that democracy is a very authoritarian system. If the problem with democracy is that its very authoritarian why are you insinuating that we want a even more authoritarian system? Its ridiculous, but it shows that you are not addressing any logical point, just repeating the indoctrination you have received.This is obviously an impossiblity, and therefore a beautiful lie so you accept the system. Democracy is designed to take the power away from the people for the political class and their buddies (big bankers and big industrialists).This is the problem with indoctrinated people. They place their hopes in a democratic guy, the guy does what any democratic leader does, abuse the peole, they complain its not real democracy. They place their hopes in a new leader that again does what any democractic leader does, abuse the people, and complain again its not real democracy. They place their hopes in a new leader... I think you get the picture.Be afraid, be very afraid, without democracy dinosaurs will eat your children!!Be afraid, be very afraid!!! (I think Bush is looking for you to hire you as propagandists).And there you go. The childish believe that politicians are looking for you and will restrict big companies. They dont know how to restrict big companies, but they dont even want to. The political power always benefits the people with more money and more capital, allowing them to avoid competition with regulations, and fuck the consumer.And ending with an ad-hominem. Bravo!Honestly, how anyone can consider this rational thiking is beyond me. I honestly hope that bitcoins crash a bit so the speculation frenzy dies, people is more wary of buying bitcoins just because it will go up in price and people start thinking of bitcoin more as a currency to earn through business. But I guess this phase we are seeing is inevitable. Ron Paul is the republican candidate that polls higher against Obama. Hopefully and then you will realize you can not calculate the demand for money because nobody is able to access the needed information.Btw, you can keep trying to explain how you can calculate the demand for money. Its entertaining. Stop lying. He did not write them and he did not managed the Ron Paul newsletters. Lew Rockwell was the one managing his newsletters and some have accused Lew of writting some of those because of the writing style but nothing is confirmed. So please stop, what do you gain from lying about Ron Paul?Im an atheist and I would be happy to have Ron Paul in the White House. Ron Paul did not say or write this things. Its there in the wikipedia page. And this has any resamblance with what happens in reality how? And there you go, you are just doing some nasty approximations, because you have no way of determining the demand for money (bitcoins). Specially calculating the rise in prices is an utopy. Your system would probably do more harm than good.There is also the problem of implementation that is basically imposible because you dont know if MtGox will exists in the future or if it will the majoritary exchange. And why are you deciding that the dollar is the only reference? And even if you include all the other currencies, how do you weight each currency?You cant, but even if you did, you are not yet having a mesure of the demand for money, because the exchanges are not the only factor in the bitcoin economy creating demand for money.Again, how do you measure the demand for money? [quote author=cloud9 link=topic=57.msg171509#msg171509 date=1307294917it was a comment addressing this issue, and your comment on it being impossible to measure the demand for medium of exchange:[/quote]But you are not mesuring the demand for money (bitcoins), you are just keeping bitcoin nominally in line with dollars.Again, how do you measure the demand for money?PS: In the example you have eliminated the currency. The problem with that equation is that it does not take into account the changes in the valuation of the currency. But I dont want to discuss about the equation. I want you to answer how do you measure the demand for money. Where are you getting this calculation from?If I suspect correctly you are trying to keep the price of bitcoins nominally stable in dollars (I can not be sure until you tell me where you get that number). Why would you want to keep bitcoins nominally in line with the dollar? And more important, how does that answer my question?PS: The M*V = P *Q equation is wrong, but I am accepting for the sake of argument. +1Yo lo único que añadiría sería una sección para comerciar. Ya que tenemos una sección en castellano y seguramente habrá gente geograficamente cercana, deberíamos aprovechar para comerciar entre nosotros. You are 100% right.Democracy is just political darwinism. Its a unfair and authoritarian system designed to benefit the political and banking class at the expense of the rest. There is a really good book called "The myth of the rational voter" that I always recomend. Yes, but that was not the question. The question was: how do you mesure the demand for money? alexk, how are you going to measure the demand for money?Hint: its impossible.Offtopic:This is how central banks promised they would opperate, its not how they actually operated.   LOL I agree. The price of bitcoin will suffer a drop at some point and Im curious to see the reaction fo the community. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp5hMiTS2dg You can have the public/private pool idea implemented with a fallback to mining on your own if both go down. That way even if the private pools are compromised, the miners will keep mining for themselve until the pools are back up again and the network wont be compromised. The thing is that you have several historic examples (Scotland, Canada, USA, ...) were there was free banking, taht means no central bank and no centalised credit regulations, and fractional reserve banks behaved. They were really afraid of bankruptcy, and actually there were very few bankruptcies. Check this out: http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=774
Actually, The Secret of Oz is even worse than The Money Masters. As I told you this would require a discussion on basic economic theory that could take pages to write. All I can do is give you a brief peak at parts that are wrong on the movie, as I already did, and point you aout to books with satisfactory economic theory and history. Btw, Peter Schiff follows the austrian school of economics of which Murray Rothbard is one of the big figures and that contradicts a lot of the things that The Money Masters says.Its ok. You dont have to believe me. Its good policy to not believe anything anyone says on the internet. But if you keep reading and researching about monetary theory and history you will realize how many lies there are in the movie and how it manipulates to sell their talking points, as it happened to me. So you feel its ok that The Money Masters lies about Lincoln?Btw, I usually agree with the videos of NIA, but behind NIA there is a scammer. Watch out for that.Murray Rothbard is considered the father of the modern libertarian movement. Just check him out before talking about sheep and obbey authorities and more stuff. I agree with what you are saying in general about the system creating excessive debt and it being a form of slavery. But the excessive debt is not created by fractional reserve banking alone. Only when you put a central bank behind the fractional reserve system it becomes inflationary, as the central bank is taking the risk away and allowing the banks to inflate. But fractional banking alone is not inflationary, since the risk of going bankrupt keeps the temptaion of credit expansion in check. There are several historic examples of how fractional banking alone is not inflationary. I did more than pointing that quotes are not real. I pointed out big "problems" on the way Lincoln is described. As I said to point out everything I would need to write pages and pages, and that is a work I can do if someone is willing to pay for it because it would take me weeks to do properly.But the fact that the movie quotes some false cites shows how careless they were in the historic part (which is the whole point of the movie).EDIT: I can recommend you some books about monetary history if you are interested. For example, Rothbard's "History of Money and Banking in the USA: ..." is a good start: http://mises.org/resources/1022EDIT2: I understand your disconfort about discovering that the movie has a lot of bullshit. I felt the same way. I actually got interested in monetary history because of that movie (and "From Frdedom to Fascism"). But when I started reading more academic books I realized how flawed (and outright lying) that movie was. I was extremely deceived, as I imagine you might feel now.EDIT3: I just realize you are asking for proves about the quotes not being real. Thats not how it works. You (or the one claiming the quotes) have to prove that they are real. The Jefferson one is easy to disprove because the word deflation was not used back then. The Woodrow Wilson one is false becuse there is basically no evidence that he said it. I would need to do a whole tesis pointing out the faults of The Money Masters. But I will give you a couple of examples:1. Several quotes in the movie are false. For example, the Jefferson one about banking institution. Another false one is the Woodrow Wilson cite about regreting the creation of the Fed, there is no record that he said it.2. The Money Masters paints Lincoln as a anti-banker president that fought against the centrallized control of money. It even insinuates in a very obvious way that Lincoln was killed by the bankers as revenge. But in reality Lincoln passed the National Bank Act when the war was finishing that centralized the credit in the big banks of New York and gave them the power to inflate the money supply and charge interest on it. How can you ignore something as big as this? Because it does not fit in the lie they want to sell about Lincoln being anti-banker.Central banking is a problem, and I want to close the central banks, but that movie is just wrong. Actually, Austrian theory explains perfectly the Tulip bubble. During the time the Tulip bubble happened there was a big influx of gold and silver coming from America to Europe. Therefore there was a big expansion of the money supply, which austrians predict will cause bubbles, and it is what happened.There were bubbles in all Europe, but there was a large influx of gold towards Holland (thus creating the most famous Tulip bubble) becaus of the fame of the Bank of Amsterdam. More info here: http://mises.org/daily/2564 (its long, you can download as pdf, and you will find the data about the monetary expansion) The Efficent Market Theory is not a theory that describes reality. It can be used for some specific cases where the conditions are very close to the conditions required by the EMT. But in general the EMT does not hold.According to the proponents of the EMT bubbles should not even happen. Eugene Fama, one of the most famous proponetnts of the theory, has denied that bubbles exists. Go figure. Hahaha. Great idea. Someone should write to the producers. Its not a good answer, for two reasons:1. Price deflation does not stop growth. The answer to those people is pointing out that their theories are wrong, as multiple historic evidence show. In fact, inflation stops growth because it creates malinvestments.2. You are asuming that growing means consuming more resources, but growing can mean consuming less resources. For example, we have today computers that consume less electricity and have more computing power than computers built 5 years ago. We have grown increasing productivity by discovering new technology and has allowed us to have more with less resources. The problem is not with bitcoin, its with the Efficient Market Theory, that is basically wrong.Dont get me wrong, markets are efficient, just not in the way described by the Effcient Market Theory. Not only that. The Money Masters has big historical mistakes and is a very misleading film.I actually got interested about central banking after watching The Money Masters and when I started reading about monetary history I got very deceived since I discovered that The Money Masters is a very misleading movie, with big big historical mistakes.I would not recomend anyone watching it. The central banks must be criticized for the right reason, not with more lies. Its not the same. The part that takes the decissions inside the Federal Reserve System are agencies of the federal government. Bernanke and the rest of the gang are nominated by the president and ratified by congress. How is that a private institution? How is a corporation any similar? Yes corporations get privileges from the government but they dont have a federal government agency as ruling institution... +1People dont understand value and money. No. Most countries have legal tender laws which means you dont have freedom of contract. If you write a contract and demand to be payed in bitcoins, gold, blue shoes, whatever... you can not enforce it. If you go to court to demand payment the court will allow the counter part to pay you bank in the legal tender currency (dollar, euros, ...) because by law legal tender means its valid to reapy any debt.Btw, when you voluntarely sign a contract, it is not initiation of violence if I demand that you fulfill your contract. And please lets stop with this inernet meme that the Federal Reserve is a private bank. Its not. And most of the central banks of the world are not private, like f.e. the European Central Bank. And even in the few cases where the central bank is private, it only gets the power because of the government charter.Its quite irrelevant that the central bank is government owned or private, the problem is that a central bank exists. No. Money always appears naturally and it is later that governments monpolize it. Study your history.Most of them. During the middle ages there were numerous private mints for example.Governements did not chose gold and silver as money, they just monopolized their use with regulations once they were widely used as money by the people.So?The whole point of bitcoin is that is not government backed. That is the reason most of us trust it. If you study history ALL governments have debased the currency. For some it has taken longer, for others shorter, but ALL have debased the currency. So if you trust the government currency you are up for a surprise. Because Bitcoin is not a government system I trust it. If the government issued a bitcoin similar system I would not trust it.And if you have a currency not backed by the government but a centrallized organization backing it you have high probability of being regulated or even banned by the government to stop you from competing with their currency. Check the recent Liberty dollars case.What you dont seem to like of bitcoin is the exact reason why I like it. People tend to focus too much in the inflation is theft problem and leave asside the biggest problem of inflation: the discoordination that creates in the market that leads to inefficiencies, lower standard of living and boom and bust cycles.You can have no increase in prices even if there is (monetary) inflation because of productivity increase. But that does not mean everything is fine and dandy. During the roaring 20's Fisher congratulated the Federal Reserve for how well they managed the money supply. There was no price increases in the CPI index. Keynes said in 1927 that they had now control over the economy and crsis were a thing of the past. On the opposed side, Mises and Hayek warned of a coming crisis. Mises even rejected a well payed job at a major bank and stayed in his low paying job as academic (his wife wasnt happy about it) because he said the banks were going bankrupt and he didnt want his name associated with it.Then the 1929 crash arrived and developed into the Great Depression because of the interventionist policies of Hoover and FDR. And btw the bank Mises rejected did go bankrupt. What did Mises and Hayek saw or knew that Keynes and Fisher didnt? Why those two that are still today considered valid economists got it so wrong? Both Keynes and Fisher went bankrupt themselves in the Great Depression. Keynes came from a wealthy family so his parents came from England and rescued his mess. Fisher lost all of his family savings but was given a job at a elitist university so he could earn some money.So again, the price index were flat under the Federal Reserve management during the roaring 20's. What did Mises and Hayek saw or knew that Fisher and Keynes didnt? Its simple. It does not matter if the price index is flat, (monetary) inflation can still cause changes in the relative price levels of the different goods in the market creating disbalances that produce inefficient outcomes and if continued for some time bring about a crisis as the only way to correct those inbalances. Fisher and Keynes focused so much in aggregates, analizing all the goods as if they were the same goods, that did not take into account the distortions inflation causes even when price index are flat.As conclussion, inflation does finance the government and the banking sector at the expense of the rest, but so do taxes and people tend to accept them beter. The real problem with inflation is that distorsts the capital structure making the system less efficient, more wasteful and makes everybody poorer. And vendors can easily adapt to having different e-currencies, because a website can automatically adjust prices and even automatically exchange from one e-currency to the one preferred by the vendor. I mean that the vendor could deal only in currency C, but accept currencies A, B, C and D. When someone goes to his/her website and pays in currency B, the system can automatically send that money to an exchange and receive payment in currency C. That way the vendor only deals with his preferred currency while still accepting a lot of them. In an unregulated economy the cost of the exchange would probably be minimal, there could even be vendor associations that exchange the currencies among themselves, a sort of vendor cooperative exchange.PS: There goes my part to get the post back on track.
You really think someone has 95% of the bitcoins in existance? But lets assume it for the sake of the argument, what would he/she gain from crashing the value of bitcoins? You are defining what a currency is: an object that by mutual agreement everybody starts using as means of exchange. It is only later that governments come and create a monopoly.How do you know you will go to the supermarket next week and there will be food? There is no government law that forbids all supermarkets from closing. How do you know it wont happen? Are you actively planning for such an eventuallity? Same with Bitcoin.Its quite sad that you think that only through government can things work, when reality shows us that its the other way around. Hahaha, priceless threat. So basically you want to ban lending but not stricly ownership. Now that you have stated what you think is moral, I would like to understand why (and please, for the sake of understanding, keep the clear and understandable language going on). Bitcoin is not a monopoly by any means.There are other currencies around. Even not countirng government imposed currencies (these are the true monopoly) there are other competing currencies around.But even in the case you want to reduce the market to p2p anonymous currencies (and lets assume Bitcoin is the only one in this sub-market) its still not a monopoly, because any competitor can freely enter the market. Being the only producer is not a monopoly, being the only sactioned producer is a monopoly.No, and big time no. Nobody here is unjustly enriching from others. Nobody is taking huge profits from anyone. We early adopters took a risk and also had vision to believe in this project, others didnt, and well see who was right and who deserve a reward.If Bitcoin fails should I go and demand that the others compensate me for the benefits they got while I was dedicating time to Bitcoin? No, that would be unjust. I have dedicated a lot of time to study economics, specially monetary policy and history. All that kwoledge adquired by my own dedication, part of my personal and limited knowledge of the world, has led me to believe in this project. Also, I was there surfing the internet and kept myself informed. Then I spent time promoting Bitcoin and trying to collaborate with the community in this forum. Other people used their time in other things that, given their personal limited knowledge at that time, though it was better for them. If Bitcoin fails do I have the right to demand that they give part of their profits to me? Why am I being unjust, if Bitcoin finally takes off and my efforts are early adopter help to bring a better world with this new currency?Everybody has limited and local information, and based on that we make our decissions and take our rewards and our lessons. Trying to play god, assume you have all the information and can judge the motivations and situations that led to this outcome is just for dictators.PS: On more practical grounds, I highly doubt in the future a scenario like the one you describe happens. People just will start using bitcoins because it will be useful to them somehow. I am 100% sure that someone will try to fork the chain and create a inflationary version, but I am 100% sure as well he will fail. History proves that inflationary voluntary currencies just die. Only way you can keep inflating away a curency and having people accept it is using violence. Without government backing, a inflationary currency dies. Imagine the situation in one or two years, where more and more business are starting to accept bitcoins. Now another group starts a new chain, and then another one, so we have three e-currencies. The problem for the two new ones is that nobody is accepting them, the companies only accept bitcoins. It would be difficult for the new currencies to be accepted by the business because no one uses them, and no one uses them because no business use them. So people will continue to use the original bitcoins and not the other currencies.Now, lets imagine the new e-currencies are started by a group of merchants that accept them as a way to promote the new currency. Only in this case its posible that the new currency gets some traction and competes with the original bitcoin. But if there are already a bunch of e-currencies I doubt people will start using one more.I personally think that having three or four e-currencies competing is good and I hope that with time appears competition. Having only one currency is probably not the safest situation.Having competing currencies is normal in human societies, its how humans have lived most of the time. But presently we have grown so used to live under a money monopoly that its hard to think how it would work. Its funny and sad at the same time. There is a difference. If you don't like the word lord, then think of rent, or loan with interest.[/quote]You have not answered. Stop hiding behind rethoric and answer clearly.In the example above, the original, how can I know if someone is just obtaining surplus in a moral way (according to you) or someone is obtaining a surplus inomorally (according to you)? The other side of the story is that saving for yourself and then using that capital becomes easier, so people can start their own projects without going so much into debt and depending so much on the banks. Inflation on the other hand promotes debt.About the farmers of dustbowl I guess you are referring to the incident during the Great Depression. The thing is that inflation propagandists always point to deflation for making loans more dificult to pay, but always hide that during the roaring 20's it was the inflationary policies of the Fed that promoted the creation of all that debt. Without inflation all that debt would not have been there and the crash of 1929 would not have happened. No, most of the economists dont think like this. Still using the argument of "most people think like this" thus you are wrong is extremely weak, borderline manipulative.There is nothing wrong with prices going down, no matter how many times you repeat the same idea. Repeat it again, still wrong.Bretton Woods was designed in a way that this was unavoidable. The USA kept printing more dollars than gold had and finally it could not pay. In fact the story of how the USA government gradually took over the monetary system its very interesting. It shows why fiat currencies, even if they claim to be backed by gold dont work. Competing currencies dont suffer from this problems. Bitcoin is not deflationary in the monetary sense. The Bitcoin economy will opperate under constant lowering prices. There is absolutely no problem with that, despite all the wackos out there trying to say the contrary.Prices adjust donwards. The video proves nothing. I dont see how the market failed the painter. You just have repeated the history, not addressing any argument. Knowledge will always be imperfect, this is something free marketeers have assumed since always. It was only neoclassicals and keynesians that assumed that information was perfect until recently.Btw, the art trader also suffers from imperfect information. He is also taking a risk. For example, what if the artist is a pedophile, gets famous thanks to his support and when the news gets out the art traders career gets ruined and all his efforts building a consumer base goes to nothing? Is that the market failing to the art trader?You are assuming that people will be completely different depending on the name you asign to them. It makes no sense. I have discovered that people that define themselves as austro-free-marketeers tend to be very moral and very consumer driven producers.No its not. Just because you repeat something again and again without justification, it does not become true. We dont live in a free market world. We live in a social-democrat system. If by capitalism you mean the present system, then yes, we should live in a better world. The problem is that people is very selfish and prefer to believe in fantasies that make their ego feel good and not real solutions. No, you have it backwards.If there was a free market consumer presure would force food companies to label their products with the information, and probably there would appear other companies with higher standards hiring employees.But the governments appears and regulates so companies can avoid competition and dont have to listen to consumer demands. Then politicians go and promote the idea that regulations help you, and its easy since very few voters read and understand the regulations.You have example after example of this. For example, I remember a one man beer production company that started to get famous locally and started to take a big part of the market. The beer companies came quickly and made the government regulated sending the guy out of business.It is really naive to believe that government regulations are there to protect you. I did use the dictionary. It says to lord is to treat with arrogance. But I still dont understand what it means to "lord over someone with a potato"... You keep using subjective terms as if they were objective. How can I know if someone is "lording the potatos"? I could ask you what your feeling are about something, but that is not way to create a system. I dont understand your distinctions, they are not clear, they always use subjective terms, that basically express how you feel about something. It seems to me that the same fact could be moral and inmoral to you depending on the rethoric used.Can you please explain to me in clear terms this:Why someone selling a potato and obtaining a surplus is just trading and its moral, but someone else selling a potato and obtaining a surplus is "lording the potatos" and its inmoral? I was laughing when I read that and I dont even know what it means. You can not keep introducing new terms, you are complicating the debate, not making things more understandable. You know what they say: if someone is using complicated words and mudding the debate it can be because of two reasons: 1) He/she has no idea what he/she is talking about, or 2) deception.Try to explain things clearly. "Lording a potato" is not a clear or self-explanatory concept. No. Even if you count government debt at the central bank as real debt (in reality its not), you have as much money as debt in circulation.Even accepting the previous as true (its not), I dont see how "the only way to keep this going is to continually accelerate the rate of growth of the economy"... I dont really understand what this sentence mean. I dont understand what you are saying. Injecting physical resources?!?No. The reason why the inflationary cycle becomes unsustainable is because the distortion in the capital structure create inefficiencies and malinvestment. As the system becomes less and less efficient at the end the system collapses.Interest rates go down as a way to keep the malinvestments that the inflationary cycle created going (that obviously produces diminishing returns). It has nothing to do with diminishing returns from resources or technologic advances. There were economists some decades ago trying to relate business cycles with technology changes but it was a complete failure, basically because they are not really related.Yes, this is absolutely true. Although I am not sure if keynesians in general know what they are doing or are just completely clueless and the whole thing just blows up because its not sustainable. Maybe some at the top know, there really is no way to tell.I think we kind of agree but the problem is how you use the word "growth".From how you are using the word growth it really seems you mean GDP. How do you define growth?It would be interesting to have statistics in terms of real resources and not money. But it is impossible or extremely difficult; its not that someone is trying to avoid that type of analysis. How do you clasify objects?. Imagine only the computer industry. How many types of computer do you report? If you aggregate too much you are loosing valuable information, if you dont the data becomes unmanageable. That is why the price system works. The problem is that the price system is so completely distorted by the monetary manipulations of the governments that it just becomes too dificult to know what changes come from supply and demand of the goods and what part comes from monetary manipulation. It is a big issue.While I agree that in some way it would be good for Germany to decouple from the euro (it has the problem that it loses a big market that controls), the other part is just not true. The Germany economy has always been strong, way before the derivatives growth. Since Weimar and the National Socialists, the germans have always had a strong currency policy that has allowed them to build industry.The reason why a strong and stable currency helps to build industry is simple. Inflationary monetary systems distort the natural interest rates and produce a series of malinvestments. While the manipulation goes on this investments appear profitable (this is the bubble), but then they come crashing down and they reveal as malinvestment and waste. Now this is a lost opportunity and wasted resources, that could have been dedicated to built a sustainable industry. In the short run inflationary countries can give the appareance of growth, because of all the econimic activity of the bubble, but in the medium and long run its ruinous.I would point out that the currency that Germany is using now is the Euro... Capital is defined as the goods that help create other goods. For example, a shovel is a capital good. It helps you produce other stuff. Its not the stuff you want to consume. This definition is the traditional definition. Even Karl Marx uses this definition.But in the financial circles because they only see money, capital has started refering to money, and this has moved onto some economists. But the definition of capital is stuff that helps you produce other stuff. Money, except in the financial world, is not strictly capital.I dont really see the connection. Central planning means organizing the production of a society. How is the Bitcoin algorithm central planning?Its not really ficticious, it measures economic activity, but it can be distorted if the price system is distorted.But I really think you are using the word growth as increase in the GDP. I would like to know your exact definition of growth. This is the most ridiculous definition of capitalism I have yet read. Come on, you are using all type of subjective concepts as if they were objective. It does not make sense at all. Yes.Also, you are only considering consumption in your model. But savings are usually used for investment through the financial system, so an increase in savings is not less money in the economy, its just less money being used for final consumption and more money being used for capital building. The transmission from savings to investment is not 100% but with a competitive financial system it does not create problems. Please, lets keep a sane debate. The middle point is not an argument. If it were slavery would still be around because you dont want to completely remove slavery, you want to find a good balance somwhere in the middle, right?  Governments messing in the currency markets have always created problems and poverty.And please, from the previous comments, always remember that increase in GDP is an increase in economic activity, not necesarely growth. No, it doesnt.Wrong again. The central bank system (which is what I am guessing you mean by debt-based economy) creates discoordination in the economy and stops growth. It creates malinvestments and crisis.If by growth you mean an increase on the GDP then yes, inflating away and then reporting a funny CPI will increase the GDP. But increase in GDP does not mean growth. GDP reports economic activity, not growth.err... The central bank is a central planning system. Even Karl Marx advocated a central bank.Why? I dont see why. Germany has had strong currency compared to the rest of the world and has built a lot of capital.Never mind, you are using capital as money, not as machines and objects that help produce stuff.And yes, when governments start messing and centrally planning the currencies bad things happen.Again, increase in GDP does not mean more growth. Amazon is not that stupid.Right now the price of bitcoins go for under 1 dollar. Why would Amazon start accepting bitcoins at 2 dollars? But hey, lets suppose they do because I guess you mean they want to raise the price. Two things could happen:1) Everybody starts selling (or using) their bitcoins to Amazon since they are paying more than double their present price. Now Amazon has all the bitcoins. Now the Bitcoin community starts a new bitcoin chain and the Amazon bitcoins are worth nothing. Amazon has lost a lot of money (and if I remember correcly the value of the bitcoin economy is over 4 million dollars, thats a lot of money) and has given us a free ride.2) Not everybody sells (or uses) their bitcoins to Amazon, but Amazon setting that price affects the market pushing the exchange rates towards those 2 dollars. Now amazon has a lot of bitcoins because its buying them to keep that rate. You explain that Amazon could start selling them, but what would happen is that as Amazon stops buying at 2 dollars/bitcoin and starts selling the price would drop abruptly. Amazon would have buyed a lot of bitcoins at 2 dollars and would have to sell way under that price. Amazon loses a lot of money again, and gives a free ride to some of us.There is no way Amazon (or anyone) is that stupid.
There you go:Catalan: http://www.easy-share.com/1914371366/What_is_Bitcoin%20(cat).srtSpanish: http://www.easy-share.com/1914371386/What_is_Bitcoin%20(es).srt*I dont know how long they will be up in that free server, but if you have any problem just send me a private message and I will send them again. Isnt this contradictory? Is there an organized effort to add translated subtitles to the video? I volunteer myself to do the catalan and spanish translation, but it would make my life much easier if I could get the english subtitles (if they exists). Fucking amazing. I agree. Profit in the monetary sense is not the only motivator (although it is a motivator), it might not even be the most powerful one (its all about sex...  ). And this is a problem I often find in the freedom movement. Saying that people are profit maximaxers is a simplification and its a wrong simplifications. In economics even austrian economists does not assume people are pfofit maximazers.For me profit and loses are important, but not mainly as a motivator, but more as a signal for resource allocation. Without a system of profit and loses there would be no economic coordination and there would be no progress. From a society point of view that is the value of profits and loses. No its not inmoral.The painter gained two things:1) Exposure thanks to the previous work of the art merchant who worked his ass to gain a costumer base and a reputation.2) Exerience. Next time he wont sell so cheap and will bargain more. This is actually the biggest benefit the painter got, but this is just my (obviously subjective) opinion. Yes, you use force to defend from the agression. Well, most Nordic countries have privatized government programs (meaning private companies are payed by the government to provide services like school, health care, etc... No public employees). Its a mixed system. Also, there is petrol there.And if you look the statistics the nordic countries are not that well off compared to the USA. The Nordic countries would be one of the poorest states (GDP per capita) if they joined the USA. Also, the nordic countries builded their industry during their more free market era. During the 80's they went more into social-democracy and went bankrupt. Since then the social-democrats were voted out of the government and changes towards more free market policies were implemented. Right. I guess that when people were debating about slavery, you would not have sided in favor of ending slavery completely because it was too extreme. Lets just stay in the middel and defend a bit of slavery, otherwise you would be defending an extreme option and "bad things tend to happen".The idea that the center point is the right answer is not only ridiculous, but also depends on how you focus the debate. Its basically nonsense. The USA is not going to be so lucky as to get a lost decade like Japan.Japan had exports, high rate of savings and a world economy that was not in recession. All those factors produced a carry trade that helped Japan money printing to not make prices rise (removing trade barriers with China and allowing cheap products into the country also helped).The USA does not have any of those and its going to suffer an inflationary crisis, stagflation. People is going to look at the Japan lost decade with envy. Some at the Mises Institute are too atached to gold, but there are a lot of misesians in the bitcoin community. What the fuck is a public good? I never got the concept.Its either a private good or a government good. I guess you could make something you own public if you signed a contract allowing anyone to use it, but I wonder how that would work. Housing for example. There is too much capital created for housing during the previous years. All that capital could have been used to created capital that created production more according to consumer needs. There is no excess production capacity, just production of the wrong type for the present demand.Slack capacity is an aggregate and thus is quite useless to understand what is going in the economy. Why does it matter if there is a lot of construction machinery stopped if there is not enough demand for houses anymore. Does stopped construction machinery means anything if there is a growing demand for computer chips? or if price of food is going up? All this construction machinery is slack or malinvestments? We could try to worship a golden caw so the prophet comes down from mount Sinaí... or something like that. Another evidence on how money arises naturally in the market, this time a very curious one.This is an explanation on why the game developers decided to change the game monetary system and the restults they got.Previously the game imposed a unique currency that they called "gold". But dont get fooled by the name. This "gold" currency was fiat. You would get "gold" for killing monsters and other tasks and the game could create as much as it needed. To avoid inflating too much they had some artificial "gold" sinks where you had to perform certain tasks regularly that would consume "gold". It was a imposed and centrally managed currency.But this system promoted a bunch of unwanted behaviours (just like in the present system, who would have guessed right?  ) and they observerd other RPG games to see how they dealt with the monetary issue. They liked how the monetary system behaved in some games, and discovered those games had no centrally planned and mandated currency system, and that competing currencies had arrised naturally, using scarce items in the game.They are implementing a competing currency system now and they are very happy with the preliminary results. Who would have guessed The whole thing is an interesting read and put a smile in my face to see the ingenuity of this people and how they found out in practice that voluntary exchange is always the best solution: http://pathofexile.com/news/2011-02-08/dev-diary-currency Government printing money.The government does not directly decide to print money, but when the central bank monetizes government debt its equivalent to government printing money.[1] So basically the amount of money increases definitevely due to government spending through monetized debt.Btw you dont need an increasing money supply to pay interests (it just makes it more easy to repay but its not necessary).[1] Monetizing government debt is equivalent to government printing money: The central banks always keep renewing the government debt and buying more, they always increase the amount of government debt they hold in the medium and long term (you can easily check this). Therefore the principal never gets payed back because its always renewed. What about the interests? The interests the government pay on the debt is central bank benefit. The benefit of the central bank goes back to the government (in the case of the fed weekly). Therefore the government get the interests back. Its like if it never payed them.If the principal will never be repayed and the interests are not payed either... its not debt. In reality its just an accounting trick. The central banks use the government debt to inflate. When the government spends through monetized debt, its spending printed money (not debt). The thing is that a lot of crisis (not all though) are usually related to problems and disruptions in the money market, therefore having a local currency does help weather the crisis. Even when the crisis is not directly related to monetary issues having a local currency can also help by making local intereactions easier. +1Also, conspiracies dont have to produce the expected effects. I am sure there are a lot of unintended consequences. Central planning does not work and it applies also to conspiracies. There is nothing wrong with this. I have always though and history also indicates the same that having local currency complementing a more global currency is positive because it helps isolate your local economy from economic problems in other place. For example, the north of Brasil has a local currency and they have weather this crisis very well. Switzerland has a long tradition of private currencies and have achieve better prosperity (not the only reason obviously). Nowadays swiss companies have a private currency system that they use to lend and borrow between associates of the system, and all the industries acknowledge that it has been a key factor to mantain economic stability.Having a local currency is very positive. It helps you isolate you from external shocks.
Kiba already explained perfectly why its not true that the factory owner sets wages. If it were true most employeers in the USA would pay only minimum wage. The reality is that only 4% pay minimum wage.Now, it is true that government regulations hurt the workers position when negotiating a wage and allows the factory owner to pay less for labor. But this is not a problem of the free market, its a problem of state capitalism or corporate socialism (Ill let you choose the label).Again, I would like to know why you think its wrong. I agree in a lot of things with socialists, specially mutualists, but I really dont get this obsession with demonizing wages.The anarcho-communist communities did not live enough to see what would have happened. How do you interpret that they not were able to organize and defend themselves? Also its important to notice that some of this communities became extremely morally repressive even banning alcohol. In some few cases they even became murderers.Also, all societies that are capable of lasting die from within. Its human nature. People get used to the institutions that gave them prosperity and take them from granted. Then they start neglecting this institutions assuming the prosperity will last. Its nothing extrange, it happens to all systems because its human nature.Btw, I dont think the American West as a whole is an example of anarchy. Some regions and some zones in particular were, but not all, although there is no doubt there were freer than today. Ah, the irony. I am still researching the security part myself. I discovered libertarianism 4 years ago and it has been quite a intellectual travel, since I was a socialdemocrat, raised by socialdemocrat parents. What catched my eye was economics and I have focus in that part (and I have ended up writtign weekly in a national media of my country which I never expected to) but I am not so knowledgeable in other areas.But for example, I have read about a nordic society in the middle ages that was basically voluntarely. It worked as a sort of "clans" but not clans as we understand them now. They were voluntary clans, where you could join and leave them freely. It was obviously a problem to not be in one of this organization since you had no protection or legal system, but competition worked. The society lasted 200-300 years. As an example, while in mainland Europe the literature heroes were all warriors, in this area the literature heroes were lawyers... Tell me which one do you think was a most violent and underdeveloped society. Why do you keep bringing the present corporate system like if it is something we defend or support? In  general libertarians oppose the present system as interventionist and government ruled, included the corporate world. For starters, a corporation is a entity that receives government privileges (it changes from country to country, but it usually involves things like limited liability) and libertarians are opposed to those. Corporations as we know them today are only possible because of government intervention. So please, I know there is a lot of bullshit around the internet with libertarians supporting corporations and stuff, but dont fall for it. Libertarians are not pro-business, libertarians are pro-free market.And answering your concern, its because they would have no other option. Look all the example of unregulated markets (and I mean real unregulated markets, not hyper-regulated markets that are called deregulated for political propaganda). What do corporations do when business goes done? They lower the price, offer a better product or close. Its not that they have many more options. What else can they do if they can not lobby for government violence?The telecomunications sector was usually an example of a sector that the market could not handle because of high natural barriers of entrace (expensive infrastructure). A lot of "economists" (for lack of a better word to describe them) said that only government could provide telecomunications efficently and respecting the poor (the poor is the preferred excuse of statists, like if they really care). Well, Somalia since it became anarchic developed a telecomunications industry that offers the cheapests rates in all Africa... And we are talking about an industry that supposedly the market could not handle. I bring this example, because it shows your misconceptions on how the market dynamics work. Without a government "to protect" the somalies from the private telecomunications companies, why are they getting the cheapest rates? Have the company owners suddenly become good people? Doubtful. Its just that they have no other option than to lower prices to not be eaten by the competition. If you had a government "to protect you", they would have used it to protect the already stablished companies from the competition and keep prices high, with some good sounding and caring excuse. But that wasnt an option, so they lowered prices. This is how things work in real live, not the wacko theories about government protecting people.Again, its not that some person is going to be good or bad because of a different system. Its that the incentives and possibilities are different. Austrian theory does not really talk about debt fuelled bubbles, it talks about inflation fuelled bubbles. It just happens that in the present system the way to inflate is mainly (but not only) through debt, so some people focus on the debt. But there could be other ways. The problem its inflation distorting the natural interest rates.Also, the Fed can say what they want. The Fed also says its there to take care of the value of the dollar. The Fed is not independent. The board of governors is a federal government agency and its members are selected by the president and ratified by congress. You can check the Nixon Tapes to see how a president influences the Fed actions. But even if it was independent, whats your point? That it benefits private companies? Obviously, its a government intervention in the market. We have been telling you that government intervines in the market to benefit a few big companies and this is one of the best examples. Again, libertarians are not pro-business, libertarians are pro-free market. The fact that something is private does not make it libertarian. It has to be free of government intervention.Btw, if people that supposedly cares about the environment started using their money to buy property with natural places they like to conserve, instead of using it for propaganda and government lobbying it would be much more efficiently use for the cause. The problem is that a lot of people that supposedly care about the environment in reality only care about politics. I dont understand why you started discussing about monetary deflation when nobody supports a system based on monetary deflation. But hey, at least we agree. Btw, the fact that people dont buy what they dont need is a good thing.No. Really no. The internet does not transmit all the information a voice conversation does, and I have heard heavy facists stuff coming from interventionist, so I am not surprised anymore. Im glad you were joking though.Yep, all true. Still dodging the question. The collectivist system, the government, is violating individual rights (the property of the natives) to destroy the amazon. Collectivism always promises the moon and delivers destruction and poverty.So many misconceptions in this (and I couldnt but to smile while reading because I use to belive most of it):Its not that a person in charge of a company cares more for you. The same person can be in government and in a private company during his/her live, and he cares for you the same. Its not that the people in government care more or the people in the private companies care more. Its stupid to believe any of those. That is not the point. The important point is that the private sector is designed to focus the incentives towards pleasing the consumer because it can not use violence, it has to get the agreement of the buyer, while the government is a monopoly that uses force to acomplish its goals. Even if a good person gets to be dictator it would probably fuck up big time because there is no way anyone can know the necessities and desires of so many people. This is why voluntary exchange works and violence does not."Old times were always better"... There is a psycological study somewhere proving that the mind tends to focus on the good memories and tries to forget the bad ones, which is why people tend to think that the past is always better.In the past people died everyday, there was rampant malnutrition, slavery, rape, etc... and the leaders did not give a fuck. This idea that old times were better is just fictional. I am glad I dont live in the past seriously, specially because the lower classes had it really tough compared to this days."If you all dont obey ME there will be caos"... Mubarak just used that line in Egypt. When it has been proven again and again that self-organization and spontaneous order always beats central planing, people still believe in the old idea. You know, Im fine with it as long as I get to be in power.  Leaders will always attribute themselves the achievements of a society (and blame the faults on others), when in reality is the people working and cooperating that makes anything possible.Anarchy is order, government is chaos. If it was possible for the government to take control of every aspect there would be caos. Absolute caos and discordination. People would starve. This society only works because there are still some sort of self-organization and spontaneous order in the middle of all the government meddling.Anarchy is not lawless. In fact, laws are respected more in an anarchic system than when there is a centralized system. Everything you said is possible under a non-government system.Yes, definitevely government spending will create a statistical boom. Its just that it wont be a real recovery because the capital created wont be the addecuate to satisfiy the consumer needs and will collapse again.Im not a capitalist, at least not in the popular sense. Im a market anarchists and I share some ideas with some self-proclaimed socialists and some other with some self-proclaimed capitalists. I really think the distinction is bullshit.You seem to imply again that without the government there would be destruction or caos, and therefore anyone that wants to get rid of government is short sighed and crazy. What if what it is short sighted and crazy is believing that without government there would be destruction and caos?. You know, its funny because you see governments helping and enabling the destruction of nature, yet you keep hoping government will do something to stop it. Tell me this: if the majority of the people really wanted to destroy the Amazon to create agricultural land, how is a democratic government going to do anything else than destroying the Amazon? Lets accept your defintions of capitalism and socialism. Why is any of those arrangements bad? (I am guessing you think one of those two arrangements is bad)This is not true. There are examples in history. You can argue its good or bad, but you can not say its impossible.Also, you can not say they did not lasted. Every human society changes for worse and for better. The fact of the matter is that it is possible. And you can not say the prove is that they did not lasted specially when you propose a system that has never existed.So please, explain to me what is wrong with any of those arrangements. But its different with voluntary currencies. If some people abandon bitcoin to start using googlecoin the price of bitcoin will probably go down because there will be less demand for them. If googlecoin creates a new market with different people and does not take users from bitcoin then bitcoin price wont be affected (maybe only the future potential of growth).I still think its silly to trust a corporation money and the people that do will rightly get what they deserve. Hopefully they will learn something. You said people dont buy stuff when prices go down. I said they do. Now you say that you buy stuff you need even when prices go down. You are disagreeing with yourself. This is getting a bit ridiculous. Either people buy stuff (for whatever reasons) when prices go down or they dont.We have been talking of prices going down all the time. If you realize I have been trying to avoid the word "deflation" and always used the expression "prices going down" to avoid confusion. Again you are agreeing with me, people buy stuff when prices go down.Nobody here is advocating persistent monetary deflation as monetary system (at least not me). Anyways, I am glad we came to an agreement.Expreading democracy around the world... Is there anyone that stills believes this bullshit? Havent we seen enough damage and deads in the name of expreading democracy? In case you are interested the expression was coined by the early progressive movement that was a creation of big companies, specially the Rockefeller and the Morgans to create a moral justification to regulate the market and gain competitive advantage through political means. This has been extremely well documented. In fact, the first meeting towards creating the progressive party was full of Rockefeller and Morgan men.There is a saying, that I never remember who said it, but its brilliant and it goes something like this: The more beautiful and utopic the promises from a politician are, the more darker his intentions. This really describes well the idea of "Expreading democracy around the world" that is nothing more than USA imperialism. In fact, its funny because the early progressive economists justified invading other countries by saying that business in the USA was too developed (late XIX century) and the USA government needed to invade other countries to guarantee new markets for the USA industries.About the question, no, I would not justify invading a foreign country to impose any system. We should have learnt by now that the reasons for war are never charitable. The charitable part are just excuses for the mases.Btw, I understand if you dont take my word for all this historic points I made and you can ask for references if you are interested in knowing the origins of the USA progressive movement.The fact that the Amazon was there and its owners did not cut it down should tell you something about it. It took an organized government to do it.I understand you have been educated to believe government cares for you and the environment. I was educated the same way (socialdemocrat parents and socialdemocrat myself until I was 27). Its not that way. Men get together and organize a monopolistic entity only to have control and profit violating other peoples rights.Ok. I understand what you say. Let me make some points.1. Money as debt is not the best source of economic theory. They explain very well how the fractional system works under a central bank, but they never mention the incentives the central bank creates to provoque that behaviour in banks, and they dont explain that without a central bank fractional reserve is very different.2. Now to the point. Government spending can keep the GDP numbers going up. That does not mean economic growth. If you go on debt and start paying people to dig a whole and then cover it back the GDP will go up, but you have not improved the economic situation, in fact you are worse, because you have the same goods (filling and covering wholes produced nothing) and you have more debt.So yes, government spending can create a statistic boom in the economic indicators, but, as I explained before, the government does not know how to satisfy the people, mainly because it does not operate under the price mechanism, so the government spending its just mainly waste (and you can litterally check that with the Obama stimulus and how it was used). It does not lead to recovery. Just for the record, right now its not the time to reduce basic welfare spending like food stamps and stuff like that. The poor people has been hit enough by government regulations, and there is no need to make them pay. There are a lot of places to reduce first. But as government are always an agent for the big interests the reductions are always towards the people.As an example, you have the crisis at the beginning of the 1920's, caused when the bubble created by the Fed to pay for IWW went bust. The president then reduced taxes, reduced spending and the Fed did not had power to inflate until 1922 (it got special powers during the war that were removed when it ended). The crisis started worst than the Great Depression, but it was over in year and a half. Why? Because government reducing taxes and spending allowed room for the market to coordinate itself again. Entrepeneurs created the industries that produced what people wanted (not just government silly spending) and real wealth appeared.The macroeconomic mentallity that any spending is good is totally wrong. You can not pretend that just spending in anything is going to produce real wealth. If you spend in useless stuff in fact you are squandering wealth, and becoming poorer. Yes, spending a lot boosts economic indicators but its not a real recovery, its not sustainable. It will prolong the depression. Yes, reducing government spending will make the economic indicators go down a lot more, but it will lead to a quick recovery. You are not answering to my questions,That is exactly my point and proves what you said before wrong. When prices go down people keep buying.Again, you deflect the issue. Brazil is a clear example of the violation of individual rights (in this case mainly property of the natives) by a collective organization (the brazillian governement). If individualism* was respected in Brazil the Amazon would be a lot better.*Individualism in politics mean respecting individual rights, NOT going along in live. Individualism is a set of rules for cooperation between people.This is totally false. It seems to me you think gov spending comes from nowhere like magic, and also that gov spending is as efficient and looks towards people needs as the private sector. What does this exactly mean? "actual use of production determining production"? I did not cited evidence. I changed paragraph because I was talking about another issue. That is what paragraphs are used for. You are joking right? I live in one of those countries and its not cheaper at all.In fact, Ive gone 4 times to the hospital near my home. Everytime I see people being treated in the corridors because there are no rooms. My aunt had to go to the private clinic because there was a 6 months waiting list to cure her chataracts. Imagine 6 months my old granma without being able to see (she still lives on her own). Thats government "caring" for you. Every winter authorities ask us not to go to the hospital during some weekends because they become totally saturated. Etc...Not all the lines. In fact, there were three lines that made the east-west route first. Two with government help, one private. The only line that its still used is the private one. When you build something thinking in the people needs to get profits you make something useful for the people. When you use the policitcal process you make something useful for a few (the ones that got rich with the government help).Btw, I feel like you are just throwing talking points one after the other, without going nowhere. When your talking points are rebutted, you throw more. What are you trying to say? If the person that generated the bitcoins joins the network before any other has found the bitcoins, it should be fine. First to notify the network the discover is the one that gets the bitcoins. Im not sure, let the comitee decide it. You forget that all this corporations rised thanks to regulations and privileges from the governments. Thats democracy. You are proving my point. You keep claiming that democracy is for the people, I keep saying that democracy is to take the power away from the people. Look around you and tell me which one it is.Bush run an anti-interventionist campaign and then became the war president. Obama promised the sky... Democracy is political darwinism, the best lier wins.And if you start talking about direct democracy lets check California. They voted to ban gay marriage and to ban marihuana. Why should gay people not be able to marry just because the majority decides its not ok? Thats democracy baning gay marriages. I think its inmoral, and anyone with half a heart can see it. Same with marihuana. Haha.The system you advocate is what creates the concentration of power in a few hands. The concentration of wealth that you see around is because of the laws aproved by the will of the majority. By the way, I forget to tell you that the first times that I discover this ideas and real critiques to democracy, I had the same emotional response you are having. I tried to defend it. The system and the politicians repeat the word democracy and associate it with good things all they can (there is a reason for that), so its hard to de-attach yourself from that indoctrination. I went through the same process. Maybe you end up with another conclussion, but really, using violence to impose your will its not moral just because its a big group of people deciding instead of a small one. Hahahaha, nice one. You have not answer to the main issue. You said that you would not buy things if prices were going down, but you have a cellphone and a computer...So? What does this has to do with individual rights? This issue you are talking about can be dealt with private roads.Right, and they would reduce their soil quality and hurt their property in mass. I dont know the system in Bangladesh, but it sounds terribly similar to India, where the market was accused, and turns out the problem was that government imposed regulations to favour Monsanto seeds that comsumed much more water. I am sure that if I dig into Bangladesh agricultural system something similar will come up.Right, and where in the process are individual rights respected? Do you realize that in the amazon the government is taking away the land from its rightful owners to allow foreign corporations to cut the trees?................You are confusing things. The money the government is spending its (obviously) "finding its way into the economy". The money that is stuck is the money given to the banks (mainly by the central bank).But tell me how government spending helps the economy.
Democracy is a form of opresion. I think democrats and facists are inmoral people. Democracy is just a lighweigth facisms.I like political discussions, but this is not one. I leave it here for today. There is nothing to regain. The government has always been and always will be a tool of opresion to favour a few at the expense of the many. By supporting it and justifying it you are just giving legitimization to the abuse.This is not entirely true. The word capitalists had been used before Karl Marx by some market anarchists and in a pejorative way. I dont like much the word capitalism. I prefer free market. Its more clear and less politically charged. But a word is just a word, it really does not matter. Ideas its what's important. Voluntarism: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoluntaryismI have no problem if a group of people decide to organize themselves in a democratic way, for example a cooperative business. I think its fine and it can work.But it is very different a voluntary association or organization run by a democratic system, where I can leave the group at any time if I am not happy with how it is managed, than having a democratic system imposed by guns (which is basically a democratic government). A democratic government is soft facisms. History proves that monopolies are a creation of government. There can not be a sustainable monopoly without regulations.The big companies and accumulation of wealth happen because of regulations and government intervention.Perfect information does not exists. Its stupid to define something with impossible demands. Free market does not involve perfect nothing.I dont think you understand what a democracy is. Slavery is perfectly valid under a democracy if the majority of the people votes to legalize it.No, I would not outlaw firearms. I dont understand what it has to do though.I dont like Adam Smith too much, that is true.I really think you dont know what democracy is. Democracy is the rule of the majority. And in real life is a system where the more politically adapted get their way imposed over the rest. No. Democracies are a tool to take away the power from the people. Democracy is political darwinism, where only the better liers and charlatans prosper at the expense of the people that do actual work.What is this true democracy you talk about? We are living in a true democracy and that is why things dont work.First, corporations are a creation of the government. Corporations are a special enterprise with government given privileges.What you meant to say is that private enterprises are not subject to the people. Which is completely false. Private enterprises are way more subjected to the people than any governments. Private firms can not force you to do or buy something against your will. Government can. All a private enterprise can do is offer you a better product in the hope that you will want to buy it. Democratic governments just need to put a gun in your head and you must obey.The free market is absence of regulation. If there are government regulations is not a free market. I dont know why you would abolish slavery just because some abuse their slaves...Democracy is a system so the elite can get their way. Democracy is political darwinism. You are dreaming.The concentration of power happens because of the government, not because of the market. ??I guess you think a true democracy is good. Democracy is the system designed to take away the power from the people while making them think they still have it. Democracy is an authoritarian system. Do you realize cellular phones do go down in prices all the time and you have bought it anyways? It seems to me you are contradicting yourself.Electronics in general go down in price all the time, and people keep buying it. Everybody knows that if they wait 6 months the phone, the tv, the computer,... they are going to buy will be cheaper. And yet, they still buy it.This is actually good. You should not buy anything that you dont want to buy just because you know you need to spend the money before it devaluates. The function of the economy is not to make people consume, consume and consume more. The function of the economy is to provide what people need and want. And if someday (that I dont think I will see) we have too much of everything, that day we can stop working this much and just work 1 day a week (in fact this has happened a bit, since 200-300 years ago, people used to work a lot more hours).Bitcoin is a special case, because is starting, mainly for two reasons.1. As much as it hurts to admit, there is still not much you can buy with bitcoins.2.Also, there is still not a financial system that operates in bitcoins that allows to transmit bitcoins savings into bitcoin investments.This is a fallacy as big as it gets. First of all you need to define what is good for society in general, because this is the typiucal discourse the elite use to mean you do as I command. But assuming you mean what its better for the majority or for the longer term, its still false.Traffic? The first roads in the USA where privately built by cooperatives formed in the different towns. There are examples of private roads that work fine.Environment? Precisely this is an example how the government is managing it and not letting the market manage it by not allowing environmental property rights. You can see the horrible results.Queues?Paying taxes??So? It seems to me you are implying that more spending can heal the economy. If this were true, all the government spening should have taken the USA out of the recession. It has not. Its an economic fallacy.Only the people working and producing what they need through NON DISTORTED market signals are going to solve the depression. All the government spending its hurting the economy.Prices go down if there is less money. Also the banking system reacts (or should react) creating more bills if there is an increase in the deman for money. This is not an issue.I could keep going. When the central bank monetizes the government debt, that is the government printing money, there is no debt there. Now you are saying hey! you just said the central bank bought government debt. Lets see:The central bank buys government bonds and, in the mid-long term, never sells them. If you check any central bank, they just keep buying more and more government debt. There are some short term operations where they sell gov bonds, but in the mid-long run they always increase the amount of bonds. When the bonds mature they renew them. In the mid-long run, central banks always increase their bond holdings. So basically the government is never going to return the principal on a monetized bond, because its always going to be renewed.Now what about the interests? The interests the government pays on the bonds are central bank profits. The central bank profits go back to the government (check the law). So basically the government gets back the interest, its like it does not pay it.So when the central bank monetizes government debt, neither the pricnipal nor the interests are going to be payed in reality. So basically its not debt, its an accounting trick. The central bank uses the government debt as collateral to increase the money supply.If you still think monetizes bonds are debt, I will borrow from you all the money you have in those conditions (not repaying it and not paying the interests). When the central bank monetizes government bonds its equivalent to the government printing money. That tells you something about politicians priorities and how they decided to allocate resources. Really? I remember reading about some libertarians in New Hamshire that used a spare garage in someones house to acommodate homeless people because it was very cold ouside. The government threaten them to close it because they did not have the license. At the end, the government did not have the balls to go ahead. Just an example of the opposite situation. The fact that the government promises a guarantee does not mean its real. It just means its a promise. Lets see how the keynesians spin this one. The price index in the UK is around 4%, yet unemployment is not going down and GDP just slipped into negative again.Thats not suppose to happen because some "economist" say that rising prices promotes investment and spending and reduces unemployment. They also say that prices can not go up when GDP is down and unemployment is high. Reality differs.http://www.zerohedge.com/article/uk-...big-head-scratFor anyone that want to check the Bank of England balance sheet and the reaction to the crisis: http://www.cumber.com/content/misc/boe.pdf Quite impressive. It took a while for the new money to reach the market but its happening.EDIT: The sad part is that keynesians will keep saying that their policies are designed to help the poor, etc... when in reality what is happening is that rising prices are going to hit the unemployed the harderst.  I could not have answered better.The first reaction of an authoritarian is always: "but what about the poor?" like if they really care for the poor and not for power. But this "survival of the fittest" is just a strawman. The market is collaboration, absence of violence.Government is the way some people get to use and justify violence to gain privileges over the rest. With the question I am trying to turn the vision that government is there to help, towards a vision that government intervention hurts.I did not explain myself or you did not get it. I am not saying lefties want a dictatorship (although some do). I am saying that internally and probably without them knowing they want a democracy (because its the polically correct way of thinking) that does what they want. When you talk to central economic planners (and this is true for right wingers also) the problem is always that the government is not doing exactly what they propose. If only the government did want they propose everything would be dandy. This is what I call the semi-god complex. It feels good for the ego.Btw, I am talking about authoritarian lefties (social-democrats and so on). I consider myself a lefty. Dont sell it as a plan to do nothing, because it is not true that libertarians propose to do nothing. Libertarians propose that the government should do nothing, that is extremely different than everybody doing nothing. You should say exactly what you said, that the government should let people self organize and attend their needs locally because government does not have the capacity to provide efficiently and any type of help by the government will in reality hurt people. If you want to be emotional you can ask them if they want to hurt people (it works with lefties).The problem is that it is nice to think that you are some kind of semi-god that can centrally plan and resolve humanity problems, only if you had enough power. Its very nice for the ego, and some people buy it (I know because I did for a long time). Until you dont realize that you are being an egomaniacal fool to believe that you can centrally plan an economy you are gong to keep thinking that just chaning the law to exactly what you propose will solve all the problems of everyone (even when you dont even know the real problems of everyone, its absurd like that). This is not really true even in a central bank system. The fractional banks protected by a central bank do create money through credit, but that does not mean all the money in circulation is debt based, just most of it.And during this crisis it has become evident that considering only the banking system as the source of money in the present monetary system will make you get the economy wrong. Understanding the present banking system is important, but there are more parts to the monetary system. If money was all debt and the banking system was the only way to create/destroy money there would be heavy deflation right now. But there is not. Thanks. Looks interesting.+1 Its even worse.Not only inflation steals from some to give to a few (as you describe it), but it also makes the economy underperform because it creates malinvestments and in extreme cases bubbles. So its not only stealing a part of the pie for a few, its making the pie smaller or not as big as it could be.Inflation really makes the middle class and specially the poor miserable. The EMH is crap. They dont even acknowledge the possibility of bubbles. EMH is used for modeling financial investments mathematically and may have its uses in some specific cases, but as a general economic theory is crap, nonsense. So I would not make much of it. Wow. The most surprising part is that he is a very good bass player. Impressive technique.
Satoshi is a p2p virtual entity. So basically the WIR is a bank in the form of a cooperative using their own privately issue currency, that the business that are part of the cooperative can use to lend to each other.Bitcoin and WIR are similar in the sense that they are voluntary currencies not backed by any commodity. But they are very different in the way they opperate because bitcoin is decentralized and WIR is not, thus changing "the game" completely.I would like to know how WIR creates money or if it opperates on a fixed amount. I could not agree more. Money really is a function, not a determined object. No problem in having your own definition, but when you are talking with someone agreeing in the meaning of the words is needed. Honestly the one I stated is the most common definition of money that I have read. But you might have a different experience. It seems to me it all depends on the definition of money. If you define money as whatever the people uses as medium of exchange, then a currency (or anything) that people uses as money becomes money (and stops being money when people dont use it as money anymore). It seems to me that it is a convoluted way of saying "medium of exchange".Isnt the objective of a currency to be money? There has been a long time since I saw the movie but let me give you a quick list (if you are really interested in some area I can dig up and check some reliable sources about some specific period so you can take your own conclussions):- Several of the quotes he uses on the film I found to be undocumented and dubious, f.e: Widrow Wilson saying at the end of his career that he regrets creating the Fed. It seems he never really felt sorry about it..- During the Lincoln era he seems to imply that he was killed by the bankers because he wanted to keep printing and bankers did not want to. The reality is that the greenback was hyperinflating and the only way to avoid it was to stop printing it. Also, Lincoln approved a banking act at the end of the war that centralized the credit in the banks of New York, so bankers were happy about him.- Then he talks about the silver thing like if it was a popular movement, when in reality it started as a industrialist thing. Actually all that part is horribly explained, and he talks about it like if it was a big crisis and then suddenly after some few years the USA has become a industrialized nation. It does not make sense, because it did not happen that way.Etc...As I said, if you are interested in some specific period I could look for some references so you can read and make your own opinion.  I dont have an opinion on peak-oil. I tried to look at the data but its a very specialized and closed industry so the data did not seem reliable enough, so I dont know if peak-oil is real or not.But no matter if it is real or not it is being used to hide the monetary manipulation and the crisis they produce. Why am I saying this?During the 50's and the 60's there was little talk about peak-oil. During the 70's with the Fed printing like crazy producing stagflation peak-oil was everywhere with "scientists" predicting with mathematical models that there was only petrol for 20 more years and forcing people to believe that petrol was the cause for rising prices. During the 80's no more peak oil. During the 90's no more peak oil. During the 2000's no more peak-oil. And now that there is a new crisis where the central banks are printing like crazy, peak-oil comes to the front again...Peak-oil is somehow correlated with central bank printing...  Now, even if peak-oil was real, the price increase would be progressive and over years. There would be no swings going from $80 to $140, then down to $30 and up to $80 again in like a year or year and a half. This movements are not supply and demand, they are monetary.So it seems quite obvious to me that peak-oil is being used to hide the central bank manipulations. And it seems it will be used again when all the money the Fed has created leaks and prices start rising like crazy.PS: If someone still believes that the 70's stagflation was caused by petrol: http://blogs.forbes.com/johntamny/2011/01/09/paul-krugman-channels-jimmy-carter-and-the-club-of-rome/PS2: And you might want to check some Tomas Di Lorenzo video where he talks about how since the Rockefeller started in the petrol business the government has been promoting the scarcity of petrol. USA government officials said that petrol would never be found in California or Texas for example. EDIT: I found the Thomas Di Lorenzo video (government peak oil propaganda starts at 17:40): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DIuXMJK_YA Correct. Is it possible to develop a system or protocol where the reader recognizes automatically if there is only the address or there is an address plus an amount of bitcoins?EDIT: Maybe something automatic in the URI like: bitcoin://askfj23ljsfd343ljklsfj393elksjdf?pay=30 ? I have no idea how much information you can include in a 3D codebar, but, if possible, it would be interesting to being able to include the address and a quantity in the 3D bar, so with one scan you can get the address and the amount of bitcoins, so you just have to confirm the transfer in the screen (f.e.). Another vote for Ubuntu here. Lincoln/greenback part was horrible, the tally stick part, etc... Its been a while since I watched it. Inflation is when there is an increase of money bigger than the demand for money (not the size of the economy). Ok. So we have settle that repeating the action does not produce the removal of all bitcoins. Now the issue is with the benefits a bank may have.This is not really an issue only for banks. It really is a issue for any business. You could say the same with a factory owner that earns 2K BTC. ¿What if he does not spend it? ¿What if he/she uses them to create new business and try to monopolize the economy? Thats really the question you are making, independent of being a bank or not.The issue is that monopolies are impossible in a free market. Monopolies only happen because of government regulations. If someone is making money in one area (absent of government regulations, like copyright laws or "anti"-trust laws) more competitors are going to enter into the area of business attracted by the benefits. That is why it has been seen empirically that in a free market prices tend to aproach production and labor costs. Also, as the original company gets bigger it gets to a point where it becomes less efficient and the smaller ones can outcompete it. ?? This is wrong. Lets check again:- Bank makes a 100k BTC loan.- Bank introduces 100k BTC into circulation.- Bank eventually gets 105k BTC.- Bank has removed 105k BTC from circulation.- Bank pays expenses of 3k BTC.- Bank introduces 3k BTC into circulation.- Bank loans 100k BTC.- Bank introduces 100k BTC into circulation....In your example, the bank is just adding and removing 100k BTC from circulation (In real life it will be a more smooth and continuos thing). The 2k BTC that gets as benefits will be supposedly spent to buy things the owners need (food, energuy, etc...). No. Simplification is alright. I am talking about distorting history and outright lying. Part of the film is legit, but other parts are simply wrong. That does not mean central banks are fantastic neither. It would only work if you use government regulations to impose it. The only way to create a cartel is government regulations. Cartels dont last long in the free market (as you just witnessed). Its coming to Europe as well. We are organizing protests for the airports, but I fear not a lot of us are going to turn out. I use to love Bill Stills films, specially The Money Masters, until I started studying real monetary history. The movie is a mix of truth and blatant lies. Big disappointment.
There is a myth going around on the internet promoted by some wackos that says: The only way to pay debt and the interests is to print more money. Its false. You could pay a 100.000 dollar debt with a money supply of only 50.000 dollars (for example).You can have interest rates with a fixed money supply. When bitcoin starts developing and being more accepted there will appear bitcoin funds, where you put your bitcoins for a while and they lend them out or invest them. That way bitcoin savings will be also investment and you will get bitcoin interest rates. If gold is really only ornamental it would no way have the price it has now. Give it another tough. Still two hours to go here, butHappy New Year to all my fellow bitcoiners. You know what, despite that hyperinflation will bring pain, this you are decribing might be the most realistic option. Anyways, hyper-inflation of the government currency is going to come at some point, like it has always happened. So one way or the other, its going to happen. This would be extremely bullish for gold.Politicians would start printing money to pay for political favors and gaining votes and the money would depreciate quickly. Check history, for example the assignat in France. I have not found one example in history where politicians printing money directly does not lead to hyper-inflation.Government printing money = gold to the sky. This is basically what is happening with QE2 and the rest to come. A central bank monetizing government debt is the government printing money.The only thing that can bring gold down is if the government decided to default on the debt and start being fiscally responsable. Apart from that, everyone nknows that governments are going to keep printing money to pay the debt. What you say is correct. I should have said that government currencies are always more insecure from inflation than voluntary currencies. If governments use force is another game (not saying you should not take the possibility into account).About the problem of governments controlling the internet the answer is this: http://guifi.net You have a english button there to get a translated site, and you should check the map button on the top right, to see how big is the network. Its basically a private and voluntary tcp/ip network. Problem is with your idea you have to trust politicians to stop printing money at some point and renounce that power, which is as realistic as giving your house keys to a thieve and ask him/her to watch your house while you are on holidays. Close the central bank. The Federal Reserve dollar depreciates quickly due to loosing the monopoly on money and the debt pays itself quickly.Andrew Jackson style. I will never get this. A government currency is always more insecure than a non-government currency, yet people keep thinking otherwise Study history. Governments always try to steal their citizens by debasing the currency.In reality is very simple, a government currency is backed by force. A non-government currency will only take off if it offers a quality currency, otherwise people have no reason to use it. A government currency is imposed by force, there is no incentive to offer a quality currency because people has to accept it anyways and therefore its always debased.Government currencies are always more dangerous than voluntary currencies. I think you wanted to say that bad money drives good money into hiding.This is a very good point, its called the Gresham Law, although Gresham did not discover it and actually promoted bad money.I think this can be a problem for bitcoin, since people will tend to use bad money (dollars, euros, etc...) before spending bitcoins. On the other side since bitcoin is not backed by the guns of any government maybe it pushes in the other direction. I guess I could not let that one pass.I broke Godwins law. Whats the punishment? A bitcoin bank does not make sense. A financial market in bitcoin will be more like investment funds, where you lend your bitcoins and they invest them and receive interest on your investments. But the money would be put to good use (by me obviously). How can you be against putting the money to good use? In fact, you should send me your money to or otherwise you are a horrible person. Yes it will. And we all will thank you.If you are interested in doing so, but in a more ecological way, you can save the electricity and send me the money it would cost you to do such a thing. I will see that the money is put to good use.   I agree with BioMike. You wont be able to convince some people even if you had the most flawless and simplest logical reasoning. As you said is an emotional response.I have been trying to promote bitcoin everywhere, all my facebook contacts know about it, etc... but I know that only a frew will find it intersting. Some people only take the effort to understand something new if its something big enough, if a lot of people is using it. Until then, no matter what you say, this people will reject it. Bitcoin target now is early adopters, people willing to try something new. Dont despair, its normal and it happens with everything new.This is why mainstream media works. If something is broadcasted in mainstream media a lot of people is willing to accept it because they believe is the norm, because mainstream media is followed by a lot of people. They dont really care about its validity (to a point). I personally believe is a mix of two psicological reasons:1) People is lazy and dont want to think, dont trust their own judgement, or both, so they rely in the masses to make decissions for them. If a lot of people is trusting it, it must be ok, right? And if the masses go wrong they wont really be embarrassed because everybody was fooled.2) We all like to feel like we are part of a group. We all are a insecure in some way (some more, some less) and some people know how to use this insecurity by making us feel good by making us feel part of a group, of something greater. This is why all the TV's sell their brands, or why the radio commentators speak like a brother even when they are rich bastards talking to poor people. They have to make you feel part of a group, so once they have the emotional attachment, you will believe what they say and it will be hard for you to refuse it because they give you false emotional confort.This came longer than expected. Basically, keep talking about bitcoin but dont despair. Its normal that only early adopters join. I thin bitcoin is doing great as a community. Now we only need more and more business accepting bitcoins. This has to be a joke right? Who is so dump as to believe the government benefits the working class? Bitcoin solves the problem of central banking. Why? (I have my own opinion, but Im interested in hearing yours). Human necessities keeps things "moving". Why do you want to force consumerism?
There was the liberty dollar, but since it was getting big, it was hit by the Feds. Expiring currency does not prevent hoarding. In fact, it hurts the people that work for a wage more and benefits speculators.Thinking that an expiring currency will avoid hoarding is extremely shortsighted (another discussion would be if hoarding needs to be avoided). The argument is similar to people saying that producing inflation avoids hoarding. Both are utterly ridiculous and for a very simple reason: People dont save all their wealth in money.For example, nowadays a lot of people have their savings for retiring in the stock market. Or most rich people have their fortunes in the stock market as well, in commodities, etc... So in reality, devaluating the currency benefits them because their actives go up in price.If people know that the money is going to lose value, they spend it and hoard something else that they think is going to keep its value.And it hurts the people that work for a wage because wages are the last thing that gets actualized. So consumer prices go up, and then, some time later, wages actualize. During the time where your wage is not actualized you have lost purchasing power. This purchasing power that is being stolen, goes to the people that has active that get apreciated by inflation, basically the rich.So it not only does not prevent hoarding, but it benefits the concentration of wealth, because its a lot easier to defend from debasing money for a rich guy than for someone that earns a wage.PS: Then you have the problems of distortion in the price signals, leading to malinvestments and less economic growth for everyone. Not really a safe haven. You got it right the first time when you said that the dollar is protected by the biggest army in the world. That is the reason why the dollar has not collapsed, despite all the monetary abuses by the USA government. If the rest of the countries could freely choose the dollar would be toast. But the reality is they dont.The problem is there is no way the rest of the world can eat up what the USA government is about to do to inflate is debt. The Federal Reserve just passed the 1 trillion mark in treasuries last week, and its going to keep going. QE1, QE2, Bernanke has already hinted at QE3 and QE4 will follow (even if Bernanke does not call it that way, the Fed is going to be monetizing gov debt for years).Treasuries are a loosing investment right now. They are coming from record low yields. They are now raising and can only keep raising.TIPS follow CPI, which is a government indicator. Watch out with that. Its the other way around. The free market stops cartels or monopolies. A cartel in the free market does not last due to competition. Its the government that with regulations helps some industries over others and creates cartels, or in some cases even monopolies.You have to keep in mind that monopoly used to mean a government sanctioned enterprise. Everybody understood that only the government using its monopoly in force can impose a monopoly. But in the beginning of the XX century the meaning started to change as a way to justify more government control.This is long, but in short you have to understand that a company internally functions in a "socialistic" way, or better said, internally functions in some sort of central planning (the degree changes depending on the structure of the company). Therefore as a company grows it faces problems because of its size and becomes inefficient (the same way a government can not centrally plan a country because its too big). At that moment the little ones can outcompete, and the only option for the big company is to use its financial muscle to get the politicians to enact regulations to stop the competition (usually under the excuse of benefiting the consumer) so it can keep operating.In reality the people demanding more regulations are the corporatists. Or they can approve a law with the orwellian title of "net neutrality" to end net neutrality and a lot of people will support it.This is a solution: http://guifi.net There is this thing called supply and demand. The supply of dollars is booming (to avoid direct default), and that means its price is going to go down, if you know what I mean. Going into treasuries now is crazy.The USA will not oficially default, it will print its way out, which is a hidden default.PS: I find it kind of amusing discussing with people that I highly suspect they are trolls. Its weird. In my country we say: "Ir de Guatemala a Guatepeor", which means something like jumping from the frying pan to the fire.In reality you are going from dollars to dollar debt so its not really a change what you are proposing. Treasuries are a bubble and a losing investment. You should look for other options. Whats wrong with what I said?Consumer information is not something important for the market? Yes, but us as consumers get to tell other consumers what this companies are doing to influence their decision towards more respectful ways of doing business.Non-violent action towards disrespectful companies is a basic tool of the market. By mid-2011 the rise in prices will start to be evident. Government and media will claim is a sign of recovery.By 2012 stagflation will be oficially admited. I will try to follow the convention, but as someone said earlier, good luck with this."Where my Bitcoin at, bitch?" works also for the non-tech-savy pimp.  That would happen if the crisis developed as a deflationary correction, but from now on is going to be more and more inflationary.Look at this lasts months. There are deflationary presures, but the Fed monetizing govt debt everyday is keeping the market up. We are going directly towards stagflation. I dont have time to argue now, but gold will keep going up until the crisis is over, that is it will go up for 4 or 5 years more. If you believe the crisis will be over tomorrow sell your gold now. In all the big crisis the DOW/gold ratio goes to near 1 and we are still at 7. I wont sell until that ratio goes under 3. If you really are, I just checked your blog and added it to my blogroll. Looks interesting. I took a look at dash7 and it looks great for what it wants to do.That said, I think its too low-bandwith for bitcoin. Also, is supposed to be extremely low consumption devices (devices that can run on a simple battery for years) so its not intended for heavy load (and heavy load in microcontrollers is different from heavy load in computers). I am not sure dash7 is for bitcoin. As a matter of fact I believe its not. The idea is that coining new bitcoins will be so hard that will become energetically non-profitable, and so your wealth will be determine by what you can produce and sell to your fellow bitcoin users. Krugman is very good at one thing: building strawmans. And that is exactly what he does with Ron Paul. I felt embarrassed for Krugman reading his posts.http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2010/12/evil-paul-krugman.htmlhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/12/asininity-from-paul-krugman-regarding.htmlhttp://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2010/12/panic-at-princeton-club.html I am very curious about this also.I have been saying that there will be competing bitcoin networks and I think its healthy. But the way you want to do it I dont think its a viable solution. Usually proponents of the deflationary spiral argue that the problem is the debt, as explained by Fisher in its debt deflation paper (which by the way I found quite infantile). I dont think anybody is arguing that decrease in prices due to increase productivity is a problem (well some fanatics might, but not any serious economist).About the debt problem is quite obvious that if a recession comes and the companies or individuals are highly leveraged, the downturn is going to be harder than if they dont have debt or have little debt. You really dont need a 20 pages paper to explain that. Also, there is the issue of the debt being used as money and when disappearing creating monetary deflation, but this strengthens the currency, it does not collapse it. It can create problems in he economy, mainly because there is usually an increase in the demand for cash, but since bitcoin is a voluntary currency, and not a monopoly with a oligopolistic credit system like the government currency, the deflationary presures can be dealt by the market. Probably I am not understanding what you want to say, but this is already posible. You just have to send the bitcoins in mybitcoin to your wallet.
No, its not dependent on a central authority. And fiat means imposed using force or thread of force. Please dont change the meaning of the definitions because it makes discussing things harder and tedious.No. If someone wants to change it, you just need one developer changing the source and making it available in the Internet. Things are always going to be like this, people have different knowledge. The developers are not a unit, they are different people that can take different decisions. The software is open source. A group of people could even pay a developer to implement the changes they want. Anyone can make what they want with bitcoin. Bitcoin works by voluntary agreement.I dont understand what you mean by "cope with growth" (growth of currency, growth of prices, growth of GDP, economic growth, ...?).That said you wont be able to make a software that is 100% versatile for any change you can imagine. A software is always limited and actually its bad if you try to make it too versatile. My experience shows that it is better to keep a software simple and that solves a practical task, not some range of remote posibilities.Competing currencies is very common and it does not have to undermine bitcoin. If bitcoin forks it will just strengthen the system. There will be exchange places where you will be able to buy or sell one bitcon currency for another if you need to, etc... In fact, I have said since the beginning that the its inevitable that different bitcoin chains appear. I think the division will be by physical territory, but who knows really. Mmm, is this a virtual round table? I am in Europe. How do you propose this group should work?I have some ideas regarding the ideas of "free banking" of Selgin and White and the problems bitcoin would have once it reaches its "coin" limit, and how to solve this problem. The question is confusing, not the best wording ever.How do your feel about....?Yes, Depends, NoI am guessing No means I feel I am against it. I think I had the discussion in this forum again, but...Socialism really is not a system. Is a set of promises or desires, but not a set of policies to acomplish those promises (which is very convenient, I know). This promises are equality and having the basic needs covered (food, housing, etc...).Then there are different systems or proposals to get to those objectives, communism being the most famous, but we all know how it ended. But there are others. In fact, socialist Proudhon was one of the biggest critics of Marx. And developing the ideas of Proudhon, people like Benjamin Tucker or Lysander Spooner would take mutualism to the next level. Now Kevin Karson (which I highly recommend reading) is taking this ideas forward with heavy use of Austrian economics.This people believe that the free market will bring society as closer as it can get to their ideal of equality. I honestly dont think that peacefully looking for equality is a bad thing. I instinctively dont like to see people having a lot while other people starve. I understand that using the excuse of inequality to gain power and violently impose rules is bad and even against equality itself. But I dont see nothing wrong on working towards a more equal world under free market rules.I have stopped calling myself a capitalist, because its too loaded, and I wont call myself a socialist for the same reason. I call myself a free marketeer, and since I come from a lefty family I consider myself left-leaning (meaning the core of social values usually related with the left pro-gays, sexually, etc..., but would not like them imposed trough government).That is why I call myself a free market left-libertarian, or if you want a left leaning free marketeer.  Agorism is left-libertarianism.Roderick Long is left-libertarianism (http://aaeblog.com/)There is even free market socialism, called mutualism, in the tradition of Proudhon and Tucker.What is the problem with calling myself a free market left libertarian? Free market left libertarian. In my country (somewhere in the south of Europe) the cars got seat belts before it was mandatory by the government to wear them, so it was just a matter of choice. I have only read the first message and I dont know if someone has told you already, but the one on one exchange ratio with bitcoin is suicide. Since the two currencies will have different market values you are creating a big profit opportunity that someone will use, crashing anyone trying to hold the one on one ration exchange. This is why you felt that part was murky. You need to let the exchange float freely.Does your system really needs to be decentralized? Because if it does not the solutions are way easier. Beautiful. This things make my day. I want to praise Madhatter for the initiative, but I am not convinced this is good for growing the bitcoin economy.At the end of the day it encourages changing bitcoins for dollars to buy stuff, not creating a real bitcoin economy. If people start using your service a lot you will end up with a bunch of bitcoins and less dollars, and if you have nowhere to directly spend those bitcoins... If you are happy to accumulate bitcoins for the future and you see this as a way to as a complement to encourage people to use bitcoin then its ok. But its not something sustainable.   Its a great idea.Now I just need to find someone that is willing to pay for the plane... +1 (I am an engineer that has worked mainly as salesman. Not everyone is valid to work as a day to day engineer, and not everyone is valid as a salesman). Bitcoin is the perfect agorist currency. Monetary policy is slow. It can take years for the effects of money printing to show to the consumer.Just sit tight and see it happening. Nothing is free. Everything has consequences. Not really. But even if this was the case, the poor people would pass through... lower prices. Oh the horror!! Imagine having to pay less for the food. Unacceptable! The poor have to pay more for the food! Its (somehow) for their own good. DNS lookup implies some kind of centralization, if I am not mistken. I think its easier to create some kind of plugin for the browser so it connects directly to the client and pays automatically. I remember reading that some of this system had a two password system. One password would open a phony part made on purpose in case the police or other criminals is forcing you to give them the key. And then the real key would take you to where you have the info.
Im glad you saved money. But Mish was not the only one who saw the deflationary effects of the credit crunch. F.e. Marc Faber predicted it as well. But if you check the data prices did not go down almost despite the contraction on credit. And the reason is because they were compensated by the monetization. And as the Fed keeps monetizing debt without the presures of the credit crunch, prices will rise.EDIT: Mish webpage is down. It seems gone. Do you know something about it? I had this discussion endless times. It is true that a contraction of credit is deflationary, but the banking system is not the only way the new money can go into the economy. Monetizing government debt injects money into the market skipping the banking system. And there has been a big amount of monetization during this crisis, and Bernanke just announced more. So if you look only at the credit you are missing part of the equation.Also, I respect Pretcher but he has been dead wrong during this crisis. If you followed his advice and shorted gold and stocks and bought dollars you must be completely ruined right now. Im speechless. All I can say is the propaganda was better before.http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2010/11/10/will-sarah-palin-and-the-tea-party-cause-hyper-inflation/ I was thinking this exactly right now and came here to ask if it was possible. Just for curiosity, is there any limit in the amount of addresses that can exists in the whole bitcoin network? "The illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer."Henry Kissingerhttp://thenewamerican.com/index.php/usnews/politics/5125-kissinger-qthe-illegal-we-do-immediately-the-unconstitutional-takes-a-little-longerq Is it possible to be 100% anonymous in the Internet? No matter what you do you are always showing your IP. Unless you go through Tor or similar, its not up to the protocol to hide the IP.Maybe Bitcoin could implement a Tor system for the transactions in itself, so buyer and seller never interact directly. I will confess I have not master the bitcoin protocol (I am lazy) so can anyone tell me if it makes sense? This is one of the best writings I have read lately.http://www.zerohedge.com/article/ben-davies-variant-perceptions-betting-against-grain-and-debunking-prevailing-myths If we get to a point where the price is energy make it worth to synthetize gold then probably we dont need a monetary system or for that case even an economy anymore. It will be really a post scarcity world. Gold has been already synthesized. The "only" problem is that the amount of energy needed to synthetize gold costs several orders of magnitud higher than the gold you get. So basically its an impossible way. And it will be for a long time.Now, I have strongly supported and publicited bitcoin and I have no problem with gold. There is no need for bitcoin and gold to become "enemies". I think gold is one of the best candidates to be money. But I oppose a government mandated gold standard. Just let the currencies compete and let people freely choose which one they want to use. Gold and bitcoin can coexists. The thing is that doing that cost them money (electricity and the lost of oportunity to use the computer in something else). So going from network to network breaking them down is a game that they can not sustain for a long time as it would bankrupt them. I am sure they could not do that very long without a major part of the participants breaking the consensus and thus breaking the group.You are used to see this kind of abusive behaviour in present days, but it is because most corporations are protected by government regulations. Therefore they dont have to suffer strong competition.Bitcoin is a true free-market currency, a voluntary currency and is not subject to regulations, so corporations or any strong player will have a really hard time taking over and loosing a lot of money. And if it has to do it several times it will just give up. The crony capitalists realized long time ago that they need regulations, government help, to avoid competition in the market. I have noticed the same.If you only use 2 cores (out of the virtual 4) it does not matter much, but if you configure it to use 3 or 4 the gain is ridiculous, while before it was noticeable. From a strategy point of view, I think its important to promote Bitcoin for business, because its going to be the harder part. The speculation part will come alone, so I dont think there is going to be a lot of problem with that. But getting business to accept bitcoins I think should be one of the main focus of this community. I dont think you got the issue. BrightAnarchist was worried about only speculation driving bitcoin. I am worried about that too. I dont think speculation should be stopped or anything, it serves its function, but bitcoin is not a casino, its a currency. We need business to start accepting bitcoin. If the only thing going on is speculation then it will die. The problem is not speculation, the problem is that we dont want bitcoin only driven by speculation, because its a no future road. I have not read the whole thread but,What deregulation? Seriously what deregulation?!?Please, stop parroting and repeating the official propaganda and go check the data. The number and size of regulation has increased, and a lot each decade, specially since the 50's. PLEASE CHECK THE DATA and see it by yourself.Now, one can argue that the changes in regulation has been for better or for worse, but no one that is honest and checks the data (as opposed to believing the official propaganda) can say that there has been any deregulation. Its the contrary, there has been an increase in the size of the regulatory regime.Seriously? Do you really think this is the way to create a community? Infected?...As I said I have not read the whole thread but I hope you have apologized or you plan to. You are not the only one worried. But there is little that can be done, apart from tyring to spread the word and encouraging business to accept bitcoin. First they were not savers, as in having money stored in a vault. They were investors in the bank fractional reserve lending program, although you could argue its still a type of savings. But nevertheless they were taking a risk. But the main point is that it was the duty of this people to give their money to a institution they trust and control. Because of the government guarnatees people trust their banks as if nothing bad could happen, and its a big mistake. Banks are companies and CAN fail, nowadays specially the small ones, since the big ones are TBTF.Bottomline dont trust the banks (specially the ones operating under the government granted credit monopoly, which probably means all the banks that exists in your country). The real problem is that this guarantees are basically psicological and now thee real deal is that the taxpayers are on the hook for the banks. No bank is going to go down. Ok, so is a server side charting software. I have been looking exactly for this but made in client side, only asking the data to the server. I know there are JQuery libraries that make candlestick and the rest, but never found the whole thing. Somebody is everybody. Or at least anyone that wants to. You can download the client and all the clients have the option of generating. Bitcoin is a decentralized system. Its one of its big points.I dont get this one. Do you mind sharing the name of the charting library?
Or in a similar one?http://www.economist.com/node/17366137?story_id=17366137&fsrc=scn/tw/te/rss/peIn spanish: http://www.errorespuntuales.es/content/trabajo-m%C3%B3vil And for good reason. Very very nice. Did you program the this or did you use some sort of library or program? Short the dollar!!It might be the effect QE2...   We should send a letter to Bernanke thanking him. Something lik:Thanks for robbing and stealing from the poor and the middle class.Sincerely,          Bitcoin holders. There is the "little problem" of the subjectivity of value, which affects prices in unpredictable ways. So even if you want a graph of the amount of dollars printed vs the difficulty of creating a new bitcoin, it wont tell you what the exchange between bitcoin and dollars will be. Good. I agree with others that Schiff is not the type of guy that jumps into something like bitcoin but who knows. Its always good to promote bitcoin. #1 - The first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.#2 - The second rule of Fight Club is, you DO NOT talk about Fight Club.Similarly:#1 - The first rule of the Gold Club is, you do not tell anyone you have gold or where you hide it.#2 - The second rule fo the Gold Club is, you DO NOT tell anyone you have gold or where you hide it.  There is still some years until something like that could happen (there is even a small chance of hyperinflation). When the DOW to gold ratio goes under 3 or 2 its time to start thinking on selling. But I am pretty sure you still have 3 or 4 years until that happens. Its really all about coordination through the natural market interest rates.If you create monetary inflation you push the interest rates downwards. That leads to entrepreneurs thinking that they can start more long term projects than consumer really want. Therefore when those projects finish they are revealed as unsusteinable. Its a bubble.If you create monetary deflation you push the interest rates upwards. That leads to entrepreneurs thinking that long term projects that consumers are looking for are not viable and therefore the economy is not really expanding as it should.The interest rates transmit the consumer needs to the entrepreneurs. If you artificially change them you will create a distortion on the market.So its not really that price inflation or price deflation is good or bad. In reality what you really need is the natural interest rates. What happens is that if you dont manipulate the interest rates by creating inflation, as new technologies and new capital appear there is more production and that leads to prices going down. But falling prices its only a consequence of a healthy system, not really the objective or the cause. The really important thing is to have the natural interest rates. If you artificially manipulate it, like central banks do by printing money, then you are distorting the market. The name of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Conference: 'A Return to Jekyll Island: The Origins, History, and Future of the Federal Reserve'Its funny because some time ago, anyone saying that the Federal Reserve was created at a secret meeting of bankers at the Jekyll Island in 1910 was labeled a conspiracist. And you wont.The banks need some minimum requirements, and its base in the money they have. If people start removing the money in mass, they will be bankrupt.To be honest if something like that happened the government would declare some sort of "Bank hollyday" or something, but it raises awareness. The peasants are getting restless in Europe: A Bank mutiny for December 7. And this is something that could really hurt the system.http://www.zerohedge.com/article/december-7-unofficial-pan-european-bank-mutiny-dayThis might also be a great oportunity to promote bitcoin. This are the facebook pages of the organicers in each country. If you speak the language you could go to the facebook page and spread the word about bitcoin. You wont find a better crowd elsewhere:Italy http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=165061130188137France http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=101996426533405Germany http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=119746184753138Holland http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=119746184753138Great Britain http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=137793666269183Greece http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=156793421024126&index=1As always here in Spain there is nothing organized yet. A 100 years later, its time to celebrate.http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2010/11/fed-at-jekyll-island-theyre-baaack.html The problem is that what Bernanke is proposing is nowhere near free banking. Its more like lets get away with the small and inefficient check and ballances that exists right now to keep credit expansion in check. I mean, they dont work, the bubbles show it, but at least they make the process somehow slower.Btw, this could be moved to the economics subforum, dont you think? WTFhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704477904575586634028056268.html?mod=e2tw That is the reason why anonimity and de-centralization is important. And bitcoin has both. I agree. I like the logo. Looks great.EDIT: Already using your image at our blog: http://www.errorespuntuales.es (click on "Autores") What about buying it between a group of some bitcoiners and create the first bitcoin republic?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlMq1R-64QcI could not stop laughing with the last answer. Yeah. English is not my first language. Thanks for the correction.
Yes we can! Change my ass!Obama is fucking desperate. He knows he is going to take a beating in this elections. In case anyone wants to read the script Obama screenwriters wrote go here.If anyone wants to know where Obama is getting his ideas from: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lDZjiPok3w Bitcoins CAN be taxed. Tax evasion can happen in any currency, easier or harder, but can happen.What makes bitcoin different from dollars or any other important currency is that its a voluntary currency, and therefore it wont be inflationary.It will keep the natural market rates and avoid the boom and bust cycles. My table is a piece of wood and a table at the same time. Or more precisely is a piece of wood and is being used as a table at the same time. Nobody sees nothing wrong with this. Things can "be" two (or even more) "things" at the same time.Similarly, gold is a chemical element and is being widely used as money. As long as it is used as money, it is money. When people stops using gold as money it wont be money. Samething with the inked pieces of paper from the Federal Reserve. They are paper and are being used as money.Money is a function. And bitcoin is functioning as money. ‎"If we do not halt this steady process of building commissions and regulatory bodies and the special legislation like huge inverted pyramids over every one of the simple constitutional provisions, we shall soon be spending many billions of dollars more."Franklin D. Roosevelt,before wining the elections. Ironically prophetic. I was not pretending to say it otherwise, and I am happy to be in the bitcoin project with everyone. Hope that is clear.Now that we have taken that out of the way I honestly think that your definitions are too subjective or vague. "control to exert power over your neighbors" can be interpreted in a multitude of ways. Its very opinable. To support something I need a clearer explanation on how things would work. If they have big tits its fine with me   My vote goes for this. Irwin Schiff is a real hero. I will just leave this here  I though on adding subtitles as well, but I think its very US specific.I added spanish subtitles to the Hayek vs Keynes rap video, and that was worth it. Its more international. But this, as brilliant as it is, its just not international.Anyway, I think I have watched it 3 times this morning and still do not get tired of it. Why did your parents move from Poland to Canada?By the way, you might like this: http://c4ss.org/EDIT: If you dont mind sharing. LewRockwell published an article about Bitcoin. In fact it was one of the first big internet publications to do it.Peter Schiff has not been claiming inflation for decades... Peter Schiff claims that the crisis will turn into an inflationary crisis (most people agree). What Peter missed was the disinflationary phase after the crash of the bubble and he has acknowleged it.I dont trust Mish. He got the desinflationary crash right, but the way he treats people that discusses with him is very very suspicious. He manipulates his words and builds strawman to attack them. I dont trust that kind of people. Also, his focus on the coming deflation when the inflatariony phase is about to hit is suspicious. Specially because his business is based in the USA and looks more interesting with a strong dollar...Peter Schiff is in the same but opposite situation. Peter has a business that focus on foreign stocks, so the projection of a weak dollar makes his business look better, which is what might have lead him to downplay the desinflationary phase. Whether intentional or a mistake by Peter, in both cases I think it was a big mistake that did not help him, on the contrary it hurt his business. I think he same is going on with Mish but towards deflation.What I really like about Peter is that he is funny and brings people to the movement. When I started discovering austrian economics I watched a lot of Peter videos, and that lead me to more complex stuff. Someone funny always help to spread whatever you want to spread. This is too funnyhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlBYpldsl3gPS: Does anyone know how to embed a youtube video? Is it posible? Investors are expecting a heavy rise in the CPI that will offset the negative interests and will end up giving them money. Otherwise it makes no sense. Its a sign that investors expect heavy inflation. As you said, this has been discussed before, but I will try to answer some:Apart from the discussion if it really is enough or not, there can be parallel bitcoin networks. Its not an idea that is very popular around here (for obvious reasons) but I think that as the system starts to gain importance there will appear competing networks, most probably local networks belonging to a geographical area. There is no problem in several bitcoin networks at the same time. There are already exchanges between dollars, euros and bitcoins, and they could exchange between the different networks.You are probably right in this one.Also, firefox or chrome plugin that allowed to pay by just clicking a link would be a step forward. There has been some discussion around this but nothing has happened.First, from a moral point of view, the people that is here earlier are taking risk and spending time in something that could develop into nothing. There has to be a reward for early adoption, right? I mean, jumping in the wagon when everything works is the easy task. Being here from the beginning when almost nobody was using it has merit. Also, remember that nobody is stopping anyone from starting a new bitcoin network. Satoshi has open sourced the software he has created.Second, from a practical point of view, people will keep adopting Bitcoin because of different reasons. One is to show the finger to the banking system. Two, because as more business accept Bitcoin people will find them useful to buy stuff. And Bitcoins will behave better than any government fiat currency (it wont lose value), therefore they will find an incentive to use it. Also there is the pesky part that since it is an anonymous currency some people will trade in it and will decide to not pay taxes. This is not encouraged here, but can be nevertheless an incentive.This is an important issue.Having a decentralized system has it advantages and its disadvantages. But there could be in the future a similar system using bitcoins. Not all forms of socialism reject money. Remember socialism is a set of goals, not a set of policies (whether you think this goals are important or possible is another matter).Btw, Rothbard convinced the communist party of the USA to include the gold standard in their program  Hopefully you guys are not trolls and are up for an honest debate.There has been more examples of anarcho-capitalism than Somalia. In fact, Somalia is not the best example of an anarcho-capitalist society. Also, about Somalia, their conditions have improved during their anarchist phase. Under anarchy Somalia has become the region with the cheapest telephone rates in all Africa, the one where agricultural and kettle production has grown faster, etc... You obviously are not going to turn a shithole into a paradise in some years. But the fact is that the conditions have improved.I have also read about the anarcho-communist communities in Spain. First of all, they were short-lived, so conclusions about them should be taken with a grain of salt since nobody knows how they would have evolved. But you say they were "pretty nice places to live by all accounts"... but you dont talk how the political comites that were formed were regulating moral issues like sex and even alcohol drinking for their members. And they were strict about it (some of them, there were many types of communities). But again, the experiences are not very conclusive (for good or for bad) because they were short lived.Its the other way around. Its the anarcho-syndicalist or anarcho-communist that tend to be democratic.This is a better definition of personal/private property than the traditional communist, but is still weak. What if you can not defend your house? What if you rent a room?mmmm, where does anarcho-capitalism opposes a trust system? Not only it does not oppose it, but anarcho-capitalism relies in a trust system.Money appeared naturally from bartering. Why do you think it wont happen again? In fact, a system of money (or at least a free market money) is a system of barter. It just happens that people always barter their goods against one good, and for that reason that good receives the name of money. Its convinient, why do you think it wont happen again?Also, ignoring that money does a lot of good for humans is not wise. Without money the coordination of production would be impossible and people would be much poorer. Specialization would not be possible and that means no modern science like medicine or physics.Again, if you are trolls or dont care about honest debate dont bother answering. I have hope to set up some sort of libertarian city-state in some place in Africa. There was a project to do exactly this in Madagascar. Some libertarian economists had talked with the president there to set up some special charter in some place to start a libertarian city (similar idea to Hong Kong). The key is that with a small tariff for the host country, it would be very profitable for them because all the activity the city would generate, and would be also very advantageous for the citizens that moved there since they could govern themselves and pay a very small tax only. The Madagascar president had accepted this and they were negotiating the terms, when there was a revolution. I wish I had the link were I read this.If something like this actually happened I think that there is a big chance that a libertarian society could expand around Africa. Because the city would thrive and surely other people would copy the initiative, also the natives would copy the structure and could be influenced and educated, etc...If something like this is stablished seriously I would go live there. Yeah. Socialism in reality or at least for academic socialists (or whatever) is defined as a system of values where equality is the base and basic needs are covered for everyone (including food, shelter, etc...). How this is achieved is not defined, so its basically a set of beautiful promises (which is very useful from a marketing point of view, but not very realistic). Then there are different theories on how to get there. Mutualists just happen to think that the free market is the best way to achieve this ends. Again, all this comes from my little understanding of the subject, but I think I got it right.So you see, if mutualists want a free market because that way they can achieve their socialistic ends and an-caps want a free market because they value it as the best way of living or the most moral or whatever... then they both defend the same, just with different objectives (maybe, because an an-cap can personally value equality as a favorable outcome). This is why I am telling you the line between capitalism and socialism gets blurred. Certainly mutualists will favour cooperatives and local commerce, while an-caps (maybe) will favour whatever its more efficient, but at the end they both accept playing in a free market.The other socialist anarchists dont make sense at all to me. It seems just like nonsense with totally unrealistic views of the world, specially the economy. The anarcho-communist or anarcho-syndicalist want to impose a monetary system based on the hour standard (the hour as in time) but they say its not a monetary standard, and then they want to stablish a market to exchange the goods based on this hour standard, but saying that its not a market... And then you have the primitivists that want to stop using technology... I am finding mutualism ok, but it goes downhill very quickly from there.Yes. Its a dangerous line to define the validity of property in subjective terms. I did not say that they are right, its just what I got from the little I have read about mutualism.But saying that since someone does not need something he/she is going to sell it cheap its a stretch. Moreover the mutualists really dont have problem with little owners. What mutualists mainly have problem and strongly denounce is the property acquired through unjust means, for example property acquired using aggressive force or government subsidies or favors. They claim that the big parts of land that are now unused are due to the government interference and not due to a free market process. I happen to agree with this last part, and I like the strong stance on unjust acquired land. I think that the rest of the market anarchists schools and even minarchists should denounce this issue more.Again, my understanding of mutualism is still superficial so my opinions could not be exactly accurate.
It gets to a point where the lines between socialism and capitalism gets diluted.Mutualists define capitalism from a historic (with marxian influence) perspective. Therefore capitalism is what happened in Europe after the industrial revolution. So basically for the mutualists capitalism means state capitalism or corporate capitalism.Mutualism is defined as free market anticapitalism or free market socialism. I really dont care what you define yourself, as long as you defend some kind of free market with some kind of realistic property system. Mutualist in reality dont defend strict property but more of a exclusive use system. They defend that a property becomes unowned if the owner has not used for a long time, as opposed to anarcho-capitalist that are more strict with property.Take all this with a grain of salt since I have just started looking into mutualism. Well, what about mutualism? Its socialism and anarchism, and I am finding it ok. I might not agree with everything, but at least it makes sense, its coherent and has realistic views. But Chomsky is just charlatanery. Apart from being cautivated by his beautiful words I dont know why some people worship this guy. All he says and writes is beautiful nonsense. Anyone capable of minimal reasoning can see it. The best thing socialist can do is distance themselves from this joke. Waiting for the update. What is this application about? (if you want to talk about it) Give it a second though.Could it be that humans are acting this way because we live under an inflationary system? Its known that economic situation has a big influence in human culture. For example, during crisis music tends to be happier (people wants to disconnect from reality). During the housing boom, in my country, all the advertisment was focused on making you feel like "the winner". Now, all the advertisment has shifted and is promoting the image of companionship and "street people". Its well known that monetary influence can change how people behave. Therefore it makes sense to think that a lot of the reactions of the people that you are observing is not something inherently human, but more how people is reacting and has learn to behave because of the consequences of the monetary system.Through history monetary inflation has always led to bubbles and you can see the same kind of behaviour during the boom phase. The "winner" image. Check the roaring 20's. But the same happened centuries ago. Inflation always promotes speculation and turns the people kind of "cheaply greedy" or "stupidly greedy", it discourages savings and promotes consumption leading to a more consumerist society, and making people not being able to project for the future, more now-minded, and less self reliant. It changes people personality. And it sure is happening now. The inflationary regime its influencing people personality. It turns people stupid.In a deflationary system, with people used to prices going down, probably would behave in a completely different way. You can see this during the USA XIX century (for example), where prices where going down and the amount of investment was going up big time.Also, in an economic sense:You are assuming that more investment is better. But that is not necesarily the case. Productive investment is useful, but not any kind of investment. For example, there was a lot of investment during the housing boom, but it was misguided, and a lot of it was mainly malinvestments. We would have been a lot better off if it was saved or invested on something else.And one of the key factors that allow productive investment is the natural interest rates, because they communicate the consumer intentions to entrepreneurs. Inflation artificially lowers interest rates, thus sending the wrong signals (in this case the interest rates is not the result of consumer actions, but its influenced by inflation) fooling investors into the wrong type of projects. Therefore the increase of investment you get from inflation is not only useless but even damaging, because it promotes malinvestments.More investment is not always good. The natural interest rates are needed to guide investors about consumer demand. Exactly, and while you do it, instead of telling the truth, that you are devaluating the wages of your workers and offering them as cheap labor, you claim that you are helping them because inflation creates wealth (or something similar)...  This is a video by George Selgin about the private coinage in the UK just before and during the earlier stages of the industrial revolution. Is one of the best conferences I have seen about monetary history, and the bitcoin community can get some very valuable lessons from it.The whole video is full of them, but as I was watching it again one struck me: when the system became widely accepted, in spite of government trying to impose its money monopoly, the shops would demand double price if you wanted to pay in government money. Thats how much they valued their private coins. It was the government money that was rejected! I believe the same thing will happen with bitcoin once it gains some traction.The obvious question is: if this coins were so popular and so useful why did they disappear? Fair question, and the answer is at the end of the video. And this is why bitcoin is such an incredible system, because it would have avoided the fate of this private coins because of its characteristics.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gn55fTRXZwPS: Anyone knows how to embed a youtube video? Chomsky the "anarchist" that constantly demands bigger government. What a joke.I am discovering now a lot of really good left-liberatarian philosophers. Why do people focus on this guy? He is a joke. For example, he demands higher taxes on the rich while at the same time he is rich and has his money in a fiscal paradise to avoid paying taxes... He is very good with linguistics and he uses it as a charlatan. Sorry, just woke up. What is this about? The problem is that social-democracies and all its regulations stop the market prices from adjusting downwards. If you had a free market it would have a strong currency. If, for example, some country tried to devaluate their currency to decrease the real wages of their workers and make them poorer to allow the exports of their industries to be more competitive, the free market nation would react by lowering prices and wages, and if the workers refuse to accept because they can find better options, then the industry would have the option of trying to automate the task or accept the gift of the foreign country and use their labor as cheap labor, while the free market country workers are doing better payed jobs.But since social-democracies and their endless regulations dont allow for prices (including wages) to adjust downwards, this process can not happen. And the only option left is to counteract also devaluating through inflation, which on top of making anyone earning a wage poorer, discoordinates the market and produces bubbles. Social-democracies are mercantilists economically. Its a loose-loose situation for everybody, but its the only way the elite have to destroy the debt while keeping the system in place.Its so stupid that in the XXI century we are still following the same mercantilist policies as the XVII century monarquies its mind blowing. Deflation does not stop investment.There is empirical evidence of this, for example, the USA during the XIX century.Its just inflationist propaganda. Just download the client and connect to the rest of the network. Or even better start accepting bitcoins in your business (if you have one) or encourage business to accept bitcoins.And welcome to the forums. I agree with the ones that say that use will determine it, but I like" XBC". This is a complete different bet. I can see this happening, specially depending on the Fed actions.If QE2 happens in the November FOMC meeting as almost everybody is expecting and it is big enough, the DOW will remain over 10.000, but if the Fed leaves QE2 for later or it is percieved as too small then it could happen.Big parts of the economy are now driven by monetary policy rather than market forces. Its sad. As Babylon said we need someone to hold the bitcoins or at least a part of them until the bet can be resolved. Lets bet. 1000 bitcoins that the DOW does not touch 1000 points before 2016. Deal?kiba what you are working on could come handy now. The Dow will go down in term of gold, but in term of dollars it will rally. Bernanke is there to make sure it happens. This would be true without the central bank. In the present system this is not true, since credit is created through inflation. The "funny" part is that the Fed argued that if Ron Paul's Audit the Fed bill passed it would politicize the Fed and it would led to inflation...The bill did not pass and now they are creating inflation on their own.Professional liers. So the IMF thinks governments can not manage the currencies responsably (which I happen to agree) but then the solution is to give control to the IMF itself. Yeah, right.
The IMF is not worried about currency being used for political purposes. They are just worried if currencies are not used for their political purposes. I think they are trying to push their agenda by jokingly introduce extreme ideas, so the real ideas they try to pass dont seem so horrendous. You know, like when you want to get 10 so you ask for 15. World domination.And he has promise me Ill be the second in charge. Muhahahahahaaaaa!!!! If the Fed wants to buy every bitcoin in existance let them.Then start a new bitcoin network. If the Fed keeps buying bitcoin you can retire rich after some years.  The dollar is a piece of paper with funny drawings. It is not a currency, a dessert topping, or a floorwax.Gold is a metal. It is not a currency, a dessert topping or a floorwax. European here (Canada born... but nobody is perfect   ) It already is. Mmm... Are you sure your dollars dont depreciate quicker than bitcoins? Dollars are worthless to create.Also, thinking that holding dollars is less risky than bitcoins might be a bit naive. Someone should work on making the GPU code open. That is the best way to stop this. Everybody was doing it. What could go wrong?   I agree with this. All the GDP forecasts are going down. The USA will show a weak GDP. Ireland just announced a -1.2% GDP. All european advanced indicators are showing a decline. This is actually good for the economy because it means that the inefficient industry from the bubble is disappearing, but in the short run its going to hurt. The stock market is disconnected from reality because of all the liquidity, but its not going to get away from this. Then at some point Bernanke will appear with QE2 and more monetization and then stagflation will start. You definitively either work at CNBC or watch too much CNBC.Treasuries are only selling now because the Fed is buying some (POMO) and people are frontrunning the Federal Reserve who has guaranteed another big intervention in the future. But this is a short time trade, very profitable but short term. Once the Fed has done its second big intervention the game is over. If the Fed does not support the Treasury then the interests that it will have to pay for the debt will be mean default for the government. In this scenario do you really think the Fed will stop buying treasuries, and even start selling them? And even if it did so, how much is the Fed going to get from a junk government bond?What good does JPM, GS or CityGroup do to the economy? They are horrible capital allocators as proven by the crisis. You dont want to get this economy artificially alive. You want the bad companies to go under, so new and efficient ones can prosper. You have to think that the USA was living a bubbled economy not a sustainable one. Returning to a bubbled economy is not the objective.By saving the banks and trying to save all the zombie companies (f.e.: GM) the government has turned what could have been a one-two year recession into a long depression. Yes, since Japan started devaluating about two weeks ago it has spiraled down.Not only Brasil is devaluating the currency, also Perú and Colombia, and many others are probably doing it but not saying it.And the Japan-China diplomatic conflict that is going on now in reality is a hidden monetary conflict, because China is buying a lot of Japanese bonds, pushing the yen up.Isnt keynesianism great? I hope Marc Faber is wrong and this crisis does not end up in a war. The thing is that the central planners use violence therefore they dont operate under the same market rules the rest of us do. Specifically, the central bank manages the monopoly on money imposed by the government using force. The Fed is not omnipotent, but it does have a very strong influence, greater than anything else probably.I completely agree.Yes, but it seems very clear to me that the new money injected by the Fed is not going to go to blow another bubble in the typical way, but rather concentrate in the most needed products: food, commodities, energy, etc... So its my opinion that the bubbled industries (mainly housing) is going to keep going down in price for a while, but the basic stuff like food or energy is going to go ballistic. The UK government is studying what would happen if the price of oil goes ballistic like it happen in the 70's:http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/8016774/Liberal-Democrat-Conference-Oil-price-could-double-in-return-to-1970s-style-shocks.htmlKeep in mind that I am saying that prices will go up, but the economy will not recover. Unemployment will be still high.We will have to wait and see. Mmmmm, are you a CNBC comentator?    Can you be a bit more specific on the exact options and actions that the Fed could take to remove the money that sits as excess reserves in the banks? Also, do you believe that the treasury will be able to finance itself without the support from the Fed?Btw, let me remind you again that Bernanke when starting QE1 said that it would remove the liquidity. Less than a month ago announced that it would use the money its getting from the maturing MBS into buying more treasuries, and has been doing so. So basically he is not removing the money.Also, in the Jackson Hole meeting, Bernanke basically assured that QE2 will be a reality, or at least that is what everybody understood. Note that I did not say that deflation did not happen. I said that the Fed aborted the "deflationary correction".About what you are saying, there has been monetary deflation for sure, specially in the longer term debt (M3) towards cash or shorter term debt (M2). But if the Fed had not monetized government debt (pushing new money directly into the market) it would had been far more intense.As for prices, consumer goods prices, the CPI which is usually what is referred as "prices" when talking in macroeconomics, have not gone down. If you look at shadowstats statistics is even worse, and they have been increasing around 5%. Sure, homes have gone down, stocks have gone down, etc... but the articles that people buy everyday, like food, have not gone down, and have keep going up, slower than usually, but still up.I have checked the statistics in page 10 of that report, and yes its a big decline, but it seems to include all goods and only small business. Its interesting data, but it does not represent the whole thing.And I am not denying there are deflationary presures. I believe the deflationary correction is going to start showing again (its already showing) until the Fed starts printing again on what its being called Quantitive Easing 2. Then prices will start rising again and heavily. Note that I am saying that prices will rise, not that the economy will recover, therefore stagflation. I predict success for the prediction of the prediction market. Stop inflation so prices stop rising? You speak of stagflation like if its something that comes out of the blue, and not something that happened because of a set of policies.Its not "what can be done about stagflation". It is "what should the government stop doing to stop stagflation". But the high inflation that comes with stagflation devaluates government and financial institutions debt, so the government has all interest in letting stagflation run for a while.I have had this discussion a lot of times and its getting kind of boring right now, but lets give it another shot.Basically the Fed has pumped a lot of money into the financial system. This money has not been released into the market yet and it sits as excess reserves. Also, the Federal Reserve has bought government debt, which is one of the main reason the deflationary correction did not happen, therefore turning the crisis into a long depression. The Fed bought specially long term debt, to keep the yield curve in check, which is funny because the Fed spent years saying that it only influences the short term yields.The reason that prices will start rising because of all this inflation is because the Fed has no chance to remove all that liquidity. If you want to discuss why we would have to analyze the Federal Reserve balance sheet, which I have no problem doing. But it should be noted that when Bernanke started all this mesures he said that he would have no problem removing this liquidity, but now he started using the money he gets from the MBS he bought into buying more government debt. He has no intention of removing the liquidty, but even if he wanted to, he has no chance.The question is not why will inflation happen. The question is how can anyone be so blind as to not see big inflation is coming, and its going to push prices up a lot.PS: English is not my mother language, and speaking technically is hard for me, so excuse any incorrection. Not necessarely hyper-inflation, but stagflation is granted. I have been betting in stagflation since the beginning of the crisis.Which leads to another question. Redengin what will the kyenesian academia do when stagflation happens again and its too obvious to blame it on the oil producers again? Default will never ever happen. The USA government will never default on its citizens. It will print away all it needs, which is equivalent to defaulting, but it will never directly default. There is a reason why there has never been a deflationary collapse and the empire collapse are always hyper-inflationary.The USA would only default on some foreign nation. The event would obviously trigger war, probably IIIWW.
Inflation is when there is a increase of the monetary base above of the demand of that money. Bingo! I fell safer already. Bitcoin can be considered a cash equivalent from an economic point of view. Not that I know right now, but I having a bitcoin module in the drupal module directory would give bitcoin some publicity. Some peope might give it a try on their shops just for the sake of it. This is very important for business to adopt bitcoins. I bet if there was a drupal module to do it automatically a lot of online places would accept them.The most e-commerce module for Drupal is Ubercart (http://drupal.org/project/ubercart and http://www.ubercart.org/) so making a module for this would be a great asset. I am starting to look into Drupal and PHP because we just started an economic blog with some friends, but obviously I am no expert at all yet. If someone knows PHP and/or Drupal I would not mind collaborating with him/her to create the module. I honestly dont see myself capable of doing it on my own. My idea before I read this was to learn to create a module for Drupal creating a "Donate Bitcoin" module. So if anyone likes the idea of a bitcoin module for Ubercart (or something similar) pm me. I noticed the same.I have started accepting bitcoin donations at my blog, and I keep promoting bitcoin at the forums I visit (yesterday for example).But I completely agree that being able to spend bitcoins is the key to success. I have said several times that having business that accept bitcoins is the key to success. Maybe we should do something to target business. Maybe not big business because that would be unrealistic, but local small business. Maybe going to some local business association would be a good idea. Just thinking out loud. Our blog http://www.errorespuntuales.es/ is accepting bitcoins donations. Its a blog about the economy in Spanish.The donation page is here: http://www.errorespuntuales.es/content/acerca-de I dont have any problem with MIT license, but there are a lot of companies that are using and developing GPL software. Saying that companies dont like GPL is not true. I dont know if its worth to have a bitcoin subreddit, but for what its worth now you have a second subscrib er. I watched the first two, the Uk ones. That this things go on is really amazing. Thanks, now I just need to know where the bitcoin.conf file is. I have checked and its not in my ~/.bitcoin folder. Its not with the binary neither. Do I have to create it? Whre should I put it?SOLVED: thanks to the guys in the chat room. Just installed it.The installation went fine, and the theme looks good. But I have no clue how to add a new node. My bitcoin program is running in the same computer as phpMyBitcoin is running. I am running the official client (not patched). I dont really understand what the port, the user and the password is for.Thanks, I would pay you some bitcoins for a donate bitcoins module. Looks very good. I will give a try soon.What do you use for login? Nobody has said it yet? Ok, then Ill have to:The best anti-virus is linux. I agree that any government metric should be doubted, in fact I am a big critic of the CPI. But the point is that macroeconomics uses the terms price inflation and price deflation to refer to the prices of the CPI, and using it in another way just adds confusion. There is no doubt that house prices are down (and they still have some way to go), there has been an stock crash (and another might be coming, probably smaller though), and day to day consumer goods prices (CPI goods) have remained flat. Semantical discussions are a bit pointless in my opinion and I prefer to use the definition the majority of economist use.And yes, the gov CPI is a big scam, but because the CPI is always reported lower than it is in reality! not higher. This happens thanks to the hedonic method and other inventions. Check shadowstats.com : http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts You can see that even during this crisis prices have been rising quite fast, which matches better the real life impressions. This CPI manipulations allows the government to pay less in its obligations like pensions, because they are updated by the CPI. Also, the real GDP number is corrected by the deflactor that comes from the CPI. If the CPI is lower than it should the real GDP number is bigger... By just changing a method the economy is "growing" faster! Isnt government statistics great?And the panic of 1907 was only possible because of the banking laws approved by Lincoln at the end of the civil war, that centralized the credit around the New York banks (one of the main reasons Wall Street grew so big).The most funny thing about all this is the legend that Herbert Hoover was a free market proponent and did nothing when the crash of 1929 happened. Hoover was the Secretary of Commerce when the 1920 crash happened (and btw, the 1920 crash happened because of the bubble created by the Fed to finance IWW) Hoover urged the president to intervene the economy and raise gov spending. But the president dismissed Hoover and listened to his Secretary of Treasury, Menlow, who recommended lowering taxes and lowering gov spending. The crisis was over quick. Hoover tried to intervene and created some government programs from his position as Secretary of Commerce, specially subsidizing farming businesses, but he had not enough power and did not had a significant impact in the economy.Fast forward to the 1929 crash, and now Hoover is the president, and Menlow is still the Secretary of Commerce. Menlow again recommends the president a non interventionist approach to the crisis, but Hoover is a staunch interventionist, and not only dismisses his advice, but also teams with the Subsecretary of the Treasury to implement the measures that Menlow was refusing, in effect putting Menlow out of power. Hoover even said that he was going to put the USA government to work like never had been seen before. And he did.But Hoover's rhetoric used the market language while FDR rhetoric used the labor language, and because of that some historians portrayed Hoover as a non interventionist free market supporter, when in reality it was the opposite. In fact, FDR accused Hoover repeatedly during the campaign of being an interventionist and that it would prolong the crisis (for some reason he changed his mind once he got in power). Even one of the subsecreatries of Treasury of FDR said that Hoover reforms where a big help and that the FDR just renamed and continued most of his programs.It is so ridiculous to portrait Hoover as a non-interventionist... In macroeconomics, price deflation is defined as a decrease in the general price level, meaning the CPI. There has been a stock crash and a housing crash, but there has been no significant price deflation. It really is a stupid issue, since its only a definition. I dont really care about the definition as long as everybody knows what its happening in reality, but using standard definitions makes everything easier.There should have been price deflation but the government has stopped it.This is something very few people understands for what I've seen. The government could print more and create more price inflation, but they fear the consequences this could have in 1 or 2 years, because it could even create hyper-inflation as you said. But for some reason, people has a big problem understanding this. So? Price inflation is a bad thing, it creates bubbles and deindustrializes a country (its one of the main reasons the jobs are going to China). Price deflation is one of the signs of a sane and healthy economy.The real goals of the Fed are not those, but even if they were the Fed is a complete failure:There has not been stable prices, on the contrary, since the Fed was founded the dollar has lost 95+ % of its value. Housing became totally unaffordable, the difference between the rich and the poor has widen (again, it happens always when inflationary policies are pursued), etc...There is not maximum unemployment and crisis have become deeper and longer, so people go without a job for longer period of times.Moderating long-term interest rates is something the Fed has done, but its actually a bad thing to do, because if a form of price control and messes up the economy.And the promotion of sustainable economic growth is laughable seeing how it has turned an industrialized country into a deindustralized and completely debt dependent country.Where did the money to do all this came from? What would have happened if the Fed did not supplied cheap interest rates to Wall Street and the rest of the banks? Why do you look at the symptoms but dont look at the root? What reality?
I dont agree with the above, but it does not matter at the end. You are criticizing the government rules to elect the member of a federal government agency, The Board of Governors. There is nothing private in that. One can argue that the government regulations for that agency are more or less prone to corruption. But that does not make it private.The secretaries of the Treasury have banking employees for the last decades as well. Yet nobody is saying that the Treasury is private. To a certain point, it makes sense that central bank employees and even that treasuries employees come from finance.The Board of Governors, the agency setting monetary policy in the USA is a federal government agency, not a private agency. Another discussion would be if the government regulations regarding that agency are better or worse, or more or less prone to corruption. You wont find disagreement with me there. I find that most areas of government are geared towards corruption and corporate profit. Also, you have to think that the legal actions of a central bank are already extremely favorable to commercial banks. One of the legal functions of a central bank is to provide liquidity to member banks of the cartel. By "provide liquidity" they mean that the banks can borrow money at an interest that nobody in the market can get. This allows banks to over-extend credit a lot a lot a lot more than they could naturally (and earn the interests), because it protects them from failure. And protecting them from failure stops competition and creates the big banks (at the end its a government created cartel of banks). And this is all legal. This does not seem to be a very shared opinion, but I have always though that as bitcoin evolves and more people adopts it, there would be different networks for more local use of the coins. For example, the shops in a town get together and agree to start their own bitcoin network, kind of like they do with local currencies to improve local shopping. There could even be exchanges between the different bitcoin networks.But who knows what will end up happening. One thing is clear to me: the adoption of bitcoin depends on shops accepting bitcoin as method of payment. That will make people who is not so conscious about the monetary system to start using it. Yep, community building is important. And offering a fun experience will help.But business accepting bitcoins is the key to bitcoin success. Setting up or opening your already existing business to bitcoin is the best thing you can do to help. The president can only nominate to Chairman someone who is already part of the Board of Governors, correct. But all the members of the Board of Governors are previously nominated by the president and ratified by Congress... I am not discussing how great or bad this works. All I am saying is that there is no private entity involved in the process. Whatever the rules are, is a government issue.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is a federal government agency, and is the one setting the policy.Take it to the extreme. The government created the Fed. If the politicians are not happy on how the Fed operates they could decide to change the law. Check Ron Paul recent Audit the Fed bill that had great support among congressman until it was taken down. The Fed knows that all its power, the monopoly on money, comes from the government. So its in its own interest to keep politicians happy.That said the bill Audit the Fed failed because there was evident pressure on Congress to not audit the Fed. And that pressure did not come from Bernanke, but from banking power.Again, I honestly think that saying that the Fed is a private institution is highly inaccurate. About who controls who... I think we might have slightly different suppositions on how that works. I think we can agree that banking power controls both. The problem wth bumb is anonimity, but to have it as an option to exchange bitcoins would be great. creighto, yes we are discussing the exact tonality while we agree in the color. But for the sake of it:You could say that the Federal Reserve is a mixed thing:- The local Federal Reserve branches are "private". And I use brackets because its not private in the common sense. The system has its unique government regulations, for example, the private banks that own the stocks can not sell them. So this "private" system does not operate under the market rules, and certain sentences have declared that they are not even private but a mix of private corporations and government entities, because of the unique regulations they have to obey. Also, bear in mind that the local Federal Reserve branches are not the ones that decide the Federal Reserve policy.- The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Bernanke and the rest) is a federal government agency. Wikipedia is not the best source, but hope its enough for this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Board_of_Governors (or you can do your own research). The Board of Governors is the one that decides the Federal Reserve policy. The members of the Board of Governors are nominated by the president and ratified by congress. And yes, once they are nominated they are supposedly independent from political pressure. But its not true that the Fed is politically independent, f.e. Bernanke knows that to be re-elected again, he has to please the politicians.So I think its very inaccurate to say that the Federal Reserve is a private institution. You could argue that its not a 100% government institution, that its a mixed thing between private and government, but still the government is the one holding control over the institution that sets the policy. If you want a more exact and legal approach, check this: http://mises.org/daily/4171So I would say that the political system holds good power over the Federal Reserve. That is not to say that the corporate system does not benefit or controls the Federal Reserve. They do, but I think its mainly through the control they have over the political system. No, I am not saying that the Board of Governors does a good job or anything similar. I am just saying that the Board of Governors, the one who takes the decisions in the Fed, is a federal government agency. Supposedly, the system is the way you describe it so the members are independent. I dont believe that for a moment, but it is the justification. Having a independent or honest politician or bureaucrat with that level of power is an utopia, a lie. But the decisions about monetary policy are already taken by a federal government agency. That is what I wanted to say, not that it worked. If I could I would abolish the Fed, and put an end to the money monopoly.I think that the real reason politicians support the central bank is because the central bank finances government and allows politicians to spend more than they could by direct taxation only. The IMF published a paper recently about the necessity of a global currency and speculated about how to make it work. One of the main arguments were the demise of the dollar and its possible collapse. So there you have a reason to make the dollar collapse.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Bernanke and the rest of the gang) is nominated by the president and ratified by congress. If you say that the government is corrupt and benefits special interests I will agree with you (its a government...), but I dont see how someone can say that the Fed controls government when its the other way arround. You have to think that politicians benefit from the expansionary policies of the Fed, because they get to spend more than they would without the Fed.Banks hate deflation. If they can avoid it they will. And they can, so I highly doubt we will see any meaningful price deflation. My doubt is: Why would someone choose this currency over bitcoins? It seems to me that it has the same advantages and problems that bitcoin has, except that it has one more problem that bitcoins do not have, it is tied to the dollar value and will depreciate with it. Why would anyone choose them over bitcoin? Agreed then. I misread what you were trying to say. I agree with the others that say that the tally stick and bitcoins are not similar at all. In fact, they are opposites. The tally stick was a government imposed currency. Bitcoin is a voluntary currency. Nobody forces you to accept it like the tally sticks.A better analogy for bitcoin could be the private mints of the UK XVII century.PS: The fact that the king used tally sticks to fight powerfull people in England does not make them legit. The king wanted the power to keep his authoritative regime, to fund wars, etc... There is nothing noble in tally sticks, just another government forcing a currency on the people because it had the swords. This network has been created differently than the potato mesh idea that you posted. There are nodes and super nodes. They have different functions. Basically the node connects (usually) to a super node, and the super nodes connect between themselves. The reason for this is mainly hardware and easier routing. The nodes are basically simple devices with one antenna that connects to a super node, like the one I just linked previously. Super nodes have different antennas, some directional to connect to other supernodes, and other omni-directional (or partially) so the nodes can connect. The reason for this is that directional antenas only radiate in one direction but get farther away and with better bandwith, so they are used to connect super-nodes. Then they have one or two (or more in some big super nodes) omni-directional that can not radiate km away but allows for local nodes to connect to the super node, because it radiates in all (or some) directions and covers an area. So you basically have the troncal connections between the super nodes and then the nodes connected to the super nodes. As the network started growing there was an effort to create redundant connections between the super nodes, for more bandwith and in case one super nodes goes down temporarely.This is the reason why the supernodes (more expensive) are sometimes funded through a donation system, where the interested chip in.The difference with what I have read of the mesh potato network is that with this system you can connect nodes farther away from each other, and the routing is more efficient, allowing for better lag and most probably better bandwith. I have my doubts on how a mesh network can behave in networks with a big number of nodes and covering a big territory, but if you want to cover a big area you need a lot of people adopting it. But this way, you can have a few people in different towns conected between each other, without the need of all the towns in the middle collaborating at the moment. The con is that you have to coordinate the IP addresses of the nodes. In the catalan network this is done through the webpage of the association. You create a node there (they use google maps to place the node) and then you get an IP address, that is usually dettermined by location and the supernode you are going to use, so the super nodes have an easier task routing packages.If this kind of networks gets popular you can probably create a mixed system, where you keep the super nodes structure but connect to the super node using a local mesh network instead of a registered node. They are trying to do this here in one of the towns where guifi.net is more extended. Their idea is to use the local town government lighting and put the mesh nodes on top (basically because its elevated and already has electricity), so they create a mesh network that gives connectivity to the whole town, and even to your mobile phone or device anywhere in the town. But to do this there has to be a wide acceptance of the project, so I think starting with the node-supernode infrastructure works better initially.And yes, those system where cheaper before (or my memory fails). I will try to look for the shop where I got the prices. Still 60-70$ one time purchase is afordable. In a few months you have already saved that much by not paying your intenet provider.PS: Here there is even a optic fiber connection. The guys connected this way obviously dont live in a city where this would be difficult. Nodes are pretty cheap. If you have someone with a super node near you, you can buy a ready to use device for 30-40 euros (http://shop.openrb.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=140, prices have changed). This devices come with the antenna and the circutis inside a sealed box with a ethernet connection (the electricity comes through the ethernet as well), so you just have to place the device in your roof, pointing to where the other node is and connect the ethernet cable. You have to make some configurations in the machine, that can easily explained and you are set to go. The box is sealed and can go through rain, storms, snow, etc... (although if you leave in a region with extream weather you might want to look at the specifications for max and minimum temperature). Some of this boxes have achieved connections of a few kilometers if they have direct vision between the nodes.Building a super-node is more expensive, but not as much as you would think. The minimum bill for a decent super node is usually 300-400 euros. This includes a machine capable of handling 4 antennas, and one or two directional antennas to connect to other super nodes, and one or two omni-directional antennas (or similar) for the local nodes. Usually each town or region of a big city needs its own super node.In Catalunya the network has grown without any type of central or initial funding. People just got together and started creating their nodes. At some point the webpage started a system of voluntary donations to create the super nodes, because at the end they were going to be used for the whole town. But if you get 10 to 20 people in a town to cheap in 20-30 euros you are good to go. This has been used also to create solar powered super nodes on top of mountains (imposible to get electricity there) to connect super nodes that did not have direct vision. You dont really need a lot of planning. Once the network starts growing then some coordination is needed, but is mainly configuration issues. In Catalunya they end up creating a non-profit association to handle this. This is just how they have done it in Catalunya. Maybe in other parts of the world other aproaches work better, but the system is not that expensive.The software is already developed (linux based) and easy to configure. People in the community is very helping and if you need any type of help I am voluntaring to connect the two groups as translator for any help any USA people would need to start their own network.What it usually works to attract people initially and start growing the network is for someone to offer a proxy to the internet. The proxy can have the p2p connections blocked (with the exception of bitcoin obviously) so the users dont abuse. A user with a good internet connection or even some bussiness can do this, without any cost (just the burden of having a part of the bandwith used by other people). Offering free (as in free beer) internet for only an initial payment of 30 dollars is a very good deal and a lot of people will be interseted. Once the network is growing, people can start using it to talk by phone and other stuff. In the catalan network there is people thinking about offering a commercial connection to the internet, that could be way cheaper since they dont need to deploy the infrastructure.This is getting long. If any one interested has any more questions just shoot them, and I will even connect them with some of the more tech savy people around here if needed. If the MSM wants to slander bitcoin they will find a way (there are many examples of this), so its not good to get obsessed with that issue. That said, I completely agree that the best way to deal with this is just not commenting. You are comparing bitcoins to dollars, which is not a very stable currency. If the dollars keeps devaluating like it has done in the last decades and the bitcoin-dollar exchange keeps stable it means bitcoins are loosing value. If someone can open ports in your router it can led to all kind of security holes. There was even a bug in the windows implementation of upnp that allowed anyone in the internet to open a port in your router. Its just not safe to allow automatically opening ports in your router. This would be a big step towards anonimity and avoiding any government interference on bitcoin. Right now the government controls the internet through regulating the commercial providers, people's access point. But this is a private network, people just connecting to each other with wifi devices in their roofs. It would be impossible for government to control, without going home by home shutting down the devices. It is also a cheap way to have network connectivity and scape the government sponsored corporations that provide internet service right now. In the catalan network there is people providing proxies to access the internet. Having UPnP enabled in your router is a security suicide. UPnP inside your trusted local network is ok, but I would not use it in your router. Kiba for scrow. But i wont vote for you again if you dont promise me some wellfare benefits next time!  This is actually a very well written and easy to understand article. One of the best about bitcoin that I have read.
Ja que estem obro un fil per si un altre català s'ha perdut per aquí. You think Windows Aero is pretty?   Model: Intel Atom n330 (2 cores, 4 virtual).OS: Ubuntu 10.04 64bitUsing the -4way option I get half the speed than using no option.  Tryed Bitcoin 3.10 on Ubuntu Lucid 64 bit on Intel Atom 330.Using the option -4way produces half the hash/s than not using the option. I tried using 1 to 4 (virtual) cores and -4way option produces less than no option always (arround half). Its probably due to the Intel thing. Does your car count kilometers?   You might be interested in this: http://guifi.net In reality, which option is more fair is a personal thing. Its subjective. This is why avoiding government impositions is so great. Because both groups can get to try what they think its more fair (or whatever they want). If it was a authoritarian system whether the leaders decide or whether it is voted, only one system could be implemented.If this guy wants to do the other system, fine. I hope him good as long as the system is voluntary. But that kind of system will only work through government force, and, in my opinion, that is what he is aiming at, hiding it behind nice and moral-sounding arguments. But if he really wants to create and try such a system as a voluntary currency, its fine with me and I hope he succeeds. No GPL? Unforgivable!!! I am leaving this community at once...  MIT is considered an open source license by the EFF, right? Kiba, you forgot to mention that the bitcoin software is open source and GPL. Since we are writing to the EFF I think its important to specify it. There you go. You admit it.When you talk about the community, in reality you are talking about the majority of the people in a region, because its imposbile that everybody has the same view about something. So you are actually advocating the rule of the majority, and by violent means if necessary. I find it repulsive.You have an example with prop8 in California. The majority decided that gay people should not marry, when is something between the two and does not affect anyone else. Yet, the majority decided they had the positive right to ban it and they did. From your point of view its fantastic and very moral. From my point of view its inmoral.Fortunately, in the USA they still have what its left of the rule of law, and the Supreme Court decided the majority should not get its way, and the individuals had the right to associate as they will, without the majority imposing their views on them.Nobody is talking about going alone. He is talking about a community where self-ownership and natural rights are respected.The fact that you talk again and again and again and again about a community does not mean you are a team player or care about the others. It just mean you like to talk about it a lot. Everybody (or almost everybody) wants to live in a community, surrounded by other people and stablish colaboration with them. But what you are advocating is going futher than collaboration and having the majority impose its will violently over the rest of the people. I find your view extremely immoral and repulsive. Add another 10 here. Honestly, when someone starts with this type of charlatanery it looses any credibility. Its obvious that you want to use cheap tricks and not acomplish anything constructive.And I will do something for you even when I dont know you, I will give you an advice: Dont come to a place and start going over peoples head telling them they dont understand human nature (and obviously implying you do completely). First, take the head out of your ass, come down to earth with us mortals, and then consider that the ideas you regard as "moral" are just evil, abusive, inmoral and degenerated.Linux is an open source kernel or the community that programs it. Whatever you consider they are both VOLUNTARY. Nobody is going to take you seriously if you say that you have the privilege (or positive right, call it how you wish) of forcing anyone to program something for you. Linux and the linux community has nothing to do with what you are proposing.Internet is a network of computers, just in case you didnt notice. Suposedly it uses 1 to 2 W only and the CPU has a cryptographic acceleration: http://plugcomputer.org/plugforum/index.php?topic=197.0Sounds very interesting for bitcoin.EDIT: The 1 W propaganda of the webpage is just that, propaganda (as spected). In real life test it uses 4W when iddle and 11W when CPU at 100% with USB and network being used. Still its very very good. A "growing money system" encourages speculation since you are influencing people to spend or invest more in the short term than they would naturally do. Since prices are going up there is no incentive to save in money and all the incentive is to "save" in form of commodity or investment. Following what you propose is how people is forced to play in the Wall Street casino or buy all type of things to keep their savings (buying houses is great, they always go up in price and the rest of the mambo jambo...) just to preserve their savings. This is why big banks always promote this type of system.I certainly dont want that type of events happening in the bitcoin community. Encouraging speculation is not what a monetary system is about. I was going to say exactly this. Glad someone catch it before I did. Now that you are at it, make it an overcraft also. As you are guessing, I am not convinced, but maybe you are seeing something I dont. Good luck with the initiative.  Best selling point ever.   Why wont you use the mobile internet connection or the internet connection of your house? Why does the kid mowing your lawn need to provide a internet connection?This is not very interesting as it drives people away from bitcoins.This is a good idea, but involves merchant computer use, and it seems similar to me to the smartphone solutions I already mention. The pros of this option is that it seems slightly simpler as the bitcoin program could have a transfer option to a usb wallet (or to a smartphone wallet for the case, they have usb connections). The cons of this option is that you can only access the funds you transfered to the usb dongle (or the smartphone memory).This seems to me like a smartphone solution, not a paper solution.I dont think installing a frontend or a wallet for bitcoin in the mobile phone from a app shop is complicated.How does the kid that mows the lawn know that the certificate is valid? To really be able to verify the certificate you need a computer, and then the smartphone solution its more practical.I think that a bitcoin wallet software for mobile phones or usb dongles is more practical, if you dont want to have your phone connected to the internet in any way, than this paper certificates. If this paper would be used without imediate validation in the bitcoin network, they could be unreliable and give bad image to bitcoin currency. As I said previously, maybe this idea could work, who knows, let the people who want to use it decide, but in my opinion is not a good idea. This is why:Well, a smartphone has mobile internet connection (almost) everywhere in a industrialized nation. Also, the shop could have a wifi or bluetooth connection to allow for the phone to connect and make the payment. And you dont need to have a bitcoin server in the phone, you could have a frontend that connects through ssh to you home bitcoin server and orders payments. You can even have the objects tagged with 3D barcodes that allows the phone to recoignaze them and the customer does not even have to type anything into the phone, just scan the barcodes with its phone and confirm the transaction.Or this idea I just came up with: Imagine bitcoind would have a webpage frontend where you could order it to make payments (obviously password protected). The shop would only need to let you access your server webpage and make the payment.Arent all this options simpler that printing paper?I dont think people is going to decide if they own an iPhone depending on its capability as a bitcoin wallet.If you want a middle man that the merchant could trust there alredy exists internet bitcoin accounts.Again, we'll see what happen. Maybe it does have some use, I just dont see it.
