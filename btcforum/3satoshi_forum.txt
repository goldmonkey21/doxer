There's more work to do on DoS, but I'm doing a quick build of what I have so far in case it's needed, before venturing into more complex ideas.  The build for this is version 0.3.19.- Added some DoS controlsAs Gavin and I have said clearly before, the software is not at all resistant to DoS attack.  This is one improvement, but there are still more ways to attack than I can count.  I'm leaving the -limitfreerelay part as a switch for now and it's there if you need it.- Removed "safe mode" alerts"safe mode" alerts was a temporary measure after the 0.3.9 overflow bug.  We can say all we want that users can just run with "-disablesafemode", but it's better just not to have it for the sake of appearances.  It was never intended as a long term feature.  Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid block chain.Builds:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.19/ It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context.  WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us. That means a lot coming from you, Hal.  Thanks. If you ever find anyone who turned it on.  It's disabled by default.It's all STL.  There are almost no buffers. @dtvan: all 3 excellent points. 1) IP records don't need to be in the chain, just do registrar function not DNS.  And CA problem solved, neat.2) Pick one TLD, .web +1.3) Expiration and significant renewal costs, very important.Avoiding CPU power fragmentation is no longer a reason.  Independent networks/chains can share CPU power without sharing much else.  See: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696 and http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28715#msg28715 I agree.  All transactions, IP changes, renewals, etc. should have some fee that goes to the miners.You might consider a certain amount of work to generate a domain, instead of a fixed total circulation.  The work per domain could be on a schedule that grows with Moore's Law.  That way the number of domains would grow with demand and the number of people using it. Right, the exchange rate between domains and bitcoins would float.A longer interval than 10 minutes would be appropriate for BitDNS.So far in this discussion there's already a lot of housekeeping data required.  It will be much easier if you can freely use all the space you need without worrying about paying fees for expensive space in Bitcoin's chain.  Some transactions:Changing the IP record.Name change.  A domain object could entitle you to one domain, and you could change it at will to any name that isn't taken.  This would encourage users to free up names they don't want anymore.  Generated domains start out blank and the miner sells it to someone who changes it to what they want.  Renewal.  Could be free, or maybe require consuming another domain object to renew.  In that case, domain objects (domaincoins?) could represent the right to own a domain for a year.  The spent fee goes to the miners in the next block fee. Some sample pseudocode using the new Accounts based commands in 0.3.18.print "send to " + getaccountaddress(username) + " to fund your account"print "balance: " + getbalance(username, 0)print "available balance: " + getbalance(username, 6)// if you make a sale, move the money from their account to your "" accountif (move(username, "", amount, 6, "purchased item"))    SendTheGoods()// withdrawalsendfrom(username, bitcoinaddress, amount, 6, "withdrawal by user")You can use listtransactions(username) to show them a list of their recent transactions. Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale.Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately.  Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.  BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either.The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring.  It's easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-repudiable commodities.If you're still worried about it, it's cryptographically possible to make a risk free trade.  The two parties would set up transactions on both sides such that when they both sign the transactions, the second signer's signature triggers the release of both.  The second signer can't release one without releasing the other. Not locktime.There's a possible design for far in the future:You intentionally write a double-spend.  You write it with the same inputs and outputs, but this time with a fee.  When your double-spend gets into a block, the first spend becomes invalid.  The payee does not really notice, because at the moment the new transaction becomes valid, the old one becomes invalid, and the new transaction simply takes its place.It's easier said than implemented.  There would be a fair amount of work to make a client that correctly writes the double-spend, manages the two versions in the wallet until one is chosen, handles all the corner cases.  Every assumption in the existing code is that you're not trying to write double-spends.There would need to be some changes on the Bitcoin Miner side also, to make the possibility to accept a double-spend into the transaction pool, but only strictly if the inputs and outputs match and the transaction fee is higher.  Currently, double-spends are never accepted into the transaction pool, so every node bears witness to which transaction it saw first by working to put it into a block. The incentive is to get the rewards from the extra side chains also for the same work.While you are generating bitcoins, why not also get free domain names for the same work?If you currently generate 50 BTC per week, now you could get 50 BTC and some domain names too.You have one piece of work.  If you solve it, it will solve a block from both Bitcoin and BitDNS.  In concept, they're tied together by a Merkle Tree.  To hand it in to Bitcoin, you break off the BitDNS branch, and to hand it in to BitDNS, you break off the Bitcoin branch.In practice, to retrofit it for Bitcoin, the BitDNS side would have to have maybe ~200 extra bytes, but that's not a big deal.  You've been talking about 50 domains per block, which would dwarf that little 200 bytes per block for backward compatibility.  We could potentially schedule a far in future block when Bitcoin would upgrade to a modernised arrangement with the Merkle Tree on top, if we care enough about saving a few bytes.Note that the chains are below this new Merkle Tree.  That is, each of Bitcoin and BitDNS have their own chain links inside their blocks.  This is inverted from the common timestamp server arrangement, where the chain is on top and then the Merkle Tree, because that creates one common master chain.  This is two timestamp servers not sharing a chain. I think it would be possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and separate block chain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin.  The only overlap is to make it so miners can search for proof-of-work for both networks simultaneously.The networks wouldn't need any coordination.  Miners would subscribe to both networks in parallel.  They would scan SHA such that if they get a hit, they potentially solve both at once.  A solution may be for just one of the networks if one network has a lower difficulty.I think an external miner could call getwork on both programs and combine the work.  Maybe call Bitcoin, get work from it, hand it to BitDNS getwork to combine into a combined work.Instead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each other's total CPU power.  This would solve the problem that if there are multiple networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power gangs up on one.  Instead, all networks in the world would share combined CPU power, increasing the total strength.  It would make it easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base of miners. Thanks for setting this up Cdecker.  Is there any chance of getting it to build the GUI version also?  If this is Ubuntu, if you get wxWidgets 2.9.0 it should just be a matter of following the steps in build-unix.txt exactly.  Is this an environment where you can build wxWidgets once and leave it there and just keep using it? As long as the interface is designed for things like showing the user the last N transactions history, it's fine, now that we have the Accounts feature making it easier to do payment detection the right way.Gavin, could listtransactions have an option to list transactions for all accounts?I'm not sure what the interface could be, maybe:listtransactions <JSON null type> [count]It would be hard to do that from the command line though. I can't think of a good solution for the interface, that's the problem.  Maybe "*" special case like "" is.  Everyone would have to make sure no user can create account name "*".I don't get how that's "easy" to track with transactions. I came to agree with Gavin about whitelisting when I realized how quickly new transaction types can be added.That's already possible.  <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG.  <pubkey> can be 33 to 120 bytes.I also support a third transaction type for timestamp hash sized arbitrary data.  There's no point not having one since you can already do it anyway.  It would tell nodes they don't need to bother to index it. New transaction templates can be added as needed.  Within a few days, there will be plenty of GPU power that accepts and works on it.  Network support will be thorough long before there'll be enough clients who understand how to receive and interpret the new transaction.Timestamp hashes are still already possible:txin: 0.01txout: 0.00  <appid, hash> OP_CHECKSIGfee: 0.01 If there's an actual application like BitDNS getting ready to actually start inserting hashes, we can always add a specific transaction template for timestamps.I like Hal Finney's idea for user-friendly timestamping.  Convert the hash of a file to a bitcoin address and send 0.01 to it: I'm not talking about the normal risk for a given minconf level, I'm talking about additional pitfalls from listtransactions when used this way.The OP's example of listtransactions <account> [count=10] [txid] seems to imply and it would be very easy for programmers to assume that if they pass in the last txid of the previous call to listtransactions, they will never see the same transaction more than once, which is not the case.  It would be very easy to double-count payments if you don't maintain your own persistent map or dictionary to track which txid's you've already accepted.It doesn't seem right to have a function that seems tailor made to be used a certain obvious way, and that way is a non-obvious trap.Suppose both spends are to the same address.  getreceivedbyaddress would always count only one or the other spend at any given time, never both.Using listtransactions, it would be very easy to count both.  You see the first spend, you count it.  You see the second spend, you count it.  Total is double counted. Changes:- Fixed a wallet.dat compatibility problem if you downgraded from 0.3.17 and then upgraded again- IsStandard() check to only include known transaction types in blocks- Jgarzik's optimisation to speed up the initial block download a littleThe main addition in this release is the Accounts-Based JSON-RPC commands that Gavin's been working on (more details at http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1886.0).  - getaccountaddress- sendfrom- move- getbalance- listtransactionsDownload:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.18/ Then how do you cope with the issues I listed in the message you quoted? It's not safe to use listtransactions this way.I know I've been criticized for being reluctant about listtransactions.  Let me explain my reluctance.Transactions are dynamic.  Past transactions can become unconfirmed, go away and come back, become invalid and disappear, or be replaced by a different double-spend.  Their date can change, their order can change.Programmers are naturally inclined to want to use listtransactions like this: feed me the new transactions since I last asked, and I'll keep my own tally or static record of them.  This will seem to work in all regular use, but if you use the amounts for anything, it is highly exploitable:1) How do you know if a past transaction becomes invalid and disappears?2) When there's a block-chain reorg, it would be easy to double-count transactions when they get confirmed again.3) A transaction can be replaced by a double-spend with a different txid.  You would count both spends.The model where you assume you only need to see new transactions because you've already seen previous transactions is not true.  Old transactions can change at any time.Any time you take an action based on payment amounts received, you always need to go back to bitcoin and ask for a current balance total (or use move or sendfrom), and be ready for the possibility that it can go down.Now that we have the Accounts feature making it easier to do it the right way, we're better prepared to have listtransactions.
No, don't "bring it on".The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way.I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy.  You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage. That's a good optimisation.  I'll add that next time I update SVN.More generally, we could also consider this:        dbenv.set_lk_max_objects(10000);        dbenv.set_errfile(fopen(strErrorFile.c_str(), "a")); /// debug        dbenv.set_flags(DB_AUTO_COMMIT, 1);+       dbenv.set_flags(DB_TXN_NOSYNC, 1);        ret = dbenv.open(strDataDir.c_str(),                         DB_CREATE     |                         DB_INIT_LOCK  |                         DB_INIT_LOG   |We would then rely on dbenv.txn_checkpoint(0, 0, 0) in CDB::Close() to flush after wallet writes. What was this wallet used with?  An early accounts patch or git build?It's while loading the wallet.  I assume it must be in this:    else if (strType == "acentry")    {        string strAccount;        ssKey >> strAccount;        uint64 nNumber;        ssKey >> nNumber;        if (nNumber > nAccountingEntryNumber)            nAccountingEntryNumber = nNumber;    }You could check that with this:    else if (strType == "acentry")    {        string strAccount;        assert(!ssKey.empty());        ssKey >> strAccount;        uint64 nNumber;        if (ssKey.size() != 8 )            printf("***** %s %d\n", strAccount.c_str(), ssKey.size());        assert(ssKey.empty() == false);        ssKey >> nNumber;        if (nNumber > nAccountingEntryNumber)            nAccountingEntryNumber = nNumber;    }Was there an interim version of accounts on git at some point that had just ("acentry", "account") for the key?If you have gdb, you could run it in gdb and do a backtrace. gdb --args bitcoin ...run(wait for exception)bt It seems like you're inclined to assume everything is wrong more than is actually so.Writing the block index is light work.  Building the tx index is much more random access per block.  I suspect reading all the prev txins is what's slow.  Read caching would help that.  It's best if the DB does that.  Maybe it has a setting for how much cache memory to use.Already does that.  See CDB.  The lifetime of the (for instance) CTxDB object is only to support database transactions and to know if anything is still using the database at shutdown.If it was doing that it would be much slower.  It's supposed to be only once a minute or 500 blocks:    if (strFile == "blkindex.dat" && IsInitialBlockDownload() && nBestHeight % 500 != 0)        nMinutes = 1;    dbenv.txn_checkpoint(0, nMinutes, 0);Probably should add this:    if (!fReadOnly)        dbenv.txn_checkpoint(0, nMinutes, 0);Does transaction commit imply flush?  That seems surprising to me.  I assume a database op wrapped in a transaction would be logged like any other database op.  Many database applications need to wrap almost every pair of ops in a transaction, such as moving money from one account to another. (debit a, credit b)  I can't imagine they're required to batch all their stuff up themselves.In the following cases, would case 1 flush once and case 2 flush twice?case 1:writewritewritewritecheckpointcase 2:begin transactionwritewritecommit transactionbegin transactionwritewritecommit transactioncheckpointContorting our database usage will not be the right approach.  It's going to be BDB settings and caching. Very much not.  Using multiple copies of wallet.dat is not recommended or supported, in fact all of Bitcoin is designed to defeat that.  Both copies will get screwed up.If you're trying to consolidate your generated coins into one wallet, a better solution now is to run getwork miners on the additional systems.  jgarzik has a CPU miner, and it supports tcatm's 4-way SSE2, so on Windows it's up to twice as fast as the built-in SHA if you have an AMD or recent Intel (core 3, 5 or 7).New demonstration CPU miner available:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1925.0 Despite everything else said, the current next step is:In particular, I suspect that more read caching might help a lot.Then something more specific was wrong.  That's not due to normal initial download time.  Without more details, it can't be diagnosed.  If it was due to slow download, did it speed up after 10-20 minutes when the next block broadcast should have made it switch to a faster source?  debug.log might have clues.  How fast is their Internet connection?  Was it steadily slow, or just slow down at one point?The 74000 checkpoint is not enough to protect you, and does nothing if the download is already past 74000.  -checkblocks does more, but is still easily defeated.  You still must trust the supplier of the zipfile.If there was a "verify it" step, that would take as long as the current normal initial download, in which it is the indexing, not the data download, that is the bottleneck.80 bytes per header and no indexing work.  Might take 1 minute.The data is mostly hashes and keys and signatures that are uncompressible.The speed of initial download is not a reflection of the bulk data transfer rate of the protocol.  The gating factor is the indexing while it downloads. ribuck's description is spot on.Pool operators can modify their getwork to take one additional parameter, the address to send your share to.The easy way for the pool operator would be to wait until the next block is found and divy it up proportionally as:user's near-hits/total near-hits from everyoneThat would be easier and safer to start up.  It also has the advantage that multiple hits from the same user can be combined into one transaction.  A lot of your hits will usually be from the same people.The instant gratification way would be to pay a fixed amount for each near-hit immediately, and the operator takes the risk from randomness of having more or less near-hits before a block is found. Either way, the user who submits the hit that solves the block should get an extra amount off the top, like 10 BTC.New users wouldn't really even need the Bitcoin software.  They could download a miner, create an account on mtgox or mybitcoin, enter their deposit address into the miner and point it at anyone's pool server.  When the miner says it found something, a while later a few coins show up in their account.Miner writers better make sure they never false-positive near-hits.  Users will depend on that to check if the pool operator is cheating them.  If the miner wrongly says it found something, users will look in their account, not find anything, and get mad at the pool operator. You should try it with tcatm's 4-way SSE2 SHA in sha256.cpp.  It compiles fine as a C file, just rename sha256.cpp to sha256.c.  I was able to get it to work in simple tests on Windows, but not when linked in with Bitcoin.  It may have a better chance of working as part of a C program instead of C++.Currently it's only enabled in the Linux build, so if you get it to work you could make it available to Windows users.  It's about 100% speedup on AMD CPUs. That's what it does, it returns true/false. Laszlo does them, but I haven't asked him to do one for a while because there wasn't anything major.  I'll ask him to do this version. I tested it on a slow 7 year old drive, where bandwidth and CPU were clearly not the bottleneck.  Initial download took 1 hour 20 minutes.If it's taking a lot longer than that, certainly 24 hours, then it must be downloading from a very slow node, or your connection is much slower than around 15KB per sec (120kbps), or something else is wrong.  It would be nice to know what appears to be the bottleneck when that happens.Every 10 minutes or so when the latest block is sent, it should have the chance to change to a faster node.  When the latest block is broadcast, it requests the next 500 blocks from other nodes, and continues the download from the one that sends it fastest.  At least, that's how it should work.It may only need more read caching.  It has to read randomly all over blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat to index.  It can't assume the file is smaller than memory, although it currently still is.  Caching would be effective, since most dependencies are recent.Someone should experiment with different Berkeley DB settings and see if there's something that makes the download substantially faster.  If something substantial is discovered, then we can work out the particulars.We checkpoint every 500 blocks. Version 0.3.17 is now available. Changes:- new getwork, thanks m0mchil- added transaction fee setting in UI options menu- free transaction limits- sendtoaddress returns transaction id instead of "sent"- getaccountaddress <account>The UI transaction fee setting was easy since it was still there from 0.1.5 and all I had to do was re-enable it.The accounts-based commands: move, sendfrom and getbalance <account> will be in the next release.  We still have some more changes to make first.Downloads:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.17/ It's not the downloading that takes the time, it's verifying and indexing it.Bandwidthwise, it's more efficient than if you downloaded an archive.  Bitcoin only downloads the data in blk0001.dat, which is currently 55MB, and builds blkindex.dat itself, which is 47MB.  Building blkindex.dat is what causes all the disk activity.During the block download, it only flushes the database to disk every 500 blocks.  You may see the block count pause at ??499 and ??999.  That's when it's flushing.Doing your own verifying and indexing is the only way to be sure your index data is secure.  If you copy blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat from an untrusted source, there's no way to know if you can trust all the contents in them.Maybe Berkeley DB has some tweaks we can make to enable or increase cache memory. A revised version of getwork is now in the official client, but the miners need to be updated a little to use it. getwork does the byte-reversing.  midstate, data and hash1 are already big-endian, and you pass data back still big-endian, so you work in big-endian and don't have to do any byte-reversing.  They're the same data that is passed to the ScanHash_ functions.  You can take midstate, data and hash1, put them in 16-byte aligned buffers and pass them to a ScanHash_ function, like ScanHash(pmidstate, pdata + 64, phash1, nHashesDone).  If a nonce is found, patch it into data and call getwork.I should probably change the ScanHash_ functions to use pdata instead of pdata + 64 so they're consistent.target is little endian, it's supposed to be the same as how m0mchil's did it.  (if it's not, then it should be fixed)  That's the only case where you would use byte reverse.  I think you do it like: if ByteReverse((unsigned int*)hash[6]) < (unsigned int*)target[6].This is the new spec.  It shouldn't be hard to update your miner to use it.The changes are:- It does not return work when you submit a possible hit, only when called without parameter.- The block field has been split into data and hash1.- state renamed to midstate for consistency.- extranonce not needed. It's not an exact drop-in replacement.  I wanted to clean up the interface a little.  It only requires a few changes.ScanHash_ functions aren't going away.  BTW, the interface of this is designed to mirror the parameters of that (midstate, data, hash1). I uploaded a redesign of m0mchil's getwork to SVN rev 189 (version 31601)m0mchil's external bitcoin miner idea has solved a lot of problems.  GPU programming is immature and hard to compile, and I didn't want to add additional dependencies to the build.  getwork allows these problems to be solved separately, with different programs for different hardware and OSes.  It's also convenient that server farms can run a single Bitcoin node and the rest only run getwork clients.The interface has a few changes:getwork [data]If [data] is not specified, returns formatted hash data to work on:  "midstate" : precomputed hash state after hashing the first half of the data  "data" : block data  "hash1" : formatted hash buffer for second hash  "target" : little endian hash targetIf [data] is specified, tries to solve the block and returns true if it was successful.  [data] is the same 128 byte block data that was returned in the "data" field, but with the nonce changed.Notes: - It does not return work when you submit a possible hit, only when called without parameter.- The block field has been separated into data and hash1.- data is 128 bytes, which includes the first half that's already hashed by midstate.- hash1 is always the same, but included for convenience.- Logging of "ThreadRPCServer method=getwork" is disabled, it would be too much junk in the log. Thanks m0mchil for keeping up on the updates!GPU miners, please upgrade as soon as possible to shut down the free transaction abuse!  This version has the new priority-based limit on free transaction spam.Before SVN 184, compiling transactions into a block used an n^2 algorithm.  The new efficient single-pass algorithm is orders of magnitude quicker.  (O(n) vs O(n^2)/2 algorithm, n=200 maybe 10 to 100 times quicker) I'm doing something like that.  Priority is a more formalised version of the concept you're describing.Yes, like this.  And the no-priority-requirement area is 3K, about a dozen transactions per block.I just uploaded SVN rev 185 which has a minimal priority requirement for free transactions.  Transaction floods are made up of coins that are re-spent over and over, so they depend on their own 0 conf transactions repeatedly.  0 conf transactions have 0 priority, so free transactions like that will have to wait for one transaction to get into a block at a time.Version 0.3.15 doesn't write transactions using 0 conf dependencies unless that's all it has left, so normal users shouldn't usually have a problem with this.I think this is a good compromise short of making the default fee 0.01.  It's not so much to ask that free transactions can only be used to turn coins over so often.  If you're using free transactions, you're taking charity and there has to be some limit on how often you can use it with the same coins.We've always said free transactions may be processed more slowly.  You can help ensure your transactions go through quickly by adding -paytxfee=0.01. We can't safely do OP_BLOCKNUMBER.  In the event of a block chain reorg after a segmentation, transactions need to be able to get into the chain in a later block.  The OP_BLOCKNUMBER transaction and all its dependants would become invalid.  This wouldn't be fair to later owners of the coins who weren't involved in the time limited transaction.nTimeLock does the reverse.  It's an open transaction that can be replaced with new versions until the deadline.  It can't be recorded until it locks.  The highest version when the deadline hits gets recorded.  It could be used, for example, to write an escrow transaction that will automatically permanently lock and go through unless it is revoked before the deadline.  The feature isn't enabled or used yet, but the support is there so it could be implemented later.
You should use at least some priority in case a flood comes along before the next block.As long as all dependencies have at least 1 conf, if the transaction doesn't have enough priority at first, the dependencies will age until it does.Or managing how much priority you spend on a transaction.  The software would have to know your future plans to know whether to spend your priority now or save it for later.  I don't think we'll need to get into that much detail though.  There's a wide enough difference between normal users and flooders.Priority doesn't have to do everything.  Once you know there's a flood, you can add -paytxfee=0.01.  Hopefully with priority, your transactions before that should be at worst slow, not stuck. Version 0.3.15 is now available.Changes:- paytxfee switch is now per KB, so it adds the correct fee for large transactions- sending avoids using coins with less than 6 confirmations if it can- BitcoinMiner processes transactions in priority order based on age of dependencies- make sure generation doesn't start before block 74000 downloaded- bugfixes by Dean Gores- testnet, keypoololdest and paytxfee added to getinfo Thank you for limiting flood tests to the testnet.Version 0.3.15 combines several features to help legitimate transactions jump the queue during a flood attack.  The key was Gavin's idea for prioritising transactions based on the age of their dependencies.  Every coin is entitled to turn over so often.  The longer waited, the more priority accumulates.  Priority is sum(valuein * age) / txsize.  Transaction fee still takes precedence over priority, and priority determines the order of processing within a fee strata.In support of the priority feature, SelectCoins only uses your own 0 conf transactions only as a last resort if that's all you have left.  This helps keep you from turning your coins over rapidly unless you're forcing it by actually turning all your coins over rapidly. I'm happy if someone with artistic skill wants to contribute alternatives.  The icon/logo was meant to be good as an icon at the 16x16 and 20x20 pixel sizes.  I think it's the best program icon, but there's room for improvement at larger sizes for a graphic for use on websites.It'll be a lot simpler if authors could make their graphics public domain. The only thing I can think of is to see if there are other versions of mingwm10.dll you can get.  mingwm10.dll is a tiny little DLL that came with the MinGW compiler that you need when you build for multi-thread.  I don't know exactly what it does, but it probably just says something like "yes Windows, see I'm in a DLL like you insisted."The end of your debug.log file might show the last thing it was doing before it crashed. Here's some pseudocode of how you would use the account based commands.  It sure makes website integration a lot easier.print "send to " + getaccountaddress(username) + " to fund your account"print "balance: " + getbalance(username, 0)print "available balance: " + getbalance(username, 6)// if you make a sale, move the money out of their accountmove(username, "", amount, 6)// withdrawalsendfrom(username, bitcoinaddress, amount, 6) I have the beginning of something like this.  It's mostly like what Gavin described.Some more rpc interface:move <fromaccount> <toaccount> <amount>   Move from one internal account to another.  I think blank account name ("") will be your default account.  If you sell something to a user, you could do move "theiraccount" "" 123.45.   Is "move" the best name for this?  I shied away from "transfer" because that sounds too close to sending a transaction.I'm thinking a new function getaccountaddress instead of overloading getnewaddress:getaccountaddress <account>   Gives you an address allocated from getnewaddress <account>.  It'll keep giving the same address until something is received on the address, then it allocates a new address.  (It automatically does what the sample code I posted some time ago did)Would these commands make it possible in simple cases to implement your website without needing a database of your own? ECDSA can't encrypt messages, only sign signatures.It would be unwise to have permanently recorded plaintext messages for everyone to see.  It would be an accident waiting to happen.If there's going to be a message system, it should be a separate system parallel to the bitcoin network.  Messages should not be recorded in the block chain.  The messages could be signed with the bitcoin address keypairs to prove who they're from. This is the important clue.  I believe it's saying it crashed in that.  Maybe there are other versions of it to try.  mingwm10.dll is just a simple placeholder thing that satisfies some callback requirement for multithreaded apps.Is anyone else running OK on Windows 64-bit? OK, if it really won't get past block 1698 on redownload, then we're in stranger territory.Yes, possibly he has antivirus software or even a router or filewall that is pattern matching a sequence of bytes and censoring it.It would be instructive to get knightmb's blk*.dat and see if that gets him past that point. He was generating invalid blocks at difficulty 1.0.  He must have a corrupted entry in his blk0001.dat or blkindex.dat file.  He just needs to delete blk*.dat and let it redownload.The safety lockdown detected the problem and was displaying "WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!" because it saw a longer chain existed that it was unable to accept.  The safety lockdown cannot stop generation or it would create an attack possibility.Good idea, I made a change to make sure it won't generate before checkpoint block 74000. The order matters not to the program, but it matters to me maintaining it.  If it jumbles the order of the .po file then I can't diff for changes.  I have to update all 7 translation files when I change the English text in the program, and it's easier when they're all in the same order.I can still put it back into normal order by making poedit rescan it.It is normal that untranslated strings are shown on top.I know, but not easily without complicating the sourcecode. Version 0.3.14 is now availablehttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.14/Changes:- Key pool feature for safer wallet backupGavin Andresen:- TEST network mode with switch -testnet- Option to use SSL for JSON-RPC connections on unix/osx- validateaddress RPC commandeurekafag:- Russian translation SVN rev 163 (ver 0.3.13.3) has the key pool feature.  Pre-generated new keys are aged in a queue before use, so that backups of wallet.dat hold keys you'll use in the future.For now I made the default pool size 100.  It can be configured with -keypool=.  Be aware, it takes a little time to increase the pool size, so don't go crazy with it.  Disk space is about 1K per key.I have not addressed the recovery side of this yet.  If you actually did restore an old wallet.dat, I think you may have to delete blk*.dat to rediscover your own transactions during the redownload.I've only tested this moderately.  You might not want to use this for a website server until it's had some more testing. Repeating myself here, but there is open source software for that, so it would just be a matter of bolting on a Bitcoin payment mechanism.  One good one I found was Mihalism Multi Host.  It's designed as a free host, so it would just need a few tweaks to loosen up restrictions consistent with paid use. Maybe you were just unlucky to have an exit node without reverse lookup.The IRC server's response doesn't look like it was disconnecting you for that.  It's supposed to go IRC SENDING: NICK after that, and it doesn't so it gets timed out.I see the problem.  The IRC code is looking for various phrases to see when the server is ready to receive your NICK, but it's not looking for that particular phrase.  I'll fix it.I don't know if it's really required to wait for the server to finish looking up hostname before sending nick.How long did it take to get connected with TOR the first time, having to use the seed nodes? That's going to be more of a SelectCoins thing.SVN rev 161 has a refinement to recursively determine if your own unconfirmed transactions can be spent.  This is needed because you should be able to spend your own change right away.The new recursive determination is: 0/unconfirmed can be spent if it's yours and all its dependencies are either in a block or also yours.Here's a Windows build:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13.2-win32-setup.exeThis version is an improvement if you already had a 0/unconfirmed transaction and might have already spent it.  If you were the original creator of a 0/unconfirmed transaction, you still need theymos' patch instead. poedit reorganised the file for some reason.  I re-ran update from sources and it put it back in the original order so it's fine now.  Did you run it on a drive where files aren't sorted alphabetically, like a FAT drive or USB flash drive?Strings aren't added or changed very often.  It's months before enough changes build up.I uploaded the changes.This Windows build has the Russian translation in it:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13.2-win32-setup.exe It can be phased in, like:if (blocknumber > 115000)    maxblocksize = largerlimitIt can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade. poedit does it.  Either get the src directory from a release, or download it with SVN.  Place your .po file 3 directories deep under the src directory.  Open it with poedit and do Catalog->Update from sources.So for example, you have:srcsrc\base58.hsrc\bignum.h...src\util.cppsrc\util.hsrc\xpmsrc\locale\ru\LC_MESSAGES\bitcoin.poOpen bitcoin.po with poedit, do Catalog->Update from sources.  It looks for the sourcecode up 3 directories (..\..\..) from where bitcoin.po is.This updates your existing .po file you already worked on and adds any news strings.  It may try to match close strings, so check things over and make sure it didn't make any bad guesses.Make sure you use the .po file I uploaded to SVN or in a release, because I always fix up at least a few things.  I'm attaching your Russian one to this message.
Thanks eurekafag, Russian translation added to SVN rev 160. Make sure you keep your node online so it'll keep rebroadcasting transaction b412a0.  It haven't seen it rebroadcast since 29/09/2010 16:41. You're connecting to yourself.  All 21 connection attempts were to a node with version 31300 (0.3.13).  Not everyone has 0.3.13 yet.IRC seems to be working.  It ought to have other nodes to try.There may be something I need to do to make sure it doesn't try to connect to itself again right away after disconnecting.  I can't see how it's happening though, it should be resetting nLastTry which would put it to the back of the queue, but the log doesn't show it.You can try moving addr.dat aside.  Maybe there's something wrong in it.Are you using -addnode? ShadowOfHarbringer, is yours faster with -4way?If it is, then I'm thinking that any AMD that supports 64-bit has 128-bit SSE2.The specialbuild version I posted here looks for model 4 or higher.  If yours is faster with -4way, then I should change it to always use SSE2 with any AMD with 64-bit. This is the point of confusion.  extraNonce is not part of the block header, it is part of the first transaction.  It does not slow down your hashing.  It does not change the size of the header.We need to be vigilant and nip in the bud any misconception that the contents of your block slows down your hash speed.  It doesn't.extraNonce never needs to be very big.  We could reset it every second whenever the time changes if we wanted.  Worst case, if you didn't want to keep track of incrementing it, extraNonce could be 4 random bytes and the chance of wasting time from collision would be negligible.Separate machines are automatically collision proof because they have different generated public keys in the first transaction.  That also goes for each thread too. +1 theymos.  Don't use this patch, it'll make you incompatible with the network, to your own detriment.We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it. Transactions aren't accepted or displayed as 0/unconfirmed until your node has a path of transactions back to the block chain.Any transactions in your wallet also have bundled with them all unrecorded transactions required to reach the block chain.  If you have a transaction that is displayed as 0/unconfirmed, then you have all the previous unrecorded transactions it depends on and you will also rebroadcast those transactions when you rebroadcast yours.If a no-fee block has already been generated and hasn't helped, then I need to look at what's wrong.  It's a part of code that doesn't get much use.  They should be recorded in the wallets of everyone who has a transaction depending on them.Sigh... why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the old copy just in case?  You should never delete a wallet.It may take a while to collect re-broadcast transactions.  It'll help if you can accept inbound connections so you'll be listening to more nodes.  Even if you find a block in 3 hours, keep it running continuously for a few days at least.

It can be safe if you're using it over your own LAN, like if you have multiple servers at a location that talk to each other.0.3.13 RC1 is available for Windows:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13-rc1-win32-setup.exe True, the switch should be something more dynamic that pays per KB.  It's harder to think of how to explain it. It ramps up the fee requirement as the block fills up:<50KB  free50KB   0.01250KB  0.02333KB  0.03375KB  0.04etc.It's a typical pricing mechanism.  After the first 50KB sells out, the price is raised to 0.01.  After 250KB is sold, it goes up to 0.02.  At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the other customers.Just including the minimum 0.01 goes a long way. If you do, I think it should be a very brief, single paragraph article like 100 words or less that simply identifies what Bitcoin is.I wish rather than deleting the article, they put a length restriction.  If something is not famous enough, there could at least be a stub article identifying what it is.  I often come across annoying red links of things that Wiki ought to at least have heard of.The article could be as simple as something like:"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralised /link/electronic currency/link/."The more standard Wiki thing to do is that we should have a paragraph in one of the more general categories that we are an instance of, like Electronic Currency or Electronic Cash.  We can probably establish a paragraph there.  Again, keep it short.  Just identifying what it is. 0.3.13 release candidate, to be released soon so please test:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13-rc1-win32-setup.exe- don't count or spend payments until they have 1 confirmation     http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0- internal version number from 312 to 31300- only accept transactions sent by IP address if -allowreceivebyip is specified- dropped DB_PRIVATE Berkeley DB flag- fix problem sending the last cent with sub-cent fractional change- auto-detect whether to use 128-bit 4-way SSE2 on LinuxGavin Andresen:- option -rpcallowip= to accept json-rpc connections from another machine- clean shutdown on SIGTERM on Linux 0.3.13 release candidate, please test:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13-rc1-win32-setup.exe As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation.  0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens.  At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature.I made changes so they show up in lighter print, with the credit amount in square brackets like [+1.23], and the amount not counted towards your balance and not available for spending.  This doesn't apply to transactions you sent, which you implicitly trust, since you wrote them.I didn't make it (+1.23) because parenthesis in accounting means negative.  I hope square brackets is different enough to be clear what is meant.The JSON-RPC interface can still see 0/unconfirmed if it wants by specifying 0 confirmations.I uploaded the changes to SVN rev 158.  I will post a 0.3.13 RC shortly.If you have any of these transactions in your wallet, do not send any payments until you've upgraded to 0.3.13, which will be coming soon.If you've already sent any of these transactions, or you're the creator of them, then use theymos' patch or make the following change and use it to send your clean transactions to a new wallet to clean things up.change:    if (pcoin->GetDepthInMainChain() < 1 && pcoin->GetDebit() <= 0)        continue;to:    if (pcoin->GetDepthInMainChain() < 1)        continue;
It's not implemented yet, but the network can support a transaction that requires two signatures.  It's described here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=750.0It's absolutely safer than a straight payment without escrow, but not as good as a human arbitrated escrow, assuming you trust the human enough.In this kind of escrow, a cheater can't win, but it's still possible for you to lose.  It at least takes away the profit motive for cheating you.  The seller is assured that the money is reserved for him, while the buyer retains the leverage that the seller hasn't been paid yet until completion. I don't think it should cause any problems for version comparisons.  31300 > 312. I would not encourage using the extra decimal places.  They're only intended for future use.You are correct that above 0.01 can still have additional precision, but the recipient won't be able to see it.  The UI will show it rounded down. Bitcoin would be convenient for people who don't have a credit card or don't want to use the cards they have, either don't want the spouse to see it on the bill or don't trust giving their number to "porn guys", or afraid of recurring billing. I don't understand, are you under the impression that the program sets the system clock?  It doesn't.We use an internal offset based on the median of other nodes' times, but for security reasons we don't let them offset us by more than an hour.  If they indicate we're off by more than an hour, then we resort to alerting the user to fix their clock. In the next release (0.3.13), I'm going to change the format of the internal version number integer from 313 to 31300, for instance 31305 = 0.3.13.5.  The last number represents changes on the SVN between releases and ought to be properly represented in the version number.  Otherwise, it would be a pain if we had a mistake or something in one of the sub versions that needed to be worked around. I implemented this change in SVN rev 157.The reason I previously made it so high was to allow very large transactions without hitting the transaction fee.  The threshold was around 26,000 BTC for transactions made of 50 BTC generated coins.  Even though it was 100 times easier to generate back then, only a few people ever encountered the fee at that level.  The new threshold puts it at around 11,000 BTC for sending generated coins.  It would mostly only be reached with generated bitcoins.  If you bought your bitcoins, they'll be denominated in larger transactions and won't be anywhere near the fee limit, unless you bought them in several hundred separate transactions.  Even if you do reach the fee level, you only have to pay it once to bundle your little transactions together. Theymos already said this...  ECDSA does not support encrypting messages.  Only digital signatures. Probably best to disable receiving by IP unless you specifically intend to use it.  This is a lot of surface area that nobody uses that doesn't need to be open by default.In storefront cases, you would typically only want customers to send payments through your automated system that only hands out bitcoin addresses associated with particular orders and accounts.  Random unidentified payments volunteered to the server's IP address would be unhelpful.In general, sending by IP has limited useful cases.  If connecting directly without a proxy, the man-in-the-middle risk may be tolerable, but no privacy.  If you use a privacy proxy, man-in-the-middle risk is unacceptably high.  If we went to all the work of implementing SSL, only large storefronts usually go to the trouble of getting a CA cert, but most of those cases would still be better off to use bitcoin addresses.I uploaded this change to SVN rev 156.  The switch to enable is "-allowreceivebyip".Senders with this version will get the error "Recipient is not accepting transactions sent by IP address".  Older version senders will get "Transfer was not accepted".I used a different name for the switch because "-allowiptransactions" sounds like it includes sending.  If there's a better name for the switch, we can change it again. I don't know anything about any of the bug trackers.  If we were to have one, we would have to make a thoroughly researched choice.We're managing pretty well just using the forum.  I'm more likely to see bugs posted in the forum, and I think other users are much more likely to help resolve and ask follow up questions here than if they were in a bug tracker.  A key step is other users helping resolve the simple stuff that's not really a bug but some misunderstanding or confusion.I keep a list of all unresolved bugs I've seen on the forum.  In some cases, I'm still thinking about the best design for the fix.  This isn't the kind of software where we can leave so many unresolved bugs that we need a tracker for them. The lines it's tripping on:Code:ERROR extern map<string, string> mapAddressBook;ERROR extern CCriticalSection cs_mapAddressBook;ERROR extern vector<unsigned char> vchDefaultKey;OK extern bool fClient;OK extern int nBestHeight;OK extern unsigned int nWalletDBUpdated;ERROR extern DbEnv dbenv;So it's acting like nothing is defined, not even map and vector.Yet, db.h is included by headers.h (and only there, nowhere else) which includes vector, map, util.h and everything before db.h.Is VC trying to use precompiled headers and screwing it up?  Could there be some leftover precompiled header files in your directory from previously failed attempts that it's finding and using?There's an installer package now that makes it really easy to install MinGW.  Don't use the latest version 4.5.0, use a few versions back like 4.4.1 (1.908.0) or 1.812.0.  A setup program completely installs everything, it's not hard like it used to be.  I think the only thing I had to do was rename make*.exe something to make.exe.http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/Off topic, but: It would be nice if someone would hack on getting tcatm's 4-way 128-bit SSE2 code working on Windows.  There's something with MinGW's optimisation, I'm not sure but maybe a problem with 16-byte alignment on the stack, that makes it segfault.  With some fiddling, I was able to get his code to work in a test program, but not in Bitcoin itself for some reason. Bouncing between 0 and 2 connections could be if it's connecting to itself.  Are you using the "-connect" switch?Did you compile it or is this a release build, and what version? I'm not sure how the 200Kb/sec, since it waits at least a half second between connection attempts.  How fast is it flickering between 0 and 2 connections?  Faster than twice a second?The wait function on linux is:inline void Sleep(int64 n){    boost::thread::sleep(boost::get_system_time() + boost::posix_time::milliseconds(n));}If that doesn't work right, then it would be possible for it to spin through the loop as fast as it can. If the only library is closed source, then there's a project to make an open source one.If the only library is GPL, then there's a project to make a non-GPL one.If the best library is MIT, Boost, new-BSD or public domain, then we can stop re-writing it.I don't question that GPL is a good license for operating systems, especially since non-GPL code is allowed to interface with the OS.  For smaller projects, I think the fear of a closed-source takeover is overdone. Trying it without the DB_PRIVATE flag in rev 153.  We need to keep an eye on what's different.On Windows at least, it creates six __db.001 - __db.006 files with sizes from 24K to 4MB.  It doesn't delete them on exit, it just leaves them behind.The docs say it uses memory mapped files.  I assume they have the same file permissions as the database files, so the same user access restrictions apply.Tests on Windows private LAN download of 78500 blocks:with DB_PRIVATE     20 minutes 51 secondswithout DB_PRIVATE   20 minutes 51 secondsI wasn't expecting them to come out exactly the same. Is there a way to open BerkeleyDB exclusive?DB_PRIVATE is the worst of both worlds.  DB_PRIVATE is not exclusive, but it does make it get screwed up if another process tries to access it at the same time.I've dropped the DB_PRIVATE flag in rev 153. Added in SVN rev 152 The fix is in SVN rev 151.You will be able to send your stuck 0.01 (actually 0.01000010) when you next upgrade. I think I know what happened.  Doubleclick on the generated transaction.  It probably has a sub-0.01 transaction fee in it.Someone has been paying a 0.00000010 transaction fee.  I don't think you can even set that with -paytxfee, I think you'd have to modify the code to do it.  Your generated block is worth 50.00000010, so when you try to send the whole thing you have 0.00000010 left over for the change, which triggers the dust spam 0.01 fee.It would normally be harmless except in this corner case.  I should add a special case to CreateTransaction to handle this. What version is the one where this happened?  Release build, or built it yourself?  Which operating system?  Were you sending by IP or by Bitcoin Address?When you sent 49.99, did it prompt you to pay a 0.01 fee?There was a change in GetMinFee, but I can't see how it would cause this.  It only starts to apply when a block gets huge. The reason for the difference in block number is the number displayed was reduced by 1 in 0.3.11 because it made more sense that way. SVN rev 150 has some code to try to auto-detect whether to use 4-way SSE2.  We need this because it's only faster on certain newer CPUs that have 128-bit SSE2 and not ones with 64-bit SSE2.It uses the CPUID instruction to get the CPU brand, family, model number and stepping.  That's the easy part.  Knowing what to do with the model number is the hard part.  I was not able to find any table of family, model and stepping numbers for CPUs.  I had to go by various random reports I saw.Here's what I ended up with:Code:  // We need Intel Nehalem or AMD K10 or better for 128bit SSE2  // Nehalem = i3/i5/i7 and some Xeon  // K10 = Opterons with 4 or more cores, Phenom, Phenom II, Athlon II  //  Intel Core i5  family 6, model 26 or 30  //  Intel Core i7  family 6, model 26 or 30  //  Intel Core i3  family 6, model 37  //  AMD Phenom    family 16, model 10  bool fUseSSE2 = ((fIntel && nFamily * 10000 + nModel >=  60026) ||                   (fAMD   && nFamily * 10000 + nModel >= 160010));I saw some sporadic inconsistent model numbers for AMD CPUs, so I'm not sure if this will catch all capable AMDs.If it's wrong, you can still override it with -4way or -4way=0.It prints what it finds in debug.log.  Search on CPUID.This is only enabled if built with GCC.
Did you try -4way?AMD Phenom (I think 4-core) CPUs are doing about 11,000khps with -4way, about 100% speedup.  24 cores should get 66,000khps.  AMD is the best choice because it has the best SSE2 implementation. (or maybe because tcatm had an AMD and optimised his code for that)There's been so much else to do that I haven't had time to make -4way automatic.  For now you still have to do it manually.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=820.0 Bitcoin clients currently only create and recognize transactions that match two possible templates.  Those are some quick tests that loosely check if transactions fit some general metrics that those standard transactions fit.  Nodes will only work on adding those transactions to their block.In the future, if we add more templates to the existing 2 types of transactions, we can change the "rather not work on nonstandard transactions" test to accept them. Currently, paying a fee is controlled manually with the -paytxfee switch.  It would be very easy to make the software automatically check the size of recent blocks to see if it should pay a fee.  We're so far from reaching the threshold, we don't need that yet.  It's a good idea to see how things go with controlling it manually first anyway.It's not a big deal if we reach the threshold.  Free transactions would just take longer to get into a block.I did a rough tally of 4000 blocks from around 74000-78000.  This is excluding the block reward transactions:There were average 2 transactions per block, 17 transactions per hour, 400 transactions per day.Average transaction bytes per block was 428 bytes, or 214 bytes per transaction.The current threshold is 200KB per block, or about 1000 transactions per block.  I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block.  That would still be more than 100 times the average transactions per block.The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide to increase it when the time comes.  It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use.  Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event. Version 0.3.12 is now available.Features:- json-rpc errors return a more standard error object. (thanks to Gavin Andresen)- json-rpc command line returns exit codes.- json-rpc "backupwallet" command.- Recovers and continues if an exception is caused by a message you received.  Other nodes shouldn't be able to cause an exception, and it hasn't happened before, but if a way is found to cause an exception, this would keep it from being used to stop network nodes.If you have json-rpc code that checks the contents of the error string, you need to change it to expect error objects of the form {"code":<number>,"message":<string>}, which is the standard.  See this thread:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=969.0Download:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.12/ Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required.  Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee.The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is.I don't think the threshold should ever be 0.  We should always allow at least some free transactions. Can you build?Try changing line 78 of init.cpp from:#ifdef __WXGTK__to:#ifndef __WXMSW__If that works, I'll change the source.  It should work. rpc backupwallet <destination> is in SVN rev 147. Thanks. This is in SVN rev 147.This is more standard, and although json-rpc 1.0 didn't specify the format of error objects, it did specify that they would be objects not strings or other values, so we needed to change this to be correct.  The code/message members have become standard in later json-rpc specs.If you have code that checks the error and expects a string, you'll need to change it.  When there is an error, the error member is now an object not a string.Also in SVN rev 147:- The command line json-rpc returns the error code as its exit code.  Exit codes can only be 0-255 on unix, so it's abs(code)%256.- The "backupwallet <destination>" command that was discussed in another thread.  It locks the wallet and copies it, so you can be sure you get a correct copy. Any suggestions for better text to put for this error message so the next person will be less likely to be confused?It's trying to tell them their clock is wrong and they need to correct it.It's relying on 3 time sources:1) the system clock2) the other nodes, if within an hour of the system clockif those disagree, then3) the user (asking the user to fix the system clock)I've thought about NTP, but this is more secure. You can probably just comment out the linecryptopp/secblock.h:187  //assert(false);Let me know if it works, and watch if it memory leaks. It looks like a template class to make sure the derived class defines its own version of allocate and deallocate.  It would be weird if that was the actual problem and it made it all the way to release.  Probably a false alarm. The code assumes little-endian throughout and was written with the intention of never being ported to big-endian.  Every integer that is sent over the network would have to be byte swapped, in addition to many dozens of other places in code.  It would not be worth the extra sourcecode bloat.Big-endian is on its way out anyway. What OS?  I ran the Windows and 64-bit Linux version and checked the about dialog.The Mac version is still 0.3.10.1.I updated the first post to be more specific.  Only the -4way code is compiled this way. The simplification is intentional.  There will only be more than one thash[7]=0 in one out of 134,217,728 cases.  It only makes it 0.0000007% slower. Version 0.3.11 is now available.Changes:- Some blk*.dat checking on load- Built the -4way code with -march=amdfam10, which makes it a little faster- Warning if your clock is too far off- Warnings/errors/alerts can also be seen in the getinfo command- Alert systemThe alert system can display notifications on the status bar to alert you if you're running a version that needs to be upgraded for an important security update.In response to an alert, your node may also go into safe mode, which disables the following json-rpc commands (used by automated websites) to protect it from losing money until you get a chance to upgrade: sendtoaddress getbalance getreceivedbyaddress getreceivedbylabel listreceivedbyaddress listreceivedbylabelIf you decide it's a false alarm and want to take your chances, you can use the switch -disablesafemode to re-enable them.This is an important safety improvement.  For a large segment of possible problems, this can warn everyone immediately once a problem is discovered and prevent them from acting on bad information.Nodes keep operating and do not stop generating in response to an alert, so old versions may still try to make a fork, but the alert system can make sure users are warned not to act on anything in the fork.Download:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.11/ As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:- boring grey in colour- not a good conductor of electricity- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either- not useful for any practical or ornamental purposeand one special, magical property:- can be transported over a communications channelIf it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.(I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply) Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock.More like a collectible or commodity. That's kind of interesting as an upside-down bar chart of how many blocks were produced each day.  The target is 144 blocks per day. Sorry, I've been so busy lately I've been skimming messages and I still can't keep up.We want to avoid Windows API calls whenever possible.  They usually take about 6-8 parameters and a lot of testing to get right, it takes a page of code to do something simple.I usually shy away from iostreams.  Seems like I too often hit limitations.  They kind of botched the C++ streams standard in the 90's, which is too bad, streams can be very powerful and useful when done right.  Using it in rpc.cpp may still turn out to be a mistake.Bottom line is I'd rather call an existing file copy function than make and test my own. I doubt there's an mmap(2) on Windows.  I'd rather call an existing file copy function than make and test my own.Thanks.  I thought it would be in there somewhere.We already use boost::filesystem in a dozen places.  It's not a new added dependency.  It gives us a lot of portable stuff that we would otherwise have to have a #ifdef for each OS and test everywhere.
If you read it into memory and write it out, it could fail in tight memory situations. I'm looking for something like copyfile(const char* from, const char* to) or copyfile(path from, path to), preferably something in Boost if it has it.  If you find it for me, it's more likely I'll get to implementing it.We require Boost for JSON and a dozen things replacing dependencies on wxWidgets.  Boost is good, portable stuff, we should not shy away from it. Try -datadir=Last time I tried $(shell /usr/bin/wx-config), there was immediate hollering about build problems with it.  There wasn't time to investigate at the time.One problem with $(shell /usr/bin/wx-config) is it will pick up any version (wx 2.8 ) and any configuration (non-UTF-8 ) of wxWidgets that happens to be there.  -lwx_gtk2ud-2.9 only matches the right configuration.  It fails if wxWidgets was built with the wrong configuration. Did they say why they were baffled? Why is it there?  Was it included by the OS, or did you have to build it?  If you built it, I wonder why it would put itself in a different place.Has wxWidgets 2.9 finally started to become available as a debian package?Maybe we should do this:INCLUDEPATHS= \ -I"/usr/local/include/wx-2.9" \ -I"/usr/local/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" \ -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" \ -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9"Again, those paths help make sure it's only 2.9 and will fail with 2.8.wxWidgets 2.8 comes in ANSI and UTF-16, both wrong for us.  It's tempting because it's so easily available as a package; a lot of people were frustrated by it until we started hardcoding 2.9 into the makefile. I started posting in the other topic but I'll repeat here, this thread seems more specific to the topic.The main backup improvement will be a pre-generated pool of keys and a rescan at load to scrape missed transactions from the block history.  Then a backup will last forward for a long time.I was starting to post the same idea you said nelisky.How about a json-rpc command that locks the wallet, flushes it, copies wallet.dat to a location you specified, then unlocks it?  That would be a smaller project than the pooled keys, so maybe it could be done first.What's the simplest portable way to copy a file?  Is there something in Boost?What should it be named?  maybe:backupwallet <destination> Any backup process/procedure would just be a stopgap until there's time to properly work on coding solutions in software.  We can try to use words to help the situation until code gets there.The main backup improvement will be pre-made pool of keys, and a rescan at load to scrape missed transactions from the block history.  Then a backup will last forward for a long time. Can you provide more details about what removing DB_PRIVATE does?I can't remember if I had a specific reason for DB_PRIVATE, or if I just copied the flags from some example code.  Does removing DB_PRIVATE make it safe for other processes to open the database simultaneously?  That may be an improvement, depending what the side effects are.  Does it substantially reduce performance by making it have to write out every change immediately or do other coordination?  Are there additional locking or coordination files then?  What else changes?  You could test by timing an initial block download with and without DB_PRIVATE, preferably -connect-ing to a local machine so network isn't a factor.Apparently, DB_PRIVATE doesn't do what you would hope it would do, which is prevent other processes from being able to open the database.  It still lets them, it just screws up if they do.  Another option, if there's a way, would be to make it lock the database files so they can't be accessed by other processes. My apologies, your post was indeed a question not a statement. getinfo has a new field that shows any alert messages or other errors that would be displayed on the status bar.The rpc methods return a json-rpc error with the error description "Safe mode: " followed by additional text specified by the alert.I added the switch "-testsafemode" for you.  SVN rev 145.This stuff is very new and may still be subject to change.Many switches are intentionally undocumented, like if their functionality is still under construction or I haven't settled on their name yet, or just test code not intended for release.-4way should eventually be replaced by an auto-detect. WRT the alert system, who cares?  The most the key can do is temporarily disable six json-rpc commands until the site owners either add the -disablesafemode switch or upgrade.  All nodes keep running and generating, the network stays up.  If I'm not available, any script kiddie can figure out how to add two characters and make a new version that disables the alert system.  It would be a temporary inconvenience only.This is what makes me think the people objecting don't know what they're talking about.  It can't "shut down the complete network".  I changed the switch name to -disablesafemode. It can't do arbitrary actions remotely.  Maybe some of you are responding to other posters who suggested the alert system should do more?If there is an alert, the following json-rpc methods return an error:sendtoaddressgetbalancegetreceivedbyaddressgetreceivedbylabellistreceivedbyaddresslistreceivedbylabelThe remaining 14 methods function as normal. I believe the safer option should be enabled by default.  If you want your server to keep trading and ignore an alert saying the money its receiving might be like the money from the overflow bug, then you can use the switch and not blame anyone else if you lose your money.Worst case if you leave alerts enabled, your site stops trading until you upgrade or add the -disablesafemode switch.Getting surprised by some temporary down time when your node would otherwise be at risk is better than getting surprised by a thief draining all your inventory.Someday when we haven't found any new bugs for a long time and it has been thoroughly security reviewed without finding anything, this can be scaled back.  I'm not arguing that this is the permanent way of things forever.  It's still beta software. This is in SVN rev 142 as version 0.3.11. If you're so paranoid that you're getting hysterical over this, then surely you're paranoid enough that if a warning message displays on the status bar, you'll check the website and forum.I think if another bug like the overflow bug occurs, it's important that automated websites stop trading until their admins can check out what's going on and decide what to do.  If you decide it's a false alarm and want to take your chances, you can use the "-disablesafemode" switch. This probably explains why hyperthreading increases performance with -4way.  If three SSE2 units is excessive, then hyperthreading would help keep them all busy. Hey Zooko!I wanted to thank you for posting about Bitcoin on your blog a year or two ago, back when I announced it on the Cryptography mailing list. I've been working on writing the alert system.  Alerts are broadcast through the network and apply to a range of version numbers.  Alert messages are signed with a private key that only I have.Nodes can do two things in response to an alert:- Put a warning message on the status bar.- Make the money handling methods of the json-rpc interface return an error.In cases like the overflow bug or a fork where users may not be able to trust received payments, the alert should keep old versions mostly safe until they upgrade.  Manual users should notice the status bar warning when looking for received payments, and the json-rpc safe mode stops automated websites from making any more trades until they're upgraded.The json-rpc methods that return errors during an alert are:sendtoaddressgetbalancegetreceivedbyaddressgetreceivedbylabellistreceivedbyaddresslistreceivedbylabel Thanks for clearing that up.  I read the link someone posted about AMD making that change around 2007, but I didn't know what the story was for Intel.There's no hope for Core/Core2 then.  They only have half the SSE2 hardware.Strange that Intel has 3 128bit units, but AMD with 2 128bit units is the faster one. Search debug.log for "proof-of-work found".  If you find any, then check for any errors right after that.The margin is 2 hours.This should be solved in SVN rev 141 and the next release (0.3.11+).  It'll pop up a message box alerting you if your clock is off by more than an hour. The clock part will be covered in the next release (0.3.11 or higher).  SVN rev 141 pops up a message box if your clock is too far off. That's right.  You don't need to be re-broadcasting your transactions for it to work.When any node disconnects a fork, it dumps all the transactions from the fork back into the transaction pool to add to the new chain.  The entire network is making sure to re-integrate your transactions again.  All you should see is that your number of confirmations starts over from 0.In some types of forks, your transaction would have gotten into both forks already, so you're already good either way. I'm not sure what to call it, but we could use a post that lists these things users should know.  If someone has time to write it, here's the list:- Make sure your clock is set correctly. - Microsoft Security Essentials.  This never got written up proper.- Warning not to mess around with your wallet.dat file.  It's a database file, it's not as simple as you think.  In this Beta version, we haven't had time to try and tinker-proof it yet.  It may not work as expected if you start swapping it around.
Make sure your computer's date and time are correct. That's the first I've heard anyone say i5 was slower.  Everyone else has said 4way was faster on i5.  Moreso with hyperthreading enabled.Good, so I take it that's a confirmation that it's working on Mac as well?Laszlo told me he did compile in the -4way stuff on Mac, so the -4way switch is also available to try on Mac.  I don't think makefile.osx on SVN has it yet, just the built version. That's a really well written walkthough.  Someone should confirm if they followed it and didn't run into any snags. wxWidgets 2.9 is their first UTF-8 version.  We are UTF-8 on all platforms including Windows.The distro packages of 2.8 are UTF-16, so they just trip people up.  People had endless build problems with 2.8 and its wxString UTF-16/ANSI conditional build options until we standardized on 2.9.  Also, to use 2.8, we were using ANSI, which was just a temporary stopgap until wxWidgets supported UTF-8.This is a problem that will solve itself.  With time, 2.9 will become a more mainline release. In the next SVN rev, I'll make it only go back to the last checkpoint at block 74000.  If we need to correct a problem in the future, we can always make sure it goes back at least as far back as the problem.  Also, I'm adding code to verify the block index, which means the proof-of-work chain is checked.Still, the system won't be entirely secure against your blk*.dat files.  You are trusting someone if you use a copy of their blk files. The performance numbers posted from a VIA C7's hardware SHA-256 weren't astronomical.  Only in the 1500 khash/s range.  If you think about it, just because it's implemented in hardware doesn't mean it's crazy fast.  It still has to do all the steps.  It's only if simplifying it down to single-purpose hardware makes it small enough to fit many in parallel.  That's not necessarily easy or a given. Definitely.  The old screenshots of 0.1 are very outdated.Windows Aero is a good choice.  Windows is still the largest user group.  Mind what's behind it for the transparent parts.What to have displayed in the transaction list?  Not completely filled up with stuff, just a few things. Total proof-of-work. Un-upgraded nodes have the correct chain most of the time, but they are still trying to include the overflow transaction in every block, so they're continually trying to fork and generate invalid blocks.  If an old version node is restarted, its transaction pool is emptied, so it may generate valid blocks for a while until the transaction gets broadcast again.  0.3.9 and lower nodes still must upgrade.The SVN now has the code we needed to automatically reorg the block chain without having to delete the blk*.dat files manually.  I knew I couldn't write that code fast and carefully enough yesterday, so I went with the quick manual option. There is no way for the software to automatically know if one chain is better than another except by the greatest proof-of-work.  In the design it was necessary for it to switch to a longer chain no matter how far back it has to go.The only exception to that is the manual checkpoints I've added.  If it weren't for those, it would be able to reorg all the way back to the first block. SVN rev 139 does a basic check of the block chain after loading.With this we wouldn't have needed to delete blk*.dat, it would have automatically done a reorg back to the fork.  There wasn't time to do a careful implementation of this at the time.It might take longer than we want, since it has to load all the blocks.  If it's too slow, we could have it only go back to a certain block number. This is what I ended up doing in SVN rev 139.Instead of deleting the bad chain, I added an extra CheckBlock to ConnectBlock so bad blocks can't get back into the best chain once they're kicked out. Done in SVN rev 137 I'd like to reduce the number of blocks displayed in the status bar by 1.   When you first load the program, it'll display 0 blocks instead of 1:"0 connections    0 blocks     0 transactions"It's always been "nBestHeight + 1" because it's counting the genesis block.  Technically, yes, the genesis block is a block.  It's a hardcoded block that you start out with.  You can't not have the genesis block.  Maybe think of it as a reference coin that you measure other coins against.  The block count people are looking for is the number of blocks they've downloaded.The main benefit is that blocks will be equal to the block number of the current best block.  If blocks is 10, then the highest block number you have is 10.  It means you have block 10 and you don't have block 11.It would reduce the confusion we had here: That's a difficult approach.We need to cause a reorg, which will disconnect the invalid chain.This is code that will rarely ever get tested, and is fairly intricate, so something simple and safe is best.Here's what I was thinking of.  (I haven't tested this yet)  It checks all the blocks in the main chain.  If it finds a bad one, it sets all that chain's bnChainWork to 0 so it can't win best chain again, and it reduces best chain work to the fork level so any new block after the fork will cause a reorg.  (It can't change pindexBest without actually doing a reorg)This isn't perfect yet.  It still needs to receive one valid block to trigger the reorg.  It would probably be possible to initiate an AddToBlockIndex or Reorganize after the check, but it would require a lot more careful attention.  I probably should break out part of AddToBlockIndex that sets the new best block.  I'll probably end up doing that instead of the code below.Code:bool CTxDB::LoadBlockIndex(){    ...    // Verify blocks in the main chain    vector<CBlockIndex*> vChain;    for (CBlockIndex* pindex = pindexBest; pindex && pindex->pprev; pindex = pindex->pprev)    {        vChain.push_back(pindex);        CBlock block;        if (!block.ReadFromDisk(pindex))            return error("LoadBlockIndex() : block.ReadFromDisk failed");        if (!block.CheckBlock())        {            bnBestChainWork = pindex->pprev->bnChainWork;            foreach(CBlockIndex* pindex2, vChain)                pindex2->bnChainWork = 0;        }    }    return true;} I wrapped sha256.cpp in #ifdef FOURWAYSSE2#endif // FOURWAYSSE2try it now. It looks like we overtook the bad chain somewhere around 74689.  0.3.9 and lower nodes have been responding with the current block number for some hours now.That means it's no longer necessary to delete blk*.dat before upgrading.  You can just upgrade and it'll reorg away the bad block chain.Thanks to everyone for the quick response! cpu family 6 model 26 stepping 4 is an Intel Core i7.That's a 23% speedup with -4way, 63% total speedup with -4way + hyperthreading.33% faster with hyperthreading than without it. That works.That's strange...  are we sure that's the same thing?  tcatm, try amdfam10 and make sure you get the same speed measurement. GCC 4.3.3 doesn't support -march=amdfamk10.  I get:sha256.cpp:1: error: bad value (amdfamk10) for -march= switchHey, you may be onto something!hyperthreading didn't help before because all the work was in the arithmetic and logic units, which the hyperthreads share.tcatm's SSE2 code must be a mix of normal x86 instructions and SSE2 instructions, so while one is doing x86 code, the other can do SSE2.How much of an improvement do you get with hyperthreading?Some numbers?  What CPU is that?
On Windows, findstr /c:"version message" debug.logIt looks like the bad chain was on block 74678 recently.  Can't wait to overtake it.On the stats at http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php  there's been 5 blocks per hour in the last 3 hours.  We had a difficulty adjustment about a day ago that should have put it back to 6 blocks per hour. The bad chain is also slowed down as more nodes upgrade.We've already generated 14 blocks since 74638.  The builds of 0.3.10 were uploaded about 2 and 3 hours ago.  Of the nodes I'm connected to, more than half are already 0.3.10.  I would say we probably already have more power than the bad chain. 1) Once more than 50% of the node power is upgraded and the good chain overtakes the bad, the 0.3.10 nodes will make it hard for any bad transactions to get any confirmations. 2) If you didn't remove your blk*.dat files, you're not helping to contribute to that 50%, and you'll still show bad transactions until the good chain overtakes the bad chain. If you still show 74638 blocks then you aren't connected to any 0.3.10 nodes.  For today, try adding these parameters:  -addnode=75.158.131.108 -addnode=99.27.237.13 -addnode=68.68.99.14Seehttp://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=828 Right, it will get reincorporated into the fixed chain.  The transaction won't disappear, it'll still be visible on both sides, but the confirmation count will jump back to 0 and start counting up again.It's only if you generated a block in the bad chain after block 74638 that the 50 BTC from that will disappear.  Any blocks in the bad chain wouldn't have matured yet.  For now, can some people running 0.3.10 with static IP who can receive incoming connections post their IP?  Then we can -addnode= them and make sure to connect to at least one 0.3.10 node. I suspect there's some difficulty receiving blocks if all the nodes you're connected to are 0.3.9 or lower.  We need enough of us so that at least one node you connect to will be 0.3.10.  The problem will start to go away when we make up more than 1/8th of the network.It'll help if you port forward so you can get lots of connections.

Here's the preliminary change.  Look right?  I have more changes to make, this isn't all of it.  Will SVN shortly.Code:    bool CheckTransaction() const    {        // Basic checks that don't depend on any context        if (vin.empty() || vout.empty())            return error("CTransaction::CheckTransaction() : vin or vout empty");        // Check for negative and overflow values        int64 nTotal = 0;        foreach(const CTxOut& txout, vout)        {            if (txout.nValue < 0)                return error("CTransaction::CheckTransaction() : txout.nValue negative");            if (txout.nValue > 21000000 * COIN)                return error("CTransaction::CheckTransaction() : txout.nValue too high");            nTotal += txout.nValue;            if (nTotal > 21000000 * COIN)                return error("CTransaction::CheckTransaction() : txout total too high");        }        if (IsCoinBase())        {            if (vin[0].scriptSig.size() < 2 || vin[0].scriptSig.size() > 100)                return error("CTransaction::CheckTransaction() : coinbase script size");        }        else        {            foreach(const CTxIn& txin, vin)                if (txin.prevout.IsNull())                    return error("CTransaction::CheckTransaction() : prevout is null");        }        return true;    }Don't sticky the topic, nobody looks up there.  There'll be enough posts to bump. I just uploaded a quick build so testers can check if I built it right.  (I don't have an i5 or AMD)  If it checks out, I'll put together the full package and do all the release stuff. I hope someone can test an i5 or AMD to check that I built it right.  I don't have either to test with.I'm also curious if it performs much worse on 32-bit linux vs 64-bit. The idea was the main part.  When you posted your patch, I realized it should have been done that way instead of "-?".  I always had reservations about "-?" because it intrudes on the possible parameter values, and the help response is based on the version of the caller instead of the server. Some places where generation will gravitate to:1) places where it's cheapest or free2) people who want to help for idealogical reasons3) people who want to get some coins without the inconvenience of doing a transaction to buy themThere are legitimate places where it's free.  Generation is basically free anywhere that has electric heat, since your computer's heat is offsetting your baseboard electric heating.  Many small flats have electric heat out of convenience.How expensive is heating oil?  With the price of oil so high, if it's actually more expensive than electric, then generating would have negative cost.There's also kids putting it on their parent's power bill, employees their employer, botnets, etc.Case 3 comes into play for small amounts.  The overhead of doing an exchange doesn't make sense if you just need a small bit of pocket change for incidental micropayments.  I think this is a nice advantage vs fiat currency, instead of all the seigniorage going to one big entity, let it go in convenience amounts to people who need to scrape up a small amount of change.
0.3.10 has tcatm's 4-way SSE2 as an option switch.Use the switch "-4way" to turn it on.  Without the switch you get Crypto++ ASM SHA-256.I could only get this working with Linux.Download:Get 0.3.10 from http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=827.0Please report back your CPU and results!  I think it's pretty clear that Core 2 and lower are slower, i5 faster.  I don't think we've heard any i7 results yet.  We need to know about the different models of AMD or other less common CPUs. On both MinGW GCC 4.4.1 and 4.5.0 I have it working with test.cpp but SIGSEGV when called by BitcoinMiner.  So now it doesn't look like it's the version of GCC, it's something else, maybe just the luck of how the stack is aligned.I have it working fine on GCC 4.3.3 on Ubuntu 32-bit.I found the problem with Crypto++ on MinGW 4.5.0.  Here's the patch for that:Code:--- \old\sha.cpp Mon Jul 26 13:31:11 2010+++ \new\sha.cpp Sat Aug 14 20:21:08 2010@@ -336,7 +336,7 @@  ROUND(14, 0, eax, ecx, edi, edx)  ROUND(15, 0, ecx, eax, edx, edi) - ASL(1)+    ASL(label1)   // Bitcoin: fix for MinGW GCC 4.5  AS2(add WORD_REG(si), 4*16)  ROUND(0, 1, eax, ecx, edi, edx)  ROUND(1, 1, ecx, eax, edx, edi)@@ -355,7 +355,7 @@  ROUND(14, 1, eax, ecx, edi, edx)  ROUND(15, 1, ecx, eax, edx, edi)  AS2( cmp  WORD_REG(si), K_END)- ASJ( jne, 1, b)+    ASJ(    jne,    label1,  )   // Bitcoin: fix for MinGW GCC 4.5   AS2( mov  WORD_REG(dx), DATA_SAVE)  AS2( add  WORD_REG(dx), 64) MinGW GCC 4.5.0:Crypto++ doesn't work, X86_SHA256_HashBlocks() never returnsI only got 4-way working with test.cpp but not when called by BitcoinMinerMinGW GCC 4.4.1:Crypto++ works4-way SIGSEGVGCC is definitely not aligning __m128i.

I'm not grasping your idea yet.  Does it hide any information from the public network?  What is the advantage?If at least 50% of nodes validated transactions enough that old transactions can be discarded, then everyone saw everything and could keep a record of it.Can public nodes see the values of transactions?  Can they see which previous transaction the value came from?  If they can, then they know everything.  If they can't, then they couldn't verify that the value came from a valid source, so you couldn't take their generated chain as verification of it.Does it hide the bitcoin addresses?  Is that it?  OK, maybe now I see, if that's it.Crypto may offer a way to do "key blinding".  I did some research and it was obscure, but there may be something there.  "group signatures" may be related.There's something here in the general area:http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/rh/What we need is a way to generate additional blinded variations of a public key.  The blinded variations would have the same properties as the root public key, such that the private key could generate a signature for any one of them.  Others could not tell if a blinded key is related to the root key, or other blinded keys from the same root key.  These are the properties of blinding.  Blinding, in a nutshell, is x = (x * large_random_int) mod m.When paying to a bitcoin address, you would generate a new blinded key for each use.Then you need to be able to sign a signature such that you can't tell that two signatures came from the same private key.  I'm not sure if always signing a different blinded public key would already give you this property.  If not, I think that's where group signatures comes in.  With group signatures, it is possible for something to be signed but not know who signed it.As an example, say some unpopular military attack has to be ordered, but nobody wants to go down in history as the one who ordered it.  If 10 leaders have private keys, one of them could sign the order and you wouldn't know who did it.

No, that's not what it is.-paytxfee allows you to include a transaction fee with your transactions.  If transaction confirmations become slow, you can get priority by using "-paytxfee=0.01".  Any transactions you send would cost an extra 0.01.  There's no reason to use more than 0.01.It's just there in case we need it.  It probably won't be needed, and it can be explained more if we do. That big of a difference in speed, by a factor of 4 or 6, feels like it's likely to be some quirky weak spot or instruction that the old chip is slow with.  Unless it's a touted feature of the i5 that they made SSE2 six times faster.A quick summary:Xeon Quad        41% slowerCore 2 Duo        55% slowerCore 2 Duo        same (vess)Core 2 Quad      50% slowerCore i5            200% faster (nelisky)Core i5            100% faster (vess)AMD Opteron    105% fasteraceat64:My system went from ~7100 to ~4200.This particular system has dual Intel Xeon Quad-Core CPUs (E5335) @ 2.00GHz.impossible7:on an Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 running x86_64 linux it was 55% slower compared to the stock version (r121)nelisky:My Core2Quad (Q6600) slowed down 50%, my i5 improved ~200%, impossible7:on an AMD Opteron 2374 HE running x86_64 linux I got a 105% improvement (!) Fixed in SVN rev 130. True, there would probably be someone with a dial-up modem or satellite dish internet.  Rarer would be someone who has both that and the wired internet that has the outage, but if it's a big enough segment to matter, out of a million people there's bound to be a multi-home geek.ISP network cuts are just your local area.  If you still have communication with the rest of your area, it would probably be something like 1/1000 of the world or less.  Block generation in the segment would take several hours per block.I favour the plan to monitor if the frequency of blocks received drops too slow.  That covers a large range of possibilities. Misc bugfixes in rev 130:fix -datadir with relative pathautostart is now off by default except on windowsfix occasional "vector iterator not dereferencable" assertion when compiled with msvcfix readlink compile warning on linux builduse sys/param.h and BSD define instead of __BSD__-paytxfee switch, e.g. -paytxfee=0.01 This is in SVN rev 130.  Check that it compiles right.Code:#if (defined(__unix__) || defined(unix)) && !defined(USG)#include <sys/param.h>  // to get BSD define#endif#ifdef __WXMAC_OSX__#ifndef BSD#define BSD 1#endif#endif Are you back to talking about the existing Bitcoin system here?I was talking about in the hypothetical system I was describing, if the network doesn't know the values and lineage of the transactions, then it can't verify them and vouch for them, so the clients would have to keep the history all the way back.If a client wasn't present until recently, the two ways to convince it that a transaction has a valid past is:1) Show it the entire history back to the original generated coin.2) Show it a history back to a thoroughly deep block, then trust that if so many nodes all said the history up to then was correct then it must be true.But if the network didn't know all the values and lineage of the transactions, it couldn't do 2), I don't think. That code was a bad idea anyway, I'm deleting it.  Any Mac code should only use __WXMAC_OSX__, not __WXMAC__ or __WXOSX__, and we should stop using __BSD__.Will that definitely cause BSD to be defined on Mac? It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.But for now, while it's still small, it's nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster.  When I eventually implement client-only mode, that won't matter much anymore.There's more work to do on transaction fees.  In the event of a flood, you would still be able to jump the queue and get your transactions into the next block by paying a 0.01 transaction fee.  However, I haven't had time yet to add that option to the UI.Scale or not, the test network will react in the same ways, but with much less wasted bandwidth and annoyance. It doesn't have to be such a breaking change.  New nodes could accept old transactions for a long time until most nodes have already upgraded before starting to refuse transactions without PoW.  Or, they could always accept old transactions, but only a limited number per time period.I've thought about PoW on transactions many times, but usually I end up thinking a 0.01 transaction fee is essentially similar and better.  0.01 is basically a proof of work, but not wasted.  But if the problem is validating loads of transactions, then PoW could be checked faster.A more general umbrella partial solution would be to implement the idea where an unlikely dropoff in blocks received is detected.  Then an attacker would still need a substantial portion of the network's power to benefit from a DoS attack.+1Any demonstration tests at this point would only show what we already know, and divert dev time from strengthening the system to operational fire fighting.
You can get away with backing up without stopping the client if you don't do anything or receive a payment within a few seconds before the backup.  (like 5 seconds) No, it doesn't usually empty your wallet with each transaction.  It uses the smallest set of coins it can find to add up to near the amount.  In this case, unfortunately, his wallet had a single 9000 BTC bill in it, and it had to break it to get 1 BTC and 8999 BTC change. Still thinking this idea through...The only job the network needs to do is to tell whether a spend of an outpoint is the first or not.If we're willing to have clients keep the history for their own money, then some of the information may not need to be stored by the network, such as:- the value- the association of inpoints and outpoints in one transactionThe network would track a bunch of independent outpoints.  It doesn't know what transactions or amounts they belong to.  A client can find out if an outpoint has been spent, and it can submit a satisfying inpoint to mark it spent.  The network keeps the outpoint and the first valid inpoint that proves it spent.  The inpoint signs a hash of its associated next outpoint and a salt, so it can privately be shown that the signature signs a particular next outpoint if you know the salt, but publicly the network doesn't know what the next outpoint is.I believe the clients would have to keep the entire history back to the original generated coins.  Someone sending a payment would have to send data to the recipient, as well as still communicating with the network to mark outpoints spent and check that the spend is the first spend.  Maybe the data transfer could be done as an e-mail attachment.The fact that clients have to keep the entire history reduces the privacy benefit.  Someone handling a lot of money still gets to see a lot of transaction history.  The way it retrospectively fans out, they might end up seeing a majority of the history.  Denominations could be made granular to limit fan-out, but a business handling a lot of money might still end up seeing a lot of the history. Updated SVN.  Thanks.There's little hope of not repeatedly stumbling over that in the future.  It doesn't break the compile for me. That makes it sound like it might somehow get lost and the parties can't get it even if they want to cooperate.When you pay for something up front, you can't get it back either.  Consumers seem comfortable with that.  It's no worse than that.Either party always has the option to release it to the other.Then you must also be against the common system of payment up front, where the customer loses.Payment up front: customer loses, and the thief gets the money.Simple escrow: customer loses, but the thief doesn't get the money either.Are you guys saying payment up front is better, because at least the thief gets the money, so at least someone gets it?Imagine someone stole something from you.  You can't get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it?  Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it'll be useless to them, although you still lose it too?  If they give it back, you can re-activate it.Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen.  If the thief gives it back, it turns to gold again.It still seems to me the problem may be one of presenting it the right way.  For one thing, not being so blunt about "money burning" for the purposes of game theory discussion.  The money is never truly burned.  You have the option to release it at any time forever. This is a very interesting topic.  If a solution was found, a much better, easier, more convenient implementation of Bitcoin would be possible.Originally, a coin can be just a chain of signatures.  With a timestamp service, the old ones could be dropped eventually before there's too much backtrace fan-out, or coins could be kept individually or in denominations.  It's the need to check for the absence of double-spends that requires global knowledge of all transactions.The challenge is, how do you prove that no other spends exist?  It seems a node must know about all transactions to be able to verify that.  If it only knows the hash of the in/outpoints, it can't check the signatures to see if an outpoint has been spent before.  Do you have any ideas on this?It's hard to think of how to apply zero-knowledge-proofs in this case.We're trying to prove the absence of something, which seems to require knowing about all and checking that the something isn't included. SVN rev 128: disable SSE2 on 32-bit.  This may only disable it for MSVC and GCC.  Other compilers might have different 64-bit defines. The heat from your computer is not wasted if you need to heat your home.  If you're using electric heat where you live, then your computer's heat isn't a waste.  It's equal cost if you generate the heat with your computer.If you have other cheaper heating than electric, then the waste is only the difference in cost.If it's summer and you're using A/C, then it's twice.Bitcoin generation should end up where it's cheapest.  Maybe that will be in cold climates where there's electric heat, where it would be essentially free.

When we switched to Crypto++ 5.6.0 SHA-256 in version 0.3.6, generation got broken on the Linux 64-bit build.  Version 0.3.8.1 is on SourceForge with the 64-bit binary updated.Download:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.8/bitcoin-0.3.8.1-linux.tar.gz/downloadFuture versions after 0.3.8 will probably require SSE2.  Anyone have Pentium 3 or older where this would be a problem? I found that SSE2 only added a slight 2% speedup, which didn't seem worth the incompatibility.  I was trying to take the safer option.It doesn't look to me like Crypto++ could be deciding whether to use SSE2 at runtime.  There's one place where it detects SSE2 for deciding some block count parameter, but the SSE2 stuff is all #ifdef at compile time and I can't see how that would switch at runtime.  Maybe I'm not looking in the right place.Should we enable SSE2 in all the makefiles?  It seems like we must in case someone compiles with 64-bit.I will recompile the 64-bit part of the Linux 0.3.8 release. Sorry about that.  CRITICAL_BLOCK isn't perfect.  You have to be careful not to break or continue out of it.  There's an assert that catches and warns about break.  I can be criticized for using it, but the syntax would be so much more bloated and error prone without it.Is there a chance the SSE2 code is slow on Intel because of some quirk that could be worked around?  For instance, if something works but is slow if it's not aligned, or thrashing the cache, or one type of instruction that's really slow?  I'm not sure how available it is, but I think Intel used to have a profiler for profiling on a per instruction level.  I guess if tcatm doesn't have a system with the slow processor to test with, there's not much hope.  But it would be really nice if this was working on most CPUs. Here's an outline of the kind of escrow transaction that's possible in software.  This is not implemented and I probably won't have time to implement it soon, but just to let you know what's possible.The basic escrow: The buyer commits a payment to escrow. The seller receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can't spend it until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back to the buyer.While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the profit out of cheating.If the seller doesn't send the goods, he doesn't get paid. The buyer would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation to stiff him.The buyer can't benefit by failing to pay. He can't get the escrow money back. He can't fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can't be sent to anyone else.Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start negotiating, such as "release the money and I'll give you half of it back", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and send you half if he's already breaking his word to steal it? I think for modest amounts, almost everyone would refuse on principle alone. Really?  Do you think people won't be able to understand the benefit?  (If your response is an argument that there's no benefit at all, I guess that will reinforce the case that people won't be able to understand it.) It's the same situation as gold and gold mining.  The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold.  Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange.I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.  The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used.  Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.Each node's influence on the network is proportional to its CPU power.  The only way to show the network how much CPU power you have is to actually use it.If there's something else each person has a finite amount of that we could count for one-person-one-vote, I can't think of it.  IP addresses... much easier to get lots of them than CPUs.I suppose it might be possible to measure CPU power at certain times.  For instance, if the CPU power challenge was only run for an average of 1 minute every 10 minutes.  You could still prove your total power at given times without running it all the time.  I'm not sure how that could be implemented though.  There's no way for a node that wasn't present at the time to know that a past chain was actually generated in a duty cycle with 9 minute breaks, not back to back.Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen.  We don't have to worry about a chain of custody of communication.  It doesn't matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself. Once you get away from a system where each node's influence is proportional to their CPU power, then what else do you use to determine who is (approximately) one person? A transaction can be written that requires two signatures to spend it next.  You write a payment that requires the signature of both the recipient and the sender to spend it.  To release the escrow, you give the recipient the signature for your half, or the payee can return it by giving you his signed half.  There's no mediator in this simple case.  The recourse is to refuse to ever release it, essentially burning the money. If you're only going to have one person work on building the block, that could take days.  Oh, do you mean send a different variation to each node with the tx fee written to them?The way it is now, it's whoever builds this gets it.If we needed to, we could have a BitTorrent-esque tit-for-tat for transaction broadcast.  Relay paying transactions to me, or I won't relay them to you.  It probably won't be an actual problem though.  It only takes one node relaying like it should to cancel out 7 others greedily not relaying.
I can't think of a way to implement that.  All the transaction fees would be additional transactions.  What about the transaction fees for the transaction fee's transaction? It's not implemented.It turned out nobody liked that mode of transfer anyway, so it hasn't had much development attention. Silently failing would look bad.Definitely needed.  What rate are you thinking of?  Ultimately, it's better to rate limit it than to let it all drain out.That might work surprisingly well.  If it works, it keeps them from hitting the rate limit, but the rate limit is there as the last line of defence. Definitely time to lower it.  I don't know a way to implement that.  The transaction fee to the block creator uses a special trick to include the transaction fee without any additional size.  If there was a transaction for each transaction fee, then what about the transactions fees for the transaction fee's transaction? One alternative is to use a round-up system.  You pay for, say, 1000 pages or images or downloads or searches or whatever at a time.  When you've used up your 1000 pages, you pay for another 1000 pages.  If you only use 1 page, then you have 999 left that you may never use, but it's not a big deal because the cost per 1000 is still small.Or you could pay per day.  The first time you access the site on a given day, you pay for 24 hours of access.Per 1000 or per day may be easier for consumers to get their heads around too.  They worry about per item because it's harder to figure if it might add up too fast.  Unlimited for 24 hours they know what the cost will be.  Or if 1000 seems like plenty, they're not worrying that it's costing more with each click if they figure 1000 is more than they'll probably use. Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.  If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.  Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.  I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.I am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack.  I think most P2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways.  (On a side note, I read that the record companies would like to DoS all the file sharing networks, but they don't want to break the anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)If we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions back and forth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum transaction fee.  0.1.5 actually had an option to set that, but I took it out to reduce confusion.  Free transactions are nice and we can keep it that way if people don't abuse them.That brings up the question: if there was a minimum 0.01 fee for each transaction, should we automatically add the fee if it's just the minimum 0.01?  It would be awfully annoying to ask each time.  If you have 50.00 and send 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and you'd have 39.99 left.  I think it should just add it automatically.  It's trivial compared to the fees many other types of services add automatically.No, not at all. Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods.  Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range.  But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.  The software is designed to support things like this.  I was going to post details of the plans for Escrow, but since getting slashdotted I haven't had time. I guess SourceForge hasn't updated its mirrors yet.  The files are there on the admin side, but not on the user side.  I have no idea how long that will take.  It's always been immediate in the past.Edit: SourceForge is updated now. I'd rather you didn't make a build of the 1000 node connecting version available.  It won't take very many people running that before we have to make another release just to limit the incoming connections. Version 0.3.8 adds an important security improvement.  Everyone should upgrade to get this change.The new safety feature displays a warning message in the status bar and locks down RPC if it detects a problem that may require an upgrade.If it sees a longer chain, but it can't process it, then it knows something is wrong.  It displays "WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!  You may need to upgrade." and makes most RPC commands return an error.  It still keeps generating as normal, which is necessary for the stability of the network.There were important security updates in the versions before this too, so if you haven't upgraded recently, it's extremely important that you upgrade now!Also, don't forget, we recently added 2.4x faster generating thanks to tcatm's mid-state caching optimisation and BlackEye's help getting ASM SHA-256 working.Download:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.8/ creighto: I agree with that idea.  After a few hours, it should be possible for the client to notice if the flow of blocks has dropped off by more than would be likely just by chance.  It could tell if it's not hearing the hum of the world anymore.In practice, splits are likely to be very asymmetrical.  It would be hard to split the world down the middle.  More likely it would be a single country vs the rest of the world, lets say a 1:10 split.  In that case, it would take the minority fork 10 times as long to generate 100 blocks, so about 7 days.  Also it would be super easy for the client to realize it's hearing way too few blocks and something must be wrong.There's no time limit.  Assuming you weren't spending coins generated in the minority fork, or spending someone's double-spends you received, your transactions can get into the other chain at any time later. I guess we should try to support the case where there's no Content-Length parameter.  I don't want to rip and replace streams though, even if it has to read one character at a time.Edit: That is, assuming there actually are any libraries that don't support Content-Length. I urge you not to use BDB 4.8.  The database/log0000* files will be incompatible if anyone uses your build and then goes back to the official build. Yes, 0.3.7 has it.  It was in rev 112. The reason I didn't use protocol buffers or boost serialization is because they looked too complex to make absolutely airtight and secure.  Their code is too large to read and be sure that there's no way to form an input that would do something unexpected.I hate reinventing the wheel and only resorted to writing my own serialization routines reluctantly.  The serialization format we have is as dead simple and flat as possible.  There is no extra freedom in the way the input stream is formed.  At each point, the next field in the data structure is expected.  The only choices given are those that the receiver is expecting.  There is versioning so upgrades are possible.CAddress is about the only object with significant reserved space in it.  (about 7 bytes for flags and 12 bytes for possible future IPv6 expansion)The larger things we have like blocks and transactions can't be optimized much more for size.  The bulk of their data is hashes and keys and signatures, which are uncompressible.  The serialization overhead is very small, usually 1 byte for size fields.On Gavin's idea about an existing P2P broadcast infrastructure, I doubt one exists.  There are few P2P systems that only need broadcast.  There are some libraries like Chord that try to provide a distributed hash table infrastructure, but that's a huge difficult problem that we don't need or want.  Those libraries are also much harder to install than ourselves. Is it 2x fast on AMD and 1/2 fast on Intel?Tried that, but it doesn't work for things on the stack.  I ran some tests.It doesn't even cause an error, it just doesn't align it. "Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar" & "Minimize to the tray on close" must not be implemented yet on the Mac.  We should grey them out in the next version. Did it print anything to the console?  Are you sure you didn't run "bitcoind"?Try version 0.3.7. It can be built with Boost 1.37 or later.
It would be neat if someone had a page (like that handy calculator at http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php) that projects what the next difficulty adjustment will be.projected difficulty adjustment multiplier =  blocks_since_last_adjustment / 2016 ------------------------------------ time_since_last_adjustment / 14_daysFor instance, if it already got half way to the next adjustment in only 3.5 days instead of 7, we would expect difficulty to double: (1008/2016) / (3.5/14) = 0.5/0.25 = 2.0Also, it could show the predicted time when the next adjustment will occur, and tell when the last adjustment was and how much it changed. That's amazing... So are you saying you use 128-bit registers to SIMD four 32-bit data at once?  I've wondered about that for a long time, but I didn't think it would be possible due to addition carrying into the neighbour's value. Except that wouldn't work for boost 1.40+ (on Ubuntu 10.04), where you need to get libboost-all-dev.Seems they changed everything around in Boost recently, "-mt" and all that, makes it hard.BTW, I tried Boost 1.34 but it didn't have the boost.interprocess stuff.Mac OSX version is available now.  See bitcoin.org or the SourceForge link. I can't understand why you're having so much pain.  I just followed the instructions in build-unix.txt.  I made a couple little corrections for Boost 1.37, which I'll put on SVN the next time I update it, noted below:Dependencies------------sudo apt-get install build-essentialsudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-devsudo apt-get install libssl-devsudo apt-get install libdb4.7-devsudo apt-get install libdb4.7++-devsudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev (or libboost1.37-dev)wxWidgets---------cd /usr/localtar -xzvf wxWidgets-2.9.0.tar.gzcd /usr/local/wxWidgets-2.9.0mkdir buildgtkcd buildgtk../configure --with-gtk --enable-debug --disable-shared --enable-monolithicmakesudo sumake installldconfigadded a comment in makefile.unix:# for boost 1.37, add -mt to the boost librariesLIBS= \ -Wl,-Bstatic \   -l boost_system \   -l boost_filesystem \   -l boost_program_options \   -l boost_thread \   -l db_cxx \   -l crypto \ -Wl,-Bdynamic \   -l gthread-2.0 What are you needing to use listtransactions for?The reason I didn't implement listtransactions is I want to make sure web programmers don't use it.  It would be very easy to latch onto that for watching for received payments.  There is no reliable way to do it that way and make sure nothing can slip through the cracks.  Until we have solid example code using getreceivedbyaddress and getreceivedbylabel to point to and say "use this! use this! don't use listtransactions!", I don't think we should implement listtransactions.When we do implement listtransactions, maybe one way to fight that is to make it all text.  It should not break down the fields into e.g. comment, confirmations, credit, debit.  It could be one pretty formatted string like "0/unconfirmed   0:0:0 date   comment      debit 4  credit 0" or something so it's hard for programmers to do the wrong thing and process it.  It's only for viewing the status of your server.  I guess that would be kinda annoying for web interfaces that would rather format it into html columns though. I don't get how it let you send if it was not matured.  Your balance would have been lower than the amount.  It would have said balance 0.01, right?  If I try that it says "you don't have enough money" or "Insufficient funds" from the command line.How many blocks did it say it had left to mature when you sent?There's a chance it might still go through.Have you copied or moved your wallet.dat in any way? We don't really need pre-compiled header.  It only makes it compile slightly faster.  I think I'll just get rid of it.  Even still, you'd still need to remember to "make -f makefile.unix clean" or delete headers.h.gch one more time to get rid of the leftover file.Damn that GLIBC_2.11.  I thought I'd been careful not to accept any of the updates. Yeah, acutely aware that I should have stayed on 9.04 or 9.10.  It's a lot more work to downgrade than upgrade and I've been squeezed for time.  Ubuntu is the most popular distro, so I'm staying with that. If the transaction didn't go out immediately at first, like if you weren't connected at the time, it may take up to 2 hours to resend it.  Long term, it does keep relentlessly sending it.I'll shorten that length of time in a future version.You do need to have downloaded the complete block chain (currently 71040 blocks) before you'll see any confirms.  Same with the recipient. Actually, it works well to just PM me.  I'm the one who's going to be fixing it.  If you find a security flaw, I would definitely like to hear from you privately to fix it before it goes public. "./bitcoin: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.11' not found (required by ./bitcoin)" isn't a new problem that started with 0.3.6 is it?  This was built on the same OS installations as 0.3.0.Unfortunately I upgraded to Ubuntu 10.04 before 0.3.0.  I will not upgrade anymore.  I don't know when I might have time to reinstall to downgrade, but at least by not upgrading, it'll gradually fix itself. 0.3.6 Linux build is back to the old makefile.unix.  It static links libjpeg so that shouldn't be a problem.Is that working better?If you got 22DbRunRecoveryException and you've used someone else's build before, you may need to delete (or move the files somewhere else) database/log.000000*Windows and Linux users: if you got 0.3.5 you still need to upgrade to 0.3.6. SVN is updated with version 0.3.6.Uploading Windows build of 0.3.6 to Sourceforge now, then will rebuild linux. Haven't had time to update the SVN yet.  Wait for 0.3.6, I'm building it now.  You can shut down your node in the meantime.   Please upgrade to 0.3.6 ASAP!  We fixed an implementation bug where it was possible that bogus transactions could be displayed as accepted.  Do not accept Bitcoin transactions as payment until you upgrade to version 0.3.6!If you can't upgrade to 0.3.6 right away, it's best to shut down your Bitcoin node until you do.Also in 0.3.6, faster hashing:- midstate cache optimisation thanks to tcatm- Crypto++ ASM SHA-256 thanks to BlackEyeTotal generating speedup 2.4x faster.Download:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.6/Windows and Linux users: if you got 0.3.5 you still need to upgrade to 0.3.6. WTF?  How did we get on that?  AFAIK, the only e-mail is if you tell the forum to do notifications, and I guess the wiki registration.  I'd consider turning off the forum notification e-mails, I don't know why we have that.  The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819 You were looking at the wrong code.  Here's the code that applies:Code:bool CBlock::CheckBlock() const{...    // Check timestamp    if (nTime > GetAdjustedTime() + 2 * 60 * 60)        return error("CheckBlock() : block timestamp too far in the future");...bool CBlock::AcceptBlock(){   ...    // Check timestamp against prev    if (nTime <= pindexPrev->GetMedianTimePast())        return error("AcceptBlock() : block's timestamp is too early");The timestamp is limited to up to 2 hours in the future.  It can be earlier than the previous block, but it must be greater than the median of the last 11 blocks.  The reason for doing it that way is so the time can get corrected in the next block if the previous block had the time too far in the future, like what happened. Was that the only thing I broke in the OSX build?!  Does it actually work after just that one change?I had to do that for makefile.vc also.  It compiled, but SHA-256 didn't work correctly; it returned the same incorrect hash each time.We'll disable it now, and if anyone figures out how to fix it, we can re-enable it then.  It's still 1.7x faster from the midstate optimisation.The Crypto++ ASM SHA-256 works with GCC on Linux and Windows (MinGW).I uploaded this makefile.osx change to SVN.  (let me know if that compiles now) It was able to reproduce this.  The database doesn't like the relative path."bitcoind -datadir=./subdir getinfo" works against a running daemon, but trying to start the daemon as "bitcoind -datadir=./subdir" gets that exception.I guess we should resolve the full path before passing it to the database.It looks like you were the first one to ever use -datadir with a relative path.
OK, thanks.  I'd also like to know if it runs fine as long as you don't turn on Generate.  You'd think as long as it doesn't actually execute any SSE2 instructions, it would still load.  At least Pentium 3's could run it without generating. I added a subset of the Crypto++ 5.6.0 library to the SVN.  I stripped it down to just SHA and 11 general dependency files.  There shouldn't be any other crypto in there other than SHA.I aligned the data fields and it worked.  The ASM SHA-256 is about 48% faster.  The combined speedup is about 2.5x faster than version 0.3.3.I guess it's using SSE2.  It automatically sets its build configuration at compile time based on the compiler environment.It looks like it has some SSE2 detection at runtime, but it's hard to tell if it actually uses it to fall back if it's not available.  I want the release builds to have SSE2.  SSE2 has been around since the first Pentium 4.  A Pentium 3 or older would be so slow, you'd be wasting your electricity trying to generate on it anyway.This is SVN rev 114.

I can compile the Crypto++ 5.6.0 ASM SHA code with MinGW but as soon as it runs it crashes.  It says its for MASM (Microsoft's assembler) and the sample command line they give looks like Visual C++.  Does it only work with the MSVC and Intel compilers? Is that still starting from Crypto++?  Lets get this into the main sourcecode. I replaced the last of the few wxBase dependencies in bitcoind.bitcoind now compiles without wxWidgets or wxBase in SVN rev 112.main(int argc, char* argv[]) is added to init.cpp.  CMyApp and the Startup folder stuff are moved to ui.cpp.  ui.cpp and uibase.cpp aren't linked by bitcoind.The makefiles have -DGUI to control whether the GUI is used.I test compiled MinGW, VC and Ubuntu.  I don't know if I broke the Mac OSX build, someone will need to check that. Sorry, actually it's ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) not RSA.  I shouldn't have said "prime numbers".  ECDSA doesn't take much time to generate a keypair. For future reference, here's my public key.  It's the same one that's been there since the bitcoin.org site first went up in 2008.  Grab it now in case you need it later.http://www.bitcoin.org/Satoshi_Nakamoto.asc SVN rev 111 That's strange, didn't someone just say that was supposed to work?  (what library was he using?)  Post if you figure out what wrong.I hope it's not going to put up this much of a fight for all PHP users.Looks like we've got the Fortran scenario already.  +1 to you for having such a long password that you found this bug.Uploaded to SVN as rev 110. 2^80 is if you can use a birthday attack.  You can't use a birthday attack for this, so the difficulty is the full 2^160 bits.  Although, if you were trying to crack any one of 1 million (2^20) transactions, you could do a partial birthday attack 2^160/2^20 = 2^140.Bitcoin Addresses are the only place where 160-bit hash is used.  Everything else is SHA-256.  They're calculated as:bitcoinaddress = RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(publickey))Correct me if I'm wrong (please, and I'll gladly eat crow) but I think it would be hard to use an analytical attack on RIPEMD-160 in this case.  An analytical attack prescribes a certain range or pattern of inputs to try that will greatly increase your chance of finding a collision.  Here, you don't have that kind of control over RIPEMD-160's input, because the input is the output of SHA-256.  If an analytical attack helps you find an input to RIPEMD-160 that produces a collision, what are you going to do with it?  You still have to get SHA-256 to output that value, so you would still have to break SHA-256 too.For brute force, RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x)) is no stronger than RIPEMD-160 alone.  But for analytical attack, it seems like you must analytical attack both RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256.  If I'm wrong, then the strength is the same as RIPEMD-160 and the SHA-256 only serves as one round of key strengthening. You would still have to sign it with public key 654321.  You need to find a collision using a public key for which you know the private key.When you claim a Bitcoin Address transaction, you give your public key that matches the hash, then you must sign it with that key.Red's point is that it's easy to quickly generate insecure public keys which you could break and find the private key after you find a collision.He points out that if the public key was required to be a secure one, one which must have required significant work to find the prime numbers, that would increase the strength above that of the hash function alone.  Someone trying to brute force would have to take time generating a key for each attempt. Red, thanks for telling me privately first!  Please go ahead and post it (and relieve the suspense for everyone!)His point is that transactions paid to a Bitcoin Address are only as secure as the hash function.  To make Bitcoin Addresses short, they are a hash of the public key, not the public key itself.  An attacker would only have to break the hash function, not ECDSA. It's best if you tell it to me privately so it can be fixed first.I just e-mailed you my e-mail address.  (or you could PM me here) Please upgrade to 0.3.3!  Important security improvements were made in 0.3.2 and 0.3.3.New features:- Gavin Andresen's HTTP authentication to secure JSON-RPC- 5x faster initial block download, under 30 minutes Please do these tests on the test network.  That's what it's for.  Thanks. Was that on the test network?http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=363.0 FLATDATA was a workaround to serialize a fixed field length array.  There was a cleaner way to make it understand how to serialize arrays directly, but MSVC6 couldn't do it and I wanted to keep compatibility with MSVC6 at that time.  We don't support MSVC6 anymore because we use something in Boost that doesn't.  We lost support for it after 0.2.0.  Maybe someday I'll swap in the clean way that just knows how to serialize fixed length arrays without wrapping them in FLATDATA. Please test 0.3.2.5 in preparation for the 0.3.3 release!  This build is looking good and should be the one that goes into 0.3.3.  I encourage you to go ahead and upgrade now if you're on Windows or Linux.New features:- Gavin Andresen's HTTP authentication to secure JSON-RPC- 5x faster initial block download, under 30 minutesDownload here:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-win32.ziphttp://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-linux.tar.gzThanks!
The JSON-RPC HTTP authentication feature in 0.3.3 solves this problem. Can anyone confirm if JSON-RPC over HTTP is supposed to use status 500 if the reply is an error reply?  I can't remember where I picked that up, maybe it's wrong.  It seems like 200 would make more sense unless there's something wrong with the mechanics of the HTTP request itself.  (and maybe that's what it said and I forgot and spread 500 to all error responses) Obviously it's a bug that it repeats the header.I was trying to follow the 1.0 spec: http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification   It called for multiple invocation.I think they mean it's like this, but I'm not sure:Post:{"method": "postMessage", "params": ["Hello all!"], "id": 99}{"method": "postMessage", "params": ["I have a question:"], "id": 101}Reply:{"result": 1, "error": null, "id": 99}{"result": 1, "error": null, "id": 101}I can't remember where I think I saw that it's supposed to send back HTTP status 500 for an error reply.  If it contains multiple responses and one is an error, I wonder if that makes the status 500 for the whole thing, I guess so.  Maybe it should always return 200.  I think someone sounded like the 500 might be causing a problem.This probably gets fixed after 0.3.3.  Until then, just use single invocation.  I wonder if any JSON-RPC package even supports multiple invocation, probably not.It would be nice if we could pin down better how multiple-invocation is supposed to work, if at all, before trying to fix it, and whether returning HTTP status 500 for error response is right. I don't think authentication should be disabled by default if there's no conf file or the config file doesn't contain "rpcpassword", but what if it contains "rpcpassword="?I can see both points.What if the programmer can't figure out how to do HTTP authentication in their language (Fortran or whatever) or it's not even supported by their JSON-RPC library?  Should they be able to explicitly disable the password requirement?OTOH, what if there's a template conf file, withrpcpassword=  # fill in a password hereThere are many systems that don't allow you to log in without a password.  This forum, for instance.  Gavin's point seems stronger.BTW, I haven't tested it, but I hope having rpcpassword=  in the conf file is valid.  It's only if you use -server or -daemon or bitcoind that it should fail with a warning.  If it doesn't need the password, it should be fine.  Is that right? Not really.  I'll change it to 1000 next time. By making some adjustments to the database settings, I was able to make the initial block download about 5 times faster.  It downloads in about 30 minutes.The database default had it writing each block to disk synchronously, which is not necessary.  I changed the settings to let it cache the changes in memory and write them out in a batch.  Blocks are still written transactionally, so either the complete change occurs or none of it does, in either case the data is left in a valid state.I only enabled this change during the initial block download.  When you come within 2000 blocks of the latest block, these changes turn off and it slows down to the old way.I built a test build if you'd like to start using it:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-win32.ziphttp://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-linux.tar.gzThese binaries also include Gavin Andresen's JSON-RPC HTTP authentication feature and the other important security improvements from 0.3.2.I've been running a test over the last 24 hours that kills and restarts it randomly every 2-60 seconds (poor thing) while it's trying to do an initial block download and it's been fine.There are no changes to the way it handles wallet.dat.  This change is only for blk*.dat and the non-critical addr.dat.  You can always delete blk*.dat if it gets screwed up and let it re-download. If I recall correctly, 500 is the prescribed status code for JSON-RPC error responses.  There is still a JSON response in the body of the reply telling the explanation of the error, which could be something like {"result":"","error":"bitcoin address not found","id":"1"}. Gavin's changes look good.  I think everything is complete.  Here's a test build, please test it!http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-win32.ziphttp://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-linux.tar.gz Yes, I think that would be really good so each dev doesn't have to figure it out themselves.  We need a simple example for each of Python, PHP and Java importing the json-rpc library and using it to do a getinfo or something, including doing the http authentication part. In many of the contexts of this RPC stuff, you can print to the console with fprintf(stdout, like this:#if defined(__WXMSW__) && wxUSE_GUI        MyMessageBox("Warning: rpc password is blank, use -rpcpw=<password>\n", "Bitcoin", wxOK | wxICON_EXCLAMATION);#else        fprintf(stdout, "Warning: rpc password is blank, use -rpcpw=<password>\n");#endif boost::program_options has the same "key=value" format.  Gavin pointed out we can use it in a simple way as a parser without getting into all the esoteric c++ syntax like typed value extraction.  We can use more features if we want later.Lets go ahead with HTTP basic authentication instead of password as a parameter. Thanks for that survey!I find "key value" a little unnatural.  There ought to be a more definite separator between key and value that suggests assignment.  The space people may just be getting lazy using their language's split function.key=some full sentence with spaces in it.  # seems more clearkey some full sentence with spaces in it.  # than thisAllright then, lets go with self-parsed mapConfig, syntax:# commentkey=valuefile extension .conf.  What's the filename, is it ~/.bitcoin/settings.conf or ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf or what?   I think we better strip whitespace at the beginning and end of the key and the value.# user who likes column formatted k            = valuekey         = valuelongerkey =   this sentence would be this    # "this sentence would be this"        key = value   # guess this is ok too  nextkey = value      right = justifiedThe normal syntax should be "key=value", but you can't blame people for the occasional "key = value". I was researching config file formats, here's a comparison.YAML is massive.  I'm not sure there's a lightweight easy to build library we can integrate into our project.  Seems overkill.JSON is tempting and I'm inclined to like it, but two main sticking points:1) No comments!  How can you have a config file where you can't comment out a line to disable it?2) Not very user friendly to have to "quote" all the strings, including the keys, and also have to remember the comma at the end of lines.{    "key" : "value",}I suppose we could easily preprocess JSON reading the config file one line at a time, truncate the lines at any # character (and/or "//"?), concatenate them into a string and pass it to JSON, so you could go:# comment"key" : "value",   # still have to remember the comma "key2" : "value",   // comment like this or bothBoost has boost::program_options.We could read lines ourselves and feed them into a map<string, string> mapConfig.while (!eof)  read line  if '#' found, truncate line  split line at first ':' -> key, value  mapConfig.insert(key, value)If we use the syntax:# commentkey : value...and don't allow whitespace indenting before the keys, I guess we would be a subset of YAML and could switch to YAML someday if we need more complexity. If we go with self parsed, that doesn't mean we can't use JSON on particular parameter values as needed.  If an option needs a list or more structured data, it could always parse its value as json:key : ["item1", "item2", "item3"]Although it has to be all on one line then.I guess I'm leaning towards self parsed mapConfig:# commentkey : value Still need to know what's the most typical settings file format on Linux.  Is there a standard file extension?  I've never seen a settings file using JSON, and it doesn't look very human friendly with everything required to be in quotes.  I think what I usually see is like:# commentsetting=valueIs there a settings file thing in Boost?When you're using bitcoind to issue commands from the command line as a client, can we have it get the password from the settings file then too?Gavin pointed out I forgot to increment the column of numbers in CommandLineRPC, so the current -rpcpw= implementation doesn't work right from the command line with non-string parameters.  (JSON-RPC is fine)  Still under construction. Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Dai's b-money proposal http://weidai.com/bmoney.txt on Cypherpunks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunks in 1998 and Nick Szabo's Bitgold proposal http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.htmlThe timing is strange, just as we are getting a rapid increase in 3rd party coverage after getting slashdotted.  I hope there's not a big hurry to wrap the discussion and decide.  How long does Wikipedia typically leave a question like that open for comment?It would help to condense the article and make it less promotional sounding as soon as possible.  Just letting people know what it is, where it fits into the electronic money space, not trying to convince them that it's good.  They probably want something that just generally identifies what it is, not tries to explain all about how it works.If you post in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bitcoin please don't say "yeah, but bitcoin is really important and special so the rules shouldn't apply" or argue that the rule is dumb or unfair.  That only makes it worse.  Try to address how the rule is satisfied.Search "bitcoin" on google and see if you can find more big references in addition to the infoworld and slashdot ones.  There may be very recent stuff being written by reporters who heard about it from the slashdot article.I hope it doesn't get deleted.  If it does, it'll be hard to overcome the presumption.  Institutional momentum is to stick with the last decision.  (edit: or at least I assume so, that's how the world usually works, but maybe Wiki is different) So you drop a settings file in the ~/.bitcoin directory, that sounds better.  In the "no password is set" warning, it could tell you where the file is and what to do.What is the most popular and common settings file format?HTTP basic authentication should be considered.  In actual practice though, it's more work for web developers to figure out how to specify the password through some extra parameter in the HTTP or JSON-RPC wrapper than to just stick an extra parameter at the beginning of the parameter list.  What do you think?  Does HTTP basic authentication get us any additional benefits?  Moving it off the parameter list but then you still have to specific it in a more esoteric place I'm not sure is a net win. You're also confusing me, what do you mean?  Did I do something unintended? Don't use the -server or -daemon switch or run bitcoind on a machine where you use a web browser.  It opens port 8332 on 127.0.0.1, the local loopback address, and you wouldn't think that web browsers could cross-site access it, but it is possible.We're working on a release soon that puts a password on the JSON-RPC interface, but until then, avoid using the -server switch, and don't web browse on the same machine where bitcoind is running.Update:The JSON-RPC HTTP authentication feature in 0.3.3 solves this problem. Right, that is quite a bit better.  Can you give me any examples of other stuff that does it that way?  (and what the command line looks like)The main change you're talking about here is instead of -rpcpw= when you start bitcoind, you'd use a switch that specifies a text file to go and read it from, right?  (any ideas what I should name the switch?) Nice graph!  A moving average to smooth it out would be nice.http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php says 212 blocks in the last 24 hours, or 8.8 per hour. Typically, over 25,000 BTC.
OpenSSL doesn't have any interface for doing just the low level raw block hash part of SHA256.  SHA256 begins by wrapping your data in a specially formatted buffer.  Setting up the buffer takes an order of magnitude longer than the actual hashing if you're only hashing one or two blocks like we do.  It's intended that the time is amortised if you were hashing many KB or MB of data.  In BitcoinMiner, we format the buffer once and keep reusing it.If you can find SHA256 code that's faster (with MinGW/GCC) than what we've got, that would be really great!  (although, keep licensing in mind)  The one we have is the only one I tried, so there's significant chance for improvement. When I wrote it more than 2 years ago, there were screaming hot SHA1 implementations but minimal attention to SHA256.  That's a lot of time for them to come up with better stuff.  SHA256 was a lot slower than the fastest SHA1 at the time than I thought it should be.  Obviously SHA256 should be slower than SHA1 by a certain amount, but not by as much as I saw.(hope you don't mind I renamed your thread, SHA-256 optimisation is something important that I keep forgetting about) I uploaded to SVN my changes to add a password to JSON-RPC.  If you're set up to build, please test it.The -server switch is replaced with -rpcpw=<password>, which is also used with bitcoind.bitcoin -rpcpw=<password>    -- runs with JSON-RPC port openbitcoind -rpcpw=<password>   -- daemon with passwordIf you have a better idea for the switch name, let me know, but keep in mind there will eventually be a password for encrypting the database too.  I'm not sure but I think they may want to use different passwords for the two.It gives a warning if you don't set a password.All commands now require the password as the first parameter.  It'll tell you that if you run "bitcoind help".The central code:  // Check password  if (params.size() < 1 || params[0].type() != str_type)      throw runtime_error("First parameter must be the password.");  if (params[0].get_str() != strRPCPassword)  {      if (strRPCPassword.size() < 15)          Sleep(50);      begin = strRequest.end();      printf("ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt\n");      throw runtime_error("Incorrect password.");  }Any comments on these decisions?1) if (strRPCPassword.size() < 15) Sleep(50);  -- this means if it's a short password, it'll wait 50ms after each attempt.  This might be used as a DoS attack, but I figured if it's a short password, it's more important to protect against brute force password scan.  This may tell outsiders whether the password is less than 15 characters, but less than 15 isn't all that noteworthy, most passwords are less than 15.  If you want to close the DoS possibility, just use a password 15 characters or longer.2) begin = strRequest.end();  -- if it's a single request with multiple invocations, I throw away the rest if one has a bad password.  This is so you can't stuff it with millions of password attempts in one packet.  What do you think, is this the right thing to do?  (multiple invocation is probably almost never used anyway)I also fixed the two duplicated commands listed in the help:getaddressesbylabel <pw> <label>getbalance <pw>getblockcount <pw>getblocknumber <pw>getconnectioncount <pw>getdifficulty <pw>getgenerate <pw>getinfo <pw>getlabel <pw> <bitcoinaddress>getnewaddress <pw> [label]getreceivedbyaddress <pw> <bitcoinaddress> [minconf=1]getreceivedbylabel <pw> <label> [minconf=1]help <pw>listreceivedbyaddress <pw> [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]listreceivedbylabel <pw> [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]sendtoaddress <pw> <bitcoinaddress> <amount> [comment] [comment-to]setgenerate <pw> <generate> [genproclimit]setlabel <pw> <bitcoinaddress> <label>stop <pw> The change list is basically encompassed by what's listed in the first message.  Everyone should upgrade to get the important security improvements.Minimizing to tray had at least 3 different glitches and bugs on Linux, including a crash one, so I disabled it again.  You can still re-enable the option with "-minimizetotray" if you want to use it anyway.  The bugs/glitches are somewhere in wxWidgets or GTK or Gnome and I don't know how to fix them.  Sorry, I just don't know what else to do, it's just too glitchy and buggy to have as a mainline feature. That's what I thought too.Now I'm hearing a report that it IS possible for javascript to do a cross-domain POST request to 127.0.0.1.  Not other domains, but just specifically to that one.  Great...If this is the case, then do not use the -server switch or bitcoind on a system where you do web browsing.I'll get started on adding the password field. They're only intended for intrepid programmers who read the sourcecode. I didn't say impermeable, I said good-enough.  The loss in practice would be far lower than with credit cards.No, the vending machine talks to a big service provider (aka payment processor) that provides this service to many merchants.  Think something like a credit card processor with a new job.  They would have many well connected network nodes. In 0.3.0, the change to 8 only ended up in the Windows version, the other versions still had 15.Please upgrade to 0.3.2, it's available now. I didn't realize you were going to document all the intentionally undocumented commands.  They're unsupported and not intended to be used by users.All the user-facing commands are listed in the -? help. I went about 200 blocks back.  The block chain was a clean straight line without branches, and there was only one known version of the locked block.Sorry, not yet, but I do want to make the initial block download faster. Right, they'll re-appear when it's finished downloading all the blocks.  I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they're trying to generate.  When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it's a race to propagate to the most nodes first.  If one has a slight head start, it'll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.A rough back-of-the-envelope example:1         04         116        464        1680%      20%So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage.The payment processor has connections with many nodes.  When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends.  If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.  A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it.  The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes. Download links available now on bitcoin.org.  Everyone should upgrade to this version.- Added a simple security safeguard that locks-in the block chain up to this point.- Reduced addr messages to save bandwidth now that there are plenty of nodes to connect to.- Spanish translation by milkiway.- French translation by aidos.The security safeguard makes it so even if someone does have more than 50% of the network's CPU power, they can't try to go back and redo the block chain before yesterday.  (if you have this update)I'll probably put a checkpoint in each version from now on.  Once the software has settled what the widely accepted block chain is, there's no point in leaving open the unwanted non-zero possibility of revision months later. 0.3.2 has some security safeguards to lock in the block chain up to this point and limit the damage a little if someone gets 50%.But if someone has 50%+ of the CPU power and malicious intent, they can prove what it already says in the design document. We should queue up a supply of pre-made addresses in the wallet to use when a new address is needed.  They aren't very big, so it wouldn't hurt to have a lot of them.  This would more generally cover the case also where someone backs up, then requests a new address and receives a big payment with it.  Maybe there should be separate queues so one type of demand on addresses doesn't deplete it for the others.The addresses would be created and stored in the normal place, but also listed on a separate list of created-but-never-used addresses.  When an address is requested, the address at the front of the never-used queue is handed out, and a new address is created and added to the back.There's some kind of rescan in the block loading code that was made to repair the case where someone copied their wallet.dat.  I would need to check that the rescan handles the case of rediscovering received payments in blocks that were already received, but are forgotten because the wallet was restored. It must be a rounding error when getinfo converts to floating point to return the JSON-RPC result.  The only place where it uses floating point to represent money is returning a value in JSON-RPC.1.139999999999 is longer than bitcoin can internally represent.internally, it could only be:1.13999999 or1.140000001.139999999999 is much much closer to 1.14000000 than 1.13999999, so it must be 1.14000000.The code is this:(double)GetBalance() / (double)COIN.(I can't think of an easy way to fix it at the moment) 0.3.1 fixes that, sets the generate threads to the lowest priority.  Download links are on the homepage now. I uploaded windows 0.3.1 rc1 and linux 0.3.1 rc2 to SourceForge and updated the links on the homepage.You don't need to update to 0.3.1 unless you had one of the problems listed in the first post.  If you've got it working already, stay with 0.3.0. We need someone to write sample code, preferably Python or Java, showing the recommended way to use the JSON-RPC interface to create an account system.  Most sites that sell things will need something like this.  Someone who's kept up on the JSON-RPC threads here should have some idea how it should work.When a user is logged in to their account, you show the bitcoin address they can send to to add funds.  Before showing it, you check if it's been used, if it has then you replace it with a new one (getnewaddress <username>).  You only need to keep the latest bitcoin address for the account in your database.  (I posted a sample code fragment for this in an earlier thread somewhere, search on getnewaddress)You use getreceivedbylabel <username> with the username as the label to get the "credit" amount of the account.  You need to keep a "debit" amount in your database.  The current balance of the account is (credit - debit).  When the user spends money, you increase debit.If you're requiring more than 0 confirmations, it's nice if you show the current balance (0 confirmations) and the available balance (1 or more confirmations), so they can immediately see that their payment is acknowledged.  Not all sites need to wait for confirmations, so the dual current & available should be optional.  Most sites selling digital goods are fine to accept 0 confirmations. A nice sample app for this would be a simple bank site, which would have the above, plus the option to send a payment to a bitcoin address.  The sample code should be the simplest possible with the minimum extra stuff to make it a working site.vekja.net is an example of a site like this. Right, the difficulty adjustment is trying to keep it so the network as a whole generates an average of 6 blocks per hour.  The time for your block to mature will always be around 20 hours.The recent adjustment put us back to close to 6 blocks per hour again.There's a site where you can see the time between blocks, and since block 68545, it's been more like 10 minutes per block:http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.php I've been trying to encourage someone to write and release some sample Python code showing the recommended way to do the typical accounting stuff, but to no avail.  It would be nice if you didn't have to re-invent the wheel like you're doing here.  Search on getnewaddress and you should find a thread where I gave a small fragment of sample pseudocode.
Neat chart.Difficulty just increased by 4 times, so now your cost is US$0.02/BTC. No, not related at all. Yes, about 20 hours.  (120 conf / 6 blocks per hour = 20 hours)  That's the normal length of time before you can spend it.  You know long before that that you won one.  Good point.  If you're going to have more than 8 LAN nodes connect to one gateway node, then you'd better have the gateway node set up so it can receive incoming connections.  Otherwise, while the gateway node has 8 or more connections, it will not try to add any more outbound connections.  As the outside nodes you're connected to come and go, it doesn't make new outbound connections to replace them.  You'll be fine if you can accept incoming connections, then there will be plenty of others connecting to you. It's in init.cpp.It's a wxWidgets app, so it doesn't have a main() function.  It may in a little while, since I'm pretty close to making bitcoind build w/o wxBase.  (it'll be in init.cpp)Sorry about my choice of the filename "main.cpp", another possible name would have been "core.cpp".  It's much too late to change.  I still prefer main.cpp.We're still in great need of sample code showing the recommended way to use the JSON-RPC functions, like for a basic account system on a typical storefront website.  Using getreceivedbylabel using the username as the label, changing to a new bitcoin address once the stored one for that account gets used.  I posted a sample code fragment on the forum somewhere.  (search on getreceivedbylabel or getnewaddress)  The sample code could be a plain vanilla bank site where you can deposit and send payments. It adjusted to 181.54 a few minutes ago.  Typical time to get a block is about a week now.The difficulty can adjust down as well as up.The network should be generating close to 6 blocks per hour now. Many businesses are like that.  For a car salesman, when will the next customer walk in the door?On the OP's question, it's a good feature, but the question is, how would we word it so people don't expect to get something after that specific amount of time?  "it said 7 days and I waited more than a week and didn't get anything!"  Approx, average, but still they're going to think that way.  It can't be a whole sentence, unless we think of somewhere else to put it, but where would that be?  Suggestions?The difficulty quadrupled a few minutes ago to 181.54.  It's going to take typically about a week to generate now. SHA256 is not like the step from 128 bit to 160 bit.To use an analogy, it's more like the step from 32-bit to 64-bit address space.  We quickly ran out of address space with 16-bit computers, we ran out of address space with 32-bit computers at 4GB, that doesn't mean we're going to run out again with 64-bit anytime soon.SHA256 is not going to be broken by Moore's law computational improvements in our lifetimes.  If it's going to get broken, it'll be by some breakthrough cracking method.  An attack that could so thoroughly vanquish SHA256 to bring it within computationally tractable range has a good chance of clobbering SHA512 too.If we see a weakness in SHA256 coming gradually, we can transition to a new hash function after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade their software by that block number.  The new software would keep a new hash of all the old blocks to make sure they're not replaced with another block with the same old hash. I like that in libraries for the external API's, but you can probably tell from the code that I'm not a fan of it for interior functions.  Big obligatory comment headers for each function space out the code and make you hesitate about creating a small little function where the comment header would be bigger than the function.  They're some trouble for maintenance, as changes to the function then require duplicate changes in the comment header.  I like to keep code compact so you can see more code on the screen at once.To add them now at this point, what would be written would just be what's obvious from looking at the function.The external API we have, in rpc.cpp, the usage documentation is in the help string.Sorry to be a wet blanket. Because of all the dependencies that different systems don't have.  It's easier to just static link what we can.  It doesn't increase the size by very much. Bitcoin automatically rebroadcasts your transactions if it receives new blocks that don't contain them.  It may take about an hour to get rebroadcasted.  It is relentless though.  It will keep nagging the network forever until your transaction gets into a block. Please try the 0.3.1 release candidate, it should at least resolve the libcrypto dependency:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=383.0Let me know if that works. That's the first time I've seen this error.How many blocks do you have? (in the status bar)You should move your blk*.dat files (in ~/.bitcoin) to another directory and let it start over downloading the block chain again.  If you don't mind, could you keep the old blk*.dat files for a little while in case I need to look at them? The proof-of-work difficulty is currently 45.38.  (see http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php)  It's about to increase again in a few hours.  It's only been 3-4 days since the last increase, so I expect it will increase by the max of 4 times, or very nearly the max.  That would put it at 181.54.The target time between adjustments is 14 days, 14/3.5 days = 4.0 times increase. That must be it then.It must be looking for a larger icon like 20x20 but we don't have one. 5 BTC seems like a lot these days, maybe the normal amount should be 1 or 2 BTC.This is an important service so new users can at least get something if generating is too hard. Run it with the undocumented switch -minimizetotray and the option is available in the options menu.I don't know how to fix it.  It's something wrong deep inside wxWidgets or GTK or Gnome. What is "120DPI mode"?  Is that an actual setting somewhere?  Sounds like an obscure enough candidate.  I suppose it needs twice the resolution icon to fill the size of the upper left corner icon.  Only one size is provided. It could go either way.  The Startup folder has the advantage that the end user can see it and manually remove it with the regular UI (not regedit) if they already blew away the Bitcoin directory and its uninstaller.  Bitcoin will not relentlessly keep re-adding it if you delete it manually.OpenOffice is another example of something that puts its link in the Startup folder. The fix for the thread priority level on linux is available in the 0.3.1 release candidate here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=383.msg3198#msg3198
That's surprising that we've never heard of that before now.Maybe you're the first person to ever run it on Vista   I have to guess it has something to do with your display color depth selection.  e.g. 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit, what is it?  Do you have a weird video card, display setup or running it on a tablet or mobile or something? Yes a bug.  It'll have to be fixed in the next version. I updated the first post with a link to rc2 for linux with the fix for this.  Please check that this is fixed for you.  Thanks!http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.1.rc2-linux.tar.gz I was not able to reproduce this.  I have dual-proc, so I ran two memory hogs.  Bitcoin got 0% of CPU according to the task manager.  The khash/sec meter stayed stuck because it couldn't get any CPU to update it.Do you have dual-proc?  Are you sure you weren't running a single processor hog? Thanks for the Spanish and French translations!  The edited and updated .po files are attached.I uploaded these to the SVN. I updated them to 0.3.0.I am tempted to remove the download links from the other languages and only keep it on English.They will need to be updated for 0.3.1 soon.  Perhaps there's a way for someone to manage the updating of the translated drupal pages. I uploaded an updated bitcoin.po for 0.3.1 attached to this message:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=151.msg1259#msg1259please use it if you're starting a new translation.If you already have a po file, poedit can update it.  - Get the src directory from the 0.3.1 release candidate posted in the development forum, any version will do:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=383.0- Make a subdirectory under src: locale/??/LC_MESSAGES(?? could be anything really, "en" or your language 2-letter code)- Put your .po file there- Open it with poedit- In poedit, Catalog->Update from sourcesThe key is that the src directory with the sourcefiles needs to be 3 directories up from the .po file. I need to give an updated .po file.OK, this must be a problem somewhere, I'll have to take a look at it or one of the other devs can.Many of the strings are in code automatically generated from uiproject.fbp where nothing can be done about these things.  I have a program I use to find all the spacing inconsistencies at the beginning and ending of strings in your .po file and manually fix them up before I upload them to SVN. I don't think you have a particular problem, I think your system is laggy because you're running a lot of things at once and hitting the pagefile because memory is full.  You confirmed when you shut off generation that your CPU drops to 0%, so the CPU usage is definitely all idle priority.  There's nothing in the 0.3.1 that would affect these things. Well, it can't hurt to do a backup and it's a good idea to backup regularly, but no, a backup is not required before installing this. This is a bugfix maintenance release.  It is now uploaded to SourceForge.  Mac OS X didn't need any fixes so we don't really need to update it, 0.3.0 is still good.The download links are on bitcoin.orgChanges:- Added Portuguese translation by Tiago FariaWindows- Fix for 22DbRunRecoveryException if your username has non-ascii characters in itLinux- Laszlo's fix for lowering generate thread to lowest priority - Fix for if you're having trouble with libcrypto linkage- Gavin Andresen's implementation of "start on windowing system startup" option Then all the CPU time is the generate thread, which definitely runs at the lowest possible priority, idle priority.  It's normal that your CPU meter is 100%.  Since it's idle priority, it won't actually slow anything else down, even though the CPU meter is 100%. We don't even specify linking glibcxx_3.4.11, so gcc must automatically link it behind the scenes.  There's probably a compiler switch that would tell it to static link it.  I'm not sure what the licensing issues would be.  Typically, compiler stuff is fully redistributable. More directly, this:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=246.0I will be posting release candidate of 0.3.1 with this fix shortly.  Please try that and let me know if it fixes the problem. OK, the undocumented switch "-minimizetotray" which re-enables the option.I uploaded the change to SVN. The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain.  In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks.  It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself. The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node. I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less.  It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in.  The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN. This is a common point of confusion.  There's no such thing as being 1% towards solving a block.  You don't make progress towards solving it.  After working on it for 24 hours, your chances of solving it are equal to what your chances were at the start or at any moment.It's like trying to flip 37 coins at once and have them all come up heads.  Each time you try, your chances of success are the same.The RNG is the OpenSSL secure random number generator.  On Windows it's seeded with the complete set of all hardware performance counters since your computer started, on Linux it's dev/random. Microsoft Security Essentials Live Protection is blocking your communication with the network.  You have connections, which tricks Bitcoin into thinking it's connected, but they are silent because the data is being blocked.You need to make bitcoin.exe an excluded process in Live Protection.This is becoming a common problem.  Someone should write this up in a pegged thread.The message "Warning: This block was not received by any other nodes" occurs when Bitcoin broadcasts a block, but nobody confirms they received it.  The warning is there just for this kind of situation, where for some reason you have connections, but they have gone dead and nobody can hear you.  Your block will never become valid because nobody received it. After it initially tries incorrectly to set itself to the lowest priority, the generate thread only changes its priority again temporarily when it finds a block.  When you've found a block, you should want it to hurry up and broadcast it as soon a possible before someone else finds one and makes yours invalid.  The generate thread only changes to higher priority for less than a second every few days.There should be a 0.3.1 release for this soon.  There are a few other issues we need to look at fixing in 0.3.1 before making a release.That's interesting.  I know the minimize to tray on Ubuntu is very clunky, but I didn't know it had a CPU peg problem too.  Anyone else able to reproduce this problem?  We had this feature disabled on Linux before, but then it seemed better to have the imperfect UI than to lose the feature entirely.  I'm thinking we should disable it again on Linux. What language is your computer set to?  Is it set to German, Dutch or Italian?  Is it one of those sub-languages like "nl-??"?It's trying to load a translation and failing.  You could delete the locale directory that came with bitcoin so it doesn't try to use it.Can someone test each language on Ubuntu and see if there's a problem with just one of them or maybe all three?
This is the second time I've seen this "Live Protection" problem reported.It must be blocking the program's network communication.  It sounds like it's allowing connections to be made, hence the 10 connections shown, but not allowing any data to be sent or received on them.We need to understand this problem better.Can someone write some instructions on the wiki explaining how to turn off or add an exclusion to Live Protection or whatever its full proper name is. Laszlo corrected this, but unfortunately it was too late to make it into 0.3.0.  There will probably be a 0.3.1 soon though.The problem is I used PRIO_MIN, I should have used PRIO_MAX for the lowest priority.  The OS isn't supposed to let you increase priority, so the PRIO_MIN ought to leave it at priority 0. It doesn't work with wxWidgets 2.8, it needs wxWidgets 2.9.  Unfortunately, there isn't a Debian package of wxWidgets 2.9 yet. Thanks for making that calculator.The difficulty doubled a day or two ago, plus it's just random and you can have surprisingly long dry spells. In Windows, you select the process in the task manager, right click, Set Priority.  Set it to BelowNormal or Low.  That shouldn't make a difference though.If you turn off Generate Coins, does the CPU usage go flat?  That would confirm that all the CPU time it's taking is generate, which is idle priority already.It could be it's slow just because you have too many things running at once and you're out of memory.  When you switch from one thing to another, it has to page it in from disk. So that was responsible for keeping blocks from downloading?The link: "Win32 CPU Cycles vs 'Live Protection' Engines"For BitcoinFX, Live Protection was keeping it from getting CPU for generating coins.  You said your friend was getting 1400-1600 khash/s, so it was getting CPU.  I guess Live Protection must have been blocking some other part of the program then? True, if it happened suddenly.  If it happens gradually, we can still transition to something stronger.  When you run the upgraded software for the first time, it would re-sign all your money with the new stronger signature algorithm.  (by creating a transaction sending the money to yourself with the stronger sig) I'll start thinking about how to do this.At the moment, you can kind of use -connect.  You can use -connect to make it connect to local computers on your LAN, like -connect=192.168.0.100.  If you start it out blank and don't let it connect to the main network, the difficulty is still at the original low difficulty.  If you've port-forwarded though, then outside nodes might still connect inward to you.With -connect it still uses IRC, do you think it shouldn't get on IRC when you're telling it to only connect to specific nodes with -connect?  The main scenario for -connect is where you have a server farm, with two connected to the network and the rest connected to the first two.  In that case, you wouldn't want the -connect computers on IRC.void ThreadIRCSeed(void* parg){    if (mapArgs.count("-connect"))        return; I tested this with a non-lower-ASCII account name on XP and confirmed the bug, then tested that the new GetDefaultDataDir fixed it.  This change is revision 102 of the SVN. What the OP described is called "cornering the market".  When someone tries to buy all the world's supply of a scarce asset, the more they buy the higher the price goes.  At some point, it gets too expensive for them to buy any more.  It's great for the people who owned it beforehand because they get to sell it to the corner at crazy high prices.  As the price keeps going up and up, some people keep holding out for yet higher prices and refuse to sell.The Hunt brothers famously bankrupted themselves trying to corner the silver market in 1979:"Brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt attempted to corner the world silver markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to more than half of the world's deliverable silver.[1] During Hunt's accumulation of the precious metal silver prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to nearly $50 an ounce in January 1980.[2] Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later,[2] much of the fall on a single day now known as Silver Thursday, due to changes made to exchange rules regarding the purchase of commodities on margin.[3]"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market I think I see where the problem is.  Coincidentally, I recently coded a replacement for the function in question which should fix it.  It's not enabled yet, but in the SVN version it prints a debug message in debug.log showing the new directory value and old value for comparison. It's hard to imagine the Internet getting segmented airtight.  It would have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from the rest of the world.Any node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up modem or sat-phone.  It would only take one node to do it.  Anyone who wants to keep doing business would be motivated.If the network is segmented and then recombines, any transactions in the shorter fork that were not also in the longer fork are released into the transaction pool again and are eligible to get into future blocks.  Their number of confirmations would start over.If anyone took advantage of the segmentation to double-spend, such that there are different spends of the same money on each side, then the double-spends in the shorter fork lose out and go to 0/unconfirmed and stay that way.It wouldn't be easy to take advantage of the segmentation to double-spend.  If it's impossible to communicate from one side to the other, how are you going to put a spend on each side?  If there is a way, then probably someone else is also using it to flow the block chain over.You would usually know whether you're in the smaller segment.  For example, if your country cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the rest of the world is the larger segment.  If you're in the smaller segment, you should assume nothing is confirmed. Thanks for finding that.  We switched from ANSI in 0.2 to UTF-8 in version 0.3, so it must be related to that.Just to confirm, if you log in with the non-latin character username, not having an appdata/Bitcoin directory yet, and run Bitcoin and let it create the database from scratch, does it work or not? Everybody needs to connect to the same IRC server and channel so they can find each other.It might not be good if we suddenly rushed freenode with a ton of users all at once.The fallback is our own seed system. irc.lfnet.org is pretty old and has impressive uptime.  I think it's going to be fine.We could take IRC out at some point if we want, but I'd rather ease into it and just test our own seed system as a backup for now, and I really like the complementary redundant attributes of the two different systems. 0.3 releasedhttp://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=238.msg2004#msg2004 Announcing version 0.3 of Bitcoin, the P2P cryptocurrency!  Bitcoin is a digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace the need for a trusted central server.  Escape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies!  Bitcoin's total circulation is limited to 21 million coins.  The coins are gradually released to the network's nodes based on the CPU power they contribute, so you can get a share of them by contributing your idle CPU time.What's new:- Command line and JSON-RPC control- Includes a daemon version without GUI- Transaction filter tabs- 20% faster hashing- Hashmeter performance display- Mac OS X version (thanks to Laszlo)- German, Dutch and Italian translations (thanks to DataWraith, Xunie and Joozero)Get it at http://www.bitcoin.org or read the forum to find out more. BTW, I did come to my senses after that brief bout with 1.3, this release is still going to be 0.3 beta not 1.0.I really appreciate the effort, but there are a lot of problems.We don't want to lead with "anonymous".  (I've been meaning to edit the homepage)"The developers expect that this will result in a stable-with-respect-to-energy currency outside the reach of any government." -- I am definitely not making an such taunt or assertion. It's not stable-with-respect-to-energy.  There was a discussion on this.  It's not tied to the cost of energy.  NLS's estimate based on energy was a good estimated starting point, but market forces will increasingly dominate. Sorry to be a wet blanket.  Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard.  There's nothing to relate it to. Laszlo's build is going to be our first Mac release so please test it! I reduced max outbound connections from 15 to 8 in RC4.15 was way more than we needed for redundancy.  8 is still plenty of redundancy.As the nodes upgrade to this version, this will cut in half the number of connections that inbound accepting nodes get.If anyone wants more than 8 connections, they can open port 8333 on their firewall. OK, back to 0.3 then.Please download RC4 and check it over as soon as possible.  I'd like to release it soon.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=199.msg1927#msg1927Other than the version number change, which included changes in readme.txt and setup.nsi, I reduced the maximum number of outbound connections from 15 to 8 so nodes that accept inbound don't get too many connections.  15 was a lot more than needed.  8 is still plenty for redundancy.
(reverted to rc2)Links removed, 0.3 is now released, so go to http://www.bitcoin.org to download it. It is, but generating is more than twice as slow. Thanks for the feedback on this.One thing we could do is lower the outbound connections from 15 to 10 or maybe even 5.  The choice of 15 was arbitrary.  It just needs to be enough for redundancy and fast exponential propagation of messages.  10 would still be plenty.  5 should be fine.  10 is good as a nice round number so users can see that it stopped intentionally.It would help to implement UPnP so there would be more inbound accepting nodes.  Your number of connections is the ratio of inbound accepting nodes to out-only times 15.  We need to encourage more people to accept inbound connections.I will implement a feature to stop accepting inbound connections once you hit a certain number.Which version are you running?Anyone know how many connections typical P2P software like BitTorrent can get up to? Here's an answer to a similar question about how to recover from a major meltdown.https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=191.msg1585#msg1585 MinGW still only has good old stable 3.4.5.  There's not much reason for them to update it. When I looked at the 3.4.5 compiled SHA disassembly, I couldn't see any room for improvement at all.  I can't imagine how 8% more could be squeezed out of it.  Is it possible Windows could have 8% more overhead?  Not making system calls or anything, just plain busy computational code, could task switching and other housekeeping operations take away that much? Welcome, Harry.I hadn't thought about starting out using bitcoind without using bitcoin first.  I guess for now, this thread serves as the tutorial.  The focus for bitcoind so far has been more on backend support for websites.  There's demand for things that would be nice for adminning headless generators like listgenerated.  For the moment, you can grep the debug.log file for "generated" and "hashmeter" for some feedback.  Generated blocks take about 24 hours before they're credited to your balance. But 1.0 sounds like the first release.  For some things newness is a virtue but for this type of software, maturity and stability are important.  I don't want to put my money in something that's 1.0.  1.0 might be more interesting for a moment, but after that we're still 1.0 and everyone who comes along thinks we just started.  This is the third major release and 1.3 reflects that development history.  (0.1, 0.2, 1.3) Many big ISPs give you a new IP every time you connect, usually in the same class B (a.b.?.?).  Maybe you should have a minimum time between payments per class-B.If you can't solve the problem, you can always keep lowering the amount of bitcoins given until it's manageable, and always require captcha. The linux release candidate in the "1.3 almost ready" thread contains prebuilt bitcoind. I think that's the best option right now.  Like cash, you don't keep your entire net worth in your pocket, just walking around money for incidental expenses.They could make a smaller version of the site optimized for mobile.  If there was an app, it could be a front end to one of those, with the main feature being QR-code reader, or maybe there's already a universal QR-code reading app that web sites can be designed to accept scans from.If there was an iPhone app that was just a front end for vekja or mybitcoin, not a big involved P2P, would apple approve it and if not, on what basis?  It could always be an Android app instead.  An app is not really necessary though, just a mobile sized website.A web interface to your own Bitcoin server at home wouldn't be a solution for everyone.  Most users don't have a static IP, and it's too much trouble to set up port forwarding. Changed the version number to 1.3 and removed "Beta".(links removed, see below)Uses irc.lfnet.org. Is it about time we lose the Beta?  I would make this release version 1.3. The first panel of the status bar is shared with the help description of menu items as you hover over them.  Since all our menu item descriptions are blank, it replaces it with blank when you're hovering in a menu. Freenode is too visible, right in the middle of where all those users and moderators are hanging out.  Laszlo's option is a much better fit for us.I made 0.3.0.RC2 available that uses irc.lfnet.org instead of freenode if you want to start switching over:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=199.msg1787#msg1787 Lets try using Laszlo's irc.lfnet.org instead of freenode.  Here's RC2, that's the only change in it:(see below for download links) This seems like a good idea.What does everyone think, should we make the switch for 0.3? We need more details about what happened MadHatter.Both 0.2 and 0.3 have a backup way of getting connected without IRC, it's just slower to get connected.0.2 can find other nodes without IRC if it's ever been connected before, but a new install can't discover the network for the first time without IRC.0.3 can also seed without IRC.  It can operate entirely without IRC if it needs to, but it's better having IRC for redundancy. Thanks virtualcoin, that's a perfect comparison.The 8% speedup from 32-bit Windows (2310k) to 32-bit Linux (2500k) is probably from the newer version of GCC on Linux (4.4.3 vs 3.4.5).The 15% speedup from 32-bit to 64-bit Linux is more of a mystery.  The code is completely 32-bit.Hmm, I think the 8 extra registers added by x86-64 must be what's helping.  That would make a significant difference to SHA if it could hold most of the 16 state variables in registers. I don't know.  Maybe someone with more Linux experience knows how to install the library it needs.I built it on Ubuntu 10.04.  I hope that wasn't a mistake.  Maybe it should have been built on an older version for more backward compatibility.  Is this a problem on Linux, that if you build on the latest version, then it has trouble working on older versions?  Is there any way I can downgrade to an older version of GCC on 10.04?The 64-bit version shouldn't be any faster than the 32-bit version, but it would be great if someone could do a side-by-side comparison of the two linux versions and check.  SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm and nothing in BitcoinMiner uses 64-bit at all.We don't need to bother with a 64-bit version for Windows.  32-bit programs work on all versions of Windows.  It's not like Linux where the 64-bit OS wants 64-bit programs.I'm also curious if it's a little faster on linux than windows.Do you think I should make the directories:/bin32//bin64/instead of/bin/32//bin/64/ Here's RC1 for linux for testing:(link removed, see below)It contains both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.Recent changes:build-unix.txt:- Added instructions for building wxBase, which is needed to compile bitcoind.- The package libboost-dev doesn't install anything anymore, you need to get libboost-all-dev.- Updated version numbers.makefile.unix:- The libboost libraries have removed the "-mt" from their filenames in 1.40.  If you're compiling with Boost 1.38 or lower, like on Ubuntu Karmic, you would need to change it back to boost_system-mt and boost_filesystem-mt.
Laszlo figured out that enabling some more optimisation increased performance about 20%, so 0.3 hashes 20% faster than 0.2.0, but I assume he used that in his own build.30khash increase to what total rate?  (to figure the % increase) You figured it out faster than I could post a reply.  It looks like laszlo's build of Berkeley DB has database/log.* files that are not compatible with ours.  The .dat files are fine, their format shouldn't ever change.  All data is stored in the .dat files.  All your own data is stored in wallet.dat.  If you had waited for it to redownload the block chain, your missing transactions and generateds would have appeared as the block chain reached the point where those transactions were recorded.When you copied the directory except log.0000000002, that's the best solution.  You should be good now.The database/log.* files only contain temporary database data.  If you exited bitcoin normally the last time, not exited by forced terminating it or crashing, then the database/log.* files can normally be deleted safely.  They're only used so that if the database is in the middle of a transaction when the computer crashes or the program is killed or crashes, then it could recover without losing data.Please keep running v0.3 if at all possible, don't go back to v0.2.10.Anyone else who hits this problem, move the database\log.000000000* files somewhere else.  (if it works fine after that, you can delete them later)I'm reluctant to make the installer delete or move those files.  If the previous run was stopped by crashing or killed, that would be the wrong thing to do. davidonpda, were you also running laszlo's build previously?Check if the "%appdata%" directory exists, and "%appdata%\bitcoin"Try: rename "%appdata%\bitcoin" bitcoin2 does it work then? What operating system?Normally when it does that it's because the directory where the data directory should go doesn't exist.  See if the "%appdata%" directory exists.Do you get that error with 0.2 also?  It's hard to see how you could get that with 0.3 and not with 0.2 since there's nothing different in that regard. Here's RC1 for windows for testing:(removed, see RC2 below)Please only download this if you're going to test and report back whether everything seems fine or not.  Make sure to look through the files in "c:\program files\bitcoin" My fear is too many programmers would latch onto that for checking for received payments.  It can never be reliable that way.  The list/getreceivedbyaddress/label functions are the only way to do it reliably.We shouldn't delay forever until every possible feature is done.  There's always going to be one more thing to do. Agree.  Certainly too trivial to clutter the user's attention with.I changed it to every 30 minutes.If I increased it to every 10 minutes, it would still be a small enough presence in the log file.  Question is whether that would be more output than the user wants when they grep. It's too late now for feature changes to 0.3, but I'll add that to the post-0.3 to do list.  I never would have noticed that if you hadn't pointed it out. I've noticed that hashing performance doesn't vary as much between CPUs as you'd expect.  Compared to an old CPU, a newer CPU doesn't show as much of a speedup at hashing as it does on general benchmarks.I guess recent CPU optimizations must have concentrated on things like I/O and branch prediction.  Most programs are a bunch of memory access, comparisons and branching, they rarely get down to cranking away at maths for very long.The latest SVN version has a khash/s display.  Around 400 khash/s per processor is typical. I finished everything on my list to do for version 0.3.  The code on SVN is about ready to release.Testing at this point is much appreciated. On Ubuntu 10.04 it wouldn't remove the taskbar button cleanly, so I made it leave it there.But now that you mention it, it's probably better to have the feature, even if it's messy, than not to have it, though it may confuse a few people when the taskbar button temporarily stays around but disappears if you click on it.Updated SVN.Thanks for testing. I integrated the hashmeter idea into the SVN version.  It displays khash/s in the left section of the status bar.Two new log messages:21/06/2010 01:23 hashmeter   2 CPUs    799 khash/s21/06/2010 01:23 generated 50.00grep your debug.log for "generated" to see what you've generated, and grep for "hashmeter" to see the performance.  On windows, use: findstr "hashmeter generated" "%appdata%\bitcoin\debug.log"I have the hashmeter messages once an hour.  How often do you think it should be? Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.Computers have to get about 2^200 times faster before that starts to be a problem.  Someone with lots of compute power could make more money by generating than by trying to steal. This is now fixed in the SVN version.1) Menu bar default color.2) Balance bar not a different color.3) Background behind bitcoin address and balance now the same color as toolbar.I checked all the standard themes and it seems reasonable with all of them.Ubuntu minimize,maximize,close buttons to the right:gconf-editorapps->metacity->generalbutton_layout=menu:minimize,maximize,closeThey've got it awfully buried considering 9 out of 10 users are used to having it on the right. Excellent choice of a first project, nice work.  I had planned to do this exact thing if someone else didn't do it, so when it gets too hard for mortals to generate 50BTC, new users could get some coins to play with right away.  Donations should be able to keep it filled.  The display showing the balance in the dispenser encourages people to top it up.You should put a donation bitcoin address on the page for those who want to add funds to it, which ideally should update to a new address whenever it receives something. The SVN version now uses IRC first and if that fails it falls back to a hardcoded list of seed nodes.  There are enough seed nodes now that many of them should still be up by the time of the next release.  It only briefly connects to a seed node to get the address list and then disconnects, so your connections drop back to zero for while.  At that point, be patient.  It's only slow to get connected the first time.This means TOR users won't need to -addnode anymore, it'll get connected automatically.   A second version would be a massive development and maintenance hassle for me.  It's hard enough maintaining backward compatibility while upgrading the network without a second version locking things in.  If the second version screwed up, the user experience would reflect badly on both, although it would at least reinforce to users the importance of staying with the official version.  If someone was getting ready to fork a second version, I would have to air a lot of disclaimers about the risks of using a minority version.  This is a design where the majority version wins if there's any disagreement, and that can be pretty ugly for the minority version and I'd rather not go into it, and I don't have to as long as there's only one version.I know, most developers don't like their software forked, but I have real technical reasons in this case.That's one of the reasons for transaction fees.  There are other things we can do if necessary.Since 2007.  At some point I became convinced there was a way to do this without any trust required at all and couldn't resist to keep thinking about it.  Much more of the work was designing than coding.Fortunately, so far all the issues raised have been things I previously considered and planned for. The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.  Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of.  The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time.  It would have been an explosion of special cases.  The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates.  The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender's conditions are met.The script is actually a predicate.  It's just an equation that evaluates to true or false.  Predicate is a long and unfamiliar word so I called it script.The receiver of a payment does a template match on the script.  Currently, receivers only accept two templates: direct payment and bitcoin address.  Future versions can add templates for more transaction types and nodes running that version or higher will be able to receive them.  All versions of nodes in the network can verify and process any new transactions into blocks, even though they may not know how to read them.The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc.  If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.  The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing standpoint. I'm working on getting version 0.3 released as soon as I can.  Just a last few things left to do.  It's been a long time since 0.2 and we need to get a prebuilt bitcoind with command line and JSON-RPC available.  This time we'll have both 32-bit and 64-bit linux binaries, and Laszlo is going to build a Mac OSX release.  Plus, we'll include the German, Dutch and Italian translations by DataWraith, Xunie and Joozero (thanks you guys!). Thanks DataWraith!  The German translation is uploaded to SVN.This is great, we've already got 3 major languages.
http://127.0.0.1:8330/?to=domain.com&amount=200.00&comment=order_12345orhttp://127.0.0.1:8330/?to=<bitcoinaddress><separatorchar>1.2.3.4&amount=200.00But as long as the link is already doing the typing for you, I don't see much benefit in using a domain address instead of bitcoin address.  With a bitcoin address, the user can't send an unidentified payment.  They can't send payment until they've been given a correct bitcoin address to send to.What would be nice about sending by domain is you could visually verify who it's going to.A more crucial issue is what if the browser isn't allowed to connect to 127.0.0.1:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=63.msg1589#msg1589and if that's true, then what about that example freenet link that had 127.0.0.1 in it? The premise is false.  Adding more transactions to the block you're working on does NOT slow down your generation rate.  When generate is scanning hashes, it only hashes the header of the block, which is constant size.  The header contains a hash of the transactions (the Merkle root) and is only updated occasionally.If necessary I can write code to make nodes prefer not to use a block if it doesn't contain enough of the transactions they know about.  A discouraged block would almost always fail to be included in the main chain, but would be accepted if it did get in.  I doubt this will be necessary, since there's no real advantage for nodes not to include all transactions. Sorry, I didn't test compile on linux the last few revisions.Reverted makefile.unix. 3) Nothing, if sending by bitcoin address5) It is decentralised.  After you have connected to the network the first time, you no longer need IRC.  SHA-256 is very strong.  It's not like the incremental step from MD5 to SHA1.  It can last several decades unless there's some massive breakthrough attack.If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash in an orderly way.  The software would be programmed to start using a new hash after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade by that time.  The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash can't be used.  SirArthur has a good point about the normal online merchant case, which is what the send-by-IP option is more suited to.  This is the case where the merchant will have a server on a static IP and their own domain name and SSL cert.Instead of connecting by IP, we can connect to a domain name by SSL, using the existing CA infrastructure to authenticate that you're connected to the owner of that domain.The user would send to domain.com (or www.domain.com is ok too).  That would be very natural and users could see and verify that what they entered is who they intend to pay.The SSL also makes it safe for TOR users.Problem is, I think merchants would still prefer to use bitcoin addresses to be certain they know what the payment is for.  You simply cannot count on users to enter the right thing in the comment fields to identify the transaction.  It would only approach practical if we had a mailto style link that prepopulates the comment field with the order number, but then the link could just as well be a bitcoin address. Just having an open bitcoin server at domain.com that users could send unidentified payments to would be too much of a liability.  Regular users aren't used to the idea of having to identify the payment.  Merchants would get too many blank payments followed by "I paid you, where's my stuff?!" a week later.The payment sequence does have a step where the receiver verifies the order before accepting it.  It can reject the payment and return an error message if it doesn't contain a valid order number.  That would require a difficult level of integration of custom code with the bitcoin server though. Bitcoin has its own distributed address directory using the "addr" message.  It's about time we coded in a list of the current long running static nodes to seed from.  I can add code so new nodes do not preferentially stay connected to the seed nodes, just connect and get the list, so it won't be a burden on them.What do you think, should I go ahead with adding the seeds?It'll still try IRC first.  The IRC has the advantage that it lists nodes that are currently online, since they have to stay connected to stay on the list, but the disadvantage that it's a single point of failure.  The "addr" system has no single point of failure, but can only tell you what nodes have recently been seen, so it takes a little longer to get connected since some of the nodes you try have gone offline.  The combination of the two gets us the best of both worlds and more total robustness.Is there anyone who wants to volunteer to run an IRC server in case freenode gets tired of us? I uploaded the 93% complete Dutch translation to SVN.  Thanks! That's a good idea.  I'm not sure where exactly to fit that in, but it could certainly calculate the expected average time between blocks generated, and then people would know what to expect.Every node and each processor has a different public key in its block, so they're guaranteed to be scanning different territory.Whenever the 32-bit nonce starts over at 1, bnExtraNonce gets incremented, which is an arbitrary precision integer. The current sending by IP is not very useful: it connects to the IP, so you'd like to use TOR for anonymity, but then it can totally be eavesdropped and man-in-the-middled.The future plan for sending to an IP is to make it a bitcoin address plus IP, like:1auaDZCFYqaGx4FKS5WenNfurk2SkoDu4h<someseparatorcharacter>1.2.3.4or1auaDZCFYqaGx4FKS5WenNfurk2SkoDu4h<someseparatorcharacter>domain.comI need suggestions for the separator character.  ":" is a candidate, but IPv6 has : in it and that might get confusing.  Something that's allowed in url parameters would be nice.I want to use SSL for the connection, using the bitcoin address' public key as the cert.  You would be certain you're connected to who you thought, and safely encrypted.  The bitcoin address would not be used for the transaction, only for authentication.  A new generated bitcoin address would be sent through the SSL connection.Since it's authenticated, it would then be safe to allow the IP address to be a domain name.  Some care taken that if a proxy is used, it uses socks4a instead of DNS lookup. Hurray!  We have our first language.  I uploaded it to SVN to go in with the 0.3 release. In the SVN version, if a transaction requires a transaction fee, it says"This transaction is over the size limit.  You can still send it for a fee of #,which goes to the nodes that process your transaction and helps to support the network.Do you want to pay the fee?"If you don't have enough money with the fee added, it says"Total exceeds your balance when the # transaction fee is included  " Does anyone want to translate the Bitcoin client itself?  It would be great to have at least one other language in the 0.3 release.All you have to do is get poedit and translate the po file I'm attaching to this post.  It's less than 750 words.Updated bitcoin.po attachment for 0.3.1 It does in fact download 500 blocks at a time, then the counter counts one at a time as it verifies the blocks.The advantage of letting bitcoin download and verify the blocks is that you do not have to trust the person you're downloading them from.  If you downloaded the blk*.dat files from some site, you would have to trust that site, since you would be accepting the data without verifying it yourself.  If you're copying blk*.dat from another computer of yours, that should be fine.How long is the initial block download taking for you? Yeah, that actually is what it is.  getallreceived 0 should do what you want.  (now it's renamed to listreceivedbyaddress 0)  The default is 1 confirmation, but I think in reality most digital goods and services can be 0 confirmations.  Like you say, if you need more than 0 confirmations, you could show two numbers, unconfirmed and available balance, so they immediately see their transaction went through.listreceivedbyaddress [minconf=1] [includeempty=false][minconf] is the minimum number of confirmations before payments are included.[includeempty] whether to include addresses that haven't received any payments.Returns an array of objects containing:  "address" : receiving address  "label" : the label of the receiving address  "amount" : total amount received by the address  "confirmations" : number of confirmations of the most recent transaction includedor listreceivedbylabel if you're labelling addresses with their username.So far I've concentrated on functions for web merchants, not so much on stuff for remote management of headless coin generators yet. This is on my list.  I will soon make the "Your Bitcoin Address:" window automatically change whenever you receive anything to the address displayed.I'm also recommending this approach for the implementation of web apps.  I just posted some sample code showing a suggested way of implementing this.Versions on SVN since 0.2.4 already have a "New..." button next to the address bar to encourage changing it manually too.@theymos: If nothing else, we can fall back on that solution in the future. I added label related functions to help with managing multiple addresses per user.  New or renamed functions are: getreceivedbyaddress -- amount received on a single address getreceivedbylabel -- amount received by all addresses with this label listreceivedbyaddress -- list addresses and amounts they've received listreceivedbylabel -- list labels and amounts they've received setlabel -- misc label functions for completeness getlabel getaddressesbylabelFor consistency I renamed getamountreceived->getreceivedbyaddress and getallreceived->listreceivedbyaddress.  The old names are still there so as not to break existing code, but they're deprecated.The idea is that if you give the username whenever you call getnewaddress, you can get the user's total received across all their addresses using the "bylabel" functions.  You can freely change their address without worrying about tracking all their old addresses.A good way to automate changing the user's receiving address: just before displaying their current address, check if it has been used to receive anything, if it has then replace it with a new one:// Get a new address whenever the current one has received anythingif (strAddr == "" || getreceivedbyaddress(strAddr) > 0)   strAddr = getnewaddress(strUsername); // Label the address with usernameDisplay(strAddr); // Display their current receiving address// Get total received by all the user's addressesgetreceivedbylabel(strUsername, 0) // unconfirmedgetreceivedbylabel(strUsername, 1) // available balanceIf you're just getting one particular user's balance, such as in response to a page request by that user, use getreceivedbylabel, but if you're scanning over all users, it's better to use listreceivedbylabel to get the complete list and scan against the result.  Scanning users with getreceivedbylabel would be n-squared, using listreceivedbylabel is n-log-n (or n linear).You should only really need to scan all users if you're polling in order to spontaneously take action in response to money received, rather than the user going to a webpage, seeing their balance and telling you what to do with it.  It's not necessary to poll very frequently.  If you require 1 confirmation, that'll take an average of 10 minutes anyway, so there's no point in polling more often than every few minutes.If you're selling digital goods and services, where you don't lose much if someone gets a free access, and it can't be resold for profit, I think you're fine to accept 0 confirmations.It's mostly only if you were selling gold or currency that you'd need multiple confirmations. Almost but not quite.  Bitcoin uses EC-DSA, which can only do digital signing, not encryption.  RSA can do both, but I didn't use it because it's an order of magnitude bigger and would have been impractical. It's not the download so much as verifying all the signatures in all the blocks as it downloads that takes a long time.How long is the initial block download typically taking?  Does it slow down half way through or is about the same speed the whole way?I've thought about ways to do a more cursory check of most of the chain up to the last few thousand blocks.  It is possible, but it's a lot of work, and there are a lot of other higher priority things to work on.Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users who only do transactions and don't generate and don't participate in the node network.  They wouldn't need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain).  If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we'll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes.  At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated.SPV is not implemented yet, and won't be implemented until far in the future, but all the current implementation is designed around supporting it.In the meantime, sites like vekja.net and www.mybitcoin.com have been experimenting with account-based sites.  You create an account on a website and hold your bitcoins on account there and transfer in and out.  Creating an account on a website is a lot easier than installing and learning to use software, and a more familiar way of doing it for most people.  The only disadvantage is that you have to trust the site, but that's fine for pocket change amounts for micropayments and misc expenses.  It's an easy way to get started and if you get larger amounts then you can upgrade to the actual bitcoin software. A little late, but in case anyone else has the same issue.  The compile dump had 2 warnings (that were 20 lines long) and 2 link errors.  The errors were:Those are probably due to switching to the release build of wxWidgets instead of debug.  They're moving towards only debug build and ditching the release build, so they probably don't care that their release build is broken by referring to non-existent assert stuff.  There's nothing to fear about the debug build.  It's fully suitable for releases.bitcoind runs as a daemon and can either be controlled by command line or JSON-RPC.Thanks madhatter and generica for detailing the instructions for building on freebsd.
At the moment, it always assumes the incoming port is 8333, so it would tell other bitcoin nodes to connect to router:8333 even if you're redirecting from another port number.I'm not in a big hurry to fix this because I can't think of any benefit to having more than one incoming connection port.  If you're providing one incoming port, then you've done your bit to help the network.  Having two incoming ports to the same person doesn't help redundancy.If you have many computers, then using the -connect switch on most of them to connect locally makes more sense. SheriffWoody:Bitcoin addresses you generate are kept forever.  A bitcoin address must be kept to show ownership of anything sent to it.  If you were able to delete a bitcoin address and someone sent to it, the money would be lost.  They're only about 500 bytes.sirius-m:Thousands of own addresses should not be any problem at all.  If you've generated 50000 BTC, then you already have 1000 own addresses, one for each 50 generated.  Those are hidden, they're not shown in the UI.It would be a good idea to add a little code that keeps giving the same address to the same IP.  Here's what I did in C++ to keep giving the same key (aka bitcoin address) until they use it:    // Keep giving the same key to the same ip until they use it    if (!mapReuseKey.count(pfrom->addr.ip))        mapReuseKey[pfrom->addr.ip] = GenerateNewKey();        ...sends the key mapReuseKey[pfrom->addr.ip]...later...    // Received something with this key    mapReuseKey.erase(pfrom->addr.ip);If it's not convenient to know when you've received, just clear the cached keys every 20 minutes.I want to add a parameter to getnewaddress for number of days to expire if nothing is received with the address. Does it happen every time you run it, or just happened once at some random time?I've never seen that fail before.  It's a call to OpenSSL that I assumed would never fail, but I put an error check there just in case.  I can't imagine how it would fail.  Out of memory maybe.The code is:key.h:    EC_KEY* pkey;        pkey = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(NID_secp256k1);        if (pkey == NULL)            throw key_error("CKey::CKey() : EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name failed");NID_secp256k1 is a constant. There you go, we could easily do it the same way, like:http://127.0.0.1:8330/?to=<bitcoinaddress>;amount=<amount>Bitcoin can answer port 8330 on local loopback just as it does for JSON-RPC on 8332.  It would give an HTTP answer.I think we can do that.Although it would be possible for Bitcoin to take care of business in the HTTP response by presenting HTML UI to the user, as a user I would wonder if some website is trying to trick me or if I'm really talking to my own Bitcoin server.The HTTP response could simply be HTML with the JavaScript equivalent of the back button, sending it back to the page.  Bitcoin then pops up the Send Bitcoins dialog with the destination bitcoin address and amount already filled in.  It would work just like a mailto: link that pops up a new email with the address filled in.127.0.0.1 loopback is accessible by any user on the machine, it doesn't have per-user separation, but it's OK because it would only serve the convenience function of pre-filling the fields in a dialog.  You'd still have to press Send.  We'd have to make sure the Send button is not selected so it couldn't jump into the foreground while you're typing a space or enter. That's a good idea.  At the very least a warning dialog explaining that it'll connect to the IP and send the information cleartext, giving the chance to cancel. When you generate a new bitcoin address, it only takes disk space on your own computer (like 500 bytes).  It's like generating a new PGP private key, but less CPU intensive because it's ECC.  The address space is effectively unlimited.  It doesn't hurt anyone, so generate all you want. Mihalism Multi Host is a popular open source PHP file hosting server.It's geared toward image hosting, but I think by increasing the file size limit and liberalising the allowed file extensions, it could just as easily be used for general file upload hosting.  They need the limits to keep it reasonable as a free service, but if we bolt on a Bitcoin payment mechanism, the limits could be relaxed.It doesn't have a bunch of client side scripting or anti-embedding junk to rip out.  It generates standard links that work normally.There's a turnover churn in these free hosting sites.  Small sites can give free image hosting, but once one starts getting popular, it gets too swamped with moochers using them for free bandwidth.  Any site that gets well known has to become more aggressively pay-naggy to cover bandwidth costs.  It's a perfect example of a service where the needed price point is in the no-man's-land between just a little too expensive to be free, but too cheap for most users to take the trouble of a conventional payment.  It's in the gap between 0 and 19.95.  The best they can do is try to maybe get 1 out of 1000 users to pay 9.95, but that has 999/1000 users treated like freeloaders.  It can't really be advertising supported because the images are embedded in other sites and downloaded without going to the hosting site.An example of a site running the software:http://www.imagez.ws/Forum:http://www.mihalism.net/Download:http://code.google.com/p/mihalismmh/What do you think?  If I made a Bitcoin payment integration for this, would anyone be interested in running it?  It might be the first fully automated service available to buy with Bitcoins.  The advantage it could offer over the free services is general file upload hosting of large files without making downloading users go to the upload site and jump through hoops.  It would give a normal link directly to the file. Title changed.It helps that we have someone with actual experience running a proxy service.  Do you think Psiphon is the best one currently?  (sometimes the one you run was the best when you started but you found better ones later) LR and Pecunix have many established exchanges to paper currencies by various payment methods, and a number of vendors accept them as payment, so an exchange link between Bitcoin and LR/Pecunix would give us 2nd-hop access to all that.  The possibility to cash out through them would help support the value of bitcoins.Bitcoin has unique properties that would be complementary.  LR/Pecunix are easy to spend anonymously, but hard to buy anonymously and not worth the trouble to buy in small amounts.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is easy to get in small amounts anonymously.  It would be convenient to buy LR/Pecunix with bitcoins rather than through conventional payment methods.Most customers who convert to LR to buy something would probably ask the seller first if they accept Bitcoin, encouraging them to start accepting it. It's unrelated.  There wasn't anything there when I started.The price of .com registrations is lower than it should be, therefore any good name you might think of is always already taken by some domain name speculator.  Fortunately, it's standard for open source projects to be .org. That's a great idea.  There's a thriving business in those services, but I've always thought the standard payment methods are at odds with privacy minded customers.Would you consider making your software freely available so anyone could easily set one up?  I know for competitive reasons the inclination is to keep it to yourself, but it could get an order of magnitude more use if anyone could give proxy access to their country just by putting the software on a server.I wonder if there are other kinds of web application servers where we would only have to tack on the payment mechanism to an already existing system? Thanks soultcer for talking with the Freenode staffer.  Good to know it's OK at the current size, and now they know who we are.  They're supportive of projects like TOR so I hope they would probably be friendly to us.  We don't want to overstay our welcome.  If we get too big, then by the same token, we're big enough that we don't need IRC anymore and we'll get off.We only needed IRC because nobody had a static IP.  In the early days there were some steady supporters, but they all had pool-allocated IPs that change every few days.  IRC was only intended as a temporary solution.  Bitcoin's built-in addr system is the main solution.Bitcoin can get the list of IPs from any bitcoin node.  In that sense, every node serves as a directory server.When there are enough static IP nodes to have a good chance that at least one will still be running by the time the current version goes out of use, we can preprogram a seed list.How do you think we should compile the seed list?  Would it be OK to create it from the currently connected IPs that have been static for a while?BTW, if we want to supplement by deploying separate directory server software, may I suggest IRC?  IRC is a good directory server (I've heard it has other uses too), and there are mature IRC server implementations available that anyone can run.   Bitcoin's IRC client implementation is already thoroughly tested. When you want to upload an image to embed in a forum post, there are services like imageshack, but because they're free, they limit the number of views.  It's a minuscule amount of bandwidth cost, but they can't just give it away for free, there has to be something in it for them.  It would be nice to be able to pay for the bandwidth and avoid the limits, but conventional payments are too inconvenient for such a minor thing.It's worse if you want to upload a file for others to download.  There are services like rapidshare, but they require the downloaders to go through extra steps and delays to make them look at advertising or encourage upgrading to a paid subscription, and they limit it to 10 or so downloads.It would be nice if we made some free PHP code for an image and file hosting service that charges Bitcoins.  Anyone with some extra bandwidth quota could throw it on their webserver and run it.  Users could finally pay the minor fee to cover bandwidth cost and avoid the limits and hassles.  Ideally, it should be MIT license or public domain.Services like this would be great for anonymous users, who have trouble paying for things. It sets different priorities for each thread.  The generate threads run at PRIO_MIN.  The other threads rarely take any CPU and run at normal.#define THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST          PRIO_MIN#define THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL    2#define THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL          0The priorities converted from Windows priorities were probably from a table like this:   "The following table shows the mapping between nice values and Win32 priorities. Refer to the Win32 documentation for SetThreadPriority() for more information on Win32 priority issues.nice value    Win32 Priority-20 to -16    THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST-15 to -6    THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL-5 to +4    THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL+5 to +14    THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL+15 to +19    THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST"If you have better values, suggestions welcome.Also, there was some advice on the web that PRIO_PROCESS is used on Linux because threads are processes.  If that's not true, maybe it accounts for unexpectedly setting the priority of the whole app.    // threads are processes on linux, so PRIO_PROCESS affects just the one thread    setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, getpid(), nPriority); sirius-m debugged this, it was 64-bit related.  The fix is now available on SVN, file util.cpp. When there's enough scale, maybe there can be an exchange site that doesn't do transfers, just matches up buyers and sellers to exchange with each other directly, similar to how e-bay works.To make it safer, the exchange site could act as an escrow for the bitcoin side of the payment.  The seller puts the bitcoin payment in escrow, and the buyer sends the conventional payment directly to the seller.  The exchange service doesn't handle any real world money.This would be a step better than e-bay.  E-bay manages to work fine even though shipped goods can't be recovered if payment falls through. We have the standard icon sizes, and the full size scales nicely to anything else.I added the full size to the first post. In the Windows world, "unicode" means UTF-16 (wchar).2.8 has two build variations, ANSI and UTF-16 (unicode).  The UTF-16 version is the "unicode" version provided in the Debian package.  I believe 2.8 and its UTF-16 build labelled simply "unicode" has been the source of build problems described in the forum.  We were previously using 2.8 ANSI in anticipation of getting to UTF-8 without going through UTF-16 hell.  We cannot compile with UTF-16.2.9 has only one version, UTF-8.  On Windows, we set the codepage to UTF-8, so on all platforms our code is UTF-8 and wxWidgets interfaces with us in UTF-8.  On Linux I assume the codepage is already UTF-8.  By standardizing on 2.9 we avoid the multi-build confusion of 2.8, and we need 2.9 for UTF-8 internationalization.Make sure you read build-unix.txt and configure wxWidgets using the configure parameters given.Curious, why is it incredibly hard to provide wxWidgets 2.9.0?  If you mean for users, that's why we static link it.It's unfortunate that we require so many big dependencies, but we need them all.  At least on Debian/Ubuntu, all but wxWidgets are available as packages.  Eventually they'll provide a 2.9 package. I don't know how to do SVG, but I did the original very large, over 500 pixels across, so it can be scaled down.  I'll give the original when I'm finished.I had to custom tweak each icon size so the vertical lines land square on their pixels, otherwise they're ugly blurry and inconsistent.  Such is the challenge of making icons.  The original will be good for scaling to custom sizes between 48 and 500 but not smaller. Are you using wxWidgets 2.9.0?  I don't recommend using anything other than 2.9.0.It looks like they've got a reference in the wx headers (arrstr.h) to something outside of wxBase.Removing -D__WXDEBUG__ from bitcoin's makefile would probably solve it.If that doesn't work and you just want to get it working, you could edit wxWidgets include/wx/arrstr.h, line 167 and comment out the wxASSERT_MSG.
Good suggestion.  I made the B slightly lighter and the background slightly darker.  Very slightly.  The foreground is now exactly the same colour as the BC in the old one.It's kind of OK if you can't easily read the B in the 16x16.  At that size, you just need to see that it's a coin.  It doesn't matter so much what's embossed on it, just that there be some detail there because it wouldn't look like a coin if it was a blank smooth circle.It's slightly wider than tall because the dark perspective under it goes more to the right than down.I finished and posted the 32x31 and 48x47 versions in the first message.  I like the 48 a lot.How does everyone feel about the B symbol with the two lines through the outside?  Can we live with that as our logo? wx/clipbrd.h isn't used, move it inside the #if wxUSE_GUI.Updated headers.h on SVN.Sorry, I linked to wxbase but I had full wxWidgets on my computer.The db.h:140 class Db no member named "exisits" is stranger.  pdb->get, pdb->put, pdb->del compiled before that.  Do you have version 4.7.25 of Berkeley DB?Db::exists()http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/api_reference/CXX/frame_main.htmlhttp://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/api_reference/CXX/dbexists.htmlI suppose they might have added exists recently, using get before that. The formula is based on the time it takes to generate 2016 blocks.  The difficulty is multiplied by 14/(actual days taken).  For instance, this time it took 9.4 days, so the calculation was 14/9.4 = 1.49.  Previous difficulty 2.53 * 1.49 = 3.78, a 49% increase. I don't know what you're talking about accepting easier difficulties. OK, I made a build target bitcoind that only links wxBase and does not link GTK.  Version 0.2.7 on SVN.I split out the init and shutdown stuff from ui.cpp into init.cpp, so now ui.cpp is pure UI.  ui.h provides inline stubs if wxUSE_GUI=0.  We only have four functions that interface from the node to the UI.  In the bitcoind build, we don't link ui.o or uibase.o.Sure feels like it could be something in wxWidgets retrying endlessly because some UI thing failed or something wasn't inited correctly.  Our hack to ignore the initialize failure and run anyway means we're in uncharted territory.  We're relying on the fact that we hardly use wx in this mode.  We do still use a few things like wxGetTranslation and wxMutex.Another way to debug would be to run in gdb, wait until everything is quiet and all threads should be idle, and break it and see which thread is busily doing something and what it's doing.I suspect bitcoind will probably work fine, but I hope you can still debug the problem. Yes, the original is 546x531 pixels.It looks good at larger size too, but since the small icons are what you mostly always see, I wanted to judge it on those first.  I'll post larger sizes and full size a little later. The automatic adjustment happened earlier today.24/02/2010 0000000043b3e50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000024/02/2010  3.78  +49%I updated the first post. When and how fast did memory usage increase?  Right away, slowly over a long time, or starting at some later event?I have -daemon running on ubuntu 9.10 64-bit and memory usage is steady.It has to be something about the difference on the server besides 64-bit.  Maybe some malfunction from the lack of GUI.  A memory leak debug tool could give a clue.  If you GPL stuff, I have to avoid using it.  Nothing against GPL per-se, but Bitcoin is an MIT license project.  Anything GPL please clearly mark it as such. New icons, what do you think?  Better than the old one?      Full size 530x529 image for scaling down to custom sizes:http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin530.pngThe perspective shadow was too thick on the larger sizes.  I updated 32, 48 and the full size.I release these images into the public domain (copyright-free).  I request that derivative works be made public domain. How much "dealing with" does GTK actually require?  Is it just a matter of "sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0" and having some extra libraries sitting around?  GTK doesn't have to do anything, just be there for bitcoin to link to when it loads up, have the gtk-init-check call fail because no GUI present, then it's done.  It saves us butchering everything with ifdefs and a separate compile and binary to use wxBase just to try to avoid linking GTK. That would be nice at point-of-sale.  The cash register displays a QR-code encoding a bitcoin address and amount on a screen and you photo it with your mobile. No, each generated transaction uses a new, single-use address.Nothing uses the address in the main window, it's just there for convenience for you to copy.  0.2.5 has a "New..." button next to it to make it easy to change each time you use it. Version 0.2.6 on SVN can now run as a daemon and be controlled by command line or JSON-RPC.On Linux it needs libgtk2.0-0 installed, but does not need a GUI running.  Hopefully gtk can be installed without having a windowing system installed.The command to start as a daemon is:bitcoin -daemon [switches...]Or, to run the UI normally and also be able to control it from command line or JSON-RPC, use the "-server" switch.bitcoin -server [switches...]With either switch, it runs an HTTP JSON-RPC server that accepts local socket connections on 127.0.0.1:8332.  The port is bound to loopback and can only be accessed from the local machine, but from any account, not just the user it's running under.To control it from the command line, the interface is a command name without any switches, followed by parameters if any.bitcoin <command> [params...]For example:bitcoin getinfobitcoin getdifficultybitcoin setgenerate truebitcoin stopIt's a simple JSON-RPC client and prints the JSON result.  Look at rpc.cpp for the list of commands.Web apps or anything automated will normally use JSON-RPC directly, not command line.  There are JSON-RPC libraries for all the major languages.  In script languages like PHP and Python the syntax is as natural as calling a local function. Ah yes, there we go, back to normal again.The ctrl+alt+F[1-8] thing never worked on this computer.  The screen just goes haywire. There's a separate public/private keypair for every bitcoin address.  You don't have a single private key that unlocks everything.  Bitcoin addresses are a 160-bit hash of the public key, everything else in the system is 256-bit.If there was a collision, the collider could spend any money sent to that address.  Just money sent to that address, not the whole wallet.If you were to intentionally try to make a collision, it would currently take 2^126 times longer to generate a colliding bitcoin address than to generate a block.  You could have got a lot more money by generating blocks.The random seed is very thorough.  On Windows, it uses all the performance monitor data that measures every bit of disk performance, network card metrics, cpu time, paging etc. since your computer started.  Linux has a built-in entropy collector.  Adding to that, every time you move your mouse inside the Bitcoin window you're generating entropy, and entropy is captured from the timing of disk ops. There are now "Sending" and "Receiving" tabs in the Address Book.  Your addresses are referred to as "receiving addresses".madhatter was working on building it on Mac.  He had errors probably caused by UTF-16 wxWidgets 2.8.  Should have better luck now with 2.9.0.  wxWidgets 2.9.0 is UTF-8 and wouldn't have that problem.I think he had it working on FreeBSD, but he wanted a non-UI version.I have the command line and JSON-RPC daemon version working now.  Will SVN it in a day or two.I disabled gdm on my Ubuntu system so it boots into command line.  I hope I will be able to get it enabled again with rcconf. Just a random streak of bad luck.  It looks steady to me.Competition doesn't have an effect until the next automatic retarget adjustment, and we haven't reached the next one yet.The adjustments are every 2016 blocks.  To calculate our progress towards the next one, divide the block total by 2016.  The fractional part is how far we are to the next one.  My back-of-the-envelope projection: 42032 blocks/2016 = 20.85 = 85% of the way.  About 1.5 days to go until the next one.  That'll only be about 10 days since the last one, the target is 14 days, so 14/10 = 1.4 = around 40% difficulty increase. Uploaded some UI changes to SVN as version 0.2.5.Instead of View->Show Generated, we now have tabs:- All Transactions- Sent/Received- Sent- ReceivedMakes it a lot easier to flip to received and check for payments.Moved the "Your Addresses" book inside the main address book.  It was confusing having two address books.I found the "To:" in "From: unknown, To: (one of your bitcoin addresses)" still confusing, so I changed it to "From: unknown, Received with:".  The bitcoin address is abbreviated so you can see the label that you set in the Receiving tab of the address book.Fixed a few UI glitches from the upgrade to wxWidgets 2.9.0.I haven't forgotten about you people who want non-UI, but I had to do some fun stuff before more build bashing. Excellent analysis, xc.A rational market price for something that is expected to increase in value will already reflect the present value of the expected future increases.  In your head, you do a probability estimate balancing the odds that it keeps increasing.In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandard's estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service (thanks).  The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost.  If the price is below cost, then production slows down.  If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more.  At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around.At the moment, generation effort is rapidly increasing, suggesting people are estimating the present value to be higher than the current cost of production. It would be nice to have a list of static IPs for new users to send test donations to so they can see how the software works.  If you can accept incoming connections and you have a static IP address, post it here!Anything sent to these IPs should be considered a donation.  If you do request a round-trip, be sure to include your return bitcoin address or IP in the comment, but please assume it'll be one-way.  They won't necessarily be watching for incoming transactions to send back.
Nodes stop trying to initiate connections once they have 15.  If you can accept incoming connections, then you can get well above that from nodes connecting to you, otherwise you max out at 15.I don't know if there's any reason to have 15 connections.  Maybe it should be 10.Since nodes that can only connect out are probably at or near 15 most of the time now, you should level off to an equilibrium.  45 suggests a ratio of 3 out-only nodes to every 1 in-accepting node.The number of connections won't be a good gauge of the size of the network any more.  Someone should periodically IRC to the bitcoin channel on chat.freenode.net and count the number of users.  That gives you the total count of network nodes (except TOR nodes).Block generation is again running ahead of pace.  We're in for another big step up in difficulty at the next adjustment in about 5 days. I updated the SVN with changes to support translation.  Translatable strings are all enclosed in _(""), and we're using UTF-8 on all platforms.When the program runs, it looks in the directory of the EXE for the file: locale\<langcode>\LC_MESSAGES\bitcoin.mo<langcode> is the two letter code of the language your OS is set to, like "de" or "nl".On Linux, it also looks for:/usr/share/locale/<langcode>/LC_MESSAGES/bitcoin.mo/usr/local/share/locale/<langcode>/LC_MESSAGES/bitcoin.mo(are there other standard places it should look on linux?)Here's a quick walkthrough using poedit to make a .po and .mo file:- Download the bitcoin sourcecode from SVN- In the trunk directory, mkdir locale\<lang>\LC_MESSAGES- In poedit, File->New catalog->Paths tab- Click the "New item" dotted rectangle button- Put "../../.." and MAKE SURE TO PRESS ENTER to add the path- Click OK- Save the file as "bitcoin.po" in the LC_MESSAGES directory you made- It should then scan the sourcecode and find about 170 strings- If it didn't find anything, check Catalog->Settings->Path tab, make sure the "../../.." was addedWhen you're done translating, commit both bitcoin.po (the editable catalog file) and bitcoin.mo (compiled data used by the program). 2 seconds of latency in both directions should reduce your generation success by less than 1%.Probably OK, but I'm not sure.  The protocol is designed to resync to the next message, and messages get re-requested from all the other nodes you're connected to until received.  If you miss a block, it'll also keep requesting it every time another blocks comes in and it sees there's a gap.  Before the original release I did a test dropping 1 out of 4 random messages under heavy load until I could run it overnight without any nodes getting stuck. I thought about that but there wasn't a practical way to do smaller increments.  The frequency of block generation is balanced between confirming transactions as fast as possible and the latency of the network.The algorithm aims for an average of 6 blocks per hour.  If it was 5 bc and 60 per hour, there would be 10 times as many blocks and the initial block download would take 10 times as long.  It wouldn't work anyway because that would be only 1 minute average between blocks, too close to the broadcast latency when the network gets larger. Right now there isn't a port number setting to do that.  It's a feature yet to be implemented.  You can only set up your NAT to port-forward to one of the computers.  (I said something earlier about NAT port translation, but that wouldn't work, other nodes wouldn't know to connect to that port)If you want, as a small optimization, you could run the rest of your computers as:bitcoin -connect=<the IP of the first computer>so they get all their network communication from the first computer and don't all connect over the net individually for the same information.  This saves bandwidth, although it doesn't use much bandwidth to begin with, so it wouldn't really matter unless you had tons of computers.For redundancy in case the first computer goes down, you could have two that connect out and the rest connect to both of them.  The first two are run normally, the rest are run like:bitcoin -connect=<IP1> -connect=<IP2> 14/02/2010 00000000654657000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002009        1.0030/12/2009  1.18   +18%11/01/2010  1.31   +11%25/01/2010  1.34    +2%04/02/2010  1.82   +36%14/02/2010  2.53   +39%Another big jump in difficulty yesterday from 1.82 times to 2.53 times, a 39% increase since 10 days ago.  It was 10 days apart not 14 because more nodes joined and generated the 2016 blocks in less time. Right.  Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating.  In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.  I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume. Yes.Almost all transactions are free.  A transaction is over the maximum size limit if it has to add up more than 500 of the largest payments you've received to make up the amount.  A transaction over the size limit can still be sent if a small fee is added.The average transaction, and anything up to 500 times bigger than average, is free.It's only when you're sending a really huge transaction that the transaction fee ever comes into play, and even then it only works out to something like 0.002% of the amount.  It's not money sucked out of the system, it just goes to other nodes.  If you're sad about paying the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself. I couldn't get wxWidgets 2.8.9 to compile on Karmic 64-bit either.I have been compiling the latest SVN on Karmic 64-bit with wxWidgets 2.9.0, which compiles fine on 64-bit.  Read build-unix.txt and use the given ../configure parameters on wxWidgets so you can use the makefile.unix.wx2.9 as supplied.  (--enable-debug --disable-shared --enable-monolithic)There's one cosmetic bug with 2.9.0 I still need to fix where the status number display is bunched up for some reason.  -- fixedThe download link on the homepage is to the sourceforge tar.gz archive which contains the 32-bit binary and the 0.2.0 sources, which were not yet buildable on 64-bit at the time.The SVN was first buildable on 64-bit with wx2.9.0 on 28 January 2010.Hopefully they'll have a wxWidgets 2.9.0 debian package someday. True, sending by IP through Tor trades one problem for another.  The Tor exit node can see the text of your message and potentially MITM you.Best to only send to bitcoin addresses then.  Payments by bitcoin address are broadcast over the network as part of the normal network traffic.  All communications with the network are broadcasts of public information. Am I missing something?  Is there something wrong with the 32-bit linux precompiled binary on bitcoin.org?The bitcoin binary in the distribution static links the wxWidgets library, and its shared links (openssl and GTK) are included in Ubuntu, so it can run without needing to be a .deb to pull down dependencies.Since we're upgrading to wxWidgets 2.9.0 for UTF-8, which doesn't have a DEB package yet, we'll continue to need to static link it. There's a small transaction fee for very large transactions.  The node that generates the block that contains the transaction gets the fee.If the same money gets sent again, it won't incur the fee again.  If all you have is generated coins in your wallet, if you send them all in one huge transaction, it has to bundle hundreds of 50 bc coins together.  After that it's just one line to send the combined unit. Are you just trying to run the program or do you really need to compile it?  There's a 32-bit linux binary that can be run on 64-bit ubuntu if you "sudo apt-get ia32-libs".http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.2.0-linux.tar.gz/downloadI recently updated the SVN for building on 64-bit Karmic with wxWidgets 2.9.0.  This was after the 0.2.0 release.  The 0.2.0 release did not build on 64-bit yet.Unfortunately there currently isn't a -dev deb package of either of the versions of wxWidgets that we can use.  On Karmic they only have the UTF-16 version.  We need either the ANSI (libwxgtk2.8-ansi-dev) version or the UTF-8 (wxWidgets 2.9.0) version.  We're moving towards 2.9.0.I know you said you didn't want VM, but as a last resort, last I checked the Windows version runs fine in Wine. There are command line options:bitcoin -addnode=1.2.3.4    to tell bitcoin about a node to connect tobitcoin -connect=1.2.3.4    connect only to the specified node(s)You can use more than one of these, for instancebitcoin -connect=(first to try) -connect=(next to try) ...You can specify non-routable IPs with -connect like 192.168.x.x, so if you had a server farm and you wanted one server to connect to the world and the rest to connect to the one server, you could do that.In particular, -addnode is needed if you're always going to connect through TOR, since the IRC server blocks all the TOR exit nodes.  To connect through TOR, you could use:bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=212.159.72.216 It's much easier to have a single binary and multiple .mo files.  It's too much maintenance work to have lots of build variations.  Once the software support is implemented, anyone could contribute translations.wxWidgets uses the gettext standard.  You use the gettext tools or something like poedit to create a .po file by scanning the sourcefiles for strings and editing the translations into the .po file, then compile it into a .mo file.  The program loads the .mo file at runtime and reskins all the strings.  Additional languages can be added to an existing program by adding .mo files without recompiling the program.On Windows, the .mo files would go in a lang subdirectory in the directory where the EXE is located.Right now I'm working on JSON-RPC and command line support, but when I'm finished with that I hope to do this next. Thank you for the offer to help translate.  That is probably the best way you could help.I will need to prepare the code for translation first.  wxWidgets has locale support, and most strings are in generated code that is already wrapped, so it shouldn't be too hard.  We also must finish upgrading to wxWidgets-2.9.0 to get UTF-8 support.  I've done test builds with 2.9.0 and there is one bug left to fix. What operating system are you using?  Windows, Linux 32-bit or 64 bit?Split from another thread.sirius-m No, sorry.  I've been meaning to redo it.  The largest icon that still looks good is the 20x20 one which is used for the tray icon in GNOME.  Any larger than that looks bad.  The 16x16 and 20x20 ones have quite a bit of hand tweaking to get the pixels to work out right.  If you just scale down a larger image, the pixels end up blurred and awkward in places where the lines in "BC" don't land square on a pixel.The best 16x16 with full alpha channel is in src/rc/bitcoin.ico.  I don't like the 32x32 version.I'm attaching bitcoin20x20.png, the 20x20 version with full transparency. Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge.But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally.  It shows 1.00 but internally it's 1.00000000.  If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places.If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point.  Same amount of money, just different convention for where the ","'s and "."'s go.  e.g. moving the decimal place 3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00. When you send to a bitcoin address, you don't connect to the recipient.  You send the transaction to the network the same way you relay transactions.  There's no distinction between a transaction you originated and one you received from another node that you're relaying in a broadcast.  With a very small network though, someone might still figure it out by process of elimination.  It'll be better when the network is larger.If you send by IP, the recipient sees you because you connect to their IP.  You could use TOR to mask that.You could use TOR if you don't want anyone to know you're even using Bitcoin.Bitcoin is still very new and has not been independently analysed.  If you're serious about privacy, TOR is an advisable precaution. That's not possible.  You've handed control of the money over to the recipient's keypair.  Only that key can control it.It's similar to if you encrypt a file with AES and a strong password, and you lose the password.  The data is lost.
We had our first automatic adjustment of the proof-of-work difficulty on 30 Dec 2009.  The minimum difficulty is 32 zero bits, so even if only one person was running a node, the difficulty doesn't get any easier than that.  For most of last year, we were hovering below the minimum.  On 30 Dec we broke above it and the algorithm adjusted to more difficulty.  It's been getting more difficult at each adjustment since then.The adjustment on 04 Feb took it up from 1.34 times last year's difficulty to 1.82 times more difficult than last year.  That means you generate only 55% as many coins for the same amount of work.The difficulty adjusts proportionally to the total effort across the network.  If the number of nodes doubles, the difficulty will also double, returning the total generated to the target rate.For those technically inclined, the proof-of-work difficulty can be seen by searching on "target:" in debug.log.  It's a 256-bit unsigned hex number, which the SHA-256 value has to be less than to successfully generate a block.  It gets adjusted every 2016 blocks, typically two weeks.  That's when it prints "GetNextWorkRequired RETARGET" in debug.log. minimum    00000000ffff000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000030/12/2009 00000000d86a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011/01/2010 00000000c428000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000025/01/2010 00000000be71000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004/02/2010 000000008cc3000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014/02/2010 000000006546570000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000024/02/2010 0000000043b3e50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008/03/2010 00000000387f6f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021/03/2010 000000003813750000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001/04/2010 000000002a11150000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012/04/2010 0000000020bca70000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021/04/2010 0000000016546f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004/05/2010 0000000013ec530000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000019/05/2010 00000000159c240000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000029/05/2010 000000000f675c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011/06/2010 000000000eba640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000024/06/2010 000000000d31420000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006/07/2010 000000000ae4930000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000013/07/2010 0000000005a3f40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000016/07/2010 000000000168fd0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000027/07/2010 00000000010c5a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005/08/2010 0000000000ba180000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015/08/2010 0000000000800e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000026/08/2010 0000000000692000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000date, difficulty factor, % change2009           1.0030/12/2009     1.18   +18%11/01/2010     1.31   +11%25/01/2010     1.34    +2%04/02/2010     1.82   +36%14/02/2010     2.53   +39%24/02/2010     3.78   +49%08/03/2010     4.53   +20%21/03/2010     4.57    +9%01/04/2010     6.09   +33%12/04/2010     7.82   +28%21/04/2010    11.46   +47%04/05/2010    12.85   +12%19/05/2010    11.85    -8%29/05/2010    16.62   +40%11/06/2010    17.38    +5%24/06/2010    19.41   +12%06/07/2010    23.50   +21%13/07/2010    45.38   +93%16/07/2010   181.54  +300%27/07/2010   244.21   +35%05/08/2010   352.17   +44%15/08/2010   511.77   +45%26/08/2010   623.39   +22% When using proxy port 9050, it will only make one attempt to connect to IRC, then give up, since it knows it will probably always fail because IRC servers ban all the TOR exit nodes.  If you're using another port, it would assume it might be a regular old normal proxy and would keep retrying IRC at longer and longer intervals.  You should not use Polipo or Privoxy as those are http filters and caches that would corrupt Bitcoin's messages if they make any changes.  Bitcoin might be trying to overcome it by reconnecting.  You should use port 9050.As riX says, the "is giving Tor only an IP address. Apps that do DNS..." warnings are nothing to worry about.  Bitcoin doesn't use DNS at all in proxy mode.Since Bitcoin can't get through to IRC through Tor, it doesn't know which nodes are currently online, so it has to try all the recently seen nodes.  It tries to conserve connection attempts as much as possible, but also people want it to connect quickly when they start it up and reconnect quickly if disconnected.  It uses an algorithm where it tries an IP less and less frequently the longer ago it was successful connected.  For example, for a node it saw 24 hours ago, it would wait 5 hours between connection attempts.  Once it has at least 2 connections, it won't try anything over a week old, and 5 connections it won't try anything over 24 hours old. Port forwarding forwards a port to one computer.  It tells the router which computer handles connections to that port.  So that's the computer receiving.If you didn't set up port forwarding, then incoming connections won't go to any computer, and attempts to send to that IP would just say it couldn't connect to the recipient and nothing is sent.  When sending by IP, you still send to a bitcoin address, but your computer connects to that IP, gets a new bitcoin address from it, gives the transaction directly to the them and confirms that it was received and accepted.Someone should post their static IP so people can try out sending by IP and also give that user free money.There's a 32-bit checksum in bitcoin addresses so you can't accidentally type an invalid address.If 4) you send to a recipient who has abandoned or lost their wallet.dat, then the money is lost.  A subtle point can be made that since there is then less total money in circulation, everyone's remaining money is worth slightly more, aka "natural deflation". Thanks for that.  Which version of Windows? I uploaded this fix to the SVN.  It watches for spent coins and updates your wallet on load and also continuously as blocks come in.  I also put a better error message, but it should never hit it because it always finds spent coins ahead of time, unless you spent the same money at the same time on two computers at once.If you want to try it, PM or e-mail me your e-mail address where I can send it as an attachment and also what OS (win, linux 32-bit, linux 64-bit). I committed a fix for 64-bit compile and some fixes to support wxWidgets 2.9.0.There was one compile error in serialize.h with min(sizeof()) that I fixed for 64-bit.  The rest of the 64-bit compile errors I was getting were in wxWidgets 2.8.9, so I started working on supporting wxWidgets 2.9.0.wxWidgets 2.9.0 is UTF-8.  We've been using the ANSI version of wxWidgets 2.8.9 in anticipation of wxWidgets UTF-8 support.I compiled and ran on 64-bit Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic.I think the only bug left is where the status number is mashed up.  I'm not sure why, I have to suspect it's a UTF-8 thing, but no idea how that could happen.  Haven't looked into it.build-unix.txt is updated and two makefiles on SVN:makefile.unix.wx2.8makefile.unix.wx2.9Unfortunately there's still no debian package for either version of wxWidgets we use.  They only have the wchar ("unicode") version of wxWidgets 2.8, which is a disaster because wchar wxString doesn't convert to std::string.  We use either ANSI wxWidgets 2.8, or wxWidgets 2.9.  So you still have to get it and build it yourself. The recommended ways to do a payment for an order:1) The merchant has a static IP, the customer sends to it with a comment.2) The merchant creates a new bitcoin address, gives it to the customer, the customer sends to that address.  This will be the standard way for website software to do it.RSA vs ECDSA: it's not the size of the executable but the size of the data.  I thought it would be impractical if the block chain, bitcoin addresses, disk space and bandwidth requirements were all an order of magnitude bigger.  Also, even if using RSA for messages, it would still make sense to do all the bitcoin network with ECDSA and use RSA in parallel for only the message part.  In that case, everything that's been implemented up to now would be implemented exactly as it has been.We can figure out the best way to do this much later.  It could use a separate (maybe existing) e-mail or IM infrastructure to pass messages, and instead of RSA, maybe just put a hash of the message in the transaction to prove that the transaction is for the order described in the message.  The message would have to include a salt so nobody could brute force the hash to reveal a short message. That's the right way to do it as riX says.  The software can generate a new bitcoin address whenever you need one for each payment.  "Please send X bc to [single-use bitcoin address] to complete your order"  When the server receives that amount to the bitcoin address, that could trigger it to automatically fulfil the order or e-mail the shop owner.Adding command line support is a high priority.  It's just a matter of getting the time to code it. The resync idea would go through your wallet and check it against the block index to find any transactions that your current computer doesn't realize are already spent.  That could happen if they were spent on another computer with a copy of the wallet file, or you had to restore the wallet to a backup from before they were spent.  Currently, the software just assumes it always knows whether its transactions are spent because it marks them spent in wallet.dat when it spends them.A wallet merge tool is possible to implement but much less in demand once resync solves most of the problem.  With resync, you could do about the same thing by sending all the money from one wallet to the other.  The receiver would resync and discover all its overlapping coins were spent, then receive them in the new transaction. Where it says "# blocks" in the status column I'm changing it to say "# confirmations".  That might be clearer.If you doubleclick on the transaction you get a little more information. Yes, it's a technical limitation.  Sending by bitcoin address enters the transaction into the network and the recipient discovers it from the network.  You don't connect directly with them and they don't have to be online at the time.I very much wanted to find some way to include a short message, but the problem is, the whole world would be able to see the message.  As much as you may keep reminding people that the message is completely non-private, it would be an accident waiting to happen.Unfortunately, ECDSA can only sign signatures, it can't encrypt messages, and we need the small size of ECDSA.  RSA can encrypt messages, but it's many times bigger than ECDSA. That is what happens if you copy wallet files around.  If you copy your wallet file to a second computer, then they both think the money in the wallet is theirs.  If one spends any of it, the other doesn't know those coins are already spent and would try to spend them again, and that's the error you would hit.Now that it's clear this is a key error message, it ought to be something more like "the money appears to be already spent...  this could happen if you used a copy of your wallet file on another computer." You can move or backup your wallet file, but it needs to have only one "lineage" and only used in one place at a time.  Any time you transfer money out of it, then you must no longer use any previous copies.This brings up a good point.  In the case of restoring a backup that may be from before you spent some coins, we need to add functionality to resync it to discover which coins have already been spent.  This would not be hard to do, it just hasn't been implemented yet.  I'll add it to the list.  This would make it mostly repair the situation instead of giving that error message. I've been thinking about that for a while.  I want to add the backend support for .onion addresses and connecting to them, then go from there.There aren't many .onion addresses in use for anything because the user has to go through a number of steps to create one.  Configure TOR to generate a .onion address, restart TOR, configure it with the generated address.  Perhaps this is intentional to keep TOR so it can't be integrated into file sharing programs in any sufficiently automated way. Coins generate at the same speed with any number of connections >= 1.More connections just add redundancy.  If you only had one connection, what if that node is slow or busy, or only connected to you?  Having several connections increases the certainty that you're well connected to the network.  That hasn't been a problem in practice, the network is very thoroughly connected.  If you have 2 or 3 connections, you're fine. I haven't tried compiling 64-bit yet. 64-bit wouldn't make it any faster, since it uses 64-bit numbers in only a few places and SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm, but it may be convenient for those running a 64-bit OS. If I get a chance I'll try -m64 and see what the problem is.You can run the 32-bit version on 64-bit Linux by installing ia32-libs.  (sudo apt-get install ia32-libs)  If we made a Debian package, it could automatically pull that in as a dependency. The transfer is immediate if you send by IP address.  If you send by bitcoin address and the recipient isn't online at the time, it might take 30 minutes or more to see it.  Also, the recipient needs to be synced up with the block chain before it'll see the received transaction.  That means the status bar at the bottom needs to say at least 33000 blocks, like "x connections  33200 blocks  x transactions".Would it be clearer if the status said "x confirmations", like:2/unconfirmed3/unconfirmed4/unconfirmed5/unconfirmed6 confirmations7 confirmations8 confirmationsEach block essentially means another node has confirmed that it agrees with all transactions up to that point. What you can currently do is set "Minimize to the tray" in options, then run it as "bitcoin -min" so it starts minimized.  The only visible part will be a small (20x20) icon on the tray, which can be doubleclicked if you want to access the UI.  Note: there's a bug with tray icons sometimes disappearing on 64-bit Karmic Koala, not sure if it's from 64-bit or Karmic, it was fine on 32-bit Jaunty.We didn't have time to implement the "Start Bitcoin on system startup" feature on Linux in time for 0.2 so it's greyed out.  I figured Linux people wouldn't mind doing that manually anyway.  I guess they need to know about the -min switch to do it right.You can locate the data directory where you want with the "-datadir=<directory>" switch.  I know someone is already doing that to put it on a TrueCrypt USB drive. That's good, is it running fine on FreeBSD?I committed the changes to headers.h.  For consistency, I used __BSD__.  The complete list of defines is at http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_cppconst.html#ifdef __BSD__#include <netinet/in.h>#endifmalloc.h is only needed on windows, I'll move that into the __WXMSW__ section before it causes any more trouble.

Then it must be something you're doing differently with building or configuring wxWidgets.What options did you use on the wxWidgets "configure" script?  The options I used are in build-unix.txt.Never heard of that happening.  Is there anything in debug.log?  If you touched the file, that sounds like something is there.  Does the program have write access to the file?
