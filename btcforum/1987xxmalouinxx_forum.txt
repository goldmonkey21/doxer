Thanks =) I know I already said it, but I LOVE your analyze S3052, keep the good work =)Malouin Like BitLex told, I think it's the getwork-patch. Just replace the old bitcoin.exe by the one from the getwork and it should work. Enjoy your Bitcoin !Malouin Good work nanotube ! This chan got a lot of actives peoples, and some good buy and sell order. I like the idea you had to make this ! Easy to understand.I did some great deal on it :p wow this is amazing, good job mate =) Hehe, it remember me when rumor has that Pirate Bay wanted to buy Sealand =) Pour l'instant pour ma part, je les vend contre du PPUSD. Mon dernier trade a été avec theymos, 1000 BTC pour 135USD. Tout c'est bien passé. La semaine prochaine, je grossis mon serveur, et la génération sera encore plus grande  J'ai hâte de voir ce que l'avenir des bitcoin nous réserve...Malouin Members. We are now at 1002 =D Good job community  Hey Bitlex !I'm happy to see that everything's going well on your side =) I'm presently at 650-660mhash/s with my radeon 5970Setting : 900mhz/1000 memory clock/ vcore to 1.15v / Temps : 78c, with 100% fan on. I use this command : --user=***** --pass=***** -f 35 -w 128You should try to add the -f 35 -w 128 and see how many % you gain. I gained around 20-30mhash with that.Malouin What is your current rate for Bit - LR ? Bonjour messieurs !Bien heureux de voir d'autre francophone sur ce beau forum ! J'ai personellement découvert bitcoin par un collègue de travail, et de fil en aiguille, découvert le GPU client. Ce projet m'intéresse fortement =) Au plaisir de ce reparler !MalouinP-S Québec ici  Nop, my bitcoin client don't generate from CPU. bethel : -f 35 and -w 128 . I don't have any rate or askrate variable.da2ce7 : If you started to generate before having all the block downloaded, then the block you found isn't valid. Restart your client and start to generate once you got all the block. This happened to me too, david explained it to me pretty well =)Malouin Davout : Yea it should work without any problem on linux. ArtForz actually use that.Fergalish : the Nvidia GT240 got 385 Gflops, the radeon 5970 got 4640. If we base it on the fact that the 5970 got 230 000khash/s per core without being OC, it should be around 20 000 khash/s yes.Malouin Good question, because officially, bitcoin is in "beta development stage". Update :Here's a screenshot of my last setting 640mhash/s - radeon 5970 870mhz/1305mhz - temp : 83cPresently it run fine, but i'm not sure it gonna be stable, gonna update here if I have any news.Malouin Windows 7 Ultimate / ATI SDK 2.2 for Win7 64 / Catalyst 10.7I got a radeon 5970, so I don't have 2 cards, but 2 hearts on it. Art got 4 cards on 1 motherboard doing this, I'm gonna ask him when I see him.Malouin hehehe thanks guys =PI was speaking with Art on irc today, and my next step will be to OC my 5970 from 800 to 910mhz. I should reach the 320mhash/s on each heart, which mean a big total of 640mhash/s.I restarted my client at 15h30 EAST time, and will stop it tomorrow at the same time. It gonna give me some data to work on. After that, i'm going to OC it at 910mhz and see the result and report here with some screenshots.Malouin
