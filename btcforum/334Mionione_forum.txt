that's what it is supposed to do, but it doesn't always do it, issues are on gcc bugzillahttp://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43798http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16660http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40838 care with __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) , it doesn't work with local variable, gcc doesn't align the stack md5 is evil, two differents files can have the same md5 checksum (http://www.coresecurity.com/content/md5-harmful)but unfortunately people still use it ;( md5 checksums are still widely used but not secure what would be the bandwidth needed per peer if there was 100 000 transactions between each block generation please?a block is generated every ~10min, so all peers must get the 100 000 transactions in less than 10minutes ?if each transaction is ~1ko, that mean 100Mo every 10min, ~165ko/s ? isn't it a bit much ? what happen if millions of transactions occurs during the block generation, would be block size huge ? so the fee must be the same for all nodes isn't it ?do the nodes reject other nodes that doesn't apply the same fee?if not, there is no way to wait/find a node that apply a lower fee? if i send many 0.00000001 BC using a friend node that take no fee (or that send fee back to me).Will the friend node spead all the transactions over the network? First time i launched bitcoin i couldn't receive anything and hard drive ran intensively for hours.I thinked it was buggy but it's not, bitcoin have to get all the known blocks (around 65500 for the moment).So if you have the same "problem" don't worry all is ok, you just have to wait. hi, what would happen if someone sends millions of 0.00000001 BC to millions of address please ?=> all of the networks peers must store all transactions ?=> are each 0.00000001 owner/hash stocked in blocks on all peers?i don't really understand how bitcoin handle fractions of bc
