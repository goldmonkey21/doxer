I read in another thread that it might be fixed by redownloading the block chain. I'm trying that now and I'll let you all know how it goes. Otherwise, I may have to try the key import/export patch and start a new wallet as you suggested. Thanks again. JoelKats,Thanks for the quick response. My client has 136504 blocks right now and I've got that payment address in my wallet. I tried starting bitcoin with the -rescan option and it took a little longer than normal to start the client but I still do not see any of the missing payments showing up. Any other ideas?Thanks! Hey all,I'm having a problem that I've never seen before. I do some mining for a couple pools and have setup receiving addresses for each pool so I can keep track of which pools my payments are coming from in my client. Some of the addresses work fine and I receive payments without any issues. Others have had payments sent to them and they never show up in my client. Here is a block explorer link to one of the broken addresses:http://blockexplorer.com/address/1NYoULkNL9KNia5knJAPfiFaxfWMBBS1XsI have downloaded the full block chain and as I mentioned earlier, other addresses are working fine and receiving payments. Could this mean that my wallet.dat is corrupted or my block chain is corrupted or something? Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to lose that money that is out there someplace and tied to my address.Thanks!
