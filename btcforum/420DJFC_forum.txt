Thanks for the input everybody.  I've retained a lawyer in Tokyo, and am trying to get a hold of anybody at Mt. Gox simultaneously. Seeking, yes. I have signed the addresses.I accidentally used the wrong address because this address was on top alphabetically from all the addresses I had ever sent to, I accidentally copied this address instead of my own address. Well it happened and I'm sorry.Is there any tech contact at Mt. Gox these days? Before I engage the lawyer, is there a way to confirm that this definitely was a Mt. Gox address... I was never able to verify that myself. Hi,That's me. Any help is appreciated, and I will be generous with rewards.-DJFC I own bitcoinbank.comIt's for sale.  Accepting bids.  I accept bitcoins ;-) I will sell bitcoinbank.com if anybody is interested.
