Thank you for your PM and all the hard work you've done!I'm glad to see there's still a lot going on.I'll keep my funds @bitoption...  Hi,I would like to withdraw my funds because I don't think there's any progress being made on the bitoption site lately...How can I withdraw dollars?(I can't exchange those for BTC, because that's not working...)When I withdraw BTC it says: "transfer of **** btc failed. Sorry! We logged the incident and will respond soon."How can i withdraw my dollars and BTC?Regards,Frans. I'm 100Â  I think I've registered on 2010-07-29, that's when I first sent coins to mtgox. Since I can't post to the original thread in "Bitcoin Discussion" - http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19590.0My MtGox number = 100.What's yours? I would like to cancel my order, but when I call https://bitoption.org/cancelOpenOption?token=***&contractId=*** I get an internal server error.What to do?I would like to post in a more appropriate thread but apparently I'm a newby... Is it being flooded again or something? Is an order publicly visible if someone selects "dark pool and normal"? I think this is a very good idea! I also think it's important to have a PHP library since this is an important programming language for e-commerce sites. It would help a great deal in acceptance of bitcoin as a currency.
