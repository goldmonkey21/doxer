 - https://buildingbitcoin.org/Excerpt;"Building BitcoinOver the past few many years, a deliberate and well-funded effort has gone into rewriting the history of Bitcoin.Instead of speculating about what Satoshi may or may not have thought or wanted, instead of speculating about the motivations of one group or another, here is simply the unedited stream of conciousness of developers long before Bitcoin was a force to be reconed with.Before Blockstream existed, before Coinbase, before Bitcoin.com muddied the waters, when Bitcoin was only a few dozen hobbyists hanging out on IRC and discussing their interest in this net technology.Follow along as early pioneers tried (and often failed) to figure out what Bitcoin was. You may be surprised that opinions and the ideas of things that were required to scale Bitcoin were very similar in 2011 as they are today.Follow along as developers discussed payment channels, the need for second-layer systems, and as later-Bitcoin-2x developers discussed the 1MB block size as fundamental to Bitcoin.

Indeed.- https://github.com/gapcoin-project/gapcoin/blob/v0.9.4-gap/contrib/gapcoin/j0nn9-describing-gapcoin.mdExcerpt ..."What are the advantages of Gapcoin compared with other prime number based cryptocurrencies?First of all, Gapcoin follows Riecoins way and uses enough Miller-Rabin tests with random bases to avoid composite numbers being accepted as Prove of Work, like Primecoin mistakenly could.But the real improvement is due to its easy pool-mineable Hashing algorithm. This means that creating a Gapcoin pool will be as easy as creating a scrypt one!Why is that important?When you look at Riecoin, there are only two pools. Even Primecoin, the first scientific cryptocurrency, only has three reliable pools. This is due to the difficulty of creating a fair reward system for the custom hashing algorithms of Prime- and Riecoin.In Primecoin, which is searching for long prime chains, you can easily modify your miner to search for smaller chains. In fact, it is mostly about a simple one-line-editing. As an example, just turn a 10 into a 7 in xolominer and you will get scads of 7-chains, but your chance to find a block has diminished.To avoid this, pools supply better payment for shares with longer chain-lengths.In Riecoin, it is even worse. Riecoin searches for prime tuples of length 6. Pools do accept tuples with less primes, but a 6-tuple only can occur in certain places. (Look at this post for a detailed explanation.) 4-tuples, by comparison, are more frequent. There are places, where a 4-tuple can occur, but no 6-tuple, which Riecoin truly needs. So pools have to check every submitted share whether the miner really searches for 6-tuples or not. Those facts are what make it so hard to create a Prime- or Riecoin pool.With Gapcoin, there wont be any problems like these. While in Riecoin and Primecoin you can choose whether to search for bigger shares or smaller ones, Gapcoin is searching for prime gaps in general. The distribution of prime gaps is still a mystery for mathematicians, thats why you cant modify your miner to look for special results. Consequently, every submitted share can be paid equally."...Gapcoin also has a superior economic model to most other cryptocurrencies.In terms of scarcity, Litecoin (for example) has a max total supply of 84 million LTC.Gapcoin has a max total supply of 10 - 30 million GAP (because the prime gap value found is added to each block) ...- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822498.msg56381025#msg56381025Finding larger prime Gaps with increased network hash rate (primespersec) is a Number Go Up technology.Gapcoin = Bitcoin + Prime Gaps...."I will sound the trumpet of mine own merits," quote Abraham Fleming in 1576 ...So, remember folks ...

For example, the numbers 317 and 331 are both prime, but no number in between is prime, so we have a prime gap of 14. By the Prime Number Theorem, the average prime gap between any two consecutive prime numbers among the first n whole numbers is the natural logarithm of n. The merit of a prime gap is thus defined as the prime gap divided by this average prime gap. For example, the merit of the prime gap between 317 and 331 is 2.43, which means that this prime gap is more than twice the average prime gap among those between 1 and 317. In December 2017, the GapCoin network discovered a prime gap of length 8350 following an 87-digit prime. This prime gap has merit 41.94, which means that it is almost 42 times as large as the average prime gap. This is the largest prime gap merit discovered to date."...Somehow I missed this article ... better late than never!

And ruined his reputation in the process.If he was Satoshi, we should respect his wish to remain anonymous, and ignore him.The other possibility is he is a master scammer/fraudster who managed to trick some pretty smart people over a period of several years.In which case everybody except the victims of his fraud and law enforcement working on behalf of those victims should ignore him.So, either he was or he wasnt.

Etc., etc.,
Yes indeed. This is a very good all-in-one 'home' solution for many Bitcoin users. Running a Bitcoin full node on a VPS server instance is much more costly (in the long-term) than running a full node on your 'home' PC.Whilst you can host a pruned node (for around $5 a month), with VPS / linux server companies such as digital ocean and vultr, hosting a full node at 300+ GB requires block storage which will set you back around $1.00/mo per 10 GB of storage i.e. around $55 a month minimum for a 500 GB instance....I'm actually in the process of writing a guide for setting up a $5 Linux VPS running a pruned Bitcoin node (as a dual stack node with Tor .onion, optional) for my 'Bitcoin on Tor addnodes project' see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5177001.0 - however the guide likely won't be published until after the Tor v3 .onion rollout in mid 2021.It is also possible to effectively CPU mine various altcoins utilizing cpulimit at 75% max (so that the VPS companies won't ban you!), to offset the cost of running a Bitcoin pruned VPS node 'cloud' instance....TBH I find it rather surprising that the OP has recently posted this topic;Tutorial: How To Fork Bitcoin- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5295647.0... and yet seemingly is unaware of what is required in terms of 'hosting' a full Bitcoin server in the cloud !?...Whilst we are all always learning, in regards to Bitcoin, as one of the oldest and active members of this forum, topics like this one just highlight to me the often great disparity between users technical knowledge and what gets interest / help / funding to move forward with what folks seemingly need and want to achieve. gapcoin.club Riecoin nodes successfully upgraded to 0.20.0 RC (most of them anyway   )riecoin.conf example for Riecoin on Tor- https://gapcoin.club/downloads/riecoin.conf.tor.txtriecoin.conf example for clearnet- https://gapcoin.club/downloads/riecoin.confCheers!

"What about key length ? By some freak chance, it so happens that RSA, DSA and ElGamal keys of similar size offer vaguely similar strength (this is pure luck since they rely on distinct kinds of mathematical objects). 1024-bit RSA/DSA/ElGamal keys currently evade our cryptanalytic abilities, but they seem to be within reach of Earth-based technology (if you spend a few hundred millions or billions of dollars in building a dedicated machine and don't mind if it takes 6 months to break a single key). 2048-bit RSA/DSA/ElGamal keys are waaaay beyond what can be done with foreseeable technology. Any key size beyond 2048 bits is the equivalent of buying a red sports car to woo girls.For your specific case:    The "sign only" options will yield keys usable only for signatures, and not for, say, encrypted emails. If you want a key usage for encryption you will need to use one of the first two options.    In older times, RSA was patented (in the USA) so some implementations supported only DSA and ElGamal. Since the patent expired in 2000, any decent implementation of PGP can now handle it just fine.    DSA signatures are a tad shorter than RSA signatures; ElGamal-based key exchange will use a few more bytes than RSA-based key exchange. We are only talking about a few dozen bytes here; any optimization of that kind will be dwarfed by the loss incurred if you decide to use red oversized keys to assert your manhood."  answered Nov 8 '14 at 21:32 The point to make is not mine.Didn't you read the satoshi post from the OP ?The order of things I would want satoshi to sign to 'prove' identity would be ...1.

A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting Bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the Bitcoin would be higher - now it would be backed by pizzas ''and'' haircuts. When Bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his Bitcoin-savings.

You might want to be more careful when directing personal insults at me.  BSV is NOT Bitcoin and Craig Wright is NOT Satoshi.Try actually reading my post ... look who you are 'trusting' with your 'money' ...- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4985868.msg55208878#msg55208878 Gapcoins focus has always been prime gap discovery ... since block 1 ... that is gapcoin's Proof-of-Work functionality.  - https://github.com/gapcoin/Gapcoin-PoWCoreThe emission is relative to the network difficulty (and of course the block halving). Again, ...* Block reward proportional to the current difficulty* Block reward halving every 420000 (about 2 years)* Cap: about 10 - 30 million GAP* Difficulty adjusts every block and increases logarithmically (it will probably take years to get to 50)The economic model, in this regard, might be considered somewhat superior to Bitcoin.Gapcoin mining, relative to Bitcoin has not even been pushed (logarithmically) much past the center of the spiral (network difficulty)....As with Bitcoin, don't blame the code because you didn't (or couldn't) mine from block 1.Don't blame the market or others because you didn't (or couldn't) buy coins when the price of market was relatively low.Don't SPNDL and complain that you didn't HODL, because trust me, no one cares! Not even 1 Satoshi.greed != prime_gaps [citation needed !?]   "Craig Wright: I have no access to the financial systems of my companies.Also Craig Wright: I went in the company accounts and backdated an invoice.

Big difference between "production increase" vs noninflationary 'growth' overtime ...Remember: The Gapcoin mining reward is the block reward plus the prime gap (network difficulty) and fees.Simply view any Gapcoin blocks raw data on the block explorer ...This 'feature' is incentive to mine (value) and to discover bigger prime gaps.Hence, * Cap: about 10 - 30 million GAP* Difficulty adjusts every block and increases logarithmically (it will probably take years to get to 50)The total number of Gapcoin produced depends on the network mining difficulty.One day the prime gap merit reward per block will outweigh the block reward, it already outweighs the current transaction fees.  Gapcoin is quite literally Bitcoin code plus the mathematical laws of nature.PoW at its finest. The economic model itself is genius.P.S.

Anyone is more than welcome to continue with submissions and commits to the community repository, currently being headed by Graham.Whilst a math and science crypto exchange is a reasonable concept, anyone who might develop one is going to do so on a domain name they would acquire directly from a reputable domain names register, one would imagine.Graham is a more than competent coder and developer with years of experience.

The per day averages start with the previous day and will eventually extend back 365 days, but until then, they increase by half a day each day by taking the average of two averages. Production costs consist of the price of broadband Internet and metered electricity. The adjusted bitcoin production is the following spreadsheet calculation =if(M2>N2,((B2+F2)/2)*(1/(3-((N2/M2)*2))),((B2+F2)/2)*(3-((M2/N2)*2))) where M2 is the available balance of dollars times the exchange rate of that same day, N2 is the available balance of bitcoins, B2 is the amount of bitcoins produced the previous day and F2 is the average of the adjusted bitcoin production per day."- http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+Rate"During 2009 my exchange rate was calculated by dividing $1.00 by the average amount of electricity required to run a computer with high CPU for a year, 1331.5 kWh, multiplied by the the average residential cost of electricity in the United States for the previous year, $0.1136, divided by 12 months divided by the number of bitcoins generated by my computer over the past 30 days."...Bitcoin MaximalismBitcoin maximalists, who's favorite hangout would currently appear to be the self described crypto twitter, mostly seem to affirm that nothing can ever be an improvement to Bitcoin.This is IMHO a malignment not only to Bitcoin itself, but also to the entire cryptocurrecy space in general.Primarily it stifles innovation, creates a false single viewpoint narrative and to be frank some of these folks are starting to sound like a broken record for "Number go up", idiocracy. Free markets are free, numbers go up and down.Plenty of ideas, testing (and code) from other altcoins and blockchains have contributed changes incorporated into the existing Bitcoin (BTC) project, and vice versa of course.Some altcoins and other cryptocurrencies do have some unique advantages over Bitcoin currently, namely;- Better privacy / anonymity features.- Faster transaction / confirmation times.- Useful PoW schemes- Smart contracts etc.,Whilst Bitcoin (BTC) will always remain the first true cryptocurrency / market mover ...

Q. What is the use of this coin?A. Gapcoin is a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin BTC), it functions as a store of value and digital cash. Gapcoin's PoW (mining process) also discovers Prime Gaps in new blocks whilst processing transactions.Q. is there any exchange available to sell this coin because if someone mine this coin then they need to sell it somewhere or use it right?A. Yes. https://freiexchange.com/market/GAP/BTC and soon https://c-patex.com/ and more ?EDIT: adding: https://freebitcoins.com/xchange/market/Bitcoin-GapcoinGapcoin was listed on poloniex, cryptopia and other now defunct crypto exchanges.Other exchanges can list Gapcoin, although most of this industry now focuses on profit driven scams instead of interesting crypto / science projects. Exchanges often want listing fees, which the Gapcoin community will not currently muster.Did you know that when Bitcoin launched it was essentially valueless and no exchange services existed, whatsoever!Q. Are there any investors at all for this project?A. Personally, I don't give a hoot in regards to attracting 'whale' investors and/or promoting 'pump n dump' schemes or BS tokens.Gapcoin is a cryptocurrency science project and a digital cash.Q. That website is not very good to me and has nothing to attract whale investors.A. gapcoin.org was the 'original' website started by the aforementioned developer, who sadly passed away.https://gapcoin.club is my basic website offering, helping to maintain and to continue the project.As we rebuild the community a better website may follow.Q. Is there any whitepaper available for the project or any place for recent project update?A. The original developer did not release a whitepaper for Gapcoin, which is essentially a Bitcoin based altcoin with some nice mathematically functional "bells and whistles" optimizations, for finding Prime Gaps.

Ever since the self-proclaimed Bit Coin creator has started suing community members who contested his status, van Pelt has taken upon himself to shine a light on the numerous cases of shady evidence that Wright provided.Some would go as far as saying that Arthur van Pelt is obsessed with Craig Wright and has a personal agenda. After all, his daily tweets about Wrights life and activity in court do require hours of research and intensive reading. But if you ask van Pelt, he will say that he only does a community service by trying to salvage the reputations of those whom Wright has harmed: from Hal Finney to Adam Back and Hodlonaut, there are dozens of lives that have been irreversibly affected by lawsuits, threats, and perpetual slandering.To support his cause, Arthur van Pelt has created the #Faketoshi Fraud Timeline: a website where he regularly publishes information that he collects from court data, testimonies, and individual investigations. His aim appears to be that of fact-checking statements that Craig Wright has made in court, private e-mails, blog posts, and social media interactions.In the Bitcoin Takeover Season 5 finale, we talk about Craig Wrights early days (convincing Gavin Andresen that he is Satoshi, debating Nick Szabo during Bitcoin Belles panel, and feeling reluctant to play the role of Satoshi), his evolution throughout the years, and the considerations that may exist behind his lawsuits.Inevitably, some conspiracy theories get discussed: Is Craig Wright a government contractor who is trying to discredit Bitcoin and destroy it from within? Or is Craig Wright actually paid by the real Satoshi Nakamoto to put an end to the relevance of who the creator of Bitcoin may be?At the end of our 155-minute discussion, Arthur van Pelt and I agree that the Bitcoin community should always be honest and phase out bad actors with facts and thorough research. While its better for bad actors to receive less media coverage, its also useful to balance their claims with facts. This anti-sensationalist middle ground may look less glamorous than scoring clickbaity website hits, but its also better in the long run."Bitcoin = BTC   Currently you can mine in the wallet with CPU or at the pool https://gap.suprnova.cc with CPU and/or GPU.The latest linux build has an additional Mining Tab, so yes quite literally click > Start (mining).A new windows release is in the pipeline, however CPU mining in the (windows) wallet is also easy ...- https://gapcoin.club/windows-gui-setup.php ..."To start mining for Gapcoin in your wallet go to:Help > Debug window > Console and type in the following command at the prompt:setgenerate trueNote that this will start the mining process using 100% of your CPU processing power!

Gapcoin does not have a 'backdoor' you can read / check the source code for yourself.5. If you had been following the Gapcoin project more closely you would know that the 'Header Shift' is already optimal in the default mining range.e.g. "Modded CPU-Miner (by dcct, about 10x faster than old version)"The additional Mining Tab in the v0.9.4 wallet does a great job of presenting what is happening and will be useful for the higher ranges, moving forward.Gapcoin has not seen any chain forks.The v0.9.2 release is a good starting point, https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.2, as a great number of additional bugs were only introduced with future Bitcoin features and/or releases. We now have the advantage of being able to 'cherry pick' from the repositories on the way up.Now, do stop trying to malign Gapcoin.

It is not fake privacy / anonymity.[notice] Zcash can't help you if you use it wrong!z-addr > z-addr is privacy / anonymity. See my post above....A Cypherpunk's Manifesto- https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.htmlQuotes: "Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world...""... Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself. Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy.

Zero-knowledge proof- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proofNon-interactive zero-knowledge proof- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof- https://z.cash/technology/- https://electriccoin.co/blog/anatomy-of-zcash/...The Bitcoin ledger is public. It is an open book. All transactions are publicly viewable and are stored on the blockchain forever. Just look at any block explorer.Zcash utilizes two address types t-addr and z-addr. t-addr are public just like in Bitcoin and are therefore publicly viewable.z-addr are basically the equivalent of a black box, on-chain. It is impossible to view the transactions within the black box.However, as a Zcash user ... let's say you buy one ZEC from an exchange service (who knows who you are through KYC etc.,)You receive your ZEC to a t-addr (public). You then proceed to send one ZEC less the fees to your own z-addr (private) and in the next few blocks you send out the one (ZEC) less the fees to a t-addr (public) to buy something online.It is relatively straight forward for a strong adversary doing chain analysis to match these likely inputs and outputs on chain and to perhaps identify you personally by contacting the exchange service, retrospectively.The chain analysis article states that less than 1% of Zcash transactions (to date) are even utilizing z-addr > z-addr transactions i.e. within the black box.Quite simply if the opposite were true and 99% of Zcash transactions were as z-addr > z-addr transactions it would become impossible to do chain analysis of these transactions.An old internet adage states "You cannot be anonymous by yourself!".Splitting inputs and outputs over time also makes chain analysis much harder ... i.e. You receive your one ZEC to a t-addr (public). You then proceed to send one ZEC less the fees to your own z-addr (private), you then cold store your coins for x duration. Before spending anything outside of the black box you occasionally move your own coins from your own z-addr to another z-addr, perhaps to a different wallet. When you send out x number of (ZEC) less the fees to a t-addr (public) to buy something online, say months or even years later, it becomes much much harder to identify the origin of the coins.It becomes even more impossible if your purchase is made to a z-addr, for example....Connecting your wallet via Tor and only making transactions through onion routing can also help to prevent other types of surveillance and analysis....I once wrote a piece on the Zcash community forum where I described DASH coin mixing vs Zcash shielded privacy as follows;DASH - If you imagine a theatre stage with say eight piles of money on the floor (masternodes), the curtain rolls up and the troop of dancers enters the stage with money in hand and each of them proceeds to move from pile to pile swapping money around then it might seem difficult for the audience to work out what is going one. However, imagine that the entire show is recorded by an audience member (on the blockchain) it is actually very easy in deed to replay exactly what happened (via a block explorer).Zcash - Imagine the same stage, except this time the piles of money are behind a screen (entirely shielded from the audiences view), if the majority of the dancers only swap money behind the screen, it becomes impossible for the audience to easily work out exactly what happened, even retrospectively....Financial Privacy is not a crime!IHMO any company doing chain analysis of other peoples private transactions (for profit), should be considered criminals themselves.

Each of the shares is represented in a congruence, and the solution of the system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem is the secret to be recovered.

Herewith, current information for pool mining Gapcoin ...The original and 'final' CPU/GPU miner release(s) for Gapcoin by j0nn9 (i.e. crt-rev5 and crt-rev5.1) were somewhat experimental, they are perhaps unstable for more modern graphics cards and require continued development.Those binary releases are perhaps best suited for RPC / solo mining (and testing), before a new GPU miner and separate (or combined) CRT miner can be developed and released.

The merit M=G/ln(P1) of this gap is M=41.93878373153988, the largest merit of any known prime gap, and the first prime gap to be discovered with a merit exceeding 40. The endpoints of the gap have been certified as primes deterministically, using the Akiyama-Kida-O'Hara UBASIC implementation (1988-1992) of the APRCL2 test, due to Adleman, Pomerance, Rumely, Cohen, H. W. Lenstra, and A. K. Lenstra (1984-1987).However, Bertil Nyman's maximal gap of 1132, following the prime 1693182318746371 (discovered 24 January 1999), continues to exhibit the greatest known value (0.92063858855742) of the Cramér-Shanks-Granville ratio G/ln²(p_1); this ratio is 0.210642105494715467 for the new Gapcoin gap. The limit superior of this ratio has been conjectured to be unity (or some even larger value); see the discussion in "New prime gaps between 1e15 and 5e16"...."Could we break any world records?In 2017 (confirmed in early 2018) the Gapcoin network found a new prime gap of maximum known merit! The merit M=G/ln(P1) of this gap is M=41.93878373153988, the largest merit of any known prime gap, and the first prime gap to be discovered with a merit exceeding 40. Source : https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/We already broke more than 544 records of first known occurrence prime gaps.

Current or past value might not reflect future value i.e. probably not a complete waste of time.2. Two block explorers are better than one or none. The same applies to exchanges.3. You have clearly never 'fried' any of your hardware / cards !?4. 'Donation' addresses will be added to the website.5. The 10 cloud nodes I'm running do also CPU mine 24/7 and find blocks ... when the network is larger these will likely be reduced.Most Gapcoin nodes / wallets are not port forwarded for incoming connections!My https://gapcoin.club nodes have insured that this network has had a 'backbone' for a considerable duration.6. Well aware of the chicken and egg situation that Gapcoin has been in since the original dev. passed away.Compiling the daemon is still tricky on newer linux releases and that needs fixing with another new repo. now that Graham has also sadly gone.The PoW-Core needs to be properly integrated, one issue being that much has changed with GitHub as well as some other factors for compiling the wallet software since the original releases.Graham has actually done an excellent job in presenting exactly what needs to be done (in his thread posts) for anyone who picks this up.Gapcoin needs a good 'team' of developers before much else and the much else is not really forthcoming because of this current situation.Any other suggestions ?The potential with Gapcoin is still immense! Anyone who thinks that a few personal PM's sent over time equates to SPAM does not have a clue what real SPAM is.Now go and try running a Tor exit node, you will soon learn what 'real' SPAM is!...Gapcoin is a functional Math based cryptocurrency, we do not need or require 'pump and dump' activities.

April 5 happens to be a very important date in the development of money.The Outlawing of GoldOn April 5, 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States. The order declared the act of saving gold a crime in the United States, punishable under a $10,000 fine  almost $200,000 in price-adjusted 2014 dollars  and imprisonable for 5 to 10 years.Roosevelts alleged reasoning for this order is somewhat hard to locate in an intelligible form, but this transcript implies the decree was issued for technocratic reasons to prop up the US Dollar and reduce demand for gold, which was being withdrawn from federal reserves at an unsustainable rate.Knowledge of this historical episode can be rather confusing to many people today, as it is difficult to fit into the typical American history narrative. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Executive Order 6102 remains widely unknown amongst the general public.Criticisms of Executive Order 6102In the past few decades, mainstream narratives largely brushed over this event. The typical narrative once branded most intellectuals who criticized Roosevelts decree as libertarian, but one need not self-identify as libertarian to find Executive Order 6102 extremely concerning.Progressives familiar with the intellectual theory behind their movement might be uncomfortable with the legal precedent set in creating an imprisonable crime without a democratic process.Conservatives familiar with the intellectual theory behind their movement may be concerned by the usurpation of a political power not delegated to the Federal government in the US Constitution. Not even the Congress is granted the power to punish for the hoarding of gold; their power for punishment concerning currencies is for fraud (counterfeiting):    To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current coin of the United States;Those who adhere to the non-aggression principle (Libertarians) will find this executive order to initiate violence against non-violent parties, without a proper claim to aggressed-property.And moderates, independents, or otherwise will almost certainly find it disturbingly Orwellian that the leader of an allegedly democratic government can declare a previously legal (and incredibly common) act to be imprisonable for 5 to 10 years, for allegedly technocratic reasons, without any public economic proof or study.Influence on BitcoinExecutive Order 6102 was a landmark event in the history of money. It influenced generations of thinkers to consider forms of money not under the control (or potential control) of political entities. Among these thinkers were the Cypherpunks, including Wei Dai (b-money), the very first reference in Satoshis original whitepaper.Why April 5, 1975?April 5 is clearly an influential date in the development of Bitcoin. Satoshis text included in the Bitcoin blockchains genesis block even seems to resonate with a fitting message:    The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banksInterestingly, Satoshis reported birth year, 1975, also seems to have relevant significance. As Edlund10 points out, 1975 is the year Executive Order 6102 was reversed and gold ownership was re-legalized for average US residents.TL;DRSatoshi Nakamotos self-reported birthday is April 5, 1975. This date happens to correspond to the date of a major turning point in the development of Bitcoin. Executive Order 6102  a decree making the holding of gold an imprisonable offense in the US  was issued on April 5, 1933. In a seemingly corroborating nod, 1975 is the year in which this act was reversed.It seems extremely unlikely that Satoshi chose April 5, 1975 by coincidence.This article was originally posted April 5, 2014 at jason.dreyzehner.com."Source: https://blog.bitjson.com/satoshi-nakamoto-day-a-milestone-in-the-history-of-money-d80b486c0e7e...Oh dear Craig, oh dear ...Craig Steven Wright (born October 1970)- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_WrightJust to be clear on this ...Craig Wright is NOT satoshi and BSV is NOT Bitcoin.From thread: "Bitcoin SV (BSV) - fake team member and plagiarized white paper"Craig Wright is NOT satoshi and BSV is NOT Bitcoin.Bitcoin = BTC  Dang ...

"Towards the end of 2012, Dave began to fail. Paraplegics get sick a lot, Lynn Wright had told me, speaking as a nurse. The bedsores get bad and they cant fight infections. Dave was in and out of hospital a lot and I dont know what his life was really like. Wright told me that Kleiman had girlfriends, but admitted he didnt really know much about his life. Like Wright and his first wife, they had met in a chatroom. They met in the flesh no more than half a dozen times. Kleiman seems to have lived in front of his computer day and night, and the sicker he got the more isolated he seemed to be. Just after 6 p.m. on 27 April 2013 he was found dead by a friend whod been trying to contact him for several days. He was sitting in his wheelchair and leaning to the left with his head resting on his hand. Lying next to him on the bed was a 0.45 calibre semi-automatic handgun, a bottle of whisky and a loaded magazine of bullets. In the mattress a few feet from where he sat, a bullet hole was found, but Kleiman had died from coronary heart disease. There were prescription medicines in his bloodstream and a modest amount of cocaine.We never really thought that we made Satoshi, Wright told me once. It was good. It was done. It was cool. But I dont think we realised how big it would be.There was no conversation between you about how it was going over? That Satoshi was becoming a guru?We thought it was funny.Wright paused, shook his head, and broke down. I loved Dave, he said. I would have seen him more. I would have talked to him more. I wouldve made sure he had some fucking money to go to a decent hospital. I dont think he had the right to choose not to tell me.What was happening to him?Neither of us had any money, physical money. We had money in Liberty, an exchange in Costa Rica, but the Americans closed it down as a money-laundering operation. Dave had a number of bitcoins on the hard drive he carried with him.

For connections                coming from unroutable addresses (such as 127.0.0.1, where the                Tor proxy typically runs), .onion addresses are given                preference for your node to advertise itself with.- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md...Depending on what your doing you can also locate the corresponding (ephemeral) private key here:cd ~/.bitcoin && sudo nano onion_private_keyRSA1024: ...(make sure you stop tor and bitcoin first and backup your keys and wallets etc.,)Also,sudo nano /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostnamesudo nano /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/private_key-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...The above should provide a good idea of how to copy, backup and/or replace the keys ...

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."Paper: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System <<<<< links to ...- https://web.archive.org/web/20100704213649/http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfAgain, Bitcoin = BTC at domain bitcoin.org - always has!...Bitcoin is NOT BSV and CSW is NOT Satoshi.Got it now?

My gut instinct was saying, Dont delete it!  As Bitcoin was in its early stages, my understanding was that copying the same wallet.dat to two different computers initially seemed to work, but if you continue to use Bitcoin client to send Bitcoin, the two copies will be out of sync. I was heavily involved with testing the client at this point.  I felt that the Fujitsu was on its last legs and I didnt want to mess with the chain of blocks.  Therefore, I transferred the file and formatted the Fujitsus hard drive permanently.  This was done after I had performed rigorous tests on the Acer Aspire laptop, as I wanted to ensure that everything was running smoothly before I removed the data permanently on the Fujitsu.The morning I saw something was not right with the display, I rang the support guys.   They asked me to send the laptop in as it was under warranty.  They said theyd have a look.Nightmare!  ...

Gapcoin has seen so many other projects come and go from this space and remains incredibly resilient none the less.In theory, as more altcoins fail, Gapcoin should eventually become acknowledged. Both as a great alternative cryptocurrency and a work of mathematical / blockchain genius.Various universities and colleges have been seen running the Gapcoin blockchain, mainly to extrapolate results....The way the Logarithmic Coin Issuance dovetails with the blockchain is actually the most impressive part, economically speaking.It basically means that slightly more coins go into circulation with more hash power being added to the network. Which remains an incentive. Hence;Cap: about 10 - 30 million GAPDifficulty adjusts every block and increases logarithmically (it will probably take years to get to 50)- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiralIn terms of monetary value each block contains both the block reward and the value of the prime gap discovered in the block. This obviously increases and decreases with the hashing power. I've been in Bitcoin on and off from the very start and Gapcoin is a very difficult concept to explain ...Gapcoin is basically Bitcoin, with some fundamental laws of nature built in.In terms of finding prime gaps against the network difficulty, it almost functions like a spiral or a helix ...- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helixseashell spiral ...If we imagine the blockchain running through the centre of the spiral, increasing hashpower moves us further from the middle to discover larger prime gaps.Also see: Gapcoin Related Topics / Further Reading;- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number 21  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_cube- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio...The entire design is vastly superior to both primecoin and riecoin.It is currently unknown if any upper bounds in terms of mining for prime gaps with Gapcoin might exist, because we don't know what the largest prime gap is ... However, fixed variables in the source code (accepted under consensus) are unlikely to cause any issues in the future with continuing to utilize Gapcoin as a cryptocurrency, in this regard. It's almost akin to the assumption that quantum computers will 'break' Bitcoin etc., Thankfully I have no need to sink to the abhorrent level of all of those involved with BSV.Not even trolling you!

The average length of a prime gap with the starting prime p, is log(p), which means that the average prime gap size increases with lager primes. Then, instead of the pure length, we use the merit of the prime gap, which is the ratio of the gap's size to the average gap size.Let p be the prime starting a prime gap, then m = gapsize/log(p) will be the merit of this prime gap.Also a pseudo random number is calculated from p to provide finer difficulty adjustment.Let rand(p) be a pseudo random function with 0 less than rand(p) less than 1. Then, for a prime gap starting at prime p with size s, the difficulty will be s/log(p) + 2/log(p) * rand(p), where 2/log(p) is the average distance between a gap of size s and s + 2 (the next greater gap) in the proximity of p.When it actually comes to mining, there are two additional fields added to the Blockheader, named shift and adder. We will calculate the prime p as sha256(Blockheader) * 2^shift + adder. As an additional criterion the adder has to be smaller than 2^shift to avoid that the PoW could be reused."The gapcoin blockchain has been producing results and actually breaking world records since late 2014 ...- gapcoin.club/new-prime-gap-of-maximum-known-merit-press-release.php- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gapUnfortunately the original developer passed away in 2017.Also see Primecoin and Riecoin....Can Bitcoin technology / blockchain be utilized to solve and/or calculate other mathematical solutions ... most likely yes ... take your pick ... ?- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics

The people waiting for the next bus are stuck in the mempool.The frequency of buses on the timetable (blocktime) is fixed at 10 mins. ("Set in Stone"), said 50 people must therefore wait approx. 10 mins. for the next bus etc., etc.,This is the nature of Bitcoins TX model (herewith, real-time example) ...- https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/The BCH / BSV 'solution' is/was to assume that we simply require bigger buses (blocks) to solve the issue.Whilst this might seem to be the perfect solution, more congestion actually occurs and the reason relative to buses is that it takes longer for people to board and to alight from the bus.In terms of Bitcoin, bigger buses (blocks) cause more pollution and will fill up your hard drive faster. If your hard drive is full you can no longer run a node or you need to buy a bigger more expensive hard drive i.e. increased centralization and barrier to entry etc.,HINT: Empty buses don't need to be bigger!  The Lightning Network is one off-chain solution to this problem by effectively providing separate shuttle bus services for say peak times - by offloading micro payments etc.,Hence ...Please think around these concepts further (super market checkouts are also a good example) and the stark reality may dawn on you that BSV is essentially an out-of-service GIGAMEG's (lolz) bus - headed back to the depot of centralization. Supposedly, thousands of passengers are waiting for this mega bus to arrive and each of them is carrying large suit cases of additional data (such as weather maps). Sounds like a nightmare to me.I do hope the bus doesn't crash or breakdown or something ...Now imagine trying to store every .torrent on the entire internet on your hard drive. No, not only the .torrent files, but the actual files....Riiiiight.- https://youtu.be/yuTMWgOduFM- https://youtu.be/jO5VV5PISHU I have not failed to understand what the real Satoshi meant (who is most certainly not CSW).I also do not require your help in any matter whatsoever either ...Bitcoin TX's are not fast, they are in fact more or less instant, when broadcast.Transaction throughput (network confirmation time etc.,) is largely what governs scalability. Not block size.It is mostly the 10 min. blocktime which directly hinders throughput / volume of congested bitcoin transactions. Changing this "Set in Stone" value obviously would alter the economic distribution model, something which is far from acceptable.This is why Hal said off chain transactions were important to scaling bitcoin and for mass adoption.Good luck with the BSV big blocks 'sand pit'. All BSV will do is increase centralization of it's own network / protocol.I made a quote on this forum in this regard very early on in BTC days, something to the effect of "It does not matter what you do, eventually you will run out of space."Better, faster, more private blockchain's are coming....Oh wait, actually you could request that your BSV 'fraudtoshi' leader (CSW) create a new account on this forum and drop me a PM ...Ask him to tell me what Satoshi told me that he/she/they wanted to build for bitcoin before I left this forum ?It would also be preferable if the message was signed with Satoshi Nakamoto's PGP Key ...- https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/satoshinakamoto.ascI will wait until May 2020, although I will most certainly continue to wait longer.   - https://youtu.be/vA2vCG6WwQA- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5.msg188#msg188and ...How to be a "Faketoshi", better than any other "Faketoshi" !?!- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5148607.0 "...CRASHing..." ...

Issues around scaling Bitcoin arose almost immediately after its inception. Hal Finney, the first Bitcoin developer after Satoshi himself, wrote this in 2010:    Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the blockchain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases. ..."

Although his name is unfamiliar to the general public of bothAmerican and China, Blondie Wong is a man who is well known to theChinese government, the Peoples Liberation Army, the National SecurityAgency of the U.S., the CIA, FBI, Interpol and numerous Fortune 500companies.Although he now lives in exile in Toronto, Canada, under the protectionof armed bodyguards, as a young boy Blondie Wong saw his beloved fatherstoned to death by Chairman Maos Red Guards during the CulturalRevolution. Years later he traveled to the United Kingdom, where heentered university and studied to become a teacher. In the summer of1989, after witnessing the Tienanmen Square massacre on television,Blondie Wong decided to form the Hong Kong Blondes and their sisterhacking group, the Yellow Pages.At first, Wong started small  organizing a close circle of friends hebelieved he could trust. Later he launched an international recruitingcampaign aimed at some of the finest computer engineering universitiesin America and around the world.Ranging from Cal Tech to MIT, Blondie Wong assembled an elite army ofsympathetic hackers.".........

PoW is far from being meaningless in this instance, it simply has a secondary 'useful' output.There is 'no waste', not 'less waste', you are correct in this regard i.e. 2 x commodity outputs, being 'coins' and prime gaps with every block ...Also, not an 'idea', it actually functions as intended, on-chain and has done so since 2014...."So the difficulty will simply be the length of the prime gap?Not exactly. The average length of a prime gap with the starting prime p, is log(p), which means that the average prime gap size increases with larger primes. Then, instead of the pure length, we use the merit of the prime gap, which is the ratio of the gap's size to the average gap size.Let p be the prime starting a prime gap, then m = gapsize/log(p) will be the merit of this prime gap.Also a pseudo random number is calculated from p to provide finer difficulty adjustment.Let rand(p) be a pseudo random function with 0 less than rand(p) less than 1. Then, for a prime gap starting at prime p with size s, the difficulty will be s/log(p) + 2/log(p) * rand(p), where 2/log(p) is the average distance between a gap of size s and s + 2 (the next greater gap) in the proximity of p.When it actually comes to mining, there are two additional fields added to the Blockheader, named shift and adder. We will calculate the prime p as sha256(Blockheader) * 2^shift + adder. As an additional criterion the adder has to be smaller than 2^shift to avoid that the PoW could be reused."For Prime Gaps see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gapHINT: We could use some more PoW, much more actually!...Correct.   Thread moved from Bitcoin Discussion to Off-topic 'cover-up' boards by forum 'mods.' ... not even to the Legal section.

I cannot begin to describe (although I most certainly shall), the dire inconsistencies presented within the following article;- https://coingeek.com/dr-craig-s-wright-appears-in-us-federal-court-testifies-he-is-satoshi-nakamoto/Specifically this;... "On the stand, Wright continued that the original Bitcoin did not use the concept of public addresses as people perceive them today; instead, it relied on public-private pairs, with the private keys needed to spend the coins. Today, people incorrectly perceive a public address similar to a bank account number, where coin holders accumulate Bitcoin and then spend from that address. The original Bitcoin system created by Wright was never meant to incorporate a system of reusable public addresses where people can see how much Bitcoin is accumulating in a single public address that is re-used; instead, a new key pair (and thus a new address) was intended to be created for every transaction in order to provide users a new privacy model. Wright testified that this is explained in the Bitcoin white paper (section 10, Privacy). After Wright withdrew from the Bitcoin project, the public address on the Bitcoin ledger became incorrectly misunderstood and then misused by developers in what would become known as the Bitcoin Core (BTC) project. Thus, at the time Wright was mining Bitcoin for his company in 2009 and 2010 and under Wrights original Bitcoin design, there was no need to keep the public addresses as people understand them now; instead, at the time, the seed or private keys were all that would be needed or stored.Wright was requested to provide the public Bitcoin addresses that reportedly hold a significant amount of assetspossibly reaching into the billions of dollars. He testified in court that hes more than willing to turn over the information if he could, but that the information necessary to generate the list of public addresses is locked in an encrypted file, with multiple keys protecting different layers of the file. At earliest, the first layers of the encrypted file cannot be opened until at least January 2020. Wright explained that the encrypted file contains the relevant seed and his proprietary algorithm that can generate the private keys for Bitcoin mined by his company in 2009 and 2010, which would allow him to generate the associated public keys and public addresses that most crypto fans are used to seeing today." ......Firstly, I'm someone who genuinely mined Bitcoin (BTC) in early 2010.

Like Wright and his first wife, they had met in a chatroom. They met inthe flesh no more than half a dozen times. Kleiman seems to have lived in front of hiscomputer day and night, and the sicker he got the more isolated he seemed to be. Justafter 6 p.m. on 27 April 2013 he was found dead by a friend whod been trying to contacthim for several days. He was sitting in his wheelchair and leaning to the left with hishead resting on his hand. Lying next to him on the bed was a 0.45 calibre semi-automatic handgun, a bottle of whisky and a loaded magazine of bullets. In the mattressa few feet from where he sat, a bullet hole was found, but Kleiman had died fromcoronary heart disease. There were prescription medicines in his bloodstream and amodest amount of cocaine.We never really thought that we made Satoshi, Wright told me once. It was good. Itwas done. It was cool. But I dont think we realised how big it would be.There was no conversation between you about how it was going over?

On websites such as Bitcoin.com ( do notice I registered and transferred bitcoin.org at that time. They did try to derail again, to sell the altcoin as a new bitcoin version or the 'right' bitcoin as intended. Abusing the term bitcoin for their altcoin. Promoting, buy bitcoin, but it was bitcoin cash or bitcoin unlimited, two altcoins.A hardfork did happen where his altcoin did lose and in the process it was clear, bitcoin cash was prone to the 51 percent attack. More. Only a few miners did play the game.In the process he did tweet in despair the community to convert bitcoin (core) to his altcoin, bitcoinSV or bsv. Known that it is estimated, I have a whale wallet of 1M btc, you would directly convert yourself, if Craig Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto, right?Also our style and attitude is totally different. I, Satoshin, was NEVER into the play to be a dictator, to patent, to control or lead the project. I always proposed solutions, as my work was given to the public. For sure, there is copyright on the white paper, but this is assigned at creation to the author by international law.His last steps recently are to claim patents, including an US copyright on my white paper. For that he did pay a small amount of 35 dollar or something, to do an electronic depot of the very well known white paper, bitcoin.pdf However, the office does not verify if the claimant of the copyright does match with the pen name of the author. So they registered the claim for copyright, however.I, Satoshi Nakamoto, did register the white paper long before the release on the internet in the period 20082009 at a Belgian notary office, just in case, this would happen, so in a court case, he would be busted.Additionally it seems, to my limited knowledge in the matter, you need to file in the 5 years after creation and the paper may not be published to the public. The white paper was published to the public about 10 years ago.So no doubt, Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.In fact, the community can check this. If all investors in his altcoin bitcoinSV or bsv do convert their coins to the original bitcoin core, btc, you will see for sure, there will be no single bitcoin from the whale wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, that will be converted to rescue the altcoin.Of course I can hijack his coin with my whale wallet, but I try to avoid this as long as possible, so I can stay in the grey zone. The reason for this is clear. When I come forward in public, the press will hunt me down like they did with Dorian Nakamoto. Also each day, some people will ask me for bitcoin or my interaction or remarks on the project.It is pretty comfortable to be in the grey zone.But this said, I am bold to state, Craig Wright is an imposter if he does claim to be me, Satoshi Nakamoto.My real name is Jurgen E. G. DEBO, born in Belgium. On twitter @realsatoshin. Reason why I did use the german GMX service. More people are from Europe in the project. Another good developer in the project bitcoin core is from Holland, despite his name soundswell. And no doubt there are connections with Switzerland, reason why Hal Finney did step in to create the first prototype of my work in the spirit of MiT open source !As related to my handle, Satoshi Nakamoto means, Sato Shi Naka Moto. The clear vision (wisdom) is in the center (your heart). I used my first, third and last name, 15 characters in an alternation of a caeserian cypher to have 15 letters, to finaly combine them with Japanese words. Finally I used Japanese exit nodes, using tor or sometimes openproxies to hide my IP. Clearly I did respect the Japanese business hours. We learn in Belgium, British English and in school, we did use double space after the dots in typewriting work, so may this explain some questions.Bitcoin and Blockchain is for the public. It is decentralized. It is designed to live on it's own, without the possibility to manipulate, control or divert the system to people who do have greed, power and ego boost in their minds.Those who know me, do know, I clearly am open source minded. As I defend higher ethics, like WE the people, WE as community.So do not have fear. Dr Craig Wright is only a wannabee and another 'faketoshi'.All the BestSatoshin"...To clarify (again), the above post is not written by me.Is this guy Satoshin? Who knows?Certainly does sound a lot more like the real 'Satoshi' who was present on this very forum ...   If you read some of my early posts, I had perhaps demonstrated more hope for the Bitcoin project economically than most, however, I was concerned in regards to some technical aspects and future political / regulatory issues etc.,In terms of supply, I actually though Bitcoin had missed / passed it's point of economic inception vs adoption. It took longer than I thought / predicted. I also didn't like some aspects of the way the project and early community seemed to be headed. I moved out of Bitcoin (temporarily) to recover some debts and business obligations and to continue with retail forex trading etc., (which was more profitable at the time) I had a lot of personal funds stolen, confiscated and/or lost.

Don't use it. Even Governments and Enterprise won't use BSV on this basis. See CSW's twitter.Furthermore, the BSV network will likely become heavily centralized with a very BIG data blockchain that only a few individuals companies will only be able to afford to run ($20,000+ machines etc.,)Imagine trying to store the data from every .torrent ever created (the actual data, not the kb file!) onto a single blockchain. It will very likely become a centralized behemoth, with single points of failure. You can't even 'prune' the blocks! It's the exact opposite of low-latency networking and decentralization effects in original Bitcoin. So, good luck with all that BSV!

A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting Bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the Bitcoin would be higher - now it would be backed by pizzas ''and'' haircuts. When Bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his Bitcoin-savings.Currently, Bitcoin is in beta development stage, and some new features need to be implemented before the system is well suited for real use.

Sadly Gapcoin was de-listed from cryptopia.co.nz on 10th Jan. 2019 (as previously advised).Furthermore, it would seem that we have had a lucky escape as cryptopia.co.nz was apparently hacked on 14th/15th Jan. 2019 and remains closed at present.

Keep us posted about any developments!...@UsernameNumber7 - trade.mct.plus looks OK - I will contact them via discord when I find a moment.Indeed GJHiggins repository seems to be working backwards ... Contrary to popular belief, I'm able to build new binaries for windows and linux. However, I do not currently have a fully working / up-to-date / secure build environment, but I'm working to fix that soon.I have mentioned Gapcoin development to the guys who had recently forked Bitcoin ABC to Bitcoin Stash. These guys are competent 'Bitcoin' developers and I hope that we might work with them in the future. See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5043802.0Does your repo. SwissKnife1000/gapcoin - build a working QT successfully on Ubuntu 18.04 running without error 'loadlocale.c:129: _nl_intern_locale_data: Assertion `cnt < (sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME) / sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME[0]))' failed.' and where 'export LC_ALL=C' etc., will only fix the issue temporarily ?The Gapcoin daemon (and QT wallet) will compile and run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS - so, in terms of operating systems, we are OK until early 2020.I do need to spend more time to familiarize myself with the code base. Sadly, other things always take priority.I have been optimizing the CRT mining sets for the higher merits. Despite some of the 'safety' restrictions in the code base (1024 shift etc.,) I remain confident that we could hit a merit of around 46 with the current implementation! We just need enough base level hashing power (from in-wallet mining) and CRT miners who know 'how to' mine correctly to progress the difficulty. Guide and sets in progress ...Upgrading the code base will also ensure that the Prime Gap results can continue to be of much higher merits....J0nn9 did incredible work here. I will be adding some limited information and links to the gapcoin.club website in due course.I'm also going to try and contact some of his family members and colleagues. I feel that it's somewhat relevant to know if his family have access to his coins and/or if we can initialize a donation address for them as we continue to progress the project. If his original Gapcoin is assumed to be inaccessible, then we perhaps have even more in common with Bitcoin than we thought....Never a better time to start mining / trading / accepting Gapcoin folks! (IMHO).   8:33:33 PM ?  Still, "Running bitcoin" ... Thanks Hal ! Bitcoin Stash can preserve the coins (wealth) of those who might of been unfortunate enough to follow the wrong path ...I feel this will become more apparent in time.Bitcoin Stash is therefore born out of necessity, by folks who actually care. Nothing more, nothing less.Merged mining FTW !    Prescient Glad you got Gapcoin synced. Most recent blockchain snapshot is here:- https://gapcoin.network/downloads/Gapcoin_blockchain.zip- https://gapcoin.club/windows-gui-setup.php (has addnodes)- https://gapcoin.club/linux-gapcoind-setup.php...The 'old' noncepool repo is here:- https://github.com/noncepool?tab=repositories (MPOS based pool)The pool closed down for an unknown reason (all coin offerings, not just Gapcoin).Pooled mining for Gapcoin has never taken advantage of the CRT mining, which has the potential to hit blocks with a factor of magnitude above the current network difficulty.CPU and GPU mining on this basis would likely smash a new world record Prime Gap with every new block....Having only one active pool will ofc lead to increased mining centralization, without any competition - exactly as with the arrival of Slushpool for Bitcoin, back in the day. However, the Gapcoin network will become more decentralized (arguably) as we attract new users, miners and exchanges.So, in general terms, we require a pool.Competition breeds competition and nothing attracts the crowd like the crowd etc.,The Gapcoin community has largely being participating for the Math (to date), so this is the way forward ...I still have my mining guide for the original pool and will happily re-publish it, as well as advertise any working pool at gapcoin.club .

Dr. Russel Carlson, assistant professor of mathematics, said this years Pi Day is Rounded Pi Day because when the number is rounded to the fourth decimal place, it equals 3.1416.According to Frey, the department wanted to take advantage of the unique date to promote the Math Learning Center. Also known as the Math Lab, the center has its own computer lab where students can receive help from tutors with their math homework.Even though the party is done every year, Frey said, It was kind of a bigger deal for us this semester because it was happening after the first week of school as opposed to near the end of the semester.Frey said the tutors wanted to show their fun side. He said, We just wanted to say, Hey, were tutors, were fun, we like to party, and were friendly people. Were trying to put a little more fun in math because without something like a math lab, math is such a pain for people.After serving free pizza and pie, Dr. Carlson gave a presentation about the history of the number pi. The earliest record we have of it dates back to 2000 BC. There was an old, Egyptian papyrus known as the Rhind Papyrus. It has an approximation of pi: 16 divided by 9 quantity squared, said Carlson.Carlson said the idea of the number pi is also found in the Bible. He said, When King Solomon was building his temple, there are all of these descriptions and dimensions. For the molten basin in 1 Kings 7:23, it says it was 10 cubits across and 30 cubits round about. That ratio - 30 divided by 10 - is three, an approximation of pi.Fascinated by the progress humans have made, Carlson said, Currently we know over five trillion digits of pi thanks to computers. I have a file with the first million digits, but theres no way Id save a file with all five trillion.After Dr. Carlsons presentation, students and math faculty competed in a competition to see who could solve a rubix cube the fastest. Then, students and faculty participated in a competition to see who could write the most amount of digits of pi. Carlson won, writing 40 digits after the decimal.Students then competed in a pie-eating contest where they had to clear a plate of whipped cream. DonEliezer Baize, a sophomore from Kahuku studying mathematics and a math lab tutor, won the contest and received a free apple pie as his prize.Baize said he was happy with how the activity turned out. Students love food, so we figured we gotta hook up those college students with some free pie. We threw in pizza, making it a solid homerun.Frey said, People dread math, so its not only our job to help them with their homework, but to relieve their stress. Activities like this are perfect excuses to have fun, and we dont get those too often.The Math Lab is located in GCB 177.

BSV is likely to bring a potential fork of Bitcoin Cash by causing incompatibility with Bitcoin Cash network and therefore create a new cryptocurrency asset - Bitcoin-SV (Token: BSV). Should it happen, all Bitcoin Cash holders will then receive BSV assets against a 1:1 ratio on your BCH assets. As a responsible cryptocurrency trading platform who guarantees maximum protection for customer assets, we decide to make the following precautions for a potential fork: 1. On the basis of snapshot during the potential forking, we will allocate BSV to your accounts against a 1:1 ratio on your BCH assets. 2. After the fork, we will release a BSV/BCH trading pair in CoinEx so you can buy or sell BSV. 3. CoinEx will not support BSV deposit and withdrawal until its chain is stabilized and all supporting services e.g. wallet are available. Please refer to our official announcement for more information. Potential security risks Unlike the previous forked assets, Bitcoin-SV (SV) lacks the replay protection mechanism, which will bring chaos to the entire Bitcoin Cash network, causing unnecessary asset loss for users. Therefore, CoinEx strongly recommends that Bitcoin-SV (SV) could take the concerns into consideration and add replay protection mechanism to avoid any unnecessary loss. CoinEx will protect your assets Together with ViaBTC mining pool, CoinEx will guard your assets even if theres no replay protection. Attention To avoid unnecessary asset loss, CoinEx recommends all users to deposit their BCH assets to CoinEx before the potential forking. We will provide 100% protection for your assets and please be assured that you will receive the forked asset of BSV as promised. CoinEx reserves the rights of final explanation of the announcement."- https://www.coinex.com/announcement/detail?id=124 Good.

If your only in this for 'profit', then you probably have the game all wrong!Yes the coin market cap top 200 has changed considerably within the last year...Most real and genuine alternative crypto currency projects (some with massive potential) have been seemingly displaced, forgotten or abandoned over equally or more 'worthless' tokenization i.e. similar to derivatives in financial markets.- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security)..."The concept of tokenization, as adopted by the industry today, has existed since the first currency systems emerged centuries ago as a means to reduce risk in handling high value financial instruments by replacing them with surrogate equivalents."...- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)..."In finance, a derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying entity." ...So, now that the 'industry' has largely replaced long-term intrinsic value (proven in Bitcoin code), with short-term 'greed' i.e. tokenization and derivatives - how can we expect to truly leverage that original value or worth?...Between 2013 and 2017 I spent a lot of my time on this forum in the Altcoin boards - for good reason.In one of my posts (which I will search for and {link here}) I stated that Bitcoin's value was now effectively backed by Pizza, Haircuts and Alt. coins.In another post I also stated that most of these altcoin crypto currencies (bitcoin clones) would simply eventually disappear....Avoid eventual de-tokenization and re-focus on what actually builds intrinsic value in the markets you are looking to 'profit' from.Here is the original bitcoin.org website:- https://web.archive.org/web/20100327210623/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/faq..."What is Bitcoins value backed by?Bitcoin is valued for the things it can be exchanged to, just like all the traditional paper currencies are.When the first user publicly announces that he will make a pizza for anyone who gives him enough Bitcoins, then he can use Bitcoins as payment to some extent - as much as people want pizza and trust his announcement. A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting Bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the Bitcoin would be higher - now it would be backed by pizzas ''and'' haircuts. When Bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his Bitcoin-savings.Currently, Bitcoin is in beta development stage, and some new features need to be implemented before the system is well suited for real use. The system already works on the basic level, though, and you can trade with it if you want to."...That was probably written by Satoshi (or with his input), and yes whilst Bitcoin had to start somewhere ... do you see any mention of tokenization or derivatives in 'fake' financial markets. None whatsoever - just real world examples of actual 'local' currency being used buy people and businesses.'We' have lost our way ...The world's elite and the bankster's are asserting and utilizing (effectively stealing) Blockchain technology to their own ends ...'Criminals' are continuing to create fake ICO's and 'SCAM's' for folks to 'invest' in ...So, please continue to sell them your Digital Gold in exchange for representative Plastic Buttons and I will see you at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.*This post does not constitute financial advice whatsoever* Indeed. I'm well aware of the fact that that video is not directly related to Bitcoin, although perhaps we spelled peer-to-peer 'wrong'.  I was just trying to get folks to think outside the box in this regard.Yes A goes to B, but does it always need to go directly? What alternative channels of 'trust' might we utilize, circumvent, protect or obfuscate between parties and how?Think steganography, mesh networks, radio frequencies, morse code, sending physical hardware through the postal system etc.,At one time it was thought that finding a solution for the double spending problem was impossible or improbable, until Satoshi came along.Your OP question asked if we lost blockchain's gift of pseudonymity - not directly if we lost speed, security, privacy or trust (and for some the ability to transact freely and openly without hindrance, fear or oppression) - which are obviously all related factors when using Bitcoin, in this regard.- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship Nope (sorry) I don't have their email address and even if I did then releasing other folks personal details to a completely random entity would not be something I would consider doing.Anyhow, that account is still active sometimes so maybe you might try to PM them directly?

I'm not asserting that anyone is a 'scammer', although some of this stuff is outright 'crazy'.    Nope. Not the 2nd, just the first forum member to post in Satoshi's 'welcome to the new bitcoin forum' thread.In terms of Satoshi as a 'legend' and proceeding mythopoeia, you will further appreciate this type of nom de plume;- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Blissett_(nom_de_plume)If the Satoshi name is actually taken from the (elsewhere) cited cypherpunk video game / puzzle - then we should perhaps seek to better understand this collective amalgamation / origin of ideas and sentiments.A Zen saying to keep me 'sane' - "Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the Masters; seek what they sought".I've heard Craig Wright (for example) state the Bitcoin is/was not Anarchistic. Of course it is, by it's very nature, you cannot set about constructing an alternative monetary system without knowing the disruption it would potentially cause to the current status quo. We can see this demonstrated quite clearly though early Libertarian type support of Bitcoin. Hence, 'anonymity' is/was always a prerequisite....Here is a great example of this established mindset experience of an original cypherpunk, although I think we can safely assert that Satoshi Nakamoto is not Joey Allegra ...The Money Machine- https://moxie.org/stories/money-machine/ oh wow!

We can all envisage situations where speed and security actually take preference over privacy and anonymity. As seen in the Changing threats to privacy video I shared above, the key is user choice.However, Person-to-Person transactions within four walls will always be more private than using the internet.Consider this, do you actually even need the internet (active) to transact with Bitcoin?- https://youtu.be/hwohadcUv4A When I first discovered Bitcoin I guess I asked myself the following;1. Does the system work (as a digital cash) - yes, seems so.2. Does the system attribute the functions of cash (fiat) - yes, pseudo-privacy and pseudonymity - which it does without centralization - cool!Being an active user of privacy systems like Tor (and advocate through agency i.e. action) I also realized the facets and pitfalls of Bitcoin in this regard. Much as the OP has described ...For example, in terms of a strong adversary, if you (have ever) run your Bitcoin wallet on clearnet then your ISP, the three letter agencies and your government(s) know that you (or someone in your household or office etc.,) are a Bitcoin user. The same applies to visiting this forum etc.,Most of the general population of the world does not understand the true level of mass surveillance in this regard. Your meta data (and everything you do on the internet) is collected and now stored for at least 100 years i.e. the entire history of you. This includes your encrypted data and this has been happening long before the Snowden revelations, examples ...- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Data_CenterConsider that this does not even included the data that you give away freely to the corporations and big business on the internet everyday.Changing threats to privacy ...- https://youtu.be/dBtmzY5gcO8?t=2m53s...Perhaps the most important aspect in terms of individual user privacy is cash-in i.e. the mode and means of acquisition - basically how a user got Bitcoin in the first place - were they mined, purchased directly or exchanged in return for goods and services.Having said this, you can still use Bitcoin today with quite strong Pseudonymity, if you think carefully about what you are doing and you practice good obfuscation techniques.Privacy is not easy, especially on the internet. Maintaining an individual right to privacy whilst affording protections against things like terrorism and crime is difficult. Indeed. To clarify though, they started that alt. cryptocurrency along with a crypto crowd funding website that was known as StartJOIN - and whilst the platform 'helped' a number of projects, it ultimately failed and they were quick to distance themselves from the fallout. Quite sad in many respects, however both Max and Stacy promoted StartCOIN heavily on the Keiser Show (on RT) whilst it was on the way up (and prior to that ofc). Not listened to the podcast yet, did they mention what StartCOIN did? Thought not. Indeed. I'd like to get records presented and updating 'live' via https://gapcoin.club website - however, that will require a server upgrade to one with a whole bunch of RAM, and for where we are now I see other things taking priority.For on-boarding new users I've started looking at options for web wallets and contacted the developer of piWallet.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=911212.0They also mentioned a mobile wallet (need to review it currently).It's an open source script and I would handle some security additions + Tor access for the web wallet etc., I'm not really a fan of web wallets, although we would be able to add a proof-of-reserve (in gapcoin holdings) to provide immediate remedy in the event of something catastrophic....Contacted https://walletgenerator.net/ and adding gapcoin via- https://github.com/MichaelMure/WalletGenerator.net/wiki/How-to-add-a-new-currency...Anyhow, I have some other projects which must now take a priority over this, but know that I am continually working on background stuff and will keep infrastructure running / updated.

Much like $7 worth of BTC today. Nope. Not as far as I know.I do remember being sent a very random PGP email by someone in 2010 who had used (or knew of my exchange service) offering me 10,000 BTC for nothing, although even with the low value at that time I declined the offer anyway. I think I deleted the email, however it was most certainly from a 'cypherpunk'-esque type of character.It didn't register with myself as being very significant until I watched one of the early Bitcoin film documentaries (The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin - 2014) and the same thing was mentioned by someone else who later ran or started a more prolific exchange service. I will try to find the approximate min. when it is mentioned by them.Don't know if it was Satoshi or not....If you are asking about general acquisition of bitcoin in the early days of the forum then basically it was so easy to mine some with a single CPU machine that you didn't need to think about it in that regard.

I was also curious to see if anyone would actually bother to participate. There was literally nothing much to do with your Bitcoin at that time and in hindsight that would of been the better option for me personally too.Anyhow, the Bitcoin Pizza's indeed remain the first real world example of someone offering up payment for perishable goods with Bitcoin. One always requires beer (free as in) + pizza for a good home game of Texas Hold'em, right? However, it's much more likely that Laszlo was (subliminally?) inspired by the original bitcoin.org website here ... https://web.archive.org/web/20100327210623/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/faq - Read: "...

Indeed from a records perspective it would be ideal to retain or to at least present all data.However, this is perhaps a bit like the Butterfly Effect i.e. stale shares and prime gap records are only really 'lost' ... like tears in the rain!We know that commensurate with network difficulty increasing - new blocks will match and exceed existing records."Your record prime gap has now been assimilated by the borg!"    Mining difficulty has increased (on average) over the past few weeks. At a network difficulty of around 23 a single core CPU should still mine at least one block within 24 to 48 hours. At the current price this is now close to the threshold.Remember that new Gapcoin blocks must mature 101 blocks before being spendable, so you might have mined blocks that are still to be credited to your balance?We are perhaps a bit closer to having a new working pool. VPS instances will be able to continue mining using the standalone miner and hopefully also continue to run / off-set the cost of a full node.Gapcoin has been profitable for myself (and others) long-term, however, like anything cryptocurrency this is very variable in the short-term.Moreover, consider if you had mined an entire bitcoin block back in 2010-2011 and held that block until 2017-2018. Again, nothing is certain in the crypto space but as a general rule - quitters never win and winners never quit.I wish you good luck and welcome you to mining gapcoin.   The new Bitcoin <> FIAT 101 ... ?1.

I've dropped the Gapcoin Club heading and simply replaced it with Gapcoin Cryptocurrency, as I felt that the notion of a club might pertain some potential new adopters to perceive a membership requirement or something else i.e. no barrier to entry.I've added additional links for 'free' server credits with various hosting companies - so hopefully, as I now commence with extensive traffic exchange promotion we might see an increase in nodes and hash rate etc., we can but try! Basic web banners will go 'live' by this Friday.

No thank you.- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_the_Holocaust       Personally I'd simply like to see the Gapcoin project reach its full potential, mathematically speaking.Mining difficulty is currently low and the most important thing to realize is that we broke a world record prime gap with around only 50+ nodes on the network and without a pool.Imagine the prime gap records to be discovered with similar computational power to that of the Bitcoin network!So many copy and paste coins have been created on this forum - many now abandoned or defunct. Gapcoin is clearly developed by a mathematician and actually closely follows Bitcoin's finite economic model, with some further improvements in the logarithmic coin issuance through mining (imho). The total number of Gapcoin's to be mined will be somewhere between 10 to 30 million i.e. probably around 20 million.The most important thing about this project is the data / optimization of the prime gaps.In the future, this type of data optimization on a blockchain (not by gapcoin per say) could potentially be used to solve all sorts of real world problems - anything from research into individually tailored medicines, construction, or simply for calculating the ever changing distance between rock and stardom etc.,In short, the product (i.e. what is produced) and/or the process of data optimization on a blockchain does not necessarily need to be currency.Gapcoin is a working example of both.

Despite references to my service being originally made via the bitcointalk.org forum.Realize that I myself lost a lot of totally legally earned money (via retail forex trading and some advertising revenues) when LR was shut down and users funds were confiscated by the US government - personal / business account funds which I myself also intended to move back into BTC ...Something really stinks here folks! Obviously! I, BitcoinFX hereby state that when I started mining bitcoin in early 2010 I used the following windows program (Prio) - https://www.prnwatch.com/prio/ - to watch all incoming and outgoing TCP/IP connections to the Bitcoin network from my home PC, which was fully port forwarded on 8333.I distinctly recall resolving the website of said Dave Kleiman, as to this effect, the domain name was also acting as a bitcoin P2P node.Either ... www. DigitalComputerForensicExpert .com or www. DaveKleiman .com or www. ComputerForensicExaminer .comThe website had a distinct design that stuck in my memory coupled with the fact that, as an individual who had recently discovered Bitcoin, this reassured myself that other IT professionals were interested in the project (if only from a research / testing standpoint).Kindest Regards, Indeed. I always found Satoshi to be very direct and to the point, almost with an air of arrogance in this regard sometimes we might assume?For example, I've heard people say that Satoshi's quote; "If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry." - 2010-07-29 - sounds like CWS i.e. @ProfFaustus on twitter. However, the ego presented by this fellow is enough to put me off considering even using BCH let alone anyone new to Bitcoin, in my honest and humble opinion.If CWS was a protagonist behind bitcoin (with Dave Kleiman / others) then I think we can assume for certain that Kleiman or someone else did most of the communicating here on bitcointalk? If Kleiman knew he was potentially unwell and/or dying, then we might certainly understand his perspective in regards to making such a comment, if he did.CWS, according to his twitter feed is working on more papers ... to be published ...

Why the Cryptosphere Is Losing Its Mind Over This 18-Digit Number- https://news.bitcoin.com/why-the-cryptosphere-is-losing-its-mind-over-this-18-digit-number/00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Exceptionally_Simple_Theory_of_Everything I will neither confirm nor deny if that is the correct answer. The question is intentionally cryptic and one that only the real Satoshi might answer to me forthright.However, why would Satoshi want to build a Bitcoin Bank - when Bitcoin itself is essentially a fully decentralized banking system....I discovered bitcoin.org (and this forum) through a very random and extensive search for 'currency' and 'digital cash'. In this regard I was not a developer or someone that Satoshi attracted to the project through the cypherpunks mailing list etc., Thus my private / encrypted text conversations with Satoshi were equally random. They have never been shared anywhere and no logs exist at my end.I could read and write (bad) code at that time, having participated in various TH poker robots, MT4 forex software and by just simply being a Linux user. I knew the software 'worked'. I ran two full Bitcoin nodes from my home in the UK and mined 24/7 - I was excited and enthused with the bitcoin project to begin with and proceeded with extensive TE advertising under my own volition. - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45.msg559#msg559If anyone saw that TE banner on the internet and found Bitcoin, it was probably promoted by myself.  I recognized that the project might draw a critical mass through widespread adoption and I was of course 'invested' through the mining process. On this basis I calculated the number of users (nodes etc.,) and gave it some time. The level of adoption simply took much longer than I expected - probably due to the unique nature of the project. Unfortunately, I decided to sell my mined coins and to move onto other (supposedly more profitable) projects, at that time. I had some investors who did not fully understand what this project could become and I was pushed in other directions.  Some personal circumstances also meant that I no longer had the time to tinker with this hobby / start-up.I think I will post a screen shot of my old 'transfer' wallet so that people can understand just how invested I was at that time.I did envisage a problem with circulation being very likely to out-strip supply and demand, thus potentially leaving the price in the doldrums, forever. I was also concerned that the government or relevant authorities would eventually try to shut it down (realize that this task would of been much much easier back then). I also considered issues with regards to scalability and to the finite supply - which I still do, "you cannot trade in diminishing intangibility", this does still become an issue when all bitcoin is mined (note that this effect will only be seen outside of our lifetimes, if at all).One might consider myself as a segregated witness of bitcoin inception.- https://youtu.be/RXMnDG3QzxE   ...EDIT: Unquestionably, for the community, the only real definitive proof of Satoshi is a signed and verifiable message and/or key.

In the beginning, not to be mistake, all three factions operate in coordination.Rothschilds, the Jews who financed Hitler, are ideologically inclined left, they support atheism, the Gnostics. Soros is their pawn.There is nothing wrong with the left ideas, but let's look at Italian Prime Minister Monti and former Greek Prime Minister Papademos. Or another quasi-leftist, French President Hollande. Everyone are Bilderbergers, and everyone are resigned vassals of the Rothschilds.How to identify vassals?They push for the privatization of everything that normal society would never privatize; they are in favor for austerity measures, for the abolition of workers rights, dismissal of workers. They resignedly worship criminal banking system. They do not question the justification of the attack on Libya. They accept the official version of the 911, they accept deception in the form of "global warming" and "carbon tax". They accept vaccinations with poisoned vaccines. They devotionaly worship the idea of the EU, which is horribly orwellian creation. They accept "Agenda 21", which is too obvious orwellian plan under the auspices of the United Nations. They push for GMO foods, proved to be dangerous.Rockefellers act on the Christian platform, although they have with Christianity the same as the Rothschilds with the Gnostics. These are Nazi bullies who aims to bombard all non-white nations. In a strange symbiosis together with Israel, which is a private country of the Rothschilds, they are fighting against Muslims. Among other things, their duty is to prevent the development of science and technology.Jesuits are behind the killings of many leftist politicians in South America and Africa, and behind establishment of the military junta. Jesuits murdered Russian Tsar Nicholas II Romanov and put Lenin. They are also responsible for killing over 200 Japanese politicians. Jesuits also control China. However, in recent time the politicians of China and Japan are increasingly encouraged to disobedience. Although the Rothschilds are cheifs on the physical level, Jesuits are still superior to them. Even their Black Pope, Jesuit General, have above himself Grey Pope, one of the Ptolemaic Papal bloodline, who operate from the etheric level. But, by recent channeled information, this figure is removed from this planet since 2010.God of the Illuminati is neither Christ nor Satan, or Lucifer. Their God is the material world.

My current work-around for this is to use cpulimit;Code:sudo apt-get install cpulimit screenRun gapcoind;Code:cd gapcoin/src && ./gapcoindCode:cdYou then need to start a screen instance for top and run top;Code:screen -S topCode:topThis will display all of your systems process ID's - PID's.You then need to find the process ID for gapcoind. It's most probably near the top of the list.Then hold and press crtl + A + D to exit the screen session. Note that if you want to re-enter the same screen session later to check % CPU mining is working then you need to do;Code:screen -r topNOT Code:screen -S top as this will just start another new screen session! You only need to do this after you have re-started your server!Back at the prompt execute;Code:cpulimit -p PID -l 64 /dev/zero &Where PID is your gapcoind numbered process ID and 64 (example) is the maximum CPU usage for gapcoind.Note : I wouldn't recommend going much below 64% CPU usage or much above 74% CPU usage per single core instance - depending on what else your server is running.Hit enter twice, first to confirm the process ID and second to action the CPU limit into effect.Now we can start mining with gapcoind;Code:cd gapcoin/src && ./gapcoind setgenerate true 1Code:./gapcoind getprimespersecCode:./gapcoind getmininginfoetc.,Code:cdYou can now confirm that the mining process (gapcoind) is using the set CPU limit by checking top again.Code:screen -r topThen hold and press crtl + A + D to exit the screen session.To exit the SSH connection with the server it's;Code:exit and enter....I will link to this post from https://gapcoin.club/linux-gapcoind-setup.php and also add more 'free' cloud server company options for mining in this regard.Note that the server company may still open a ticket for 'high CPU usage / abuse' - you might explain to them that you are running a node for a mathematics / scientific research project and tell them you can further restrict the CPU usage, if necessary.The flag for constant CPU usage varies. However, if your total system use remains on average below 85% to 90% then you will probably go undetected as a 'good egg' in this regard.Good luck! Thanks pdazzl. I will certainly give it a go.

That alone is a lot more than Bitcoin's highest market capitalization. If you can't 'kill' a robust decentralized financial technology, the easy option is to manipulate the price.Remember that this is potentially about ownership of the commodity. It is a zero sum game in terms of the markets. They don't care if you win or lose. I think the worst factor of this is that any manipulation is potentially made simpler when the BTC price is higher.Remember : First they take it away from you, then they sell it back to you.orBuy, Buy, Buy Bitcoin, then Bye Bye Bitcoin ?...The OP's assertion is therefore valid and the answer is yes (considering all other price factors, actors, variables etc.,) I thought it important to further clarify the disparity of their 'illusion' (or perhaps it's just a misunderstanding?) ...FIAT currency is backed by 'nothing' (except central bank bonds and debt) and is effectively created out of thin-air.

In broad global economic terms, it might be argued that Bitcoin has in fact become a replacement 'safety net', for what was the Bretton Woods system.One wonders if; (1) Bitcoin is an 'accident' of design through necessity? or (2) Bitcoin is an intentionally designed fail safe (beta!), running in parallel to a 'known-to-be-broken' financial system (insert conspiracy theories here)? or (3) Elements of both?...Either way, what would appear to be a massive price manipulation does seem to be indicative of classic bait and switch tactics by 'Big Players'.

No Pre-mine. Based on Bitcoin Core code base.- Not a token. Not an ICO. No pre-sale.- Currently still operates on a fully decentralized basis and unlike Bitcoin you can still mine Gapcoin with a fairly standard PC using your CPU and the wallet (just like you could with Bitcoin in 2009-2010 before pooled mining was invented). Gapcoin had a pool at one time, but it closed down.- Difficulty adjusts every block and increases logarithmically. Which means slightly more coins are produced, when more people are mining!- Every new block (with increased mining difficulty) has the potential to be a new world record prime gap.- As of December 2017, the largest known merit value (prime gap) and first with merit over 40, was discovered by the Gapcoin network. (quick - someone call Norris McWhirter)....- https://youtu.be/fxEqIt-NUSY @j0nn9 - An open question from the Gapcoin community ...Do you now have plans to continue with Gapcoin's development and/or with the future release of updated software, now or in the future ?Kindest Regards, Indeed. Gapcoin's value is undoubtedly, backed by Math ...  We can assert that all prime gap records attained by Gapcoin do add to the value of the entire blockchain.However, this perceived relationship between proof-of-work and value is somewhat unquantifiable in reality.In terms of Gapcoin, if we consider 'the block' which currently holds the record for the prime gap of maximum known merit - do said coins at this address hold a value above other coins on the chain? In reality, probably not. Things are only worth what someone is willing to exchange them for at any given time. Moreover, auctioning the private key / wallet for the address also carries 'risk' for the buyer, detracting from value or worth.If we consider transfer of said coins, in this regard, then the only real claim of additional value is perhaps linked to the origin of the coins. It has been asserted already that Bitcoin's of a known questionable origin (or tainted coins) may carry an (actual or perceived) reduced value over coins produced by new blocks or those with a determined 'clean' origin. This concept was developed in Zcash where "All coins are created equal.", due to the ability to hide the origin of coins via shielded addresses.TBH most folks considering or using Gapcoin as a currency probably won't really care a jot in this regard, in exactly the same way that most users don't know or don't care about the cryptography which underlies Bitcoin.You are 100% correct though.

A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting Gapcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the Gapcoin would be higher - now it would be backed by pizzas "and" haircuts. When Gapcoins have become accepted widely enough, he could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his Gapcoin-savings.Currently, Gapcoin is in beta development stage, and some new features need to be implemented before the system is well suited for real use.

Thank you @gjhiggins, always interesting work and contributions!

I will be moving the set (tentative) milestones forward.Gapcoin has remained a Math project first and crypto-currency second of course. Having a functional meta data explorer for prime gap records will be most excellent indeed! If you intend to browse with TBB it is unwise to also use the TBB Tor as a SOCKS proxy for other applications. You may actually be breaking / leaking both your TBB anonymity (when browsing) and the SOCKS applications anonymity (PIVX).Instead you should install the Tor Expert Bundle and ensure that you proxify PIVX through that Tor SOCKS proxy separately. It is perfectly OK to use the TBB and the Expert Bundle on the same machine. They use different ports when configured correctly i.e. with 2 version of Tor running on the same machine.Here is a link to the post I made recently on the Zcash forum in regards to using 'Zcash on Tor' ;- https://forum.z.cash/t/set-up-guide-for-running-zcash-on-tor-ubuntu-debian-linux-desktop/18748If you require actual privacy and anonymity when using PIVX and/or Tor then don't use MS Windows - period....After some downtime of the pivxproxy.zone website (due to some issues with the hosting provider - hopefully resolved) the service is now back online.

Among other things, it fixes two issues in earlier versionsof the hidden service code that would allow an attacker to cause ahidden service to exit with an assertion failure."Gapcoin Club Tor nodes can be found here, if anyone needs them;- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822498.msg18512899#msg18512899Yes, Gapcoin has more genuine Tor nodes than the recent and 2nd incantation of "Torcoin".  ... and GAP is also helping with research for tornull.org - as mining Gapcoin (even on single core instances is mostly above BE) helping to self-fund the nodes, some of which are also Bridges!Math + Science + Research and yet most folks on this forum would still seemingly rather invest or support 'vapour-ware' ICO's  *shrugs*   I've dropped Dana Jacobsen an email to gauge if they might have any interest in helping with the Gapcoin project.- https://archive.org/details/danajacobsennumbertheory - print "Just another Perl hacker,";- who also codes in C, C+GMP and is somewhat legendary in this field, I'd imagine.TBH I have collated a database of university math / science depts, ready to be contacted as we progress, hopefully. It is a matter of computational certainty....Dana Jacobsen - https://github.com/danaj I will say that I'm not incapable of completing a new windows Gapcoin wallet release including updated SSL etc., however a new competent developer is required to move the project forward.Gapcoin becoming fully 'decentralized' without a working pool for sometime now has been interesting. Mining in the wallet should remain an essential focus for an attempt at a new world record prime gap - along with pooled mining.Right now, we really need a new trusted pool to muster some fresh interest and to start the new thread topic etc., I have been asking various long-term community pool operators if they would take a look at running a new Gapcoin pool.@gjhiggins is currently unable to assist with Gapcoin development due to other time constraints.Any pooled mining at a set 'shift' difficulty increases the total network difficulty and the potential for finding new prime gap records.For example, I'm currently solo mining using the crt-512 shift CPU miner and with a network difficulty between 21 to 22 - hitting a new block will often therefore carry a merit of 24 and above.Pooled mining with the crt shifts (which gives opportunity for higher merits) did not exist with noncepool (gapcoin's only ever working pool). However, pooled mining could be made to work in this regard, as long as miners know which shift to mine with and at which port provided by the pool etc.,Although, with an increased network hashrate and difficulty - blocks with higher merits will be found automatically." if the difficulty reaches 35.4245 38.07, every block will be a new world record:Top 20 Prime Gaps - http://primerecords.dk/primegaps/gaps20.htm "So, currently we need to reach a difficulty of around 30 to 35 and/or one of the (solo) miners at a higher shift needs to be 'lucky'.With a couple of pools, CPU and/or GPU solo mining and real CPU cloud mining instances in operation - it is highly feasible to smash a new prime gap record with gapcoin mining. That's entirely up to the individual.Remembering that;PoB was partly designed to replace the need for constantly upgrading physical mining hardware, as seen with PoW in Bitcoin.~ Imagine that you have 10 BTC - at the current market value how much would you save (hold) long-term vs how much you might need to spend on goods or services or to perhaps invest into new mining equipment - with a hope to ROI and make profit etc.,If your looking for ROI over time then PoB is probably the main option.PoS was primarily designed for security of the blockchain (as seen with Peercoin), although many coins have used it to provide stake Interest or to eliminate the need for PoW entirely. However, due to the low percentage of PoS in Slimcoin, security of the network is its intended function in the main. A few wallets staking a small amount of coins occasionally is a good ideal.If Slimcoin were ever to see new PoW mining pools again and popularity / usage similar to Bitcoin, then having a large amount of active PoB coins might equate to running a large Bitcoin mining farm, mostly without any overheads. Most future Slimcoin users in this regard would be restricted to doing PoW pooled mining with some PoS interest returns, as doing limited PoB would be unlikely to see any return, unless they were extremely 'lucky' - a bit like solo mining an entire BTC block at today's difficulty with say a single antminer s3. Indeed.Coin control for PoB! Slimcoin truly is a mine field!    To PoW mine Slimcoin in the wallet just go to console and type;setgenerate true- to mine with all CPU cores or;setgenerate true n- where n is the number of system CPU cores that you want to mine with i.e. 1,2,3,4 ......Failing that I have a PoW wallet that I mined around 2,500 SLM to if the offer is a good one.  - money is only money when its moving Its probably important to note that Slimcoin remains a very experimental crypto-currency.The tri-block generation system uses: PoW, PoS and PoB and is rather 'messy'. Overtime, the users wallet can become somewhat unresponsive, particularly if the wallet has a fairly large number of transactions and/or active PoB coins.TBH it might be advisable for Slimcoin users to try and adhere to the following rules;1 - Avoid staking coins (PoS) or setting active PoB with a wallet (address) that you solo mine (PoW) blocks with or transact with.2 - Avoid burning coins (PoB) with a wallet (address) that will be used for making / receiving numerous transactions. It is probably a good idea to use 3 or 4 separate wallet.dat files (making backups ofc); Wallet 1 - For (solo) mining PoW blocks. This wallet should be kept encrypted and mostly locked.Wallet 2 - For PoB minting only. Transfer your coins to 'burn' here. Avoid making numerous transactions. Avoid re-burning multiple sets of coins (especially overtime) and instead start a new fresh PoB only wallet, where possible. This wallet should be kept encrypted and unlocked for PoB minting only.Wallet 3 - For PoS minting mostly. This wallet should be kept encrypted and unlocked for mainly PoS minting. Add reservebalance=0 to your slimcoin.confWallet 4 - For your transactions and payments etc., This wallet should be kept encrypted and mostly locked (offline).The above will help your wallet from becoming unusable overtime. I concur. The PoB concept has proven itself to work, in that it does provide an ROI over time (at least in terms of the users total burnt coins).It has certainly remained difficult (at most times) to keep the wallet running 24/7 due to the state of the network (always improving) and continuing development work on the wallet releases etc., (again always improving).The PoB return is 'luck' based against the network consensus and it will be fascinating to see how Slimcoin can progress with a stable network and an increasing number of users, once again !?!Slimcoins PoB can in fact be likened to buying tickets for a lottery, where the original capital / stake remains secured. I had previously suggested in the old thread that the system is very similar (in some regards) to UK Premium Bonds;- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_BondHowever, Slimcoin is also unique in that it is a working example of a monetary system where the destruction of money is directly linked to the creation of new money.Quite how this coin has remained mostly unknown amongst the plethora of guff altcoins that have come and gone from these boards remains a mystery to me!Traditional banks or hedge funds, for example, could enable Slimcoin's blockchain model to provide a guaranteed ROI whilst also controlling capital supply. TBH more developers should of flocked to this coin in droves already! In terms of its economic model and structure alone, Slimcoin remains one of the most interesting experiments on bitcointalk and within the crypto space to date. Thanks to whoever extended the block explorer hosting! I was going to renew it (again) and was delighted that someone else had already contributed in this regard.Considering the future possibility for new bounties ...TBH I'm personally not really in support of built-in wallet exchanges or other kinds of wallet additions, certainly not in the main branch anyway.A wallet is a wallet IMHO and any connectivity to 3rd party apps / services etc., is mostly rather hideous in reality! However, a separate branch with built-in exchange functionality is certainly a possibility, if the community supports it. I'm not a developer for Gapcoin.I think that our basic essential community requirements (moving forward) included;1. A new known dev. who can bring the code base more up-to-date and compile a windows wallet with the latest SSL + we could also use a Mac wallet ofc.@PeterTheGrape - I'm wondering if @gjhiggins - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=254673 - would have the time and/or inclination to work on Gapcoin. It seems that many folks from this thread have also had a long-term mutual interest in Slimcoin - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1141676.0 , myself included, (with @gjhiggins now being the main Slimcoin projects take-over dev.) In fact, I'll drop him a PM after this post! I see no reason why my existing Gapcoin servers would be able to be extended to host a Slimcoin daemon as well.2. A working pool or two and perhaps a new faucet.With these aspects in place I'd be OK with starting a new thread and commencing with promotional activity for the new world record attempt.I'll soon add a second stage to the existing cloud mining guide to suggest limiting the default Gapcoin daemon miner to only utilize around 65% CPU - as Digital Ocean, Linode and Vultr don't seem to flag instances that are running Gapcoin with such a CPU restriction in place. It's not mining anyway, it's math and science.  To stand a real shot at a world record prime gap we only need to focus / increase the network hashing power for a relatively limited duration.  To think that I once donated 500 BTC to Gavin's faucet ... Here are the first BTC exchange rates by NewLibertyStandard - http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+RateWhilst the BTC history books https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin  cite BitcoinMarket as the first 'automated' bitcoin exchange - NewLibertyStandard in fact established / calculated the first base BTC dollar value from actual electricity usage - the free market approach clearly worked more successfully for the price.I also had a website making manual exchanges before the BitcoinMarket existed- https://web.archive.org/web/20100617031313/http://www.bitcoinfx.cz.cc/I'm certainly not a bitcoin millionaire today.

Their service is not endorsed by Tor."Anyone reading this should also see: https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html"Tor" and the "Onion Logo" are registered trademarks of The Tor Project, Inc.(2) "Torcoin" is making 'false' claims in regards to their current (and only) software release: Version 1.0.0(a) Despite claiming that; "Torcoin is fully integrated with the Tor project network", the current wallet software is not automatically running over the real Tor® network and therefore exposes the users real IP address on clearnet!Note that almost any crypto-coin on this forum can be run over the real Tor® network by configuring the proxy settings to use a Tor® daemon as a SOCKS proxy.(b) "Torcoin is 100% Anonymous, unlike Bitcoin.  Send & Receive payments with full privacy" - Note that "Stealth" addresses are not fully anonymous, in comparison to other anonymity technologies.(c) "By running TorCoin, you are increasing the number of nodes on the TOR network, and thereby helping people across the world remain anonymous." Again, this claim is currently false.Torcoin's existing wallet release does not run a real Tor® network node (Relay or Exit node) when the wallet is started. "Torcoin" software is therefore not currently able to reward actual Tor® network nodes operators, as they have also claimed....As someone who has hosted real Tor® software Relay and Exit nodes for more than 10 years (and have also been using Bitcoin since the year dot), I feel obliged to make the above facts known.~ Running genuine Tor® software nodes remains a thankless and mostly unrewarded task that I choose to undertake, as I believe in the right to privacy etc.,Furthermore, the real Tor Project Inc has long considered trying to enable said incentive mechanism's for real relay and exit node operators and various research papers have already been published;See: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-incentives-research-roundup-goldstar-par-braids-lira-tears-and-torcoinNote that the TorCoin paper mentioned is not the "TorCoin" of this forum thread!...Whilst the continuing development concept for a "TorCoin" maybe somewhat feasible - I fail to see how you can remedy the above situation.   Welcome!The torrc configurations posted in this thread are due for an update and/or should now be considered outdated.

Good for you sir! Genuinely. It is known that other people also have/had issues with coins being 'lost' or 'stuck' when PIVX was formerly known as DNET.Whilst it was my prerogative to sell, just looking back at some parts of this thread is hardly very reassuring.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262920.msg16606698#msg16606698What some here should know is that I hosted the majority of Tor addnode=.onion's for this coin. Over 80% of these nodes in fact;As well as the 4 DNET public Tor Relays. These nodes ran almost to capacity for months, however the benefits of hosting were outweighing the costs.I was not online for a few months, the devs. unfortunately seemingly made no effort to contact myself about the re-brand. Despite myself having been actively in contact with them to provide detailed information on settings etc., for them to also host some of their own nodes.We already know that the PIVX price has increased incredibly quickly (even in crypto terms) and therefore any opportunity to buy back-in has been more uncertain.So, not that great here for some.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262920.msg18565332#msg18565332 Whilst I'm here, do any PIVX community mods. have any idea why my post got 'flagged' by the 'system'...?- https://forum.pivx.org/t/pivx-on-tor-a-community-funded-proposal/245  - https://forum.pivx.org/t/my-posts-hidden-by-community-flags/317- https://forum.pivx.org/t/introducing-pivxproxy-zone/624Still supporting PIVX, although sometimes wondering on what's best. I too am just over 10,000 adrift from the 'borked' DNET wallet releases of around 6 months ago. The back-ups are incompatible with the current chain and after doing importprivkey the wallet corrupts soon after its re-started. TBH the situation that caused the incident was partly my fault, as I happened to be moving masternode balances at the time of also doing upgrades. As @tylerderden, a bunch of us were continually upgrading to the latest releases to try and re-establish a consensus of the then forked blockchain.The ongoing wallet updates (and some other factors) also caused me to sell over 30,000 DNET (now PIVX) before the re-brand.~ Being early to the crypto party is often seemingly problematic!- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262920.msg15877449#msg15877449 - Its around this time in the thread topic.However, I'm fairly confident that I might be able to recover the 10k one day with some concerted effort on my part.Still supporting PIVX as it does have future potential. (1) Relaying Tor traffic should always be optional.(2) Arguably the most 'anonymous', secure and correct way to run a .onion addnode is as ClientOnly 1 (clients never relay or exit Tor traffic, although they can except SOCKS and/or hidden_service connections).See: - https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en - always RTM ! I'd just like to clarify to you that integrating the actual Tor® software into your "Torcoin" wallet is where the potential issue might arise.... "Creating a new brand that incorporates the Tor brand is likely to lead to confusion, and commercial confusion is a sign of trademark infringement." ...Crypto currencies that have previously built Tor connectivity directly into the wallet, such as Stealthcoin, were not named "Torcoin" nor did they use the ticker "TOR" or the onion logo....The Tor Project, Inc. have previously discussed 'incentive mechanisms', (as a way to reward Relay and Exit node operators) for some years;See: - https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-incentives-research-roundup-goldstar-par-braids-lira-tears-and-torcoin - N.B. that the TorCoin mentioned in some research papers is not related to the coin of this thread, by my understanding.Incentive mechanisms relating to bandwidth have known privacy implications. If you are preposing to force wallets to act as Tor Relays or Exit nodes (which is not cool), then is it only the wallets staking balance which would provide a 'reward' ? As this cannot solve a 'nothing to stake' conundrum for new relays over time, for example....My intention is certainly not to 'troll' your thread and I have both interest and concerns here. If you are serious, you should perhaps contact The Tor Project, Inc. directly. That is what they are advising on their own website.Regards, EDIT:Do NOT download or run torcoin-qt.exe - the executable is confirmed to contain a wallet.dat stealing trojan.SHA256: d2efdd54f98bd45c7dc572ad84b071ccfdf20b9f25757ff052b96721d5e1e1d2File name: TorCoinWindows1.0.zipDetection ratio: 20 / 58https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d2efdd54f98bd45c7dc572ad84b071ccfdf20b9f25757ff052b96721d5e1e1d2/analysis/SHA256: 40387019beef2eb50cec3fe0ced82f81eec44140a17e9b1dfd3c895bba9af0b0File name: torcoin-qt.exeDetection ratio: 22 / 61https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/40387019beef2eb50cec3fe0ced82f81eec44140a17e9b1dfd3c895bba9af0b0/analysis/Do NOT download or run torcoin-qt.exe - the executable is confirmed to contain a wallet.dat stealing trojan.  (1) It's not TOR it's Tor, in fact with regards to the actual software it's Tor®(2) https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html ...   "Tor and the Onion Logo are registered trademarks of The Tor Project, Inc."

Although, I don't think that the 'true' pps value is being reflected here.What I do know is that these are (more or less) the optimal CPU settings for finding the most blocks with my system, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to speed up mining with the 512 large shift....If this community gets more organized and we have a couple of new pools running with tons of generic CPU miners to push the difficulty up + solo miners running the CRT then we could smash the record.The CRT miner did not exist when the pool was running at full-tilt. If a pool can be set-up to accept shares of differing shifts on different ports then this will be very interesting! I've just run some numbers on the approximate cost of generating 1 GAP against avg. electricity prices and hardware etc., and based on CPU mining at the current difficulty level (against a BTC price of more than $1000) 1 GAP coin should really have a min. value of no less than around 500 satoshi's.Anyone selling at less than 500 satoshi either has free hardware and/or free electricity, or perhaps mined / accumulated a lot after the pool closed down, or before the first block halving etc., GPU mining wouldn't of made that much difference.Its all relative, although something to think about.

Shifts above 28 seem to have a lower performance when CPU mining.The most optimal range is seemingly the 25 or 26 shift range. I think that the 26 range has a higher gaps per. day / primespersec ratio.2^25 = 335544322^26 = 67108864So,Code:setgenerate true -1 33554432 900000 25orCode:setgenerate true -1 67108864 900000 26Generation is limited to 'genproclimit' processors, -1 is unlimited. ^^ i.e. Num CPU Threads    Indeed. Gapcoin is a solid crypto-currency with a useful PoW, unlike Bitcoin.It also has an economic model to rival other crypto's, if we can start to build-up any kind of economy using GAP."The big improvement in comparison to Bitcoin is that instead of burning electricity for it's own sake, Gapcoins Proof of Work function actually does useful work by searching for large prime gaps - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap ""Specifications:PoW: custom, prime gapsBlock target time 2.5 minutesBlock reward proportional to the current difficultyBlock reward halving every 420000 (about 2 years)Cap: about 10 - 30 million GAPDifficulty adjusts every block and increases logarithmically (it will probably take years to get to 50)Fair launch:Gapcoin was not designed to enrich the early adopters or the coin creators! Unlike Primecoin, the more people that mine Gapcoin, the more coins per block will be produced. (Coin supply will increase logarithmically with the difficulty, this means it will grow in the beginning, but later, it won't change that much.)There wasn't any premine!"If the network hash power gets high enough then we do eventually stand a good chance at breaking the world record prime gap! Which would certainly be a news worthy event.When Gapcoin did have a working pool, folks were mining only at the lower shifts. With a couple of new pools, some regained popularity and bulk solo miners using the higher CRT shifts, then we might stand a very good chance at a new world record and if not then the blockchain will certainly be full of useful mathematical data.We already see regular connections from Universities across Europe, the US and Asia who are clearly interested in harvesting the math results that Gapcoin generates.

GPU mining is only around 6x faster. I'm not going to say "I'm an active developer" for Gapcoin, although I am trying to generate new interest in this project.Finding a new fully competent developer is certainly on the to do list.The Gapcoin network is stable, the although the wallet could use some feature and compatibility updates + new OpenSSL - Bitcoin v0.9.2 (which Gapcoin Core is built on) was actually a reasonable release with some necessary security fixes. - https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.2  The new 'unofficial' Gapcoin Club website is now live.- https://gapcoin.clubIt's somewhat basic for now, although provides Gapcoin and the community with a fresh starting point.The focus is currently towards maintaining and of course building on what we have.I've added a basic guide for windows users to get started with CPU mining Gapcoin in the wallet.- https://gapcoin.club/windows-gui-setup.phpThe Gapcoin Club hosts all of the IP nodes mentioned in the guide and thus the network has increased its overall stability. A guide for linux users should be online within the next week or so along with a new cloud mining guide.EDIT: - https://gapcoin.club/linux-gapcoind-setup.phpI will be cloning the official Gapcoin repo. to continue with development and we have some options for new Gapcoin mining pools.  The target date for Gapcoin to attempt a new world record prime gap will commence from 21st Oct. 2017.    @UsernameNumber7Glad that you have managed to get everything set-up.

I feel that I have this obligation to fulfil for s3v3nh4cks (and the PIVX team / community), who have genuinely been some of the kindest and most generous developers I've liaised with on these forums.TBH, hosting quality, high-bandwidth Tor nodes is sometimes a real pain, particularly Exit nodes, when your having to perform multiple upgrades and deal with / prevent potential 'abuse' issues. It's also quite costly and time consuming.However, generally speaking, if you want stable Tor nodes for a project with proper maintenance and administration then I'm probably a good choice of candidate.Recently I've had some personal issues and have been on hiatus, but I'm trying to re-build my portfolio and serve my legendary status, if you will.In the realms of crypto currency and privacy related projects, PIVX is now likely to rival DASH / Zcash (ZEC) and others (I probably just shot myself in the foot their, metaphorically, price wise).Anyhow, what I'm basically saying here is lets do this! If the community is willing / able to fund some Full Tor Exit Nodes also running PIVX addnode=.onion's then I can endeavour to do just that. Also finally producing the proper (re-branded) set-up guide for the PIVX wiki for users to follow.This type of set-up is something that the Zcash community is currently helping me with:- https://forum.z.cash/t/zcash-on-tor-a-community-funded-proposal/14651~ I'm also actively looking into researching and preventing potential 'attacks' against users of crypto-currencies, whilst using anonymity networks like Tor.It will be fairly straight forward to combine some services for PIVX - with a bit of additional funding. I don't wont to be in a position again, where I'm forced to switch off nodes because the running costs are outweighing personal benefit to myself!Running PIVX Full Tor Exit nodes will certainly demonstrate to a privacy focused community that this project can go to the stratosphere, hopefully.Anyone is welcome to PM me with suggestions if they would like to help in this regard.   Sorry I was AFK!This crypto had a lot of 'technical' issues when it was formally known as DNET. I have also had some personal issues, compounded somewhat by my own unfortunate situation.I shared useful incites for Tor connectivity with s3v3nh4cks (and the community in this thread), with a large majority of addnode=.onion's being set-up and hosted by myself. I hope to re-instate my original nodes and to perhaps re-publish my set-up guide for the website (eventually), if I re-brand it of course! Sorry I missed the memo...s3v3nh4cks knows my situation and I have also congratulated him on Pivx. I hope to be in a better position someday and to fulfil my own abilities once more.Good times to all - not forgotten.
No worries. Sorry to 'hijack' the OP's thread.I guess that makes four sides to every story i.e.My side, your side, the truth and the narrative!    I'm actually starting to think that I might vaguely remember a site similar to what your describing. Its certainly not one of the sites already mentioned above in this thread though.I will need to have a look through some old emails / notes etc., which I may or may not have access to any more. Its clearly not my old service anyway, so that's one possibility less I guess.Please try not to get your hopes up. I've done that myself before to only be disappointed. Indeed. What's done is done, but we don't forget (well perhaps some of it)!   Oh, cool! I searched without the www.  I'd like to point out here that the ecardone api widget (on one site page) was run by ecardone (Liberty Reserve people) and it provided a 3rd party exchange service to buy LR (not bitcoin) from them via their website. Perhaps that is what the OP remembers using?To clarify, I was never part of Liberty Reserve - only an account(s) holder. I certainly did not distribute any private bitcoin sales via wallet.dat download either. Any exchange I made was/is on the blockchain.EDIT: Note that these free domains were controlled by nic .cz.cc (now defunct) and that any domain content seen after my exchange service operated is not mine and is essentially 'hijacked'.  Additional: I was also never part of AurumXchange (now defunct + they did not exchange BTC back then), an affiliate link is referenced on one of the archived pages, understand that at that time I was keen to make buying bitcoin as accessible as possible, often via 3rd party websites, hence ...I did make the crossover between e-currency, forex trading forums to bitcoin. Around that time NewLibertyStandard had some issues with PayPal charge-backs from customers that used his website: http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/ - I'm probably the reason he added Pecunix (now defunct) as a bitcoin exchange method, because of no charge-backs, as with Bitcoin.Whilst one of my websites might look like a hiyp, I was actually doing real Forex trading with brokers that accepted Liberty Reserve back then (such as what is now roboforex, for example) and I made profit (mostly trading XAUUSD), making LR withdrawals without any issues. Our initial concept was to back our exchanges with both mining and forex trading. The majority of micro 'investors' in my other website were 'hyip' people who caused me some 'issues' and some other personal circumstances made me withdraw from bitcoin to focus on continuing with some trading robots and other projects.One of the reasons I sold my own bitcoin via the BitcoinMarket (who accepted BTC <> LR) was to help repay my own shares to investment partners (now deceased), so that I could focus on continuing trading Forex markets, which at that time was more profitable! Crazy, right!  No one was ever left out-of-pocket from my activities, which is why I'm not a btc-millionaire today.Most people on this forum and the history books will be completely unaware of the massive efforts some of the earliest adopters took in helping to establish bitcoin as a currency.One of the last things I did before I left the forum, on hiatus, was to donate 500 BTC to Gavin's bitcoin faucet, because it had 'run-dry'. Coins which I almost put into cold-storage.  I also shared many a PM with Satoshi, which was fun!   I ran the '2nd' known Bitcoin <> fiat exchange service, using Liberty Reserve (now defunct - with my totally legally earned Forex trading funds being 'confiscated' when LR was shut down).I had a basic website with contact information and a simple pricing widget, but the few successful trades I conducted were all manual and done via email. I certainly did not accept credit cards either and none of the trades I conducted totalled more than $10 in fiat value, at that time.Before the BitcoinMarket exchange was established, there was someone in the US who made exchanges by accepting cash in the mail. I don't recall who that was and I think they also deleted most of their post history.I just checked the way back machine archive and no copies of my website exist during the time it was online, which was for less than a few months, probably. I used a free .cc.cz domain with my forum account name. It was hosted for free on weebly. If the OP genuinely brought bitcoin in the manner they claim then I don't imagine that they have the dates correct or the website they claim to of used was certainly not known to users of this forum at that time. Bitcoins early history on the wiki is truly very patchy TBH, because those wiki pages were created mainly by people after the events. The first trades for goods and/or services were not the now infamous Pizzas! I remember buying US postage stamps from NewLibertyStandard before Laszlo posted the Pizza trade. I suspect that other trades also took place before that time, they were just not made publicly.Anyhow, if you are genuine @CryptoCruiser then I wish you luck! I'm also one of the few people from bitcoins early history who knows what its like to not own or to have lost coins that now have great value.

Proof of burnWith proof of burn, instead of pouring money into expensive computer equipment, you 'burn' coins by sending them to an address where they are irretrievable. By committing your coins to never-never land, you earn a lifetime privilege to mine on the system based on a random selection process.Depending on how proof of burn is implemented, miners may burn the native currency or the currency of an alternative chain, like bitcoin. The more coins you burn, the better chance you have of being selected to mine the next block.Over time, your stake in the system decays, so eventually you will want to burn more coins to increase your odds of being selected in the lottery. (This mimics bitcoin's mining process, where you have to continually invest in more modern computing equipment to maintain hashing power.)While proof of burn is an interesting alternative to proof of work, the protocol still wastes resources needlessly. Another criticism is that mining power simply goes to those who are willing to burn more money.The only coin that uses proof of burn is slimcoin, a cryptocurrency based on peercoin. It uses a combination of proof of work, proof of stake and proof of burn, but is only semi-active at this time. ..."

I perhaps ran the first known public Bitcoin Tor .onion under an alternative forum account named 'xeronet'.The crypto community masses here generally don't donate anything any more or in the main even bother to fully utilize such offerings that helped in making Bitcoin great.Whilst your offer is appreciated, with respect, 5000 GAP at the current exchange rate wouldn't really even cover the costs of set-up or administration of one node for much more than a few months, even if the node was also mining GAP itself.~ Great progress usually only facilitates when philanthropy or investment recognises the people of genius or projects of certain merit, like GAP. This is now most certainly a dichotomy of establishing a truly successful alternative currency.I could add Tor support to my single remaining Gapcoin VPS node, although I have no idea how long I might be able to run that for, when the immediate costs often outweigh the benefits.If I still had a bunch of Bitcoin I would do it (as well as for a load of other cool projects), but I don't, so sadly I cannot. @gjhigginsPlease reference the new Emercoin source code / recent upgrade :- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=362513.msg17847459#msg17847459Seems to be applicable to the Slimcoin wallet issue that myself and a few other's have reported.Thanks again for your continuing development work on Slimcoin. Hear hear!The first physical goods brought with Bitcoin were certainly not Pizza!I remember buying US postal stamps from http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/Specialty+Shop and other people made direct exchanges to PayPal via New Liberty Standard prior to that.The very first Bitcoin purchases were simply not documented publicly on this forum or anywhere else. I doubt that my stamp purchase or others exchanges were the first transactions for physical goods or services either.

Otherwise you won't have coins that are eligible or that carry enough stake weight to stake with, yet.

PoB rewards are randomized as your percentage of effective burnt coins (if any) of the total network effective Burnt coins, across active wallets.  Firstly, Thanks for your work on Slimcoin @gjhiggins and others !Slimcoin has undoubtedly one of the most unique and innovative economic models of any alt. crypto-currency, following Bitcoin and Peercoin....Having mined, staked and burned SLM from the start I have one wallet with a total of 12,500 burnt coins (around 5,000 still active). This wallet also has over 4,000 transactions and running v0.3.2.1 or v0.4.1 on Windows 7 is a total nightmare as the wallet GUI is continually Not Responding. Interestingly enough, the wallet is more responsive (seemingly) when the walletpassphrase has been entered to unlock the wallet. Anyhow, the wallet will remain Not Responding for upwards of 1 hour with a 1 to 10 min window of correct functionality, randomly!Running a secondary wallet (with only a couple of 'banked' transfers i.e. transactions) seems to run OK though.Memory dumps and crash logs don't reveal much with regards to the issue, however having a wallet with this many transactions and a likely "two is company, three's a crowd" type of scenario remaining in relation to the block rewards / blockchain is partly the issue still, I suspect.I now have a v0.4.1 daemon running on a linux VPS and will try importing the priv key(s) from the aforementioned wallet to help determine if this is a windows only GUI bug.Probably worth mentioning that the windows machine is a 6 core i7 (12 threads) with 16 GB of Physical System RAM ...I might of been partly responsible for suggesting Slimcoin (a.k.a John Smith) hardcoded reservebalance= to effectively test staking as optional. I'm no longer sure that this is the remedy.EDIT: Now seemingly running the same wallet on a single core linux VPS without any issues. The logical explanation is that a large number of transactions + having effective burnt coins = windows wallet GUI overload (somewhere) in the current code base. - https://github.com/navcoindev/navcoin2/ - This repository, Search: maxorphanblocks"Keep at most <n> unconnectable blocks in memory (default: %u)"Bitcoin was around 750 (being PoW not PoS). NAV is obviously PoS with much faster block times, so for staking wallets I'd imagine that the devs have a good reason for suggesting maxorphanblocks=10000 .I needed to reduce RAM usage on a non-staking server with upwards of 125 connections and found that maxorphanblocks=1000 seemed to be an appropriate server value cap (along with some other settings). If you have plenty of free RAM, then stick with the 'default' value ofc. No, no, no ... isn't it a Unicorn Zombie Apocalypse ...- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPXv392pc9k - NSFW (unless your a mega-lo-maniac?)- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2euMNmsb_s   - https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/0a339e595c72cff80edc67e1f19cb7d799a5a47e45dac32f9c52bff57804f392/analysis/1473947564/   Good good.@ devs. and anyone using NAV over Tor ...Thanks for adding the how to guides on the website, much appreciated.I wanted to take this opportunity to point out that running applications (i.e. NAV or any other crypto coin software) through the Tor Browser Bundle (Tor) is perhaps not the best practice with regards for total user privacy. Don't get me wrong here, running NAV over Tor is still going to provide increased anonymity and privacy over running on clearnet. This advisory has to do with how Tor handles SOCKS connections / DNS leaks etc.,Here is Tor developer I. Lovecruft on the subject of SOCKS connections in Tor / Browser during a lecture on anonymity systems at Radboud Universiteit.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGIE7KTJiBY&feature=youtu.be&t=1h33sBasically, it is advisable to run two version of Tor. The Expert bundle (configured for NAV or other crypto coin's) and then The Tor Browser Bundle (Tor) for browsing.Note that it is absolutely fine to have two versions of Tor running on the same machine. The Expert Tor bundle should be configured to use your localhost SOCKS port 9050 , whilst the Tor Browser Bundle localhost SOCKS port 'default' should remain as 9150.Also see:- https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WarningsAboutSOCKSandDNSInformationLeaksFor the Tor Expert Bundle, a CLIENT only torrc config. for NAV might look something like this ;Always read the manual : https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.enIf one requires the up most privacy, security and anonymity then look at Whonix - https://www.whonix.org/ - where the NAV wallet or daemon could easily be installed on a Workstation / VPS.Cheers!

Shadowcoin got a mention today, on the Keiser Report - Episode 966, in regards to privacy on the blockchain during an interview with Jaromil of https://www.dyne.org/ about cryptocurrency markets, Monero and something called Ethereum.  - https://youtu.be/R3xWDhNFbNE?t=19m46s   With Ubuntu desktop I often recommend running GNOME Metacity, instead of Unity.sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback- http://www.howtogeek.com/189912/how-to-install-the-gnome-classic-desktop-in-ubuntu-14.04/Which is hassle free and that bit faster for getting things done when using GUI coin wallets!    NAV Tor nodes have mostly been running stable, all on the correct chain height etc., (ref. your post regarding your sending issue) I will double check everything server side, although these are just regular NAV nodes ofc.~ For a daemon NAV server conf these options have improved stability;nosmsg=1txindex=1maxorphanblocks=1000 Thanks!Note : The above Tor addnodes are 'beta' testing with the UMBRA v1.5.0.0-dirtyThe wallet tab will show "Tor connection offline", despite being connected.You can confim connectivity via the "Tools" Tab > Debug window > Peers    Herewith, SDC UMBRA Tor addnode=.onion support ;addnode=umbrapxieyalbldd.onion:554addnode=sdcfxhy2lmc3j7t7.onion:554addnode=umbrah4nz5nybziy.onion:554addnode=sdcfxp7gbiaqniwp.onion:554addnode=umbrax5u5zj5bspa.onion:554addnode=sdcfxzr2wpn6hz23.onion:554addnode=umbra3nrlxk66gzl.onion:554addnode=sdcfxvuymj4ika4m.onion:554An example Tor shadowcoin.conf (which can be used with the Tor Browser Bundle - https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html- out-of-the-box) ;Code:Code:listen=0port=554maxconnections=8proxy=127.0.0.1:9150onion=127.0.0.1:9150onlynet=toraddnode=umbrapxieyalbldd.onion:554addnode=sdcfxhy2lmc3j7t7.onion:554addnode=umbrah4nz5nybziy.onion:554addnode=sdcfxp7gbiaqniwp.onion:554addnode=umbrax5u5zj5bspa.onion:554addnode=sdcfxzr2wpn6hz23.onion:554addnode=umbra3nrlxk66gzl.onion:554addnode=sdcfxvuymj4ika4m.onion:554addnode=shadow2b3ozvqmhm.onionaddnode=shadow3kdzs7v6is.onionaddnode=shadow5ea566kf2j.onionIt is advisable to add regular IP addnodes at the base of this .conf for 'failover', which will enable your client to also exit connections via Tor. Although, hidden_service connections (.onion) never leave the Tor network.- https://chainz.cryptoid.info/sdc/#!networkRemember that less connections are preferable over more connections, in terms of anonymity and privacy. 6 to 8 connections are probably optimal for broadcasting transactions.Port 554 has been selected as it is a common Tor Exit port - see: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicy - whereas the 'default' Shadowcoin port 51737 is not.Shadowcoin Support for server up keep etc. to : SZUZwSiw84YkmrvtFEyyDB71KEox6Vu6H6Cheers! Interestingly enough the mining difficulty is the highest it has been for sometime now at around >22.20The last few months average was probably somewhere around 21.50 relative difficulty.At one point last month I was mining on over 100 single core $5 mo. instances directly onto the Gapcoin wallet on single nodes, partly to support the network and also because this was actually profitable! Each instance was finding more than 1 to 5 blocks on average per. day at that difficulty.Gapcoin is still being de-listed from poloniex on 09/05/2016 - although a new market is opening up at cryptopia : https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/ExchangeThe dev. has seemingly not returned throughout this hiatus. It would be good to bring the Gapcoin code base up-to-date. However, aside from that Gapcoin remains a great crypto currency with a useful PoW. Shall do. Should be within the week or so for public posting, after some dev. testing etc., Indeed. Perhaps poloniex are the 'real losers now' for de-listing GAP (and some other coins) ? ... oh wait, my bad, I forget that the Market Makers don't really need to care about that. It remains however that the 'Math' coins are perhaps more difficult for everyone to fully appreciate as currency.GAP is still my personal fav. of all the Math coins though. Noticed that these nodes seem to be running the stable release now also.Think that we now have enough 'public' nodes to produce some good Tor 'howto' documentation etc., Some crypto-currencies 'destroy' transaction fees, whilst others add transaction fees into new blocks. It is generally more common for PoS coins (over PoW) to 'destroy' transaction fees, I think.@s3v3nh4cks - well that turned out to be a simple enough solution, should really of thought of that one!  
No worries. That's perfect. I'll look to add connectivity for the ones that I'll likely set-up. Its always best to set-up a bunch of nodes at the same time as it obviously make it more difficult for any observers to try and figure out which service is which.   Another weekend project for me then !    Sure. Are their any 'public' addnode=.onion or hidden_service seed nodes for SDC. I realize that the Shadow code base supports Tor ofc.Here is the post regarding the public NAV nodes that I'm running ;- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=679791.msg15855117#msg15855117Here is the post with regards to 4 of those nodes also being full Tor Relays ;- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=679791.msg15857415#msg15857415I'm effectively offering to set-up a similar set of nodes for Shadow, as well as trying to ascertain if any other public addnode=.onion's exist ?I checked your documentation at https://doc.shadowproject.io/#tor and did not find any listed nodes. Checking if you have .onion seed nodes in the code base next, whilst trawling through this thread.Moving forward, Tor connectivity is remaining 'optional' in SDC, right ?...SDC / Tor users might also appreciate my ramblings here ; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg16104604#msg16104604Cheers! Folks here might appreciate the advanced Tor Browser Bundle torrc thread.Posted some new example torrc settings for use with the TBB v.6.0.4 ;- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg16104604#msg16104604Cheers! Indeed. No worries. Keep up the good work on the script!I have some good iptables firewall rules that are long term 'tested' on vultr instances, if you want to collaborate on those via PM for the script ? xeronet Torrc is a Client Only (example) configuration. - for the Tor Browser Bundle.xeronet Torrc - v6.0.4 - "Include Five-Eyes Entry and Exit Servers"Note : Tor Relays and Exit Nodes will now be listed by their Public Keys (instead of NickName and IP), which is a much better way to list EntryNodes, ExitNodes and Exclude Nodes.A more detailed explanation of the new settings will be presented soon.

addresses, which would allow you to 'bind' multiple daemon's running on a single host to each IP. As, far as system resources allow."    It also depends on how you want to run your Masternode's.Most VPS cloud instances will provide a single static IPv4 address (some providers still offer shared NAT though). Increasingly, VPS hosts are also providing IPv6 addresses, which would allow you to 'bind' multiple daemon's running on a single host to each IP. As, far as system resources allow.For IPv4 VPS hosts (or even your 'home' network), you could simply use a 'free' Tunnel Broker to add a secondary IPv6 address ;- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokersThis method is known as IPv6 - in - IPv4 It is also possible to 'bind' to your unique addnode .onion address, when using Tor. However, binding to other Tor .Exit node operators IP's to run your own Masternode though Tor would certainly not be a good idea, as nodes will simply conflict, if everyone started doing that.Basically, you want to own or at least directly control any 'IP' that you are going to 'bind' your Masternode to.Hence, one DNET MN per IP address, is the best practical option. I have been following the posts in the NAV thread with regards to their use of parts of the SDC code base.I've implemented optional addnode=.onion daemon connectivity for Navcoin and would likely easily be able to add some nodes on the same and/or new servers for SDC.Does SDC have any existing / dedicated Tor nodes already ? Would the community / devs. consider any bounties to assist with server set-up / help with running costs etc.,...The concept of 'Tor Incentive' mechanisms is not new ;- https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-incentives-research-roundup-goldstar-par-braids-lira-tears-and-torcoinN.B. that the 'TorCoin' of this forum is not the one mentioned in any of the research papers.Here is Roger D. (lead Tor dev.) on the subject of 'Tor Incentive' mechanisms at HAR (Hacking at Random) 2009 ;- https://youtu.be/WJD1hDKDqlo?t=4m56s      ...Using the Tor network as an optional transport mechanism is one thing, whilst integrating the Tor software into existing software is perhaps something else entirely.-  https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html.en Good job ph4nt0m! I seem to remember submitting Gapcoin for voting at Cryptopia some while back now. Maybe it got de-listed from voting ? Anyway, lets make sure to get GAP listed this time around.Started looking for new / alternative exchanges for Gapcoin as a secondary option and discovered that its already listed at Nova exchange !- https://novaexchange.com/market/BTC_GAP/- https://novaexchange.com/market/LTC_GAP/Although to date, no trades have taken place. I guess Nova exchange is as 'trustworthy' as any other ? Looking for reviews etc.,EDIT: Nova exchange appears to have a 'mixed' history and the forum thread appears to be 'locked' currently.EDIT2: Seemingly the BTC market has been replaced with an LTC market trading pair. Random. Yes. The network appears to be more stable now.wallet.dat corruption issues can be easily resolved by syncing a new wallet with the v2.1.2.1 release and then using a previously backed-up wallet.dat or importing your private keys into the new wallet. Using a freshly generated master node key in the .conf also seems to improve things. The network does not care which DB version an individual node runs. The wallet.dat does care about which pre-requisite version of the DB it is using and/or that it is or is not compatible with.- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md... " Ubuntu and Debian have their own libdb-dev and libdb++-dev packages, but these will install BerkeleyDB 5.1 or later, which break binary wallet compatibility with the distributed executables which are based on BerkeleyDB 4.8. If you do not care about wallet compatibility, pass --with-incompatible-bdb to configure. " ...It will be easier to do bug tracking if everyone is "singing from the same song sheet", at least. Over the last few months I'd been mining Gapcoin on an increasing number of single core 'private cloud' server instances, generating a reasonable amount of profit and/or off-setting other server costs.The poloniex announcement to de-list Gapcoin on 9/5/2016 (along with other coins) caused the GAP price to drop by over 50% overnight, the immediate result being that mining is no longer 'profitable' in the short term, or for the foreseeable future, without an exchange.I have had no choice today but to switch off lots of Gapcoin mining instances and some of these servers were actually hosting daemons to support other crypto coins! (being paid for by the hour).Whilst market makers don't really need to care much about the knock on effects of these de-listing decisions, when they take these actions they often inadvertently effect the entire crypto eco system.Crypto currency remains the 'wild west'.

More haste, less speed.If these issues are not fully resolved (explained) over the next weeks, it is highly likely that folks will simply switch off Masternode hosting due to server costs etc., You would need to use the navcoin.conf from this post to connect your wallet through Tor:- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=679791.msg15855117#msg15855117These addnode=.onion services are not running websites. They are simply running navcoind as a Tor hidden_service !You can easily connect Navcoin using the Tor Browser Bundle (as it runs Tor for you when you start the Tor Browser), however, you would need to keep the TBB open to maintain the Tor SOCKS connection for Navcoin to use. So, this method is only really useful for sending transactions. If you want to run / stake Navcoin 24/7 over Tor then installing the Tor Expert Bundle (Standalone) is advised.You can confirm that you are connected via Tor in your Navcoin console, using getpeerinfoA full connectivity guide can be established once I have communicated more with the Navcoin dev. team.~ Ever since the release of the Tor Browser Bundle, folks have increasingly begun to see the Tor network as purely an anonymous web browser. Its so much more. A good example for using your own private hidden_service is setting up an SSH connection into your home 'linux' box, for connecting from anywhere with total privacy and anonymity.

Furthermore, the individually 'advertised' hidden_service info presented in the Tor atlas contact information, may (or may not) correspond with the Tor Relay node actually running the Navcoin service i.e. an 'fx' and/or 'ca' addnode=.onion node may (or may not) be hosting any one of these Navcoin Tor services.Mixing Navcoin Tor traffic with regular Tor relay traffic is certainly beneficial for users privacy, as well as potentially bringing Navcoin to a wider audience. Nodes relaying traffic for the Tor network allows the Navcoin project to essentially provide bandwidth back to other Tor users i.e. P2P seeding, instead of just leeching. The majority of DNET Tor addnode=.onion's nodes appear to be at the correct block height now.~ An anonymous source has forwarded 4 new DNET addnode=.onion nodes ;addnode=dnetxef3rmouy5qo.onion:989{ DQ2bY1Suks8Zs3hXMEXgfZK2qTErfWyWET }addnode=dnetxcvx4iqeunnk.onion:989{ DNzSSB3hUCL7pEHdoSsAwX41qRkrZAeG85 }addnode=dnetxn4m5kfh4xhr.onion:989{ DPXWTuVufYDFK6FyNXry6DvuFVCrDEb2md }addnode=dnetxu5edp35e4rm.onion:989{ DRoa9N5cNK6VQUkYTrzhyDVDsRTjbAdfea }Nodes seem to be working OK currently.

If you are looking to help expand the Tor network and DNET network by running a 'dual stack' masternode then yes - some information can already be found in this thread, with a main guide being worked on.If you are seeking to essentially circumvent DNET masternode security by utilizing Tor .Exit node operators IP offerings as your own masternode IP's - then no, not really.  The Tor network has less than 1000 .Exit nodes currently - see: https://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ - of which the majority will not allow exit traffic on DNET's 'default' port - being why port 989 was selected for DNET addnode=.onion hidden_services. Furthermore, Tor Exit node IP addresses rotate by default every 10 mins, which is certainly not ideal for attempting to run masternode exits over Tor....Tor 0.2.8.6 stable was actually released yesterday - https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0286-released - I've seen permission errors related to upgrading existing hidden_services on some linux distributions.

However, we also want to stay out of the immediate personal domain, so sharing funds within a family or copying coins between devices should not be subject to monitoring by the state.In Taler terminology, we distinguish between transactions where the exclusive ownership of the value of a coin is passed from one entity to another, and sharing whereafter control over a coin is shared by multiple electronic wallets (which may belong to different individuals). In Taler, the receiver of a transaction is visible to the state and thus can be taxed, while sharing is invisible to anyone not involved. Once a coin is shared among different individuals, any one of those can try to spend it, but only the first spender would succeed. Thus, sharing requires a strong trust relationship among the individuals involved, and thus represent interactions in the protected immediate personal domain, and not commercial transactions.When Taler needs to provide change, for example because a customer only has a 5 Euro coin but wants to make a 2 Euro purchase, it needs to create fresh coins (of a total value of 3 Euros) that are unlinkable to the original 5 Euro coin to ensure privacy. To ensure that the resulting refresh operation where the change is converted to fresh coins cannot be used to transfer funds from one entity to another, Taler ensures that any owner of an original coin that was involved in a refresh operation can follow a link to the private information of the fresh coins generated by the operation. As a result of this trick, refresh operations cannot be used to create transfers, as the linkage ensures that the fresh coins are always shared with the owner of the original coin.As a result, Taler does not intrude into the personal economic domain, offers good privacy, taxability for transactions and the ability to give change."- source : taler.net   Received (anonymous) metrics data for a selection of the dnet addnode=.onion Tor hidden_services; with the last few months averaging well over 100 concurrent hidden_service connections per relay!~ Holding fire on detailed Tor / dnet set-up documentation until after the release of Tor v0.2.8.5 (stable), due to slight alterations with Tor hidden_service directory permissions....Has any dnet community / network voting taken place for the PoS implementation ?

It is unclear if any of these nodes are actually mining Gapcoin or just simply collating data on Prime Gaps etc., Checked getpeerinfo for the three main nodes.After syncing the Pr (Unobtanium testnet) wallet - which appears to only find 3 connections - I re-tested the v0.10.1.12-retrograde windows release, which seems to be functioning OK.As above, it is probably advisable to install / run Pr from the Unobtanium (testnet3) --testnet folder / location. So, that the UNO --testnet wallet can be used to re-sync if necessary. Then try running the v0.10.1.12-retrograde windows release, for improved connectivity.Recommended addnodes currently are;45.32.244.201:6552545.32.32.237:6552569.28.82.86:6552573.9.181.217:1801146.105.39.103:65525Three are my linux nodes, plus the wmikrut pool node and a node on ovh france - which appears to be stable. Syncing the Pr blockchain with the windows wallet from scratch will take to long currently and importing the testnet3 blockchain .zip is necessary.Both of the Pr windows release builds don't seem to be working properly.As posted above by @FallingKnife the Unobtanium Bluechist --testnet Pr wallet is working fine.45.32.244.201 - vultr .com - JP45.32.32.237 - vultr .com - AUSingle core instances with 768 MB RAM with 2GB swapfile (also running Unobtanium and Unicoin daemons!) 69.28.82.86 - atlantic .net - CASingle core instance with 256 MB RAM with 2GB swapfile (dedicated Pr instance! cost $1 a month!)So, if the blockchain is slow to download, this is most probably why. ^^ @Alex4JOK fair enough.However, please update the repository doc with the above information, as adding ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin and trying to apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev is obviously going to cause some confusion for Debian/Ubuntu-like Linux distribution users.- https://github.com/cryptogenicbonds/CryptoBullion-CBX/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md...To clarify why Alex4J is stating that using a berkeley-db version other than 4.8 is possibly a bad idea - I will quote a Litecoin team member from 2013 ..."Upstream Bitcoin considers db-4.8 to be the only supported version. 5.1 is known to work, buts databases are incompatible with official builds created with db-4.8.""5.1 works. It is just incompatible with the official binaries so your wallet.dat will forever be different, needing your own builds."It remains that - libdb4.8++-dev has no installation candidate. So, something for all Linux users to be made aware of.

Promoting Gapcoin to University Mathematics departments would be a good more forward perhaps.Getting a couple of 'super computers' or IT labs on board would certainly help towards finding some news worthy prime gaps!...Foremost, Gapcoin really needs a new mining pool and getting listed on another exchange would be good.A vote listing for cryptopia.co.nz is here: https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/VoteI've contacted a number of pool operators recently to try building a new pool, although without success.I might make a concerted effort to try and get a Gapcoin pool up and running myself soon, no guarantees though.   Looks like they have cloned / added Gapcoin to the Blockchain Artifact Library repo. for Azure DevTest Labs. a.k.a. BaaS "Blockchain as a Service" - https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/tree/master/baas-artifacts - along with a few other crypto coins / projects.Microsoft's Azure 'cloud' platform is good, but in comparison to other cloud solutions it is perhaps rather expensive. It's geared more towards a cloud enterprise solution TBH.However, It is possible to sign-up for a Microsoft's Azure 'free trial' with up to $200 worth of Azure credits (depending on your geographical eligibility etc.) - See : https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/As I recall, they require a valid credit card and Microsoft Live ID for sign-up.The 'free trial' Azure credits are time restricted, although they will probably last for a good few days of mining Gapcoin on 2 x 8 core instances and 1 x 4 core High-Power-CPU instances, if the terms are still the same. So, one could just install a Gapcoin windows wallet on each instance and mine in the wallet.   Herewith, a Tor Browser Bundle about:config Null Advisory;- https://tornull.org/tbbnull.phpHow to EDIT the Tor Browser Bundle about:config - http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:confignetwork.http.sendRefererHeader ; 1 - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.http.sendRefererHeaderbrowser.sessionhistory.max_entries ; 2dom.storage.enabled ; false - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Dom.storage.enableddom.vibrator.enabled ; falsewebgl.disabled ; truebrowser.cache.memory.enable ; false - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.cache.memory.enablenetwork.http.use-cache ; false - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.http.use-cachebrowser.cache.disk.capacity ; 0browser.cache.offline.capacity ; 0browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl ; false - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.cache.disk_cache_sslplaces.history.enabled ; falsenetwork.prefetch-next ; false - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.prefetch-nextbrowser.send_pings.require_same_host ; true - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.send_pings.require_same_hostbrowser.send_pings.max_per_link ; 0beacon.enabled ; falseclipboard.autocopy ; false - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Clipboard.autocopydom.event.clipboardevents.enabled ; false - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Preferences/Preference_reference/dom.event.clipboardevents.enabledlayout.css.visited_links_enabled ; false - https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2010/03/31/plugging-the-css-history-leak/browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers ; 0 - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewersHow to Stop Firefox making Automatic Connections - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-stop-firefox-making-automatic-connectionsbrowser.newtabpage.directory.ping ; set a blank stringbrowser.newtabpage.directory.source ; set a blank stringbrowser.aboutHomeSnippets.updateUrl ; set a blank stringbrowser.startup.homepage_override.mstone ; ignorebrowser.selfsupport.url ; set a blank stringAdditional (optional) :extensions.blocklist.enabled ; falseexperiments.enabled ; falseexperiments.supported ; falsenetwork.allow-experiments ; falseHow to fully disable Google 'Safe' Browsing and Reporting - http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.safebrowsing.enabledbrowser.safebrowsing.appRepURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.downloads.enabled ; falsebrowser.safebrowsing.gethashURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.malware.reportURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.reportErrorURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.reportGenericURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.reportMalwareErrorURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.reportMalwareURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.reportPhishURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.reportURL ; set a blank stringbrowser.safebrowsing.updateURL ; set a blank stringservices.sync.prefs.sync.browser.safebrowsing.enabled ; falseservices.sync.prefs.sync.browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled ; falsePipelining Optimizations :network.http.pipelining.maxrequests ; 32network.http.pipelining.max-optimistic-requests ; 8Tab Optimizations :browser.tabs.animate ; falsebrowser.panorama.animate_zoom ; falseRecommended addons :Smart Referer - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smart-referer/ - about:addons > Preferences > Mode : "Send nothing as referer, looking like a direct hit" + Automatic Updates > OffuBlock Origin - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/ - about:addons > Preferences > Show Dashboard > Tick "Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses" + Automatic Updates > OffNote : Always check addons for updates outside of your browsing session and/or use a new identityAlways set the Tor Button > Privacy and Security Settings...

I fully recognize that malicious activity and 'hacking' attempts against websites are a real and everyday occurrence.Project Honey Pot is a very useful data resource in this regard, to protect against forum SPAM and other known nasties.The CEO & Co-Founder of Cloudflare, Inc. is also the Co-Creator of Project Honey Pot - https://www.linkedin.com/in/mprinceIt is to my understanding that Cloudflare was established / accelerated when various three letter agencies leveraged just how 'valuable' the Project Honey Pot was to them....Most websites do not suffer DDoS attacks, do not have databases or login areas to be 'hacked', or comment sections or forums to be harvested or spammed and yet they continue to enable cloudflare - blocking regular internet users who most likely just want to read web pages.- https://www.projecthoneypot.org/harvester_useragents.php- https://www.projecthoneypot.org/comment_spammer_useragents.php- https://www.projecthoneypot.org/robot_useragents.phpMost problematic useragents / bots and 'abuse' issues can actually be filtered out by using a good Anti-SPAM script, such as Bad-Behavior (without using a Project Honey Pot API key or enabling Cloudflare);- http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us/about/Basic DDoS protection can be achieved by using Fali2ban or Mod Security instead;- https://modsecurity.org/- http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#DontBlockTor Tor is not using Cloudflare!Cloudflare is a website 'protection' company used by webmasters to supposedly help in preventing 'abuse' issues against websites.Cloudflare has increasingly started 'screening' Tor Exit node / VPN traffic (using captchas by google), and incorrectly assuming that a few 'bad' actions from a single IP address = all traffic from said IP address being 'bad', by default.This is deeply flawed and simplistic methodology, as thousands of individuals can potentially be using a single IP address at any one time.Cloudflare has blogged that 94% of the requests it sees from Tor are "malicious." - which is highly unlikely indeed.Quite simply any website currently using Cloudflare is most certainly annoying its regular visitors and at worst blocking them outright or censoring them completely. - Source: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CloudFlare" ... ControversiesCloudFlare was ranked in the 7th rank among the top 50 Bad Hosts by Host Exploit. The service has been used by Rescator, a website that sells payment card data.Two of ISIS' top three online chat forums are guarded by CloudFlare but U.S. law enforcement has not asked them to discontinue the service.An October 2015 report found that CloudFlare provisioned 40% of SSL certificates used by phishing sites with deceptive domain names resembling those of banks and payment processors.On November 2015, Anonymous discouraged the use of CloudFlare's services, following the ISIS attacks in Paris and renewed accusation of providing help to terrorists. CloudFlare responded by calling their accusers "15-year-old kids in Guy Fawkes masks" and saying that they consult "actual anti-terrorism experts" and that they "abide by the law". "   Indeed.As a Tor Browser user, Tor relay exit node operator and as someone who has used Cloudflare to 'secure' websites in the past - I now personally refuse to use Cloudflare and will also actively look to avoid websites that are 'protected' by Cloudflare.Cloudflare is a 'black-box' (closed source) technology that is effectively performing a MITM censorship 'attack' against regular internet users.Any webmaster using Cloudflare is in fact centralizing the internet.~ I don't think that any Bitcoin users need to be told why centralization is certainly not a good thing.#DontBlockTor The Trouble with Tor - https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-trouble-with-tor/The Trouble with Cloudflare - https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trouble-cloudflare/ - #DontBlockTor" Posted March 31st, 2016 by mikeperry in abuse access cloudflare privacy security Wednesday, CloudFlare blogged that 94% of the requests it sees from Tor are "malicious." We find that unlikely, and we've asked CloudFlare to provide justification to back up this claim. We suspect this figure is based on a flawed methodology by which CloudFlare labels all traffic from an IP address that has ever sent spam as "malicious." Tor IP addresses are conduits for millions of people who are then blocked from reaching websites under CloudFlare's system.We're interested in hearing CloudFlare's explanation of how they arrived at the 94% figure and why they choose to block so much legitimate Tor traffic. While we wait to hear from CloudFlare, here's what we know:1) CloudFlare uses an IP reputation system to assign scores to IP addresses that generate malicious traffic. In their blog post, they mentioned obtaining data from Project Honey Pot, in addition to their own systems. Project Honey Pot has an IP reputation system that causes IP addresses to be labeled as "malicious" if they ever send spam to a select set of diagnostic machines that are not normally in use. CloudFlare has not described the nature of the IP reputation systems they use in any detail.2) External research has found that CloudFlare blocks at least 80% of Tor IP addresses, and this number has been steadily increasing over time.3) That same study found that it typically took 30 days for an event to happen that caused a Tor IP address to acquire a bad reputation and become blocked, but once it happens, innocent users continued to be punished for it for the duration of the study.4) That study also showed a disturbing increase over time in how many IP addresses CloudFlare blocked without removal. CloudFlare's approach to blocking abusive traffic is incurring a large amount of false positives in the form of impeding normal traffic, thereby damaging the experience of many innocent Tor and non-Tor Internet users, as well as impacting the revenue streams of CloudFlare's own customers by causing frustrated or blocked users to go elsewhere.5) A report by CloudFlare competitor Akamai found that the percentage of legitimate e-commerce traffic originating from Tor IP addresses is nearly identical to that originating from the Internet at large. (Specifically, Akamai found that the "conversion rate" of Tor IP addresses clicking on ads and performing commercial activity was "virtually equal" to that of non-Tor IP addresses).CloudFlare disagrees with our use of the word "block" when describing its treatment of Tor traffic, but that's exactly what their system ultimately does in many cases. Users are either blocked outright with CAPTCHA server failure messages, or prevented from reaching websites with a long (and sometimes endless) loop of CAPTCHAs, many of which require the user to understand English in order to solve correctly. For users in developing nations who pay for Internet service by the minute, the problem is even worse as the CAPTCHAs load slowly and users may have to solve dozens each day with no guarantee of reaching a particular site. Rather than waste their limited Internet time, such users will either navigate away, or choose not to use Tor and put themselves at risk.Also see our new fact sheet about CloudFlare and Tor: https://people.torproject.org/~lunar/20160331-CloudFlare_Fact_Sheet.pdf "   @Kasper_SKY - I had these original SLG crypto-cards produced.

SOCKS5 - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS - in the main only provides Authentication.To quote the spec. - https://shadowsocks.org/en/spec/protocol.html -"The shadowsocks protocol is very similar to SOCKS5 but encrypted and simpler.""Super Fast - Bleeding edge techniques using Asynchronous I/O and Event-driven programming.""Mobile Ready - Optimized for mobile device and wireless network, without any keep-alive connections."Unlike a VPN, shadowsocks does not use keep-alive connections. ChaCha20+Poly1305 can be as much as 300% faster than AES-256-GCM with SHA-1 authentication - https://blog.cloudflare.com/do-the-chacha-better-mobile-performance-with-cryptography/From a user (Client) perspective, once shadowsocks is installed, and you have correctly entered the provided servers settings and passkey etc., you click connect and now have an encrypted SOCKS5 proxy to connect you browser through (usually on localhost:1080), or any other application that supports SOCKS5.You can run DNScrypt and still connect shadowsocks (using it as a regular SOCKS5 proxy). It is also possible to push (connect) a VPN connection through shadowsocks and/or to connect Tor through shadowsocks and/or your VPN.On a mobile device, compared to a VPN, shadowsocks will use less CPU, less bandwidth and less battery power.   @DRPD - The vps upgrade guide I have posted is really meant for individuals using independent vps hosting i.e. not really for services like mp-hosting, which as I understand it is a 'managed' hosting service. However, I can understand your readiness to resolve issues with your own Masternodes ofc.Again, the guide is aimed at easy-to-follow linux command line instructions, that will install the pre-built linux binaries 'as if' built from source.Glad you have now got it running OK anyway.Just to clarify to everyone, I'm not part of 'mp-hosting' nor am I directly part of the dnet dev. team - just doing some network related research....On a separate note - I have successfully built dnet on a Whonix Workstation ( as the current pre-built linux binaries won't run )- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262920.msg14259019#msg14259019I'm working on a guide for this currently. Both the Whonix Gateway and Whonix Workstation can be run on 1 machine in 2 separate VirtualBox instances, automatically pushing all dnet CLIENT traffic through the Whonix Gateway, over Tor, whilst the CLIENT wallet runs securely in the fully sand-boxed Whonix Workstation.   https://bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin - N.B.

ShadowSOCKS - SSFX Servers Project (beta)"A secure socks5 proxy,designed to protect your Internet traffic."I, BitcoinFX am providing secured ShadowSOCKS proxy servers - available to purchase (soon) with Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, on request.Firstly, ShadowSOCKS is a free Open Source project available here: https://shadowsocks.org/ - with existing CLIENT software for most platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, and OpenWRT.- https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.htmlUsers of ShadowSOCKS still require reliable and available SERVERS to connect through, although you are of course welcome to spin-up your own production server....My projects multi-servers package price (for a one year passkey) will be set at $15 and your personal passkey will give you access to an increasing number of available SOCKS5 encrypted servers (TBD), as I continue to build-up the project and it's userbase.A minimum of 4 servers will be activated within the first 2 Months of operation.The first servers Geo-locations shall include: Russia, Canada, Sweden and Latvia....If you are already a Member, Senior member, Hero member or of Legendary status here at BitcoinTalk then you are welcome to message me for 1 of 50 free 'lifetime' (one year duration - beta) passkeys.Please also sign-up for a free tutanota.com webmail address, so that I can easily forward your passkey to you securely, using end-to-end user encryption, as well as to maintain customer contact.This beta passkey will work for all of the new project servers for the duration of one year, after which time you will be invited to renew your passkey at the standard annual price and before its expiration. (The beta offer is no purchase necessary - first come, first served - subject to your forum member status and of course subject to availability).The beta server is cloud hosted in Russia and is up and running now - it is intentionally low-RAM for 'testing' purposes and will be slower than the first main production servers - the beta server will most likely be used as the 'demo' server, moving forward.The chosen encryption cipher is chacha20 (a salsa20 variant) - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variantAvailable outgoing ports for the beta server are TCP: 20-21, 80, 110, 143, 443, 989-990, 993, 995, 1194, 5222-5223, 5228, 8080, 9418FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, OpenVPN, XMPP, XMPPS, Android Market, HTTP_alt and git The beta server is using OpenNIC DNS and can therefore resolve Emercoin, Namecoin and OpenNIC domains through the proxy....The first main production servers will support a wider variety of available ports including Electrum (for Bitcoin) connectivity, IRC and more.Thank you.Beta server passkey's remaining: 50 of 50Shadowsocks is licensed under the APL 2.0  or the GPLv3  or the LGPLv3.   Indeed. In general this function will work OK.However, IMHO Obfuscation Mixing should remain an optional choice for the user.

Yes adding enableobfuscate=0 in the .conf should disable it.However, in the 'tested' new MN instance, it did not. Hence, why I'm reporting the issue.   The post with the .i2p 'in' proxy link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1092682.msg12313202#msg12313202 - probably best not to register or login using that link though!...Exchanges like this one could prove solvency by using physical bullion, with a signed messages, similar to how eCache operated through Tor (pre-Bitcoin) ...- http://p2pfoundation.net/ECache- http://www.scribd.com/doc/27467097/Interview-With-Operator-of-eCacheI have advocated this type of Pseudonymous Proof-of-Valve (combined asset certification / ownership) for building a Proof-of-Value Network using Physical Bullion on top of the CBX Network;- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11844494#msg11844494Ofc proof-of-solvency in this regard is not going to prevent an 'anonymous' exchange from 'running' with users coins, but it would perhaps be better than nothing....Whilst I'm here, please consider adding Dnet - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262920.0 - to exchanged.i2pCheers! No. The issue would only potentially apply to the set-up of a new local Masternode on a 0 balance wallet address.It is not a major issue. Just something that new folks setting up masternodes could be confused by.The devs will understand what I'm referring to here. I'm referring to instances on 'One single Local Masternode' where the 10,000 Dnet balance is actually being received to the Masternode capable address.   Reporting a potential 'conflict of obfuscation' / Masternode activation issue when users set-up a new Masternode on a 0 balance wallet address, in regards to the v1.0.2.0 release setting: "Enabled Obfuscation by default, the new default is to keep 1000 DNET mixed with 8 rounds."- If the user is intending to set-up 'One single Local Masternode', receiving the 10,000 Dnet set-up (requirement) from say purchasing coins via an exchange, then the incoming transaction is likely to be met with an Obfuscation transaction fee payment from the balance (before the Masternode is enabled), thus leaving say a 9999.99981844 Dnet balance remaining and causing the user to receive the following unexpected message; "Not capable masternode: Could not find suitable coins!"Which can ofc be easily resolved by sending just 1 more Dnet to the same address and then making a new transaction of 10,000 Dnet to the same (your own) wallet address to allow for successful Masternode activation.   Dnet listing has been activated at cryptocoin.cc - - http://cryptocoin.cc/table.php?cryptocoin=darknet      Guessing everyone that cannot currently sync. the wallet is running windows or /Prototanium:0.10.1.1/ ?Last windows release was seemingly built from: - https://github.com/thegreatoldone/prototanium - 404 removed 'original' source - i.e. /Prototanium:0.10.1.1/Linux / VPS nodes synced and running have 10+ connections, including the block explorer: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/pr/Probably all being built from the 'latest' source: https://github.com/Prototanium/Pr - i.e. /Prototanium:0.10.1.2/Without having access to the 'original' source, I assume that a windows build / release of /Prototanium:0.10.1.2/ would most likely 'fix' this issue. For those of us interested in achieving 'true' privacy and anonymity of transactions, from the client/user perspective, the choice of OS is vital.Tails - https://tails.boum.org/ (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) - mentioned a few pages back, is an excellent choice for browsing the web and other tasks, although perhaps not as ideal for making crypto transactions, storing blockchains etc., (which is one reason it uses Electrum for Bitcoin).Again, this is for client wallets i.e. not for Masternodes. So,Whonix - is perhaps a way forward ... Realizing that this solution requires at least 2 machines (or 2 Virtual Boxes!), being a "Gateway" and a "Workstation".- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Whonix - "...Unlike Tails, Whonix is not "amnesic"; both the Gateway and the Workstation retain their past state across reboots. Not being amnesic improves security on the Gateway, by allowing Tor's "entry guard" system to choose long-lived entry points for the Tor network, reducing adversaries' ability to trap users by running malicious relays."...- https://www.whonix.org/"Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux and security by isolation.Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible. With Whonix, you can use applications and run servers anonymously over the internet. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP."orQubes OS - https://www.qubes-os.org/ - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubes_OS..."With Whonix integrated into Qubes, you can easily route network traffic through the Tor anonymity network."... No worries. Tested upgrading only from the previous guide, however the above should all be OK.Cheers!

More than 50-100+ Tor enabled DNET nodes would be something else!  EDIT: If anyone requires more detail for installing Tor with ARM controller on a VPS, check here:- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374919.msg13987295#msg13987295 Anyone running 'Dual Stack' Masternodes on mp hosting ? i.e. is Tor use allowed on mp hosting ?If so, it would be good for network diversity for MN operators to run as 'Dual Stack' nodes and to publish their own addnode=.onion addresses.- http://xeronet.c0m.li/dnet-crypto.php- Following set-up instructions from: 2. Install Tor as a CLIENT only config. for addnode=.onion connectivity.N.B. Tor CLIENT only configurations won't relay Tor traffic, only DNET P2P traffic over Tor. - Having a large majority of DNET network Masternodes running on the same IP block / Subnet Ranges (at a single hosting provider) is also perhaps not that great for network diversity! Although, I can understand the user requirement for easy-of-use / set-up and cheap and cheerful pricing etc.  Privacy networks, like Tor, actually enforce network diversity 'rules' by 'default' ; "EnforceDistinctSubnets 0|1    If 1, Tor will not put two servers whose IP addresses are "too close" on the same circuit. Currently, two addresses are "too close" if they lie in the same /16 range. (Default: 1)"Although, more Masternodes is obviously preferable to having fewer Masternodes.

The PoS block reward with the previous release was 0.00 GPL - when I tested it last!- Rules of Acquisition: 37 "The early investor reaps the most interest."  ?   Yes. Tails is a good distro. that includes Tor - although it will be better suited for clients making transactions than for nodes. After reviewing my musing post of yesterday: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262920.msg14130245#msg14130245It should be possible to simplify an Air-Gapped model for a single transaction path, using masternode's as mix-clusters i.e. ephemeral Authority node A and node B. These nodes (including the cllient) need to be unable to identify one other directly.- Doing true Air-Gapped transactions 'on-chain' remains a 'holy-grail', as most projects seem to have done some part of this mixing / sending 'off-chain'.So, at least there is the potential to discuss such an implementation with the dnet developers here.The existing transaction anonymity / obfuscation for dnet is still on par. with DASH ofc, and is stronger still when combined with Tor in terms of preventing traffic analysis.   I've made a basic review of the existing design and thought on how it might be possible to try and improve it, considering what we know works in existing anonymity systems.Firstly, being based on CoinJoin - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CoinJoin - the inputs/outputs method only partly solves privacy, but is still somewhat open to traceability, by a strong adversary.- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(cryptocurrency): "...Darksend is a coin-mixing service originally based on CoinJoin. Later iterations used a more advanced method of pre-mixing denominations built into the user's wallet.In its current implementation it adds privacy to transactions by combining identical inputs from multiple users into a single transaction with several outputs. Due to the identical inputs, transactions usually cannot be directly traced, obfuscating the flow of funds. A heuristic (based on inputs/outputs order) was suggested for partial tracing the transactions, but neither formal proof nor counter-proof was presented..."As s3v3nh4cks mentioned in an earlier post the best potential alternative to this method is likely utilizing an Air-Gapped solution.In other words, the outgoing transaction is sent to node A where the funds never directly leave to their destination address and instead node B sends the funds to the destination address.Looking at building onto the existing system it should be possible to create say Authority based servers, perhaps routed through several masternodes, for anonymity, similar to the Tor network design in principal.So, the transaction is sent from an already obfuscated balance, whereby the MN1 forwards the transaction (via 2 separate circuits) to Authority A and Authority B destinations (perhaps being larger, ephemeral pools of combined MN's!), that are able to combine identical inputs readily (without the need to match input/output).Example;The client sends to MN1 (which chooses the a and b (Middle Node Paths):- MN1 (Entry) - knows only the client and MN2a and MN2b (Middle), but does not know MN3a or MN3b respectfully or Authority A or Authority B.- MN2a and MN2b (Middle) - knows only MN1 and MN3a or MN3b respectfully (Exits), but does not know the client or Authority A or Authority B.- MN3a and MN3b (Exits) - knows only MN2a and MN2b (Middle) respectfully and Authority A or Authority B respectfully, they do not know MN1 (Entry) or the client.- Authority A retains the transaction amount (only knows MN3a). Authority B pays the destination (only knowing the recipient and MN3b) and confirms the transaction chain.Transactions overtime would likely average out the starting balances of Authority A or Authority B, although round-robin checks and balances could also be used. Furthermore, if Authority A and Authority B are actually comprised of random and ephemeral mix-clusters of existing Masternodes, then 'risk' is split between nodes, as well as outgoing payments to destinations i.e. their is no actual Authority A or Authority B.The above is highly theoretical, although is probably a near perfect anonymity system in terms of transaction privacy and masking traceability.One flaw still remains, which is the change in the balance on the clients wallet address, although partly obfuscated ofc, the coins remain 'spent'.It is of course very difficult to spend 'money', without actually spending it though!
Indeed. To this regard I recently made the following post in the CBX thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.1640..."All of the crypto-currency obfuscation systems in existence, to date, still cannot fully prevent the two main factors that can be used by a strong adversary to identify or to track an individual. These factors remain (1) acquisition (i.e. the trail of where your coins came from or how you originally acquired them) and (2) storage (i.e. your actual balance on a specific address and how it changed over time with regards to transactions, regardless of any obfuscation efforts). At best, users might gain only some plausible deniability.As satoshi stated, Bitcoin can provide reasonable anonymity and privacy if it's used correctly i.e. you might mine PoW coins to a fresh wallet address, over Tor, at a .onion enabled pool (such as eligius or mmpool, for example), only ever connecting the wallet via Tor, making transactions that don't identify you personally (which is practically impossible in reality, being the you are most likely the recipient of any goods or services etc.,) and then abandoning said wallet / address entirely.It could also be argued that using 3rd party mixing services is actually bad for your anonymity!"...and from : https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_modular_redundancy- There is an old adage to this effect, stating: "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three." Meaning, if two chronometers contradict, how do you know which one is correct?   - http://www.onion-router.net/History.html- http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/tor-design.pdfStill much great reading to be found here: http://www.freehaven.net/papers.html   As a general rule, truly secure, private and 'anonymous' systems should avoid any one single point of failure.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_modular_redundancy- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_modular_redundancyAs in " who guards the guardians? " - which is actually not dis-similar to how Tor hidden_services work.Maybe something like PageKite is more feasible though - https://pagekite.net/ - *whistles* ...That is already technically possible, but it is not really a good idea for the network, either for Tor and/or dnet nodes.The Tor network simply does not have enough .exit IP's to make that a viable option, coupled with the fact that unless you know how to fully edit your torrc for this purpose, then Tor IP circuits rotate every 10 mins by 'default' anyway.It would therefore be a much better option to obtain a bunch of cheap / private Socks proxy (static) IP addresses and to use those instead.Although, running a node as onlynet=onion and then using your own addnode=.onion hidden_service address effectively as externalip=.onion could work OK, in theory.- https://bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin - realize however that a number of these Connection options: are currently unique to Bitcoin Core with the version 0.12.0 release and that code updates would be required to dnet and/or respectfully dash for this to function...Moreover, the real issue here being that IP addresses are 'unique' and that FQDN's (fully qualified domain names) are not, as multiple domain names can ofc operate from a single IP address (i.e. as with shared hosting and with .onion addresses).Your 'technical issue' exists, because the Masternode design was seemingly created to try and prevent this form of centralized monopoly of Masternode ownership, in terms of network effects, at the very minimum.   Guess so.Also, seems that Vultr made some website updates this month and have a 'free' $50 promotion running.- https://www.vultr.com/freetrial/ - (not an affiliate link).Great for anyone who might not have ever used a Linux VPS before to perhaps sign-up for!   Anyone setting-up a 'Dual Stack' Masternode / Tor VPS might also consider running the node as a Tor Relay, providing bandwidth to other Tor users.Client Only torrc (example) config:Amendments / additions to run as a Tor Relay (example):## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.Nickname MyDnetRelayExample## Administrative contact information for this relay or bridge.

So, If you can't be a Relay - be a Bridge:- https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#RunningABridgeExample Bandwidth setting:## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must## be at least 20 kilobytes per second.## Note that units for these config options are bytes (per second), not## bits (per second), and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10,## 2^20, etc.#RelayBandwidthRate 100 KBytes  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)#RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KBytes # But allow bursts up to 200KB (1600Kb)EDIT:- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1262920.msg14155533#msg14155533These settings enable a Relay to be 'useful' in terms of bandwidth, although still very unlikely to exceed the 1 TB bandwidth limits of VPS providers such as Vultr or Digital Ocean (including the dnet node bandwidth). N.B. Do not run a Tor Exit node at either Vultr or Digital Ocean, they only tolerate Tor Relays (non-exits).Anyhow, if your not going to be running a web server on the VPS then this is perhaps a good way to utilize the bandwidth and get your 'moneys worth' from the hosting provider. 300+ masternodes, all running as Tor Relays would make for a very useful addition to the existing Tor network and for users privacy!- https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-relay-debian.html- https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/tshirt.html   - https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoodBadISPs   No worries. Probably also a good opportunity to dispel some media myths in regards to the term 'Dark Net'.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJNxbpbHA-I&feature=youtu.be&t=16m9s- "Every web page out there that google can't index" - Arma.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet"A darknet (or dark net) is an overlay network that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization, often using non-standard communications protocols and ports. Two typical darknet types are friend-to-friend networks (usually used for file sharing with a peer-to-peer connection) and privacy networks such as Tor.The reciprocal term for an encrypted darknet is clearnet or surface web when referring to search engine indexable content."Some good uses for a 'DarkNet' might include;- To better protect the privacy rights of citizens from targeted and mass surveillance- Protecting dissidents from political reprisal- Whistleblowing and news leaksUsing Tor with addnode=.onion connectivity for P2P crypto-currency wallet connections is perhaps more accurately described as a "friend-to-friend" network, over being a 'Dark Net'.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend...The recent showtime docu-series 'Dark Net' made for some interesting, informative and disturbing viewing.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Net_(TV_series)- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5397520/"A documentary series that explores the furthest reaches of the internet and the people who frequent it, Dark Net provides a revealing and cautionary look inside a vast cyber netherworld rarely witnessed by most of us."   Enabling any crypto-currency to run 100% over an anonymity network by 'default' is perhaps not the best choice for all users.Bundling the Tor software with any coin is also generally not a good idea or 'best practice'.- https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faqPresenting all users with information and allowing them to make an informed choice on how they want to connect is the better option....It is already possible to use this coin 100% over Tor (just like you can with Bitcoin).darknet.conf (example)Code:listen=0port=989proxy=127.0.0.1:9150maxconnections=8onion=127.0.0.1:9150addnode=y5kcscnhpygvvnjn.onion:989addnode=5bmhtjvn2jvwpiej.onion:989addnode=pyfdxkazur3iib7y.onion:989addnode=ok3ym5zy6m5klimk.onion:989addnode=i6vpvzk2jxuqqs5f.onion:989addnode=bgdhpb76fkbw5fmg.onion:989addnode=f7j2m26rptm5f7af.onion:989addnode=gtlqzb5zbws5di7g.onion:989- which would connect you to (available) addnode=.onion's inside the Tor network and allow for your wallets connections to also exit to other  clearnet IP nodes / masternodes.Code:listen=0port=989maxconnections=6onion=127.0.0.1:9150onlynet=onionaddnode=y5kcscnhpygvvnjn.onion:989addnode=5bmhtjvn2jvwpiej.onion:989addnode=pyfdxkazur3iib7y.onion:989addnode=ok3ym5zy6m5klimk.onion:989addnode=i6vpvzk2jxuqqs5f.onion:989addnode=bgdhpb76fkbw5fmg.onion:989addnode=f7j2m26rptm5f7af.onion:989addnode=gtlqzb5zbws5di7g.onion:989- would connect you to only (available) addnode=.onion's inside the Tor network - which is the most 'anonymous' / private way to connect, as your connections never leave the Tor network.Using socks port 9150 in your .conf enables connectivity through the Tor Browser Bundle, right out-of-the-box !- https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html...Users who don't want anonymity or privacy features might instead look to use the litemode=1 setting, which completely disables obfuscation mixing in the wallet.~ In exactly the same way that many different groups of people and individuals use the Tor network for anonymity, you need all of these aspects in-the-mix for a healthy balance of privacy, security, anonymity and good connectivity.The more masternode operators that can run as 'Dual Stack' nodes (and are able to publish their own addnode=.onion address), the better the diversity becomes for increased privacy and anonymity - for all users that require said functionality.   A basic Linux VPS install / set-up guide here: http://xeronet.c0m.li/dnet-crypto.php - apparently a work in progress.Reference: Set-up Fail2ban - an intrusion prevention framework;- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374919.msg14037105#msg14037105Reference: iptables (strict) Linux VPS firewall rules;- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374919.msg14038073#msg14038073   Just wanted to let the CBX community know that I'm still very much researching and formulating the Proof-of-Value Network concept.In relation to Digital Gold Currency, I stumbled upon the following issue of "Digital Gold Magazine" yesterday;- http://www.scribd.com/doc/294575032/Digital-Gold-Magazine-Jan-2016Which should make for a very interesting read for anyone holding CBX with an appreciation for precious metals. It also covers some interesting aspects regarding privacy and security.TBH I'd never heard of the Digital Cash Alliance - https://digitalcash.to/ or SilentVault - https://silentvault.com with 'off-chain' P2P transactions before reading the article (well maybe I had, but not really investigated it fully).Anyhow, what really continues to amaze me is that historically, pretty much all centralized Digital gold currency - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_gold_currency - has not ended well at all, yet this industry continues to proliferate 'certification' and 'redemption' on that very basis.Again, "If you don't hold it, you don't own it". One aspect that is interesting, in terms of these essentially centralized / counterparty offerings is their use of PageKite - https://pagekite.net/ a redundant server stack which can operate without a forward facing IP addresses!I digress...      Located new working addnode=.onion's for this coin via the Tor Atlas, not currently being listed in the OP.- https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/7FBBEAF3011C0E8498214611B1601AB0BB0420A9- https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/8B1434497F187A5E10756F5227764324D13CC68F   Does genesis-mining .com operate their own merge mining pool for UNO ? or are they just merge mining at another pool ? - Figured that they are probably merge mining and then off-setting their own costs through the 'customers choice' as to which coin they mine ?   I concur with this. The main focus for CBX should remain firmly on security, over privacy and anonymity features.PoS coins (arguably) offer much less transaction anonymity when compared with PoW coins anyhow. The actual process of staking in fact continually relinquishes a wallets (users) anonymity to the blockchain, coupled with the fact that most people will acquire their coins though exchange purchases, which is far from ideal in terms of true anonymity to begin with.All of the crypto-currency obfuscation systems in existence, to date, still cannot fully prevent the two main factors that can be used by a strong adversary to identify or to track an individual. These factors remain (1) acquisition (i.e. the trail of where your coins came from or how you originally acquired them) and (2) storage (i.e. your actual balance on a specific address and how it changed over time with regards to transactions, regardless of any obfuscation efforts). At best, users might gain only some plausible deniability.As satoshi stated, Bitcoin can provide reasonable anonymity and privacy if it's used correctly i.e. you might mine PoW coins to a fresh wallet address, over Tor, at a .onion enabled pool (such as eligius or mmpool, for example), only ever connecting the wallet via Tor, making transactions that don't identify you personally (which is practically impossible in reality, being the you are most likely the recipient of any goods or services etc.,) and then abandoning said wallet / address entirely.It could also be argued that using 3rd party mixing services is actually bad for your anonymity!In regards to CBX, privacy and pseudo-anonymity can help to provide some users with added security or just simply increased accessibility. Being able to run your PoSP (PoS) wallet over Tor to known (trusted) addnode=.onion addresses can be of benefit to some users. Quite simply in just getting better connectivity.Dual stack nodes are the way to go, with around 8 to 10 known (published) addnode=.onion addresses for CBX nodes being made available. This would allow CLIENTS to only utilize addnode=.onion connectivity over Tor for best anonymity / privacy / network connectivity.So, SOCKS5 proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 (port 9150 for TBB) , onion=127.0.0.1:9050 (again, port 9150 for TBB) and/or onlynet=onion compatibility features being included in a future CBX wallet release.Reference: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin-onion=<ip:port> Use separate SOCKS5 proxy to reach peers via Tor hidden services (default: -proxy)-onlynet=<net> Only connect to nodes in network <net> (ipv4, ipv6 or onion)-port=<port> Listen for connections on <port>It is also important to consider correct Port connectivity settings over Tor, which often requires both client and server correctly forwarding addnode=.onion connectivity to a Tor friendly port: Reference: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicyNodes don't need to be run as Tor Relays or Exit Nodes, they just need to correctly transition traffic to Tor friendly .exit ports from other Tor Exits Nodes.I have in fact already started a Linux Tor guide for Bitcoin here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374919.0 - in regards to the new functionality in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 .I would be able to set up dual stack addnode=.onion's dedicated to CBX, and provide a guide for others to follow, although it is unlikely to be something I would undertake without community / developer support (both financial and/or free as in beer), as it effectively requires maintaining and running more than 4 dedicated CBX nodes on cloud servers. The other nodes need to be run by community members, anonymous or otherwise, as one individual running all nodes is certainly not a decentralized approach!Cheers! Very nice!- certainly another marked improvement in lowering memory usage.In my honest opinion, CBX PoSP pretty much renders more than 1/4 of the top 100 alt coins on coinmarketcap as totally archaic by comparison.   Thanks!Anyone using windows and running Bitcoin (full nodes or otherwise) might afford some additional protection by using a good P2P IP based firewall, such as PeerBlock.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerBlock- http://www.peerblock.com/releases- https://www.iblocklist.com/lists   iptables (strict) Linux VPS firewall rules:Reference: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowToCode:sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT// Allow all loopback (lo0) traffic and drop all traffic to 127/8 that doesn't use lo0Code:sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT// "We can allow established sessions to receive traffic:"or// "If the line above doesn't work, you may be on a castrated VPS whose provider has not made available the extension, in which case an inferior version can be used as last resort: "N.B.

As a general rule, if/when one starts to run out of space, one probably does require some more space!      This feature could be of more use in the future, especially if individual nodes will run 'dual stack' i.e. on clearnet and through Tor.I've started a thread on that basis here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374919.0- How-to Guide: Set-up Tor on Linux (Ubuntu) and connect Bitcoin   How-to Guide: Set-up Tor on Linux (Ubuntu) and connect Bitcoin- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374919.0   Part 2- Setting up and running bitcoind on your VPS- Running a 'dual stack' bitcoind i.e. on clearnet and though Tor.- Using 'ephemeral' hidden services as addnode=.onion'sAvailable soon. How-to Guide: Set-up Tor on Linux (Ubuntu) and connect BitcoinWith the release of Bitcoin Core version 0.12.0- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374377.0We see the following developments for using Bitcoin with Tor:Automatically use Tor hidden services-------------------------------------Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socketAPI, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically.Bitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available),Bitcoin Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, withoutmanual configuration. Bitcoin Core will also use Tor automatically to connectto other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened. Thiswill positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening, anda connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the `-listenonion`,`-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings. To show verbose debugginginformation, pass `-debug=tor`.A good guide for how-to easily set-up Tor on Linux (Ubuntu) for use with Bitcoin seemed somewhat lacking, so here goes:(Part 1) - Install Tor with ARM Controller.Assuming that you already have SSH access to your server:Code:sudo apt-get updateCode:sudo apt-get dist-upgradeCheck that you have the following packages installed and/or install them:Code:sudo apt-get install nano screen ca-certificates openssl ntp ntpdateCheck your time server offset:Code:ntpdate -q ntp.ubuntu.comReboot here, if necessary.OK. Let's add the Tor official package repository to our sources list:Reference: https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html#ubuntuCode:echo 'deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org trusty main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.listImport the key:Code:gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 886DDD89or use: gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89Now export the key:Code:gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -Refresh our sources again and we should now see http:// deb. torproject. org being hit a bunch of times.Code:sudo apt-get updateInstall Tor:Code:sudo apt-get install torNow Stop Tor, as we need to configure it properly:Code:sudo service tor stopThe Tor Project provides a package to keep the signing key current, which is a good thing, so let's install it:Code:sudo apt-get install deb.torproject.org-keyringInstall Tor GeoIP data base (might have already installed it):Code:sudo apt-get install tor-geoipdbInstall Tor ARM controller:Code:sudo apt-get install tor-arm apparmor-utilsDone.Next we need to configure how Tor will run. We do this by editing our torrc file.Code:sudo nano /etc/tor/torrcThe most important lines in the torrc to add or uncomment (removing the #) for basic CLIENT only (i.e. non-bridge, non-relay, non-exit) Bitcoin operation through Tor are:See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html- The above torrc config. connects us to the Tor network, as CLIENT only and ensures the SOCKS Port 9050 is accessible from our localhost (127.0.0.1:9050) for Bitcoin to connect through. N.B. This is also considered an optimal config. for hosting your own Bitcoin addnode=.onion Tor 'ephemeral' hidden_service.Navigate the torrc screen using your keyboard's arrow keys. When done, Save the torrc config. with:Now we are ready to start Tor and the ARM controller using a separate screen session (which is very convenient when using a VPS).Start (restart) Tor:Code:sudo service tor restartCreate a new screen session called tor:Code:screen -S torNow start ARM within the new 'tor' screen session:Code:sudo -u debian-tor armN.B. if 'sudo' won't run, then just use only > armSuccess! Now Tor and ARM are running. You can navigate the ARM 'tabs' using the arrow keys on your keyboard.To exit ARM's screen session (although keep it running when you exit the VPS or continue to work in another screen) press:To re-enter the running screen:Code:screen -r torN.B. Use this command and not ' screen -S tor ' to check that Tor / ARM are running when you next login to your VPS.You only need to use ' screen -S tor ' if you restarted the VPS or shut down the screen session.You can also use ARM to shut down Tor (closing ARM by pressing q q) , first using the menu tab m in ARM or simply just use:Code:sudo service tor stopN.B. Some VPS servers do not allow using the 'sudo' command as user, so simply omit any reference to 'sudo' in any line above if you encounter this issue.OK. Part 2 of this guide will look to cover:- Setting up and running bitcoind on your VPS- Running a 'dual stack' bitcoind i.e. on clearnet and though Tor.- Using 'ephemeral' hidden services as addnode=.onion'sIf this guide was useful for you please consider some 'tips / donations' at http://StartOR.org - Cheers!   Notes for anyone trying to compile the /UniCoin:1.0.0/ daemon from source: https://github.com/unicoindev/unicoinPackages: (some you probably don't need, anyway)Code:sudo apt-get updateCode:sudo apt-get dist-upgradeCode:sudo apt-get install git make build-essential libssl-dev libdb++-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-devCode:sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compilerCode:sudo apt-get install miniupnpc libminiupnpc-dev autoconf automake libtool pkg-configBest reboot here after install.Build:Code:mkdir UnicoinCode:cd UnicoinCode:git clone https://github.com/unicoindev/unicoin.git .N.B. the . to git clone into the same folder, which is useful.Code:cd srcCode:mkdir objN.B. obj folder was missing, causing compile error.Code:cd leveldbCode:sh build_detect_platform build_config.mk ./N.B. build_config.mk was also missing.Code:cdCode:cd UnicoinCode:cd srcCode:make -f makefile.unix "USE_UPNP=-"N.B.

Actually, for an alt. with such (comparatively) high historical trade volumes on cryptopia, it could probably use a lot of things.   Just wanted to clarify that I can probably run more than one electrum-server-uno as a Tor 'hidden_service'. One instance likely being dual stack i.e. optionally available over Tor, for increased user accessability and some privacy, whilst also being available over the clearnet....Thank you to everyone who kindly tipped some UNO for the IP nodes I posted.  Cheers! ...OK so that's very light on everything then.I have a few Tor relay's running currently. It will be straight forward enough to point a domain name at it, install Let's Encrypt SSL - https://letsencrypt.org/ and link the electrum-server-uno via a Tor hidden_service.Might as well try to make myself useful.

I will check where the network sync is at before posting the node IP   @makiI have just been discussing some new UNO and PR nodes with @FallingKnifeThey will have enough space to add 2 Unicoin nodes (maybe temporary) whilst this project gets back on track. I will put the nodes up and then see if @BitcoinNational still has the bounty offered above.   However, I seem unable to get a block source for Unicoin at present. Do you have a download link for the blockchain .zip or .rar ?In the meantime, also try to contact and get this listed on cryptochainer: http://cryptochainer.com/dir/Cheers! - https://emerproxy.xyz - using OpenNIC DNS to resolve Emercoin domain names is now also accessible via a Tor network hidden_service.- Tor .onion address : eivd4nanrtr2qkk6.onion (experimental)https is also functional for the .onion address, however, Let's Encrypt do not currently sign .onion address SSL certificates. So, you will receive a certificate warning in TBB when first using https. Of course, the 4096-bit encryption is functional (and secure) if you accept the certificate warning. N.B....Untrusted Connection> Technical Detailseivd4nanrtr2qkk6.onion uses an invalid security certificate.The certificate is only valid for the following names:  www.emerproxy.xyz, emerproxy.xyz  (Error code: ssl_error_bad_cert_domain)> I Understand the RisksAdd Exception...As the hidden_service .onion (proxy) is also running on a TLD (and corresponding clearnet IP address) it is ofc possible to verify that the SSL certificate is the same. So, the certificate warning can be considered somewhat irrelevant, as nothing 'bad' is happening here.However, this service is highly experimental (alpha) and should not be relied upon for strong anonymity or privacy.Users should understand that this hidden_service is not actually hidden! Also, that this six-hop .exit circuit is not recognised as an official Tor exit node IP, due to it being a 'hidden_service', running on a Tor Bridge (i.e. in principal a non-exit Tor relay).Such as service is useful, as (secure / anonymous) access to alternative domain names is not ordinarily feasible whilst using the Tor network. Thus, it might be useful to security services, for example, in checking the content of active or registered .emc domains etc.,...Please do not all run to 'test' this service at once, as the server currently requires a RAM and core upgrade, due to increasing popularity as a general encrypted web based proxy.N.B. This service is also beta testing emcLNX rotator advertising (currently with a single pop and static links), as I wanted to try and demonstrate some potential issues with that system. The pop-ad can be avoided by making your first website click, using only the second mouse button.This service is using the Surrogafier proxy script. So, it does not currently support flash. It also requires javascript (to some degree) to function correctly, which can effect the users anonymity. Again, this service is not really intended for 'regular' privacy browsing of the internet, but is useful in checking .emc domains. Great stuff!As always, the issues with making this work from a technical perspective is one thing and then actually getting communities to best utilize a provided solution is another thing entirely.Being able to broadcast (or send and receive) audio transactions would perhaps be the most useful feature to try implementing initially.One wonders exactly what percentage of people from the occupy movement, for example, even bother to actively use Bitcoin currently !   I'm not fully acquainted yet with everything that the HAMradiocoin project has achieved.Projects like the Free Network Foundation - https://thefnf.org/ - are of interest to me though.- https://youtu.be/Fx93WJPCCGs?t=3m15s - Free the Network: Hackers Take Back the WebMost issues related to Net Neutrality - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality- can be overcome using Mesh Networking https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networkingBeing able to use decentralized free Radio / Mesh Networks for crypto-currency transactions truly facilitates the future of digital-cash for communities or wider society i.e. without corporate control and without banks.In fact, everything here is (mostly) already technically feasible;- http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoiners-finland-send-cryptocurrency-radio/- http://kryptoradio.koodilehto.fi/For the purpose of making transactions, one-way communications could already effectively be made two-way, as the receiver can send a one-way confirmation back - https://youtu.be/HRwiAk2wjZoAs garmin mentioned, something similar to Chirp - http://www.chirp.io/ - (although fully decentralized) could easily be implemented for converting / broadcasting QR codes as .wav files (encrypted with something similar to ZRTP).- https://youtu.be/DoeNbZlxfUM?t=37m7s - see: Moxie M, presenting Red Phone app. now Signal app. https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal/Recommended HAM project codename: flatfoot Eskimo  ?     10:11:46￼[{"id" : 1,"addr" : "75.19.27.27:65525","services" : "0000000000000001","lastsend" : 1455271849,"lastrecv" : 1455271849,"bytessent" : 350441,"bytesrecv" : 4417387,"conntime" : 1455187691,"timeoffset" : 2,"pingtime" : 0.24501400,"version" : 70002,"subver" : "/Unobtanium:0.10.1.1/","inbound" : false,"startingheight" : 203201,"banscore" : 0,"synced_headers" : 204869,"synced_blocks" : 204869,"inflight" : [],"whitelisted" : false},{"id" : 2,"addr" : "75.19.27.28:65525","services" : "0000000000000001","lastsend" : 1455271849,"lastrecv" : 1455271849,"bytessent" : 6690769,"bytesrecv" : 2719240,"conntime" : 1455187692,"timeoffset" : 3,"pingtime" : 0.21201200,"version" : 70002,"subver" : "/Unobtanium:0.10.1.1/","inbound" : false,"startingheight" : 203201,"banscore" : 0,"synced_headers" : 204869,"synced_blocks" : 204869,"inflight" : [],"whitelisted" : false},{"id" : 3,"addr" : "69.28.82.86:65525","services" : "0000000000000001","lastsend" : 1455271849,"lastrecv" : 1455271849,"bytessent" : 355940,"bytesrecv" : 2828737,"conntime" : 1455187692,"timeoffset" : 1,"pingtime" : 0.17501000,"version" : 70002,"subver" : "/Prototanium:0.10.1.2/","inbound" : false,"startingheight" : 203201,"banscore" : 0,"synced_headers" : 204869,"synced_blocks" : 204869,"inflight" : [],"whitelisted" : false},{"id" : 4,"addr" : "73.9.181.217:18011","services" : "0000000000000001","lastsend" : 1455271857,"lastrecv" : 1455271857,"bytessent" : 2046968,"bytesrecv" : 4160498,"conntime" : 1455187693,"timeoffset" : 1,"pingtime" : 0.19001100,"version" : 70002,"subver" : "/Prototanium:0.10.1.2/","inbound" : false,"startingheight" : 203201,"banscore" : 0,"synced_headers" : 204869,"synced_blocks" : 204869,"inflight" : [],"whitelisted" : false},{"id" : 7,"addr" : "46.105.39.103:65525","services" : "0000000000000001","lastsend" : 1455271854,"lastrecv" : 1455271854,"bytessent" : 401448,"bytesrecv" : 2734431,"conntime" : 1455187697,"timeoffset" : 0,"pingtime" : 0.06900400,"version" : 70002,"subver" : "/Prototanium:0.10.1.2/","inbound" : false,"startingheight" : 203201,"banscore" : 0,"synced_headers" : 204868,"synced_blocks" : 204868,"inflight" : [],"whitelisted" : false}]https://chainz.cryptoid.info/pr/#!network   Great thread.I will vote other.You cannot trade in diminishing intangibility.When you stop producing something, eventually nothing is left.PoS is one solution, although the main factors building any Bitcoin 'value' from the get-go are finite, rarity and scarcity vectors and of course the electricity used to generate the coins. Other option - specify;Arguably, a near perfect solution (for any finite crypto-currency) would be for the network to be able to automatically determine addresses with unspent coins for x duration (say more than 100 years / or 'holder' determined time-frame) and then to have those dormant coins automatically returned back into the network as mined 'transaction fees'.This is likely the only true solution to maintain a finite supply of 21 Million BTC, whilst preventing the otherwise certain effects of diminishing intangibility.Of course technically very difficult to implement (security wise), much could be possible within 150 years, if Bitcoin makes it that far, although so far, so good.

This can be one of the good coins to outlast the crypto-warz / alt. stagnation.     You got it. 100% correct. Mindset and of course the actual physical value of the precious metal (bullion) 'backing' the collective CBX Proof-of-Value network certifications.Indeed no one is buying or selling anything, just simply representing combined 'value' for two things that they already own i.e. CBX and physical bullion, as a blockchain based 'smart' contract with one's self.This collective action can be described as a 'shield and spear' paradox of value - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Irresistible_force_paradoxIt is "what happens when an unstoppable force (CBX / Blockchain) meets an immovable object (Physical Bullion)?"The collective backing is not only representative value, but is also actual value i.e. 'worth'.As with crypto-currency, said value remains the property of the owner, yet the representative value is distributed and decentralized.If you don't hold it in your hand, you don't own it.This is the exact opposite to all 'debt based money' (collateralized debt obligation), it is collateralized asset certification and can also be used this way i.e. to demonstrate that you are 'good' for a loan or to show that a business has 'real' capital / backing. For example, a bullion retailer could also use this as proof of stock or reserve.Perhaps most importantly, the rehypothecation of bullion, becomes increasingly difficult or is made to be almost impossible with a true POV network. In fact, it is likely to render the old system (paper gold / markets) entirely obsolete, as they would become completely 'untrusted'.- http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-04-24/rehypothecation-gold-and-why-it-matters - The Rehypothecation Of Gold- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0pQNkX8jLM - Zeitgeist Addendum (HD) Part I - Federal Reserve... @Alex4J - You have certainly done a good job with streamlining the CBX wallet, implementing PoSP and optimizing the CBX code base.   ...Moving forward with Proof-of-Value Network / Proof-of-CBX certification project.Pitched here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11746755#msg11746755Demonstrated here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11844494#msg11844494Noting the existing work by Bitnation and MrChrisJ on GitHub with regards to "... citizenship with private passport services using available cryptographic tools", which could provide and interesting project to fork from.- https://github.com/Bit-Nation/World-Citizenship- https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-CitizenshipEssentially implementing a 'decentralised' Blockchain notary service, say similar to CryptoGraffiti - http://www.cryptograffiti.info/ - which is perhaps something worth considering.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg13708885#msg13708885Gradually finding the time to do a full write up on this, which is probably best presented on the CBX forum itself.

Other 3 could be rotational.Cheers!EDIT: addnode= The majority of perceived issues with this concept are fairly easily solved or are less problematic than they first appear to be.(1) Backed CBX becomes automatically un-backed if the self-signed CBX denomination is less than that certificated and after x duration expires i.e. 48 hours 'grace'. This process can be automated via a block explorer.(2) Self-signed Proof-of-Value certification should also automatically expire after a set duration (or on a network consensus based on block count), much in the same way as SSL certificates for https websites are valid for 60 days, 90 days, 180 days etc., or as blockchain name services have a set duration, as seen with namecoin or emercoin i.e. smart contract expiration.(3) Consensus based models could be implemented for 'trust' validation i.e. trusted vs untrusted backing consensus (dual pricing / value model). linked example: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(SSL) for how this might be achieved with a browser based plug-in running directly from the CBX wallet / blockchain, again much like namecoin or emercoin DNS, as a decentralized notary daemon.(4) Multiple representation of the same physical bullion by the same individual is unlikely, and is already somewhat overcome by using a network consensus 'trust' model. Furthermore, to represent the same bullion you still require additional CBX to back / sign / verify with, so doing this becomes increasingly expensive and unlikely. Remembering also that the main benefit of participation in a Proof-of-Value network is towards the collective value, above that of the individually represented value.All of the above can remain fully decentralized and Peer-to-Peer.    Indeed. Let's have a look into the nitty-gritty of how Proof-of-Value bullion backing actually benefits CBX through true price discovery.Example;Alice has 125 CBX and decides to back it with 5oz of .999 fine silver.Bob has 500 CBX and decides to back it with 10oz of .999 fine silver.Today (with a $13.58 London fix for 1oz silver at 12 noon) - http://www.lbma.org.uk/pricing-and-statistics ...Alice's 5oz silver x $13.58 = $67.90 / 125 CBX = a representative proof-of-value of $0.5432 per. CBX.Bob's 10oz silver x $13.58 = $135.8 / 500 CBX = a representative proof-of-value of $0.2716 per CBX.Alice and Bob's combined backing therefore equates to a proof-of-value (average) of $0.4074 per. CBX. The Proof-of-Value Network becomes more interesting when;Carol has 100 CBX and decides to back it with x amount of gold.Desmond has 1 CBX and decides to back it with x amount of palladium.elambert has 10,000 CBX and decides to back it with x amount of platinum.  As more people (and businesses) continue to participate in the Proof-of-Value network CBX/Real-Bullion value begins to realize true price discovery and finds equilibrium against the total CBX supply.Anyone backing their own CBX holdings would be increasingly likely to back against the established proof-of-value (network average).Everyone is also likely to back (adjust) their current holdings against the changing proof-of-value (network moving average).Backed CBX is technically not in current circulation. Thus, we can also define CBX in circulation (more on this later - to be defined).This network effect can directly benefit true price discovery. For example;Network participants are increasingly less likely to back 1,000 CBX with just 1oz of silver (due to finite CBX supply), especially when most participants are backing 0.01 CBX with 1oz of gold (for example). This, in fact, not being dissimilar to how a 51% network attack becomes to 'expensive' to procure against a PoS coin, as network participation involves one's self holding both assets i.e. CBX and precious metal in combination....I could type a lot more regarding theory here - although I have tried to keep this post as concise as possible.   I did not intend to put a dampener on any Bitcoin, CryptoBullion or P2P trading for precious metals (in my previous post).I'm obviously all for that.   The prices seem to be fairly reasonable. It really depends upon what you are looking to buy.Stacks (25) of 1oz Silver Britannia's are a good option perhaps. Generally you want to try and avoid paying much over the spot price per. Silver 1oz.TBH even a UK based website like BullionByPost is quite reasonable, if you can buy a good few stacks in one order to get the discounts.1oz Silver Britannia's have a 2 pound face value as a UK legal tender coin, are fine silver at .999 purity, are Capital Gains Tax Free and insured delivery is always a bonus.If you are able to buy-in around double the quantity that you intend to store long-term, it is usually possible to split up one of the stacks in say around 2-3 years and then sell the individual coins for a very good mark-up. International collectors are often keen to complete sets of individual yearly coin issues, especially on bidding websites. Even with the reduction in the spot price it is possible to double up on the purchase price on an individual coin, if you brought some in bulk. Nothing is ever for certain though.Tenth Ounce Gold Britannia's are also good to buy in stacks. However, buying bullion bars close to the spot price can be cost saving for smaller orders. It really depends.Trying to find better deals using Bitcoin accepting sellers and/or buying bullion from outside of the UK is generally not that beneficial really, unless you are looking for rare or unique items etc.,- Why Silver And NOT Gold - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBVgQBuDt4E    Thank you @Killiz In regards to my previous post, we might also look at the example of digix - https://dgx.io/ on the Ethereum platform - apparently being a company that is offering blockchain based assets (paper gold contracts) in exchange for your Ethereum. "the first Smart Asset company built on Ethereum"So, in contrast to a PoV Network, this would in fact appear to be a centralized store-of-value (of physical gold) representative on a blockchain technology, although apparently your gold (decentralized asset cards / tokens) are 'fully redeemable' !?!- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_gold_currency ... !?!As with crypto-currency, the best and only way to truly own anything is to actually hold it yourself.If anyone wants to exchange crypto-currency 'value' for physical bullion then that's all well and good. However, not having to trust a 3rd party with your 'money' is exactly one thing that Bitcoin (mostly) solved!With a truly decentralized Proof-of-Value network, there is no 3rd party, counter party or company to trust whatsoever, you (as an individual or company) have only to present existing value to an already fully peer-to-peer based network, adding value and price stability for everyone.   @elambert recently forwarded a reddit post to me regarding the CBX PoV (Proof-of-Value) concept.- https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoBullionX/comments/42qtqh/i_dont_get_it_please_explain/Perhaps someone would be kind enough to post a response, as I don't currently use reddit.- Sending any quantity of CBX from a 'backed' physical bullion wallet address, beyond the self-signed allocation, effectively breaks the contract that you made with yourself. PoV CBX addresses would be automatically and consistently checked via the blockchain (explorer) for validity in this regard. Technically the physical bullion is backing the CBX and not vice versa. If you might envisage spending half of your CBX in the near future, then you would perhaps choose to back with just half the quantity of CBX, for example. You are of course free to send and receive CBX to/from a 'backed' address above the presented 'backed' quantity and/or to spend any PoSP interest.- Nothing in regards to the physical bullion itself "signs" it or ties it directly to the amount of CBX, except for the self-signed contract that you are creating with yourself and then presenting to the network, in terms to Proof-of-Value and ownership, of course also being directly linked to the weight and type of the physical bullion represented.- The CBX signing message and verification system effectively facilitates an 'open' standard for a Proof-of-Value network including a blockchain based technology. Anyone is able to verify that the message is valid. Such a system is also useful for trading if each party wants to confirm ownership.- https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18qy88/bitcoin_message_signing_and_verification/It is also useful in terms of providing literal Proof-of-Value, i.e. perhaps in terms of issuing assets, as with coinprism - https://www.coinprism.com/ for Bitcoin and colored 'coins'.Moreover, the collective 'value' of the physical bullion 'backing' x amount of CBX (against the total supply) would primarily allow for a combined 'live' comparison widget, not dissimilar to this example for Bitcoin;- BTC to gold - http://preev.com/btc/xau- BTC to silver - http://preev.com/btc/xag- BTC to platinum - http://preev.com/btc/xpt- BTC to palladium - http://preev.com/btc/xpdOf course, the essence of our PoV Network creation being to find price equilibrium for CBX/Real-Bullion - untied from the current market value of BTC on crypto exchanges.A Proof-of-Value Network, using blockchain technology for verification can truly remain open, decentralized and P2P, whilst enabling true independent price discovery. PoSP also helps to facilitate this model very well indeed.I have described this kind of Proof-of-Value Network as a 'Paradox-of-Value', as in modern times we have all become far to familiar with using currency as a 'debt' based system. Blockchain technology gives us all the ability to not only store and send value in or on a blockchain, but also to add and to represent value (and ownership) on a blockchain.As @lab rat hoax described "Collateralized asset certification (as opposed to collateralized Debt obligation)".- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11903796#msg11903796 Great episode of the Keiser Report - Episode 864- https://www.rt.com/shows/keiser-report/329404-episode-max-keiser-864/Dis-intermediation / true price discovery"tally sticks and gold standards"..."In the second half, Max continues his interview with Reggie Middleton about Pathogenic Finance: The autonomous, anti-fragile, trustless paradigm shift transforming banking, brokerage, securities and insurance."- basically all about PoV Networks and 'linking' assets on the blockchain.Using CryptoBullion in this regard is truly bleeding-edge fintech.The CBX community has demonstrated, in practice, exactly what financial experts are referring to as the future.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11844494#msg11844494We have much work to do on this still, although it is already possible to amalgamate the existing community PoVN data and present a 'true price discovery' model for physical bullion against the 'value' of CBX.   It is probably worth noting here that the Dcrypt algorithm was desgined to be both GPU and ASIC resistant ~ even pooled mining resistant, to some extent, away from centralization.CPU mining is still feasible with Slimcoin, just as CPU mining was once feasible with Bitcoin.The Slimcoin wallet does have a built-in Dcrypt miner. To start mining Slimcoin, after downloading the Slimcoin wallet and fully syncing with the blockchain, simply goto;Help (Tab) > Debug window > Console (Tab)  and type;Code:setgenerate truewhich will start mining Slimcoin with all CPU cores / threads.or setgenerate true 'number of CPU cores / threads' i.e.Code:setgenerate true 4which selects the number of CPU cores / threads to mine with.to confirm your mining hash rate type;Code:gethashespersecto stop mining Slimcoin in the wallet type;Code:setgenerate falseCPU-Z is useful for determining the number of cores / threads for your PC - http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.htmlSlimcoin PoW difficulty remains comparatively low;getdifficulty14:43:37{"proof-of-work" : 0.00937144,"proof-of-stake" : 0.03124954,"search-interval" : 1}...Furthermore, still seeking any serious developers who might be interested in Slimcoin, I will endeavor to contact some folks and try to ignite some interest perhaps. Thought of the day:"Do you own Gold or Silver ?" , "Register your asset ownership on the blockchain"...with a Wealthie = "a Pseudonymous Selfie of Digital Ownership on a Blockchain"     
"DECENTRALIZED crypto currency (including Bitcoin) is a delusion (any solutions?)"Crypto Bullion (CBX) now has PoSP (Proof-of-Stake Participation) which can equal Increased Decentralized Network Participation.Also looking at a combined Proof-of-Value Network to equal Independent Decentralized Price Discovery through Participation.A "Shield and Spear Paradox" of "Digital proof of ownership" - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11901786#msg11901786Arguably, against your opening gambit, such a 'solution' helps somewhat against centralization, although the (perceived) issue of 'scalability' perhaps remains.Much work to be done still from a technical standpoint, although I thought that you might find this interesting.Great thread BTW OP. A thread worth reading ...- DECENTRALIZED crypto currency (including Bitcoin) is a delusion (any solutions?)- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1319681.0Does Proof-of-Stake Participation and a Proof-of-Value Network in fact offer a solution (to a perceived problem) !PoSP = Increased Decentralized Network Participation.PoVN = Independent Decentralized Price Discovery through Participation. Yep. Still here.I'm no expert economist and always learning as we progress. My skill set from pitfalls continues to evolve !Who was it that said "Bitcoin is the devils way of teaching geeks economics" ?Phase 2 ... now we geeks have learned better economics ...    Freicoin applied the economic principal of demurrage to crypto-currency.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/FreigeldThis effectively established a centralized 'pool' from 'taxing' its holders. The main issue for the model is seemingly collective indecision of how exactly to return 'cash flow' from the centralized pool, mostly with regards to 'value'.Bitcoin, as a modern monetary system (or store-of-value), being more akin to gold and without any central (issuing) authority does not require holders to sustain demurrage. Here we can note the wiki reference to 'E-gold' with regards to bullion storage;"E-gold is an example of a modern private currency in which demurrage is applied. In this case there is a gold storage charge of 1% per annum. The demurrage associated with e-gold is arguably expended by the currency operator to help cover real storage costs."Again, in the instance of Bitcoin (or CryptoBullion), we see no 3rd party or centralized authority to levy any such charge. Demurrage principal is entirely unnecessary to the fundamental function of the system. Perhaps in much the same way that physical bullion ownership can be considered private, arguably without any actual storage costs.VonSpass has covered well ' inflation / deflation ' in the last post, with regards to CBX.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg13489229#msg13489229Neither Freicoin or Bitcoin can lend themselves as well to a "shield and spear paradox" of value (in terms of scarcity and rarity):- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11901786#msg11901786Currency:- Medium of Exchange- A Unit of Account- Portable- Durable- Divisible- Fungible (Interchangeable)Money (the above plus):- A Store of ValueFreicoin is in fact therefore not money, because its Store-of-Value depreciates overtime, as mentioned.Commodity money, as a Store-of-Value, can always have actual (useful) and perceived intrinsic value i.e. like CryptoBullion.For example, when comparing the current low gold price against the US dollar or low oil price against the US dollar, we can ask ourselves what has more intrinsic value? A piece of paper or the actual physical commodity. This is the lie that banks, markets and governments have sold to the world. Finite commodities (commodity money) have intrinsic value over currency.Perhaps, now that PoSP is running for CBX we can start to look more at the intrinsic value of CBX against physical bullion, and members of this community have already demonstrated how this can be achieved collectively, without a central authority.One crypto-currency which is also starting to lead the way in "Digital proof of ownership" is Emercoin: http://emercoin.com/EMCDPO   v2.3 running, seems that's got it!18:30:11getdifficulty18:30:12{"proof-of-work" : 48.33048138,"PoSP" : 0.00529092,"search-interval" : 2}18:30:45getdifficulty18:30:46{"proof-of-work" : 48.33048138,"PoSP" : 0.04820161,"search-interval" : 1}18:31:30getdifficulty18:31:31{"proof-of-work" : 48.33048138,"PoSP" : 0.00401166,"search-interval" : 1}18:32:26getdifficulty18:32:26{"proof-of-work" : 48.33048138,"PoSP" : 0.18270906,"search-interval" : 1}18:33:33getdifficulty18:33:33{"proof-of-work" : 48.33048138,"PoSP" : 13.05105380,"search-interval" : 1}   Visiting https://check.torproject.org/ will confirm that your Tor connection is working properly.Hovering over the "onion" Tor Browser Button will show the current Tor circuit that your Tor Browser is using, for the current site.Visiting http://ip-check.info/ and https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ can help to confirm your privacy settings.If everything seems to be OK with the above and you have not messed with unnecessary privacy settings or installed other addons and you are using the latest version of TTB then 'your good'.Tor is basically a 'random' three hop encrypted tunnel, so you get good anonymity even for http websites.Three 'random' hops are necessary in a Tor circuit for 'anonymity', as 'default' ;Hop 1 (a) Entry - knows only you and Hop 2 (b) Middle, but does not know Hop 3 or your destination.Hop 2 (b) Middle - knows only (a) and (c) Exit, but does not know you or your destination.Hop 3 (c) Exit - knows only (b) Middle and your destination, it does not know (a) Entry or You.That's how Tor works and it does work very well indeed, if you use it right!EDIT: You could also install a network packet sniffer like WireShark - https://www.wireshark.org and watch your own connection.   - https://emerproxy.xyz (beta) uses OpenNIC DNS servers and can (proxy) resolve most .emc .coin .lib .bazar and .nmc domains.   Your welcome!I hope that everyone finds the presented information both useful and informative.Tor Browser Bundle has been updated to v5.0.7 - of course the v5.0.6 example configs. will work OK with v5.0.7- https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-507-released- "Bug 17875: Discourage editing of torrc-defaults"To clarify, this is a separate file to the main torrc and does not apply here.Remember to tailor the example torrc to best suit how you use Tor.   Thomas Lohninger: Net Neutrality in Europe - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QKCEhoYBkUChristian Schaffner: Quantum Cryptography - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh8OGDNJZQkrop, frank: Ten years after We Lost The War - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4k7RKx4OQMKurt Opsahl: Crypto Wars Part II - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3a06NEq2McWill Scott, andz torproject.org: The state of Internet Censorship - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7Qczmq1vN4State of the Onion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXEUE__ap08Fatuma Musa Afrah: Keynote - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIivWGgZ5o   Following https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/cmu - "Did the FBI Pay a University to Attack Tor Users?"- https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151201/07281232952/tor-devs-say-theyve-learned-lessons-carnegie-mellon-attack-worries-remain-that-theyre-outgunned-outmanned.shtmlIt would appear that anyone using the xeronet Torrc might of afforded some resistance against said attack ...See: https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032002.htmlNoting that all servers used in the attack had a Nickname set as " Unnamed ", which has always been a recommended ExcludeNodes setting within the xeronet Torrc, thus users were unlikely (or at least less likely) to have their Tor client make Entry or Middle Node connections to any of these attack relays.

Yes. Incorrect formatting of .htaccess rules can easily (and incorrectly) block access to your entire website.The correct .htaccess rules for blocking proxies can be found in this 'legendary' blog (probably the source);- https://perishablepress.com/block-tough-proxies/Also, this message might actually be considered a bit more user friendly;"Sorry. Proxy access is not allowed. If you are not using a proxy please contact EMAIL with your IP address"   I recommend using the Bad-Behavior script, which actually covers a lot of the rules in the G5 and G6 firewall from the above blog anyway. Most of the rules in BB actually became the Mod Security base. The modified script for BB I posted was 'cobbled' together from reviewing several (now outdated) .htaccess lists and comparing user agents with activity at http://botsvsbrowsers.com/ and https://udger.com/- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1094930.msg13184663#msg13184663Good job OP for starting this thread!   Good that you stopped the bots by just using cloudflare then !I completely understand wanting to allow as many 'human' visitors to your website as possible, even from proxies and VPN customers etc.,However, the reality is that most of the visitors from proxies or VPN's are 'gaming' faucets and making multiple claims on mass.Although, the 'Not an access provider or ISP' list I posted is (optional), after all !   What I have posted is a multi-pronged solution, which is also fully compatible with cloudflare and the FaucetBOX.com script.Faucet admins. can use the hostnames lists within the FaucetBOX.com script and the Bad-Behavior script and cloudflare, together in combination .- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1094930.msg13122044#msg13122044As an example for just how effective this is for blocking VPN and proxy providers from a faucet we can look at zenmate.com (a known and popular VPN provider that also has a free browser plug-in). Some of their proxies have a reverse look-up as zenmate.com and they currently operate 4 free locations (with multiple IP ranges) in Hong Kong, Romania, USA and Germany - the Hong Kong location uses pacswitch.com , the Romania location uses voxility.net and the USA and Germany locations use leaseweb.com / leaseweb.net . Thus, by using this list in combination with FaucetBOX.com / NastyHosts.com (provided look-up service) we are already blocking access to the faucet from this VPN / proxy provider (without any IP blocking being necessary). Furthermore, blocking said 'Not an access provider or ISP' ranges also blocks thousands of other VPN and proxy users with accounts on these hosts.Cloudflare simply does not block any or all known proxy and VPN accounts having clean traffic and only good User-Agents. They only block traffic known to be 'bad' and/or that which appears to be questionable (i.e. 'bad' User-Agent or originating from a Hijacked IP range or recently participating in a DDoS attack or being part of a botnet etc.) and even then, they are mostly only presenting these bots with captchas, which for advanced bots, being capable of completing captchas are actually often passable !Using the Bad-Behavior Anti-SPAM (and the mod. script) will also help to block loads of other junk from a faucet website and when used in combination with cloudflare will provide very comprehensive web security, making 'gaming' your faucets that bit more difficult. The Bad-Behavior script actually improves cloudflare security - being a locally hosted, rule based firewall, compatible with the existing cloudflare solution.Adding a free httpbl_key into Bad-Behavior from projecthoneypot.org will screen and block known 'bad' IP's listed in their database, having been seen across multiple sites and honeypots. The reality being that many Hijacked IP ranges and existing Botnets are capable of making claims from faucets on mass. Moreover, many Tor exit nodes have a current listing with projecthoneypot.org and so this method will effectively block Tor. Again, loads of Tor exit nodes are also hosted in the 'Not an access provider or ISP' list.Using direct proxy detection / proxy blocking in your .htaccess is also an option as an extra layer of security.- https://perishablepress.com/how-to-block-proxy-servers-via-htaccess/ and https://perishablepress.com/block-tough-proxies/Trying to block by individual IP addresses is largely ineffective and way to time consuming. It's a free API key from https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ which can be used with the Bad-Behavior Anti-SPAM script to block known 'bad' IP's.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1094930.msg13122044#msg13122044 What really needs to be locked down is incoming traffic sources for services such as, 2captcha .com , anti-captcha .com and others - that do have an API compatible with known faucet bots. They in fact decentralized the captcha look-ups to workers, although some checking, detection and blocking should be possible. Updated - 'Not an access provider or ISP' list: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1094930.msg13125867#msg131258672nd list for Hosting / Virtual Servers / Dedicated / Cloud / VPS / Colocation etc.,- Confirmed domains with currently Unconfirmed Reverse look-up addresses.Now working on a Reverse look-up list for known VPS / Proxy / Cache providers.Using the Bad-Behavior Anti-SPAM script (+ httpbl_key) and this list within the FaucetBox.com Script (NastyHosts.com enabled) and not seeing very many bots getting through. Probably less still once cloudflare is re-enabled, after some more testing.  Herewith, a list I posted in the faucetbox thread for 'Not an access provider or ISP'- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1094930.msg13125867#msg13125867Also, a mod. for the Bad-Behavior Anti-SPAM script, which is quite effective if you get a free httpbl_key . - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1094930.msg13122044#msg13122044 Quite correct minifrij . This was just another example of how the script could be called really, depends on the individual server set-up.   I was fairly certain that the hostnames function was doing lookups via Nastyhosts.com . Individual IP-based blocking is mostly time wasting IMHO, although necessary in some instances of course. Thanks for clarification.Would a separate list of Reverse hostnames for known proxies and VPN providers be useful also ?Added a couple more hostnames to the 'Not an access provider or ISP' list above, here:- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1094930.msg13125867#msg13125867 Bad-Behavior script should be called from the main index.php before any other content from your website is loaded.Code:<?phprequire_once("/home/YOURHOST/public_html/bad-behavior/bad-behavior-generic.php");/*where YOURHOST is replaced with your host directory.or this code should work on most PHP servers ...Code:require_once($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/bad-behavior/bad-behavior-generic.php');Check that your website loads and functions properly.You can test that Bad-Behavior is working by using this Firefox add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/user-agent-overrider/and then adding ' Bad Behavior Test ' to one of the existing User Agents already listed. Seemingly in-script blocking does not function unless the FaucetBOX look-up service is enabled i.e. via NastyHosts.comDigitalOcean VPS hostnames invariably do not have Reverse DNS as .digitalocean.com - so unfortunately only IP address range blocking is feasible.Also not included amazonaws.com , as doing so would outright block a couple of ads / metric services like Alexa ! Anyway, have now started researching and tracking various automated captcha-cracking services and robots. Should have a good block script  within a few weeks or into the new year. Updated the list above for 'Not an access provider or ISP'.Have included hostname: is74.ru which is a 'known proxy cache provider for hackers', allegedly. Might be some genuine ISP traffic amongst this range (AS8369), although quite doubtful. - http://bgp.he.net/AS8369#_prefixesTraffic from this AS range appears to be 'gaming' faucets on mass, with referral / bot traffic !

A lot of the previous information in this thread is somewhat outdated.Herewith, updated (example) torrc for TTB Version 5.0.3 +Notes:- Revelations have shown that, apparently, if you are a Tor user from or located in a 'Five-Eyes' country i.e. United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia or New Zealand - then you are probably much less likely to be under surveillance (unless you are directly targeted). Therefore, it may actually be of some benefit to your individual privacy (also considering speed and security) to allow Tor Exit and Entry servers located in those countries into your torrc. As always, it is entirely up to the individual how to configure the config.- Three letter (and four letter) institutions apparently track all connections made to the Tor Authority Directory Servers. There are a total of 9 Authority Servers in the Tor network at present and so these have also been added to our config. in ExcludeNodes .- Adblock plus is no longer an 'advised' add-on for TTB. See: https://help.riseup.net/en/better-web-browsing- uBlock Origin https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/ - https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock - is a much much better alternative choice. (N.B. Privacy Badger from the EFF is a good add-on, although just using uBlock for TBB is probably for the best).- Smart Referrer add-on https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/smart-referer/ - is the only referrer add-on I tested that effectively 'fixed' - "hidden (changed when switching the website)" to Green status - with; option "Send Nothing as referrer, looking like a direct hit" - when testing at http://ip-check.info - in TBB.- Updated torrc configurations make use of the Autonomy Cube project -

You need to install this: Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784vcredist_x64.exe and vcredist_x86.exe for MSVCR120.dll correct installation. wow - EmerCoin project has some really great additions since I last checked in - good stuff.- I operate 3 Tor Exit Servers (Russian hosted) which are using DNS resolvers from OpenNIC Project.Thus, these .exits will resolve .emc domains over Tor. You can select using only said servers by editing your torrc (Tor Browser config.) adding the following;Code:ExitNodes startor0ru,startor1ru,startor2ruand maybe:Code:StrictNodes 1See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.htmlJust remember to remove the above when you finish visiting or testing .emc domain's over Tor - to revert back to normal default 'random' operation.Cheers! I found the v0.4.0 release to be unstable on windows - Running 0.3.2.1-alpha (stable) without to many issues though.The client does occasionally freeze up slightly with heavy RAM usage, compounded if PoW mining.For now, I'm running PoB only with PoS also disabled, which is much more stable. Running the 0.3.2.1-alpha release on windows requires at least 2 to 4 GB for free RAM for stability.I believe the issues which cause this (in the main) have already been documented in the original slimcoin thread. The Dcrypt algo (by design) has funky RAM usage. @AizenSou - It's really not that terrible!  I think one of the main benefits of PoB is that it provides incentive for users with active burnt slimcoin's to keep the wallet running, over PoS and PoW.~ wonders if slimcoin aka "John Smith" might in fact be SN as they always seem to be 'too busy' or wander off to work on other projects.- https://youtu.be/emDJTGTrEm0?t=7m24s - http://www.slimcoin.club/whitepaper.pdf   GJ d5000 ! Thanks! Those will do for now whilst we continue to develop the CBX Proof-of-Value concept and pricing widget.    - https://www.startjoin.com/audiocoinapp£15 GBP pledge ( $24 approx. ) ..."10,000 AudioCoins, Aurovine Headphones + App Stake Priority"I hope this one gets fully funded as I actually really do need some new headphones! Good one. Thank you.I'm continuing to work on documentation for the CBX Proof-of-Value Network, as well as a database and code for a basic pricing / valuation widget.Using 'live' / ticker pricing data for gold and silver is not really necessary at present as the daily London Fix will do.LBMA have made it difficult to pull any data directly from: http://www.lbma.org.uk/pricing-and-statisticsUsing http://www.kitco.com/gold.londonfix.html instead for now.Slow progress and no rush - Although, a widget / API similar to http://www.kitco.com/finance/bitcoin/ for CBX <> Gold , CBX <> Silver and also incorporating the CBX Proof-of-Value Network 'verified' backing is the main goal - https://bitcoinaverage.com looks useful, as well as https://www.cryptocoincharts.info/coins/show/cbx ofc.By the time the new CBX PoSP wallet is released then I should also be much further forward with the above and can start to work with raizor and the rest of the CBX dev. team on how we might best incorporate all of this. - http://audiocoinfx.wix.com/promo  in rotation at 20+ traffic exchanges.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNNma1BDIUA    Would be good to see this project get funded on StartJOIN.com - aurovine.com and audiocoin.eu are starting to make waves both in the music industry and on the crypto markets as well recently.   Have just read about Hullcoin:- http://cointelegraph.com/news/114965/hullcoin-government-backed-digital-currency-designed-to-tackle-local-povertyCould only think of this:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkEXqywc6RE  and  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl3DqaNbqSU       Indeed. It is perhaps only possible (or worthwhile) to issue yourself with a personal asset-backed security using block chain technology, as you are the holder of both the asset and the certificate.~ No one bought or sold anything in relation to the contract with oneself. There is no company to issue anything. All holdings are fully decentralized and remain in individual ownership.  - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset-backed_securityBitcoins are worthless because they aren't backed by anything- https://bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoins_are_worthless_because_they_aren.27t_backed_by_anythingBitcoin is Not Backed by Anything (And Thats OK!)- https://bitcoinmagazine.com/17392/bitcoin-is-not-backed-by-anything-and-thats-ok/Vladimir Putin Addresses Digital Currencies on Russian National TV- https://bitcoinmagazine.com/21237/vladimir-putin-addresses-digital-currencies-russian-national-tv/- Bitcoins are backed by nothing, and this is the major problem.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value  and  https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value  Perfect snatchmonkey - verified.It really does not matter if people choose to back with less or more bullion than others.As we progress with this we will reach some sort of price equilibrium from the data https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_equilibriumThe actual total backed CBX precious metal 'value' amalgamated could eventually hold a higher value over the exchange price of CBX to Bitcoin or Litecoin, for example.For now, anyone could back 1000 CBX with just a gram of copper or even 0.001 CBX with a 1 Kilo gold bar (if they can fit it on the A4 page)  If / when we start to reach a critical mass of backed CBX against the CBX remaining in circulation then this could get very interesting.  EDIT: The reference to price equilibrium is probably more accurately described as; "competitive quantity" or market clearing quantity - in relation to the economic principals of supply and demand."Properties of equilibrium...Equilibrium property P1: The behavior of agents is consistent.Equilibrium property P2: No agent has an incentive to change its behavior.Equilibrium Property P3: Equilibrium is the outcome of some dynamic process (stability)."Thus, the CBX Proof-of-Value Network is a dynamic process to find price stability against precious metals and relative to Bitcoin (markets). Good one elambert.You have placed an extra space before the (I) in the message field above (currently).However, the message will verify properly when the additional space is deleted, 'as is'.Looks like you may have done this in a similar way to FiniteByDesign (using the document template provided) and probably copied the text over from the document directly into the CBX software message field, for convenience. Hence the extra paragraph settings.It will be best to try and format the messages in plain text (with say notepad) without extra paragraphs, indents or spaces etc., anyway as long as the messages match the printed text and can be verified then we are good. No need to re-do at this stage, however when this starts to be done on mass and/or the data is being machine read and verified then this might well become more relevant. At least this helps to highlight some eventualities.It will be best to start verifying posted messages with return screen shots of the verified message from the CBX software. So, Proof-of-Value Network Verification.Anyway, once we have at least one more participant in the CBX Proof-of-Value Network Certification then I think we have the start of our fully decentralized network and thus can commence with Phase 2.    I have sent an expression of interest request for Co-Branding ShireSilver.com physical bullion cards to Shire Silver.- https://shiresilver.com/catalog/merchant/co_branding_feeThese cards would be fantastic for entry-level users to the CBX Proof-of-Value Network and its also great advertising.Thinking that this could be crowd-funded through startjoin.com - offering some cards as rewards etc., Thank you. I'm continuing to work on the detail for this concept and the relevant documentation for community review. It will take a while as some research is also being completed.Nothing whatsoever to stop others backing their own CBX with their own physical bullion and contributing to the inception of said decentralized proof-of-value network in the meantime though!- Wondering how a rare crypto-currency such as Crypto Bullion (Est. 2013), now being backed by decentralized gold and sliver, with good trading volumes at Cryptsy is not yet listed on other crypto exchanges such as Bittrex and even Bleutrade ? @FiniteByDesignYes. That's good now. Message verified 'as is'. Welcome to the CBX Proof-of-Value Network!I will make a note for the documentation to avoid paragraph spacing, as an advisory, although as long as the message can be verified its OK. @FiniteByDesignEDIT: Yes. OK now.No. Anyone should be able to easily verify the message by copying and pasting the three sections of text into the CryptoBullion software from your post 'as is'.Your signed  'Verify Message:' posted does not match with your printed 'Verify Message:'.I was therefore unable to verify your message 'as is', so please also check the text in the 'Message:' section to ensure that all formatting matches 100% - You have to printout the exact same message that you sign."Enter the signing address, message (ensure you copy line breaks, spaces, tabs etc. exactly) and signature below to verify the message..."- Fantastic choice of coin to back with though.I'm working to finish some basic documentation to make this process as easy as possible. Indeed. The potential is really great here. Its a concept for 'sound money'.Lots of possibilities to be discusses both with the CBX core team and with the community.The most important thing right now is for people to start certification of their own holdings. Initial data is required to make progress.We can't initialize a decentralized network, unless more people decide to participate.   Proof-of-Concept - Back-to-Basics - 2nd Backing- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11844494#msg11844494CBX Proof-of-Value Network Certification - Building a Decentralized Value Network using the CBX blockchain.Entitled: Shield and Spear Paradox - "What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?" - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Irresistible_force_paradoxCBX Wallet Address:Code:5jSNbAr8WwZfokPwoARez5gkt6rQVcxFvXhttp://blockexplorer.cryptobullion.io/a/5jSNbAr8WwMessage:Code:I BitcoinFX hereby back 0.000001 CBX with 1/10 Gram 24K Pure .9999 Gold Maple Leaf Wafer Aurum ZZ53550.Should I divest either my CBX and/or physical bullion holding then this statement is automatically considered null and void within the CBX Value Network.I hereby endeavour to provide a separate notification should I divest this personal holding.Verify Message:Code:ILCxgAOTn2f91qLbKVvQynElQ8UYs8iMzbuCZl7op2jZZLKZdz9ILGn/oHGpDxm5pCHpc4d7qaXZSXSWpklVmxQ=N.B. This now 'backed' wallet address currently holds 0.001001 CBX. As 0.001 CBX is the minimum transaction fee the backed 0.000001 CBX is most likely absorbed as an 'Over Limit Transaction Fee' if spending from this address, ofc without receipt of additional funds to the address. Hence it remains an 'immovable object'?  1/10 Gram 24K Pure .9999 Gold Maple Leaf Wafer Aurum is the lowest weight (certified) physical bullion that I could find to back the 'lowest' (common) denomination of CBX with.   
Good show FiniteByDesign,Hopefully folks will also start backing with physical Platinum, Palladium and Copper as well. Backing with rare coins and historical items would also generate further interest perhaps!I have started working on a guide .pdf for The Silver Forum. However, this same document should be submitted for community review and also approved first by the CBX dev. team.I'm thinking that this set of documents / data should probably be under something similar to a Creative Commons License:- https://creativecommons.org/choose- https://creativecommons.org/freeworks- https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/Think: "Money as Art"    Indeed. This requires community participation and > data from said participation.I'm really trying to get members of The Silver Forum to start using Crypto Bullion and to try backing some CBX with precious metals that they own. I have a post offering some CBX in their private members lounge. In the main they see this as a bit of a learning curve, although have not rejected the concept and remain open to the possibilities with this. Yes. An incentivized 'backing' model through interest is certainly a possibility.Is it necessary though ? Does it over complicate everything ? Good stuff.Some of these concepts I really like, others not so much. I need to re-watch these and make some notes. An interesting theory indeed BTCat.Although, it cannot really work like that in my honest opinion (unless I misunderstand you).When the CBX from a balance is spent you are effectively breaking the contract of the Signed statement with yourself. This happens automatically if the CBX balance is spent below the backed statement of proof-of-value. However, it does not prevent you from staking the existing balance and/or spending the interest or the balance that remains above the backed quantity.What you are describing here I think is something similar to a derivative ? https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance) - which is not a principal of 'sound money' or 'honest money' and should be viewed as the opposite of what we would seek to achieve here.How I personally envisage this working in practice is that when an individual might consider their backing to be of a lower value against the total network value, they will simply re-back their holdings and create a new statement. This potentially adds 'value' at the same time as some individuals would most likely re-back with more CBX and/or more physical Bullion. Remembering that their is only so much CBX in circulation to be backed (or uncirculated CBX to be re-backed)!It is also why we should completely avoid and in fact do not need to set a currency peg against the gold and/or silver price in dollars etc.,A Value Network determines the actual price through price discovery and free market valuations in this regard. No.It is not really possible to 'buy' backed CBX as the action of backing means that the CBX becomes uncirculated.~ The only way that buying backed CBX becomes possible would be if you purchased the wallets corresponding private key and the same physical bullion from the signed owner and both parties signed a new statement of ownership / transfer. N.B. that the buyer would then need to move the funds and re-sign for security, thus rendering the said transaction pointless.The basis of this is that all CBX on crypto exchanges would therefore become un-backed and can therefore be defined as circulated.Against the total CBX money supply (market capitalization) it will be possible to track exactly how much CBX is circulated vs uncirculated. Indeed elambert, I will drop you a response soon.Cheers! With the screen shot and signed message I in fact backed 1000 CBX with 5 x 2 Troy Oz Scottsdale Mint "Stacker Round"s - i.e. 10 Troy Oz Total (thus far) See: https://www.scottsdalesilver.com/store/product.php?productid=17562 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5EJrjUtRuw  (sounds like you had to much caffeine and no sleep)...It is vitally important that the majority of the proof-of-value backed holdings are individually owned, personal and therefore decentralized. Think of this as the very oposite to the centralized mining farms that we now see with Bitcoin. 3rd party vault storage is generally a bad idea as well, although I can envisage that some centralization will probably occur.If we look pre-bitcoin to understand why centralization is a massive potential hinderance, we can see that the majority of centralized DGC's (Digital Gold Currencies) - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_gold_currency have in fact failed. Not only due to having centralized servers, but also due to having centralized gold holdings.Again, a fully decentralized proof-of-value network is the best approach. OK. I will look to produce a workflow diagram of the cryptobullion Value Network for community discussion....On a less serious note;- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YKw8w-e50 - Philomena Cunk Money "Moments of Wonder."- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ - First Follower: Leadership Lessons from Dancing Guy    In search for the lowest retail denomination of physical gold 'bullion' ownership available from the internet I have discovered valaurum.Whilst their 1/10 gram 24 karat gold 'certificates' are a few 100% above spot price, they are individually numbered!See: http://valaurum.com/ (N.B. That is not a 'yellow' peice of paper, but a very thin layer of pressed gold and is a similar size to a bank note.)Thus, at the lowest entry point one could even back 0.000001 CBX with 1/10 gram of 'certificated' gold.    My public post at The Silver Forum "How to use crypto-currency to verify value and secure your PM trading.- https://thesilverforum.com/topic/3613-how-to-use-crypto-currency-to-verify-value-and-secure-your-pm-trading/...On a separate note this thread makes for a wonderful read for anyone perhaps overly immersed in the Bitcoin / Alt. coin / crypto scene with an interest in numismatics.- https://thesilverforum.com/topic/584-bitcoin-and-other-crypto-currencies/ Sounds good.The use of any third party or counter party, as with crypto-currency, is not required in the main and should also be avoided.This is a decentralized and independent Value Network, although third parties will no doubt offer storage services as you have described.The issue with verifying precious Precious Metal holdings (or that of double representation) can be solved somewhat by separating the data set between certificated and non-certificated Bullion i.e. individually numbered bars vs metal presented via type and weight value alone.A website where members use a 'trust' voting system to provide weighted assurance on others individual holdings will work best imho.  Herewith, a post I have just made in the Premium Members area of The Silver Forum to try and attract existing holders of Precious Metals."How to use crypto-currency to verify value and secure your PM (Precious Metals) trading."" ... As a fellow silver stacker, numismatics collector and long-term supporter and user of digital 'crypto-currencies', such as Bitcoin and Litecoin - I hope to present to you an easy and perhaps revolutionary concept in " How to use crypto-currency to verify value and secure your PM trading."Aside from the actual benefits of crypto-currency as 'money' or as a 'store-of-value', most people are perhaps unaware of the added security or proof-of-ownership potential when buying and selling goods and/or services online (or in person) that crypto-currencies can already facilitate.Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oxM9_OCQKM - How to sign and Verify messages with your Bitcoin Adress from your Software wallet- https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18qy88/bitcoin_message_signing_and_verification/Practical use cases:Lets imagine that you want to make a trade with someone on this forum (you don't even need to make the payment using crypto-currency or even hold a balance in said crypto-currency to sign and/or verify messages).You could request that the seller posts a 'signed' message of an address that they own and includes it with a screen shot of the actual item that they are selling, thus presenting cryptographically verifiable proof-of-ownership to you as the buyer.As the buyer proposing to purchase an item with crypto-currency you can also demonstrate to the seller that you have the currency/money to pay them and/or that you own the particular wallet address.As an online vendor (whether choosing to accept crypto-currencies for sales or otherwise) you could present screen shots of physical bullion to your potential buyers of items which are signed and verified as being your own wallet address.Lets say that you are selling a 5 Kilogram Silver Bullion Bar - you can post a screen shot of this item on your website with a signed statement that you own this bullion. This is 100% verifiable to anyone who verifies your message.To further build trust as an individual seller or as a vendor you can sign the statement to include both the item type and weight and even back it with an address containing the corresponding denomination in crypto-currency. So, in the case of the 5 Kilogram Silver Bullion Bar you could present a Bitcoin address that also contains £2000 to £2500 worth of Bitcoin (approx. example at the current silver price).This is also providing a potential buyer (or investor) with proof-of-value or proof-of-capital. If you are a small retailer of 1 Oz Silver coins then you might post a signed image and statement to verify said stock.In short, this is a better way to do online trading in precious metals. It is more secure for both the buyer and the seller.... "I have followed this post with screen shots of my own signed backing along with a link to this thread and to the cryptobullion.io website, explaining how anyone can easily download the software and use it to sign/verify messages. Indeed. With the creation of a legally binding contract between parties it would be possible to 'back' mutual holdings and/or to use individual or combined holdings to back other assests, stocks and even to back entire business ventures as proof-of-capital.You have described in practice a 'Smart Contract' in relation to blockchain technology.Also realize that the notion of backing has two stand points i.e. "I BitcoinFX hereby back 1000 CBX with 10 Troy Oz of .999 Fine Silver."and/or"I BitcoinFX hereby back 10 Troy Oz of .999 Fine Silver with 1000 CBX"Remember also that in the action of backing something, you are not necessarily buying or selling anything. You are simply combining a tangible and intangible asset and proving ownership. At first, this concept is perhaps somewhat mind-numbing. However, it truely is a concept of 'Sound Money'. You got it raizor! It's potentially a 'Bullion Dollar' idea in principal and in practice!   Realize also that all 'backed' CBX is not in direct circulation anymore, being relative to the 'unbacked' CBX in-circulation against the total supply, which in theory means that the circulated CBX potentially has increased 'worth'. Don't forget that you can easily start mining for Slimcoin in the wallet - as the dcrypt mining algo is designed for CPU.Help Tab > Debug Window > Console Taband simply type:Code:setgenerate trueorCode:setgenerate true <number-of-cpu-cores>To stop mining type:Code:setgenerate falseDepending on your processor and number of cores it may take a while to find a block though.check difficulty with:Code:getdifficultyLong gone are the days when you could mine for Bitcoin this way.     Here I am over at The Silver Forum - https://thesilverforum.com/topic/3605-hello-fellow-silverites/?p=54907 starting to introduce the concept of backing ones physical bullion with cryptobullion.Realizing that with this post I have essentially backed my own forum accounts!  - https://thesilverforum.com/gallery/image/344-cryptobullionio-cbx-1-oz-999-fine-silver-bar/ Seemingly Audiocoin was developed to work in tandem with the Aurovine music platform.- http://www.aurovine.com- http://www.aurovine.com/how-it-works-fans- Watch: AudioCoin Keynote Short Version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANv72Iy4uoQThe developers appear to be slightly more active on some other crypto forum websites.I noticed that they have a 'live' crowdfunding pitch on StartJOIN: https://www.startjoin.com/audiocoinapp for a Mobile App.When PoW ends and provided that the Aurovine platform is successful in keeping an increasing user base I for one am hopeful that Audiocoins should potentially be worth more that they are today. I like what they are trying to do with this one anyway! Herewith, the basic CBX Proof-of-Value Network Certification document that I used to back some of my own CBX holdings with physical sliver.- https://mega.nz/#!2pUlADxA!-VUrzNkNL8tUvgHKwMYyOuqwi8-TS0qhD5RGais8NOU - CBX-Proof-of-Value-Network-Certification.odt- https://mega.nz/#!j1FSyQIL!BmdMcDaIOwjsoaBFcSYaW92j5OHXbpEQ8MtcFpTLgdo - CBX-Proof-of-Value-Network-Certification.docSee: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=951753.msg11844494#msg11844494If others start doing this then we have some interesting data to work from, at the very least. CBX will also have a thread topic that looks rather shiny to potential investors! The concept can also be presented in a new thread and eventually be developed into a dedicated forum and/or website perhaps. I have joined a couple of silver and gold investment forums with the intention of presenting this concept to them. You mean to build a similar platform for CBX ?They are pulling chart data from a several exchanges and markets using Trading View - https://www.tradingview.com/ (which is free).It would be good to create a platform like this for CBX including Gold and Sliver pricing etc., however CBX really needs to be present on some bigger markets first.If others begin to participate in the CBX Proof-of-Value Network then we can have some solid 'alternative' data to build platforms and widgets.I guess people could even start backing their CBX holdings using iShares Sliver Trust or SLVs, for example, although it is always better to hold the physical bullion yourself. It might also be interesting to start presenting personal holdings from platforms such as vaultoro - https://audit.vaultoro.com/ (see: 'Clients with holdings' where a unique ID could be tracked, if fully verified) and if anyone is prepared to post an account screen shot along side their CBX wallet, for example.Building a fully decentralized and distributed Value Network, as I have suggested, could prove to be a very powerful concept indeed. Crypto exchanges could back their customers funds with Proof-of-Value. Online gold and sliver retail businesses can potentially back their bullion stocks with CBX holdings. Assets and derivatives (digital or otherwise) could even be launched via a proof-of-value network in the future.The social media potential for a proof-of-value network is also huge. People are much more likely to use and hold a crypto currency over another if they see others backing it with physical bullion. In Gresham's law it is commonly stated as: "Bad money drives out good" or if we consider this another way, as "Good money drives out the bad"!

I'll send you a PM.Glad that you like this concept.The best way to look at this in terms of adding value I think is to recognize that any participating entity must hold both CBX and precious metal. Both of these things probably being a very good idea in principal and in practice.Being a cryptographically signed message and therefore verifiable on the blockchain, manual or automated verification that the CBX holding still remains is ofc possible via a block explorer. So, if the amount of CBX for the public address is ever spent below the represented amount then the individual 'backing' can be considered to be divested and is delisted from the spread sheet and/or blockchain / application database.One of the only potential issues with this is double or multiple representation of an individual bullion holding against multiple CBX addresses. However, holdings could be represented in to two or more categories i.e. certificated (numbered) proof-of-bullion vs non-certificated (proof-of-weight) etc.,Whilst most economists would probably argue that this issue presents us with a quandry not disimilar to that of Gresham's law - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law - remember that this is being proposed only on a fully decentralized basis.As described in social sciences the proposed action of backing our own CBX is with individual 'agency' - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_agency - "Agency is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices."Furthermore, within a free market it is equally important not to set the ratio of CBX to x precious metal, but to leave this action up to the individual to determine for themselves.CBX is an intangible asset - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_assetBullion (precious metal) is a tangible asset - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangible_propertyWe are presenting a way to combine Representitive Money - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money and Commodity Money - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money together.Thus, creating a fully decentralized Store of Value Network on top of the existing Crypto Bullion blockchain.The data derived from this action would essentially allow anyone to do Value Network Analysis and Value Conversion of Tangible and Intangible Assets - http://www.vernaallee.com/images/VAA-VNAandValueConversionJIT.pdf - 'on the blockchain'....The referenced passage from The Frogs is as follows (usually dated at 405 BC)."   The course our city runs is the same towards men and money.    She has true and worthy sons.    She has fine new gold and ancient silver,    Coins untouched with alloys, gold or silver,    Each well minted, tested each and ringing clear.    Yet we never use them!    Others pass from hand to hand,    Sorry brass just struck last week and branded with a wretched brand.    So with men we know for upright, blameless lives and noble names.    These we spurn for men of brass... "    So, lets imagine that I back 10 CBX with 1 Oz of fine silver and you back 1 CBX with 5 Oz of fine silver.11 CBX is now backed by 6 Oz of fine silver having a value of x in whatever currency.Now factor in many other individuals doing the very same thing and backing CBX using varying quantities of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, nickle and copper - coins and bars etc., all being publically verifiable.x number of CBX is now backed by x worth of fully decentralized physical bullion.The provision of goods and services (as well as exchange platforms) helped to build and establish the bitcoin economy.Being rarer than bitcoin and presenting itself as a 'store-of-value, CBX as asset based commodity money should seek to establish seperate and additonal price discovery through other means.  No 3rd party exchange is taking place and their is no counterparty risk.I'm simply suggesting that people could back their personal physical bullion holdings with thier own CBX and present this action publically, on the blockchain.It's a bit like issuing a gold certificate to yourself: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificateThis process turns an unallocated (fungible) asset into an allocated (non-fungible) asset, which is also publically verifiable.Most crypto bullion enthusiasts are likely to own some physical gold or sliver that they could easily use to personally and publically 'back' their own CBX holdings, both in part or in full. I would like to put forward the following proposal for fellow holders of Crypto Bullion (CBX) to act upon.Let us each start to back our own CBX holdings with real physical bullion, as 'Proof-of-CBX'.Anyone holding CBX and some quantity of physical bullion or precious metals is able to participate.An individual could back any denomination of CBX with any quantity of physical bullion that they own. The most important principal being that the individual owns both assets.You would simply upload a photo of the physical bullion together with your CBX wallet address (including a signed verifiable message) and your forum username, as one image.For example;"I (insert your forum name) hereby back (x amount of CBX) with (x amount of physical bullion).I understand that if I should divest either my CBX and/or physical bullion holding then this statement is considered null and void.Furthermore, I endeavor to provide seperate notification if this personal holding is divested."Of course, the quantity or type of physical bullion and/or amount of CBX being backed is actually not important.In other words it does not matter if an individual chooses to back 10 Oz of copper with 1000 CBX whilst another individual might back 1 gram of gold with 0.0001 CBXThe action of backing CBX with any physical quantity of bullion (on an individual basis) should help with increased price discovery and awareness.Comparing such data with live metals prices would provide an amalgamted bullion value for CBX, in addition to its crypto currency value.In practice 1 Oz fine silver or gold coins are within easy reach of most investors and are probably a good starting point in terms of value against the current price of CBX. Some good news.Version 2 is one of the winning voting coins at Cryptopia exchange this week: https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Home/VotingSo, Version [V] is to be listed on their exchange platform.  Indeed.http://www.multifaucet.tk/index.php?blockexplorer=V&currency_infosnapshot:Total blocks: 561120Synchronized blocks: 484681 (86.37742372 %)    N.B.

Version [V] is one of the original SHA-256 / PoS 'Digital Asset' and 'Store of Value' crypto currencies.The old thread can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=478176.0Members of the original dev. team seemingly helped to start other crypto currency projects, such as Mintcoin, however the Version project was abandoned due to some issues with with staking functionallity and several network forks.The new revived Version 2 is working well thus far, without any such issues.  Unobtanium Total Supply: 250,000Version 1 [V] Total Supply: 2,500,000Thus, 10 times less rare than... A double negative multiple negation as understated affirmation ?    " 10 times less rare than Unobtanium and a bit like Crypto Bullion on acid " - SWIM - Version [V] is back!   - Great work noise23.   I think I saw this happen in an earlier release of Mintcoin once.You should be able to dump the private key of the 'unknown address' i.e. the change address (that noise23 linked to via the block explorer) into a new wallet. Make sure you have multiple back-ups before doing this and maybe double check with noise23 via forum PM.  noise23 has done a remarkable job thus far in reviving Version [V] and providing updates for the new functional client wallet.Undoubtedly, towards 'the end' of Version 1, the network was a real mess and there were lots of massively accelerated PoS forks.I too have somewhat considerably less coins than I thought I did in regards to the above, although compared with the original coin specifications it is obvious that the original PoS function was indeed totally borked.I think that we can rest assured with the new Version 2 fix and move forward.The new 60% PoS rate will ofc provide 5% interest per. month for those of us fortunate enough to have retained our mined Version notes.- i.e. Better than none! Contacted a couple of crypto exchanges in regards to them listing Version [V]Voting is now possibe at cryptopia: https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Home/VotingHave also sent a message to the online wallet service coinwallet.co who provide PoS pools: https://www.coinwallet.co/pos/pool/info and twitter tip bots: https://www.coinwallet.co/pos/pool/info for other crypto coins.Hopefully Version [V] will now re-establish itself as one of the original and truly alternative SHA-256 / PoS / Store of Value crypto coins.  
Yep.

The addresses and transaction ID's do not show up in the new block explorer.My main wallet is largely intact and functional although 'missing' the majority of its 'final' balance, probably due to being on a fork anyway, so that is to be expected ofc. My mined balance is present and correct actually, much before the PoS function went fully AWOL.  Interestingly enough the 2 x 2,500 transactions sent from my main wallet are also not present as outgoing transactions either. I will get around to uploading some screen shots. No worries though, cannot be helped.My main wallet had almost 3,000 transactions, so moving the balance to fresh addresses. Having to do that as multiple transactions as I keep getting the standard warnings for over limit transactions. Trying to stake was causing the wallet to freeze up a bit and having few network nodes currently probably wasn't helping much either.Anyway, good stuff and I should start mining in the pool when the sign-up confirmation comes through.     This is a really great concept imho! aurovine.com can surely help new, aspiring and even established artists by putting them directly in front of consumers whilst also enabling them to monetize their own content.The relatively high PoS interest rate with Audiocoin should lend itself well to the platform, artists, producers and consumers alike, potentially reducing overall costs and the unnecessary leverage by the industry 'fat cats'.Good for crypto-currency and good for Bitcoin, methinks! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lK4cX5xGiQ         wow - really great job noise23 with resurrecting Version [V] - the blockchain and parts of the code was a real mess.Not totally sure on exactly how many Version coins I have at present due to the slight rollback.Recovering my wallets, re-syncing and will re-evaluate the bounties I set.New PoS rate is quite high - although I guess it makes it worthwhile mining some to stake interest.  The Kingdon of North Sudan - https://kingdomsudan.org/Bir Tawil - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_North_SudanMapping micronations - The Stream - http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201408141504-0024059  "The Kingdom of North Sudan recognizes the Liberland"- 19th April 2015 - Liberland - Proclamation: https://kingdomsudan.org/page/our-news/uploads/media/Liberland - Proclamation.pdf- The Kingdom of North Sudan: https://kingdomsudan.org/  Indeed.

However, 100% PoS will most likely quickly diminish pre-sale value even at $0.01 per NeuCoin. It will take for some very spectacular adoption to see market demand increase above this rate of PoS minting.What I'm personally most uneasy with is the NeuCoin economic model in regards to the fact that a centralized entity is basically in control of the purse strings from the outset and moving forward. Whilst I can fully recognize that Bitcoin mining using pure PoW has also become very centralized in terms of distribution, this is arguably a network effect  with coin supply not being restricted, controlled or determined by any entity, unlike with NeuCoin.The alt. coin most similar to NeuCoin is probably Mintcoin which started at 20% PoS return and eventually reduces to 5% in 4 years. Mintcoin's price is in fact very stable in comparison to most alt. coin's when we consider that its price has effectively been a measured mainly against Bitcoin's price volatility. Mintcoin has been a comparatively stable crypto currency because it has such a large coin base. So, with NeuCoin being focused towards micro payments, this could work well for price stability.What percentage of 'The Foundations' NeuCoins are being given away (i.e. freemium) and/or are to be sold ?The main issue here I think is really that:  we 'the 99%' only have access to around 5% of all NeuCoin  whereas  you 'the 1%' have access to around 95% of all NeuCoin. It seems to me that a lot of the projects on StartJOIN currently go unfunded sadly, so hopefully the StartJOIN - Bitcoin capital project could start to change that.StartJOIN is also becoming a bit London-centric at present perhaps with all the Trews news agents projects and StartCOIN scratch card giveaway projects seemingly getting funded very quickly!Anyhow, you have to Start somewhere and hopefully they can begin to spread the StartCOIN / StartJOIN net a bit further afield. Obviously its really important to build up local use and a local following, with London being a good base to start with.Its ironic though that StartJOIN has been giving away 1000 and 100 StartJOIN scratch cards, yet most projects are still going unfunded. I guess the thinking is that this will filter through overtime ? That's really great!Hoping that just by having our StartOR Tor Servers running that we can continue to attract a wealth of technology projects to be funded on StartJOIN.If we can exceed the target funding for the new StartOR.org USA servers then we are planning to set-up some new fast Tor Exit Servers in Sweden, Latvia, Romania and Luxembourg. Follow: https://twitter.com/startor_project for new updates. Thanks! Appreciated and thank you!Take a look at this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.0 - we are working on a guide that will make use of the fastest and safest Tor servers to help journalists, activists and all Tor users worldwide.Thus far StartJOIN and StartCOIN have provided a great platform for funding for this project.Anyway, don't want to hijack this thread much more - off to vote for StartCOIN at Cryptsy      StartOR.org - website is now online where this threads torrc config. will be available and updated in the future.Our StartCOIN Funded Tor Relay Servers Project 2.0 - is also currently live crowdfunding on StartJOIN using Bitcoin and StartCOINSee: https://www.startjoin.com/StartOR_ProjectStartOR Project website: http://startor.org   Fellow StartCOIN fans,StartOR.org - StartCOIN Funded Tor Relay Servers Project 2.0 - is live crowdfunding on StartJOINSee: https://www.startjoin.com/StartOR_ProjectThanks for your support.

Bytecent PoM per 60 mins requirement has increased from 70 to 105 BYC within the last 24 hours.Is the PoM target requirement linked directly to difficulty and/or to other factors such as block count etc. ?Can't find that information easily with Bytecent being closed source currently.  So, do the developers think that asking Scrypt miners to contribute hashing power for less than < 2%  of the total pre-sale (and PoW) coin base is actually a viable option for return ?Is what effectively equates to a more than > 94% pre-mine really workable moving forward and in the long-term ?Will the developers themselves buy or mine NeuCoin on this basis ?  I have read the white paper for NeuCoin and whilst it is technically and historically comprehensive I found it to be somewhat lite on the economics.3 Billion NeuCoin Pre-Mine1,000,000,000 NeuCoin = Growth Foundation = i.e. Them1,000,000,000 NeuCoin = Utility Foundation = i.e. Them and us ? Giveaway survey coins are allocated from here ? and/or ... " Using an innovative proof-of-stake (PoS) design and economic model, NeuCoin is the first digital currency that will be strategically distributed to all participants who help increase its utility, growth and value:    Some given for free to get consumers started with zero friction - and more awarded for recruiting new users    Some given to companies that make NeuCoin more useful, such as content providers that accept micropayments in NeuCoin, exchanges, and processors    Some sold to investors, with proceeds used to fund user acquisition and utility development "   400,000,000 NeuCoin = Code Foundation i.e. Them ?  200,000,000 NeuCoin = Founders "0.2 billion retained by founders for $1 million of work invested" - N.B. based on the pre-sale valuation of $0.01 = 1 NeuCoin  the Founder's got a 50% discount i.e. $0.005  200,000,000 NeuCoin = Angels "0.2 billion sold to strategic angel investors for $1 million cash invested"  - N.B. Again, based on the pre-sale valuation these Angels got a 50% discount i.e. $0.005  100,000,000 NeuCoin = Seeders "0.1 billion sold to initial seed investors for $250,000" - N.B. Seeders got a 75% discount on public pre-sale value i.e. $0.0025 per NeuCoin" In contrast to virtually all previous digital currencies with pre-mines, all NeuCoins held by the founding team, seed and angel investors are subject to strict re-sale provisions for five years (each of these holders may only sell 2% of their holdings per month in the first year, 3% per month in the second year, 4% per month in the third year, 5% per month in year 4, 6% in year 5). "Are these strict re-sale provisions including or excluding all or any PoS interest ? How can this be verified ? At the initial 100% PoS rate this is potentially irrelevant, even without including the discounted value !   100,000,000 NeuCoin = Public Pre-sale @ $0.01 = 1 NeuCoin (i.e. 1 million USD)Thus, valuing the pre-mine at 30,000,000 USDPoW "5 million coins per month during year 1 will be awarded through PoW scrypt mining."   60,000,000 NeuCoin = Total PoW NeuCoin supply over 12 MonthsNeuCoin Public Pre-Sale is less than < 3.33% of the total coin baseNeuCoin Total PoW equates to less than < 2% of the total coin baseSo, " NeuCoins design answers the nothing at stake argument"  , although we might conclude that our "something to stake" is a very slim piece of the NeuCoin pie indeed and that this is fixed from the outset.However, NeuCoin could actually make for a very stable currency in terms of maintaining value in comparison to say Bitcoin.Even with the initial 100% PoS percentage if the NeuCoin team is successful in attracting new NeuCoin'ers to the currency and building upon said utility, as they have put forward, then NeuCoin could hold its value overtime quite well and may potentially increase in value long-term as the PoS interest percentage return declines.I don't see NeuCoin being a high or fast return investment though, as from what I have modeled I think anyone buying into the pre-sale would be very lucky to even double their investment within the first year on the basis of the above.

More torrc config revisions for TBB 4.0.4The Tor Project has recently changed the way that EntryGuards works to a consensus set parameter. This is probably the best way to handle this setting and we therefore no longer need to set any NumEntryGuards NUM, although a higher number like 8 may still be applicable if we decide that we can explicitly trust our listed EntryNodes.See the Tor manual:UseEntryGuards 0|1    If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term entry servers, and try to stick with them. This is desirable because constantly changing servers increases the odds that an adversary who owns some servers will observe a fraction of your paths. (Default: 1)NumEntryGuards NUM    If UseEntryGuards is set to 1, we will try to pick a total of NUM routers as long-term entries for our circuits. If NUM is 0, we try to learn the number from the NumEntryGuards consensus parameter, and default to 3 if the consensus parameter isnt set.

Hello DannyB135 - you seem to have enabled pluggable transport options.Setting EntryNodes whilst using pluggable transports at the same time isn't really viable.Using ExitNodes options with pluggable transport is OK though.Using pluggable transport options is likely to make you connection intermittent especially whilst downloading.Install a fresh Tor Browser Bundle an start with the default options if your able to do that. Glad I started mining xaucoin - should be interesting to see how this one performs on the markets.Quite similar to Unobtanium [UNO] actually, which has been performing well recently and holding its value. A better comparison would probably be DRK vs BBR (Boolberry)Darkcoin provides a reasonable solution for making anonymous transactions. Boolberry has the best CryptoNote implementation to date, ihmo. In terms of 'true' anonymity no coin offers this at present.It is one thing to be able to make anonymous and obfuscated transactions, however the main issues still to be solved are that of acquisition / ownership and traffic analysis.- The originator of an 'anonymous' transaction is perhaps much less likely to be identified by tracing a transaction. For example, researching individuals who are mining (or mined) coins in clear net mining pools or who brought and exchanged coins using a 3rd party service makes for a much easier starting point. In fact, simply running an 'anonymous' coins client wallet would most likely flag an individual in a sub-set in terms of the meta data alone.A truly 'anonymous' coin would need to offer PoW pool mining through Tor (or a similar trusted anonymity network), with a strong focus on decentralization, from the get-go.Stealthcoin is a good example of a coin that protects its users from traffic analysis using Tor. However, PoW mining is still a much better way to secure a network in terms of user based anonymity and privacy.Bitcoin actually offered good anonymity when it was first released and users could mine solo in the wallet, without pools.Creating 'truly anonymous' digital cash is not an easy task.Privacy, Security, Anonymity and Trust.

Well, I look to support Coin Magi in a general capacity anyway.Being a CPU only coin with a max. 5% PoS interest rate, Coin Magi can continue to be a useful and effective crypto currency imho.The fundamentals are right with this coin and that's the most important aspect.

So, I'm thinking I'll probably order one to tinker with. Indeed. The index and follow meta tags and sometimes revisit-after help for the main part. Site looks fantastic! Have update links on my mining guide to link to the Magi Official homepage.None of these wordpress templates ever seem to include proper Meta Tags these days.

They are down at the moment. I had to cancel the vps hosting account(s) that they were running on. Due to the DRK price being low and with a lack of revenue from the web proxy sites to support the service I could not keep them running at present.I have the keys backed up for the .onion addresses and will look to reinstate the nodes in the future perhaps.  The International Virtual Crypto Summit 2015 is being held on-line on February 26-27th.Will Sterlingcoin be represented in any 'official' capacity and/or be in e-attendance ?

GeoIP is skewed and showing US.  I had a discussion with Vultr support today to try and ascertain what would be an acceptable level of CPU usage to avoid having a cloud instance with them restricted, flagged or cancelled.They stated that a customer can use the full power of the purchased CPUs provided that the processes running do not negatively affect other users of our services. Common things to avoid are processes with excessive I/O or CPU interrupts.- https://www.vultr.com/legal/use_policy.php"In the event your instances uses excessive CPU from activities such as cryptocurrency CPU mining, Vultr.com reserves the right to limit the CPU available to your instances in order to maintain a consistent level of performance on all our nodes."Anyway, I have set my nodes to use only -e 20 i.e. 20% which interestingly enough is the rate limit restriction per. cpu that Vultr introduce to customers accounts who have used excessive cpu resources. So, I'm guessing this is acceptable usage !The khash/s rate is somewhere around 3 to 6 khash/s on average, around the same as an Rpi 2.   Thanks joelao95. You can find the MyMagi contributions address at http://tor.mymagi.nazuka.netThe MyMagi Tor Relay Server is running on a $7 instance at Vultr (N.B. that they do not allow Tor Exit nodes, only Relay's) - anyway 50% of the CPU is mining Magi to off-set the bandwidth costs, with the other 50% CPU usage dedicated to running Tor and Arm (which rarely goes over 20% CPU usage actually).The node also has a Bitcoin address listed in the ContactInfo and therefore receives small amounts of Bitcoin via https://oniontip.com/I thought it would be interesting to create a Tor server that essentially funds itself by mining Magi, through donations / contributions and advertising (a-ads revenue from the free proxies) / referral commissions (from the mining guide) and the PoS interest. It is ofc possible to build a script that would send monthly Bitcoin payments to Vultr for the server to pay its own running costs i.e. essentially an example of a smart contract in action. Anyway, surplus funds will be put into reserve and/or be used to set-up new Relays, a process that could also be fully automated. Looks like they have the wrong block height and are probably out of sync or still syncing with the network.They might be running Slimcoin-Qt 0.4.0-alpha with the old daemon and therefore having trouble syncing. Could you let them know they need to downgrade their Slimcoin wallet ! Thank you very much 111magic.The services are fairly basic, although should help to bring some new users to CPU mining Magi. I have a bunch of other 'free web proxy' domains that have been running on this web host for well over 6 months now. Had to fine tune the settings and limits to keep them working as best as possible (service is fairly temperamental at peek / busy times) and no idea how long the free hosting will remain!Anyway, I keep these sites in weekly rotation in many proxy lists across the web and will also be adding the 468x60 banner to various traffic exchanges for the CPU mining guide.MyMagi Tor Relay will always be kept running.

Have submitted it anyway. Qualys SSL Labs Report for buyslg.com is OKhttps://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=buyslg.com&hideResults=on    As I said in my previous post "You should always inspect an SSL certificate to determine why its not valid though, as something bad could also be happening."Simply adding an exception is not the best solution, specially if something is potentially tampering with the secure connection.Again, a currently valid 2048-bit COMODO cert. should not be presenting any exception error in a generic / updated version of Firefox.Here's the location of the Firefox Certificates Store for you to check its in tack. Tools > Option > Advanced > Certificates > View Certificates.If you are not using any proxy settings, 3rd party public network, VPN and/or alternative DNS settings you might want to consider re-installing Firefox.HTTPS Everywhere is also a very good Firefox addon to install: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere  That website is using a currently valid 2048-bit COMODO cert. so you should not be seeing any warnings.A 'valid' list of around 99% of certificate authorities is include by 'default' in most browser bundles. CA's mainly get included by paying huge sums of money to browser companies to get their companies root certificates included. An untrusted connection warning can appear for numerous reasons, such as the certificate being out of date or the CA's root cert not being included in the browser bundle by 'default'.For example, on some of my web proxy sites I use 4096-bit CAcert.org certificates for maximum security, as both the private and public keys are max. 4096-bit. However, CAcert.org root certs. are not included by 'default' in the majority of browsers and therefore present a connection warning unless the correct root certs. are installed by a user. Its a bit like using an adobe flash plug-in. The irony being that a valid 4096-bit SSL Cert. is way more secure than a 1024-bit or 2048-bit cert. that most of the commercial CA's charge webmasters for. Loads of root CA's still use and issue only 1024-bit or 2048-bit root certs. Which is enough to secure users, but probably still allows some three letter agencies to easily read your encrypted data as it travels across the internet.The most 'secure' SSL cert. would arguably be a self-issued and self-signed 4096-bit cert. https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate because you don't have to trust any 3rd parties in respect of the certificate.You should always inspect an SSL certificate to determine why its not valid though, as something bad could also be happening.Encryption works, although the entire SSL protocol is mostly old and needs a fresh approach like this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Wl2FW2TcAN.B. To anyone reading - this is a general discussion post and does not effect the security of Sterlingcoin.  From the OP:"New Block Generation through Proof-of-BurnEven a Raspberry Pi can competitively mine, fast hardware offers no advantage"- http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-2-on-sale/- Slimcoin - #Futurist !          Glad that you got synced with the latest client.Certainly some updates to the slimcoin.club website - so unless their is a 2nd admin.

Perhaps getting Slimcoin listed on coinmarketcap.com and another exchange will help to facilitate just that....It's still remarkable that Slimcoin doesn't have a more active following. Slimcoin is now one of the only 'CPU only' coins potentially worth mining - after Magi. What is the coin's official website?slimcoin.club - Yes. http://slimcoin.club has the latest wallet download, updated nodes and a recent snapshot of the Slimcoin blockchain.Which exchanges is it traded on? List all that apply.https://bter.com/trade/slm_btcPlease provide a URL that shows the total number of coins in real time.http://www.slimcoin.club/#blkexpPlease provide a URL of the coin's official logo:Suggest:https://github.com/gjhiggins/SLIMCoin/blob/slimcoin/src/qt/res/icons/slimcoin.pngPlease provide any other information that would be useful.The 1st known working implementation of PoB (Proof-of-Burn) block generation. Combining 3 block generation algorithm's being PoW, PoS and PoB.Unique Dcrypt CPU mining algorithm designed to be both ASIC and Pool resistant.Original Website: https://slimcoin.org/Block Explorer: https://bchain.info/SLM/White Paper: http://www.slimcoin.club/whitepaper.pdfBitcointalk.org announcement thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=613213.0...Welcome to Slimcoin ! On balance it is more likely than not that PoS (made to be anonymous or otherwise) could ever provide the same level of anonymity that proof of work can.The ability to anonymize and/or obfuscate transactions is always secondary to the means of acquisition. I have mined at https://cgb.theblocksfactory.com/ and found it to be a reliable pool. Presumably they will upgrade to CBX.Also recommended to the Sterlingcoin dev team to look at offering CBX payouts for their upcoming multi-pool Cystum, which is currently in development.  Touché !   Keep up the good work Spencer and team.EDIT: Oh, CryptogenicBullion (CGB) just got a new wallet release and a re-brand to CBX ( CryptoBullion ) it is still Scrypt mine-able, although could be another good choice of PoS coin for the multi-pool ?  Re: Crypto-Trade being listed in the OP ?- https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/another-bitcoin-exchange-shuts-little-warning/Actually quite surprising that CBX (CGB) isn't listed on other major exchanges like bittrex or perhaps bleutrade. ~ "A pessimist is never disappointed"     Good job with the new wallet and re-branding.  If the Cystum multi-pool is the 'Official Sterlingcoin Multi-Pool' then that's justification enough for me anyway."You can only please some of the people some of the time and all of the people never!"     http://boolberry.blue - boolberry themed web proxy featuring 4096-bit SSL security by CAcert.org - still going strong!Have just renewed the SSL Cert. and removed most ads because the revenue was dire.     Yes. Good move to get more folks mining in the multi-pool. Payout options for established PoS only coins is the way forward and will also be advantageous for the pool.Adding payouts in Mintcoin could certainly get the pool hash rate up.Perhaps even the new-ish PoS gamer coin GoldPieces might also make for an attention gathering addition ? - It's PoW phase was less than one million coins and PoS blocks reset after staking, which actually makes the 500% PoS rate rather interesting.  ...Anyway, very much looking forward to mining some more SLG at Cystum multi-pool.   Sterlingcoin price has been holding steady with some good buy support for the last week or so. It's a very good sign considering that the multi-pool isn't even live yet.I'm still mining directly onto bleutrade (whilst the SLG multi-pool is in testing / development). Anyone that is selling or can be bothered to do some arb. trading ?   ...Also needed to put a connectivity node up for another coin (Slimcoin), so I've set it up as a public Sterlingcoin node as well.UK, London based node running on vultr: addnode=108.61.197.252SLG team can add it to the op .conf if they want to.Cheers! Node is running v.0.3.2.1-alpha on win server. I also used the snapshot from slimcoin.club and got fully synced in under 3 hours, without adding / changing any .conf settings.Try syncing with a fresh wallet.dat and then replacing it with your main wallet once synced, if your not already doing that. Anyway this new node seems to be very stable and the provider seems to have a good and fast network upstream. Number of connections is > 20 currently.I will try to compiled and run a new windows version when we know its stable.Cheers! 
Syncing a new node:addnode=108.61.197.252  Better late than never.TBH I've been multi-pooling Sterlingcoin the last month myself using auto-trade and direct mining pool deposits to bleutrade.com - https://bleutrade.com/exchange/SLG/BTCMost of the SLG/BTC buy orders in the 4 to 10 SLG range are my auto-trades + a few others.    Magi is an interesting choice for CPU mining.Gapcoin has a GPU miner now, although you can still find a reasonable amount of gapcoin CPU mining in the pool. You might also see a decent return on your mining when Gapcoin finds a new world record prime gap.Slimcoin has a very experimental GPU miner available, however the Slimcoin dcrypt algo was designed to be CPU only. You might be able to find a couple of blocks solo mining in the wallet. Slimcoin is a very interesting and underrated alt. coin imho.I'm CPU mining Gapcoin at present - https://gapcoin.club That was too fast !    In terms of a currency symbol such as  £ , $ or BTC - I don't believe so currently !EDIT: Perhaps https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ - S with caron or a $ with caron, as a 'crown' ?                          TBH I'm mostly just waffling regarding the economic principals concerning Bitcoin and crypto currency in general.Though to date the thing which Bitcoin and crypto currency will probably always appear to lack is intrinsic value i.e. fundamental value.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(numismatics)- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_theory_of_valueThe main thing I'm suggesting for Sterlingcoin is to provide a direct exchange rate for Sterlincoin <> Sliver (USD , EUR, GBP). Any exchange on this basis is thus truly P2P - that is to say Peer-to-Peer and Person-to-Person i.e. for Silver goods received. Building Real intrinsic 'value' as worth.If you want to look at the 'value' of any alt. coin then currently more often that not you first look at its price against Bitcoin i.e. SLG/BTC right ? - Let's start to change that ! The Singularity Is Near    Indeed. Its impractical and was what I meant by 'without having an existing mechanism in place', although you just highlighted my typo.The original purpose for my post was to describe how to easily create an exchange rate between Sterlingcoin and Spot Silver, although I did get a bit carried away.   Thanks! The eBay auction is bound by eBay's T's and C's on the bidding process, so card 1 of 10 will go to the highest bidder on eBay.I would be happy to auction off one of the other single cards in the set for BTC, although I'm not sure if its OK to do an alt. coin auction on bitcointalk at present or if their would be enough interest ? Perhaps just the prime number cards in the set, being 2, 3, 5, 7  In terms of security and safety for the cards, yes that is being work on. I'm building this up as a small business, as I still think that examples of physical crypto currency is very important.I have a temporary holding website for the project which is in development at http://cryptocards.link - the initial concept was originally funded with crypto currencies on StartJOIN and we have already produced batches of StartCOIN and Sterlingcoin crypto currency cards. I'm currently funding a similar project for Bitcoin on StartJOIN: https://www.startjoin.com/bitcoin_cc - where you can also find photos of the actual cards in the Update Tab. Here is an example of 100 Limited Edition cryto cards that I produced for Sterlingcoin for the recent Bitcoin Expo London 2015 - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=721936.msg10235501#msg10235501Although it doesn't apply to our current cards - I'm also looking at using only bio-degradable plastics for future versions of the cards.We are also looking to produce bespoke custom cards for each crypto currency using only the customers existing wallet address and QR code.With regards to Gapcoin this just seemed like a good way to try and get some additional interest for the project, so that we might eventually get a new world record prime gap.  With the upcoming Sterlingcoin hangout I thought I would look at a few options and provide some general info. for discussion by the community.A currency peg is usually set against another countries currency, in traditional financial markets, although this can also be against other commodities or assets etc.- http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-peg.asp or http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegging.asp... " 2. A practice of an investor buying large amounts of an underlying commodity or security close to the expiry date of a derivative held by the investor. This is done to encourage a favorable move in market price."This is actually how Nubits - https://www.nubits.com/ (the first crypto currency to thus far mostly successfully fix its exchange rate to the US dollar i.e. One Nubit = One US dollar) has been using NuShares to maintain the exchange rate on crypto currency markets via its Nubot software - https://bitbucket.org/JordanLeePeershares/nubottrading .EDIT: However, in a free crypto currency market (with Sterlingcoin already being listed on multiple exchanges and without having an existing mechanism in place) SLG is automatically indirectly 'pegged' to the value of Bitcoin and other crypto currency pairs, moreover supply and demand is the bigger factor in determining current price and/or value.- https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange-rate_system and https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demandTrying to fix or 'peg' and exchange rate can seem like a very good idea when the asset price is 'low' (or comparatively low) in the market, although for Sterlingcoin this would not be an ideal situation were 'value' to eventually exceed its pegged price.Sterlingcoin, in reality (crypto currency) is an intangible commodity (asset based) money (currency) - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_asset and https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money1. Intangible - in that you can't physically hold Sterlingcoin in the palm of your hands - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_asset2. Commodity - in terms of a 'marketable' item in exchange for goods and services - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity3. Asset - in terms of an economic resource in financial accounting i.e. digital cash - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset4. Money / Currency - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Money and https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CurrencyBeing a PoS coin (with perhaps some existing benefits over PoW) Sterlingcoin has a 5th incentive being 'risk-free' interest https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest at the fixed rate of 5.5%What gives Sterlingcoin, Bitcoin or any crypto currency its true 'value' is less defined today. We can see this clearly by how much the Bitcoin price has fluctuated since its inception. Given its intangible nature the only certain 'commodity' based value aspect is in fact the means and cost of production i.e. purchase and/or depreciation on mining equipment, the cost of electricity used in production and time.Other main aspects for consideration being the total supply, fungibility - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility and of course Rarity vs Scarcity - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity_valueThese main factors are exactly how the first Bitcoin exchange rate was established by NewLibertyStandard on this very forum.- http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/Exchange+Rate... " The exchange rate is the average of the adjusted bitcoin production per day divided by the average production costs per day. The per day averages start with the previous day and will eventually extend back 365 days, but until then, they increase by half a day each day by taking the average of two averages. Production costs consist of the price of broadband Internet and metered electricity. The adjusted bitcoin production is the following spreadsheet calculation =if(M2>N2,((B2+F2)/2)*(1/(3-((N2/M2)*2))),((B2+F2)/2)*(3-((M2/N2)*2))) where M2 is the available balance of dollars times the exchange rate of that same day, N2 is the available balance of bitcoins, B2 is the amount of bitcoins produced the previous day and F2 is the average of the adjusted bitcoin production per day. "- http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+Rate... " During 2009 my exchange rate was calculated by dividing $1.00 by the average amount of electricity required to run a computer with high CPU for a year, 1331.5 kWh, multiplied by the the average residential cost of electricity in the United States for the previous year, $0.1136, divided by 12 months divided by the number of bitcoins generated by my computer over the past 30 days. "Other factors determining the Bitcoin price on the free market are now of course Supply and Demand, as well as the Goods and Services that Bitcoin can be exchanged for (including the exchange to alt. coins).- Bitcoins, Alt. coins, Pizzas and Haircuts. - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=323188.msg3460909#msg3460909... " What is Bitcoins value backed by?Bitcoin is valued for the things it can be exchanged to, just like all the traditional paper currencies are.When the first user publicly announces that he will make a pizza for anyone who gives him enough Bitcoins, then he can use Bitcoins as payment to some extent  as much as people want pizza and trust his announcement. A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting Bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the Bitcoin would be higher  now it would be backed by pizzas and haircuts. When Bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his Bitcoin-savings. "... and this is why Lazlo offered to buy a Pizza for Bitcoins ! To create supply and demand !These aspects make up the intrinsic value of Bitcoin (or Sterlingcoin), an intrinsic value which is often hard to fully grasp considering crypto currency is fully decentralized peer-to-peer money.So, for Sterlingcoin (and its current position) I think that the question is how best to try and build intrinsic (actual) value. Merchants, goods and services help a lot, although as others have described this is a double edge sword and a slow burn in terms of price. The strengths of Sterlingcoin are clearly demonstrated in its potential association with Sterling Silver or a Silver Standard in terms of actual value - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_standardI've already highlighted the pitfalls of a pegged value, however I can envisage a useful potential for a linked exchanged rate to the Silver Fix.- The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) sets the daily fix for Silver against the GBP, USD and EUR - http://www.lbma.org.uk/pricing-and-statistics  once per. day.... " The LBMA Silver price auction is operated by CME and administered by Thomson Reuters. The price is set daily at 12:00 noon London time. The price is expressed in $ per troy ounce. Reference prices are also available in £ and & euro. "Plotting the London Silver fix against an average daily Sterlingcoin price would provide an interesting measure of linked / perceived value, moving forward. To be able to easily say that Sterlingcoin is Up or Down against physical Silver today would give a new dimension to trading.I also feel that it could be a good way to attract individuals and businesses with an interest in numismatics to Sterlingcoin. Folks trading physical Sliver (and gold) coins and/or small quantities of numismatic collectables / bullion on the Sterlingcoin forum (on a personal basis) would be a fantastic way forward.For example, it could be possible to start the ball rolling by offering heavily discounted physical Silver from the Sterlingcoin Store and/or forum when being brought with Sterlingcoin. For example, bullionbypost.co.uk/silver-bars/ offers considerable discounts on orders of over 100 Sliver bars, with the price of a single bar being x 2 that of a bulk order price of a min. 2.5 g Sliver Bar. This saving (less P&P costs) could easily be passed on to anyone wanting to buy with Sterlingcoin. Many other options are ofc available.However, doing something like this is not dissimilar to say Lazlo and his Bitcoin for Pizza, as today Lazlo's Bitcoin's are clearly worth much more than the $ price of the pizza.Another option might be to back Sterlingcoin (or a percentage of the total circulation) with physical Silver through the creation of a Foundation or other means. Not fractional reserve banking, but Full Reserve banking https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking and to then offer dividends or some incentives on this basis. However, this is probably something for consideration much later on.Anyway, some food for thought.    Herewith, the first physical Gapcoin crypto currency card.Gapcoin Crypto Currency Card Wallet - Limited Edition - Issue No. 1 of 1010 day eBay auction:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/111589388874Item Specification:A unique and stylish UPVC (credit-card sized) Gapcoin crypto currency wallet pre-loaded with 101 Gapcoin (GAP) featuring:- tamper-proof hologram and bar code sticker to safeguard the private key.- unique wallet address with scannable QR code for easy loading and receiving Gapcoin payments.- distinctive Gapcoin logo.- rigid 0.76mm UPVC card plus a transparent card protection cover.- a way to easily gift Gapcoin to others or to secure your own GAP into "cold storage".- limited edition - 1 of only 10 individually numbered Gapcoin crypto currency card wallets.Preloaded with 101 Gapcoin (GAP).https://bchain.info/GAP/addr/GTTPcGB8SdoFLBo7o8GrQ7tLi91n3bxDjiTX ID: 5454efac7a64eb35066a2c514e08a49cbe90d68c3f0b6acdfeaa3fb42a0c9e84N.B. each of the 10 limited edition cards will be auctioned when the current auction has sold.     4 Sterlingcoin Premier Edition Crypto Currency Cards now listed on eBay.- http://forum.sterlingcoin.org.uk/index.php/topic,134.msg330.html#msg330   You Sir become a Slimcoin legend !    Re: "Official Sterlingcoin Cryptocurrency Cards" Thanks!   - Indeed. Sterlingcoin (seen as a brand) already has a very strong international identity moving forward.For example, Sterling silver is a well known standard throughout the world https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_silver and the UK currency as Pound Sterling (GBP) https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling is officially widely used outside of the United Kingdom in the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar (alongside Gibraltar pound), Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, British Indian Ocean Territory, Guernsey (local issue: Guernsey pound), Isle of Man (local issue: Manx pound), Jersey (local issue: Jersey pound) and even the British Antarctic Territory.Sterling (as a currency) is also very familiar with 'unofficial' users within some African nations, being mainly Uganda, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Rwanda, Malawi and Botswana.Also see: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_area  - "The sterling area, or sterling bloc was a group of countries that either pegged their currencies to the pound sterling, or actually used the pound as their own currency..." which includes a list of over 70+ independent countries, the Commonwealth of Nations, oversees territories and protectorates etc.Thus, the notion of a Sterlingcoin albeit physical, digital, crypto or otherwise is already truly international and identifiable well beyond a UK market place.Cryptocurrency is ofc open to all and remains usable by anyone and everyone on a world wide basis, having an origin or source is no bad thing though.

We should try to re-instate / re-activate PoS imho. Slimcoin should try to remain a Tri-Block Gen. coin.Slimcoin as the developer clearly put a lot of thought into the economic viability of Slimcoin, PoS is an important part of that model imho.This coin has so much innovation its hard to understand why it isn't much more popular. I would like to start contributing and testing builds when I have time perhaps. Magi is currently a good choice for CPU mining imho....Slimcoin is perhaps very underrated in terms of its importance in innovation in crypto currency. Slimcoin has the first known working implementation of PoB (Proof-of-Burn) block generation. It also utilizes the unique Dcrypt PoW algorithm which was designed for CPU mining and to be ASIC resistant.The latest version of Slimcoin is available here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=613213.msg9227084#msg9227084The Slimcoin whitepaper also makes for a very interesting read: https://slimcoin.org/images/downloads/slimcoin_whitepaper.pdfAlthough an experimental GPU miner does now exist for Slimcoin, very few people are currently mining, so it is therefore possible to find some blocks with CPU. You can mine in the wallet using: setgenerate true numberofcores via help Tab > Debug window > Console Tab. Slimcoin is also listed on Bter exchange....Gapcoin is a very interesting CPU mineable coin, although a GPU miner does now exist. http://gapcoin.org/ and https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822498.0Gapcoin is the largest know, decentralized search for Prime Gaps.   Herewith, design proofs prior to the print run of the Sterlingcoin - London Bitcoin Expo 2015 Crypto Currency Cards.Still waiting on delivery of some stock, although we are looking to produce 50 to 100 cards min. for Spencer to distribute.

Ditches Tor for a More Anonymous Network" is perhaps very misleading and somewhat uninformed.Tor network hidden_services probably provide the best know anonymity and privacy for users. Although, as stated within their name these services are only hidden and are therefore not truly anonymous, as from a networking perspective the potential to locate them exists.- How to locate a Tor Hidden Service ? - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=902763- Tor: Hidden Services and Deanonymisation [31c3] - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZdeRmlj8GwBy all accounts the "Silkroad 2.0" was not located through any know practical and/or theoretical networking 'attack vectors';- State of the Onion - 31c3 Tor Talk - http://youtu.be/wKArmXr8o04?t=47m30sMoreover, Further improvements are also being made with regards to how the Tor networks handles hidden_service requests for clients - to improve on anonymity. I have strong doubts as to if I2p would actually currently provide better user anonymity against an 'all seeing' adversary....However, you can never have enough anon networks or projects for users to utilize or contribute towards. These are interesting crossover projects:- Abscond Project - https://hideme.today/dev/- Privacy Solutions - https://privacysolutions.no/...It's really great to see Darkcoin getting more recognition as being towards 'Anonymous Digital Cash' (perhaps best described as just 'Digital Cash'    ofc).- For those of you that don't know (or perhaps forgot) I'm still operating 2x Tor hidden_services for Darkcoin wallet connectivity through Tor:See: http://darkproxy.eu/darkvpn.php - N.B. torrc config. is just an example and is due for an update - although the .onion addresses for client connectivity are live and kept updated to Onyx V3 (10.17.26)+The web proxy service (only on clear net for now) has been running for many months and has hopefully brought some new interest to Darkcoin. Its only a one-hop proxy ofc, with the emphasis being on strong 4096-bit encryption. I'll perhaps look to improve and diversify the service offering in the future; if I can find some project funding, as well as trying to get the wallet nodes integrated with dual I2p connectivity etc.So, SWIM assumes transactions over Tor using Darksend and/or over I2p (or a mixture of both then) ?   P.S. Did anyone ever set-up 'anonymous' Darkcoin mining over Tor or I2p yet ? See: http://eligius.st/~gateway/faq-page#t9n14 > General Questions > Can I mine over Tor?   PoS function has not been removed from the code. It has only been temporarily deactivated by enforcing reservebalance=  large balance to prevent staking coins in the wallet.It is therefore still possible to stake (if you edit before compiling) the code or to fully reactivate staking in the future.Staking (or having 3 methods of block generation active at once) seemed to be causing some issues as the block chain increased in size. This was simply part of a fix to get the chain moving again following multiple 'forks'. Staking does still appear to stall the client on occasions though.

Good job.Just wondering if you have seen this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=916634 - PHP Bitcoin Node Status Page. Could be interesting to fork the code for public Sterlingcoin nodes etc. I'd probably look to set one running. Thanks.The above is just a sample of the old wallets transactions (longtime 0 balance ofc). I had another 2 (sometimes 3 PC's) CPU mining to individual Bitcoin wallet's quite sometime before the first transactions to this wallet.I also briefly ran the first and what is/was considered a hobbyist exchange service for BTC <> LR. Although, realize that I'm referring to around less than $100 in total for about 5 or 6 individual transactions, before I decided to close the service because it simply wasn't worth my time running it !Here are the first BTC exchange rates (calculated against electricity usage in producing BTC) - http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+Rate  (not my website).I remember that NewLibertyStandard had some charge back issues with customers using PayPal. So, we separately sought to use individual 3rd party exchange services that didn't do charge backs such as Liberty Reserve (now defunct) and Pecunix.Almost all of my original BTC was sold (by myself) on another early automated exchange (as personal funds) which I transferred mostly into various Forex trading brokers through LR. I chose to do this as I had decided I would probably make more money trading financial markets before any significant price rise in BTC. At that time I could still CPU mine more BTC although that quickly changed and I was priced out of the mining game well before BTC reached over $1 - Ironically, it didn't seem worthwhile investing in new GPU mining equipment for myself at that time, plus regretfully a few personal reasons meant I didn't really have the time for it.Fast forward a few years and when my Forex trading had started to become less profitable ( although I had very good success trading gold against USD and some other pairs ) I decided that I would move funds back into BTC when it was at around the $100 to $250 mark, as I was fairly certain that we would start to see a big run up with BTC hitting the main stream news.LR was increasingly reported to be shady and mostly criminal in its wider exchange activities. However, it was also used by many honest citizens for legitimate deposits to Forex Trading accounts and for general internet payments. I personally never used LR for any 'illegal' or malicious activities whatsoever and mostly for personal funds and to pay hosting bills etc. Personally I never had an issue with it until it got shutdown.Unfortunately (yet again), I started making transfers at exactly the time that LR got taken offline (as well as some other exchanges running of with my hard earned capital) and so I 'lost' over 3 years worth of trading profits and missed the BTC price increase from $250 to $1200 - which again would of given me a nice income and some surplus BTC to perhaps start some good projects. Unbelievable, right !?...Anyway, the above even more strongly reaffirms my belief in decentralized money and ownership of money by the individual and not by government, banks or any form of centralized issuing institutions. Satoshi was always way ahead with all of this.The very early adopters, such as myself, had to find ways to determine and create value in Bitcoin as well as to increase the user base. We believed in the technology (still do ofc) and wanted to promote it. TBH I perhaps became somewhat disillusioned before it really started to take off as against my calculations it just seemed to be taking to long. I'm just unlucky perhaps.Finding this wallet through is giving me a very interesting incite into early transactions and as to who mined what on the blockchain. Indeed. Puts a 10,000 BTC pizza into perspective though, right ?  - Nobody expects the revolution - do let me know when it re-starts.   Just recovered an old zero balance wallet belonging to myself... if anyone is interested ?Re: I am the poorest early adopter in the world...EDIT: You win some, you lose some and that's just the way it goes ... !?!?~ Inspired by this thread and some recent events I randomly decided to try and fire up an old dell inspiron laptop I used in early 2010 which suffered a battery, screen and HD failure in the space of a month or so.After eventually managing to boot it up and having 30 so attempts to remember an old windows xp password (without success) I then resorted to using an ubuntu live cd to try and access my old data...Success.

Looks like the script got stuck, so I'll make good any outstanding requests first.Cheers! Indeed. Riecoin (and ofc Primecoin) have already achieved some new records relating to Prime Numbers.Gapcoin is specifically searching for Prime Gaps - see: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap - which is quite different to both Riecoin and Primecoin."But how are prime gaps useful?Prime numbers are interesting for lots of mathematicians around the globe, and they're also important to every day cryptography (see  RSA ).Researches about prime gaps could not only lead to new breakthroughs in the bounded gap, it may also help proving the Twin Prime Conjecture and maybe even the millennium problem, the Riemann hypothesis. Who knows?"  As the thread title requests - If you have some free CPU power then try mining Gapcoin !Gapcoin is a prime number based p2p cryptocurrency and the largest, decentralized prime gap search.The original developer has sadly passed away, however the project is ongoing at: https://gapcoin.club With increased hashing power (and continued development) the Gapcoin network will discover new Prime Gaps.See: https://gapcoin.club/primegaps.phpLets try to get cryptocurrency back in the news for all the right reasons again. Do it for the math and not just for the money.  Gapcoin thread here at bitcointalk.org - see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822498Thank you.EDIT: 5th June 2020 updated links and info. If you add Sterlingcoin (SLG) and Mintcoin (MINT) I'd vote:- Darkcoin (DRK)- Sterlingcoin (SLG)- Mintcoin (MINT)Pure PoS alt. coins at around 5% interest FTW imho. PoW is half-way to becoming centralized.However, PoW is still the best way to do 'Anonymous Digital Cash', so I'll make an exception for DRK.    ... because the money is in the math.I've sent 1250 GAP to top-up: http://www.multifaucet.tk/index.php?faucet=GAP  as > 1000 = 0.1 GAP drop size every 12 hours.2015-01-05 13:39:16    250 GAP2015-01-05 13:35:32    500 GAP2015-01-05 13:27:14    500 GAPThese donations have been covered through affiliate commissions received via sign-ups of my Gapcoin cloud mining guide: http://gapcoin.grn.cc/~ In the current crypto currency economic climate it is perhaps going to be difficult to push Gapcoin as a currency over and above the plethora of alt. coins.Thus, we continue to mine this for the math with the probability that the money will follow.   Hooray! Good stuff and reassuring to also see block 131401, 131402 and 131403 ... onwards ofc.    Slimcoin is still alive and well.Congrats on the open source GPU miner, will take a look at it.My US nodes are still online 107.181.250.216 and 107.181.250.217 (not sure about the other hardcoded nodes in the slimcoin.club Peer List at present). NOMP pool is down though. So, solo mining only for now it seems.I continue to run the wallet and have been burning more coins. Good to know that my efforts have brought some new interest to Sterlingcoin in general and before PoW ended.I'm in the process of getting a website set-up to continue retailing these cryptocurrency cards. Will also be offering similar cards for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Mintcoin, Darkcoin, Startcoin and ofc Sterlingcoin.I'll get a couple of ebay auctions online for some of the remaining Premier Edition Sterlingcoin Crypto Cards within the next week or so, just seems to be a logical way of gaining some more interest and new users of SLG.  Interesting thread indeed. I'd say all of the above + those still aflame & the countless unnamed.   ~ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=358790.msg8484376#msg8484376Anyone that can help find this - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=358790.msg3839053#msg3839053  ?Anway, lots of really fantasic stuff here for the history books. I also found back tracking from sources such as the Free Haven papers and projects were really interesting in terms of MIT etc. Just wondering which coins those currently mining Sterlingcoin will be switching to once PoW has completed ?Think I'll be going back to mining DRK and START depending on which is currently more profitable.Will be putting some 1st gen and 2nd gen SHA-256 tech. onto the Sterlingcoin multipool ofc.   Realistically, somewhere above top 20 in the current market is very feasible for Sterlingcoin.Pure Proof-of-Work evangelists might tell you otherwise, but PoW mining profits are now a pipe dream for most. In recent weeks we have seen Bitcoin (and some alt. coin) cloud based mining services disappear before users can ROI. The constant race to design, manufacturer and to own expensive PoW mining equipment is leaving investors and speculators with further reduced opportunity to ROI or just break even. Proof-of-Work is undoubtedly becoming more and more centralized.Pure Proof-of-Stake can provide a more certain prospect for ROI when the fundamentals are correct. Very few PoS coins have got what might be considered the perfect mix in terms of total money supply and the ongoing interest percentage to make the model both realistic and economically viable as a currency.PoS has many other advantages over PoW imho. Why purchase expensive mining equipment or fake cloud mining contracts when you could just buy Sterlingcoin and perhaps stand a better change to at least ROI both long-term and short-term.Crypto currency is about ownership of your money through decentralization providing a further reduced need to trust any 3rd parties with your transactions or savings. Sterlingcoin perhaps facilitates this over and above Bitcoin or other PoW schemes due to the added incentive to the keep your Peer-to-Peer wallet online to stake interest on your coins, not to mention that its also much much more environmentally friendly in the long-term as well.The original hybrid PoS currency Peercoin provides 1% interest on your held balance, which in reality is not enough interest to even cover most users transaction fees. Although PoS was designed to solve other problems, most users are interested with regards to having an interest bearing crypto currency account.Mintcoin is perhaps the strongest example of a pure PoS crypto currency to date imho. Whilst the original 20% interest is certainly to high it reduces over a four year period (by 5% per. year) where it eventually settles to 5% max. in all subsequent years.Around 5% PoS interest could be considered the perfect ratio as it both covers transaction fees and allows interest on your held balance at (or just above) 4% which is ofc a percentage familiar to most fiat savers as an acceptable and realistic return on small to medium deposits.Sterlingcoin being more towards an asset based crypto currency offers a strong identity moving forward, as well as very sound economic fundamentals and principals to match.I will go as far as stating that Sterlingcoin is perhaps the asset based crypto currency that CryptogenicBullon could of been and that Litecoin should really be. What I'm trying to say is that Sterlingcoin should really be placed at least sliver to Bitcoins gold when you consider all of the above.- Happy New Year Everyone - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTL4ejs73DY    Sure. I notice that the db issue is sometime still present at start-up or fresh install. This issue used to exist with Mintcoin and Blackcoin and was fixed, though I don't remember how exactly atm.I've also seen the installer process hang after a successful install on windows 7. It can eat up memory if its not closed manually or without a system restart. Might be caused by some other system software I'm running though.I notice that some menu text becomes hidden when the Sterlingcoin window is off-clicked, but no worries really. Everything else seems to be good following the code tidy-up. Just some constructive criticism for improvement in future releases. Great work on the Sterlingcoin v1.4 wallet btw. Visual improvements abound.I personally much prefer the Lite version, although I can appreciated that most users will probably like the widgets. Indeed. I have noted your position and continue to reserve best judgement whilst trading.However, they have recently added an auto-sell feature on all pairs, so its possible to do 'set and forget' (hopefully not forever!) trading on auto-pilot. This feature has seemingly resulted in increased trading volumes across the exchange and so it seems to be getting more profitable to be holding some BleuShares.Auto trading most of the alt. coins for a 'high liquidity' pair, such as Dogecoin to BlueShares, will push the auto-trades through fairly promptly. More worthwhile alt coins can be auto-traded to Sterlingcoin as they continue to accumulate and withdrawn asap ofc.  Anyway, I won't hold more than I can afford to lose (which is easily said when the price is 'current'). I have accounts at Cryptsy and Bittrex as well, so this is just an additional trading exercise to trade up some more Sterlingcoin on the free market. Started test trading on bleutrade recently. They perhaps list a few to many 'unusual' alt. coins, although the trade engine seems fairly good.Brought some BleuShares in fact and will soon be auto-trading most of the alts. for Sterlingcoin.  Could actually be an exchange to watch, if it remains reliable.~ "Cramer on CNBC said hit the BUY BUY BUY button !" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktKNEGSqLB4

As a Tor user and Tor Rely operator for a number of years now I have decided to make this post. I think both anonymity and privacy on the internet is increasingly important in today's world. I personally do not conduct any 'illegal' activities when using the Tor network. I make this open post to help ensure the future security of all Tor users. Tor Hidden Services are just that i.e. 'hidden' and thus they are not totally invisible or anonymous.- http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29987373- https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymousBrowsing via Tor does provide improved privacy, security and anonymity for most internet users and further protects against traffic analysis, in the main.This is not a software bug report. This is out-of-the-box reverse engineering, of sorts..."How did they locate the hidden services?So we are left asking "How did they locate the hidden services?". We don't know.     In liberal democracies, we should expect that when the time comes to prosecute some of the seventeen people who have been arrested, the police would have to explain to the judge how the suspects came to be suspects, and that as a side benefit of the operation of justice, Tor could learn if there are security flaws in hidden services or other critical internet-facing services. We know through recent leaks that the US DEA and others have constructed a system of organized and sanctioned perjury which they refer to as "parallel construction."Unfortunately, the authorities did not specify how they managed to locate the hidden services. Here are some plausible scenarios:... Operational Security ... SQL injections ... Bitcoin deanonymization ... Attacks on the Tor network ... " ~ It is already known that a Tor Hidden Service provides better anonymity for users over Hidden Service operators. Tor developers have made this very clear in the existing website documentation.1. Always Read the Manual - https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html" StrictNodes 0|1    If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is necessary to perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfill a .exit request, upload directory information, or download directory information. (Default: 0)"ExcludeNodes node,node,    A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes and address patterns of nodes to avoid when building a circuit. (Example: ExcludeNodes SlowServer, ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234, {cc}, 255.254.0.0/8)    By default, this option is treated as a preference that Tor is allowed to override in order to keep working. For example, if you try to connect to a hidden service, but you have excluded all of the hidden services introduction points, Tor will connect to one of them anyway. If you do not want this behavior, set the StrictNodes option (documented below).    Note also that if you are a relay, this (and the other node selection options below) only affects your own circuits that Tor builds for you. Clients can still build circuits through you to any node. Controllers can tell Tor to build circuits through any node.    Country codes are case-insensitive. The code "{??}" refers to nodes whose country cant be identified. No country code, including {??}, works if no GeoIPFile can be loaded. See also the GeoIPExcludeUnknown option below."2. Thinking outside the box.With basic text edits to the Torrc .config file and using a process of elimination we can commence with a search for the most likely Geo location of a Tor Hidden Service.Listing routers by country code via http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ or another mirror presents data for the majority of Relays and Exits.So, lets imagine that a .onion address might be physically hosted in say the US. First we try to connect to a hidden service to check its currently 'live'. If so, we exit Tor and edit the config with StrictNodes 1 and ExcludeNodes {us} then re-start Tor and try to browse to the hidden service once more and if it is now inaccessible then we might assume, with up to 99% accuracy (against MaxMind GeoIP) that the 'Hidden Service' is potentially hosted (or at the very least that its current Guard Server is routed) within the US.If not, then we keep trying blocks of GeoIP country codes in descending order until a likely country match is found. Of course the actual percentage accuracy is less when including satellite, A1, unknown IP addresses and potential spoofing or Geo-rotational IP's that advanced Hidden Services might utilize.Obviously this method cannot be considered 100% accurate, although when combined with other Tor network stats. and/or chronological data it is a potential method to commence with unmasking the location of a Hidden Service or attempting to monitor its users:- What is the first know publication of the .onion address ?- Was a new Relay created around that time and does this match the likely GeoIP location ?- Does all or part of the Hidden Service code / software only run on linux or windows etc. ?- What Relays probably don't host this hidden service ? Etc., etc.,...~ I could post a lot more with regards to this possible 'attack vector' for Tor Hidden Services. Its not really necessary to do so. In less than 30 bootstrap attempts to the Tor network using a regular home PC and some networking tools you can quite easily determine the most likely Geo location of a Tor Hidden service with a fairly high degree of accuracy. Combining this information with other already known and more sophisticated 'attack vectors' perhaps gives you something towards a "parallel construction" ... Well, in terms of networking anyway.Always RTM. EDIT: The obvious question is if StrictNodes are really strictly necessary as a hard coded Tor function ?   Sure.How is the multi-pool dev. going ? I have a few spare USB Block Eruptors and Antminers about if you need some SHA testing ?   TBH the print / design software is specific to the printer and uses the extension .card  - I've not have much time to play about with the format to see what might be possible, however I can certainly provide you with the dimensions in the next few days and then just import graphics from another format. I'll check what can be done with it first though.A personalized / custom card linked to ones own Sterlingcoin wallet address could be quite popular I'm thinking ! Indeed. It's closer to 30+ Premier Edition cards remaining actually. Some contributors (i.e. donations without pledging for a card) on the StartJOIN project did not provide any contact address information, so whilst I've messaged those few to check if they would like a card for donating to the project, still mostly no response as of yet. So, just over 25 cards left to be sold or auctioned anyway.    Have not been very active here recently - seem to of spent most of the last few weeks feeding plastic cards through a printer !Anyway, I'd be keen to help with marketing and/or promotion in some capacity.I think a lot of progress could be made by linking everything together. I'd be happy to get a starter point-of-sales pack of Sterlingcoin Standard Edition crypto cards out to all existing merchants, when we start production. Being able to pick-up the equivalent of a Sterlingcoin 'Top-up' voucher from an existing Sterlingcoin accepting merchant could be a good start. The intangible nature of crypto currency is perhaps its biggest flaw for easy mass adoption.The cryptocards.link website (when I get around to creating the site) will provide a way to easily buy these Sterlingcoin Standard Edition - gift cards / cold storage cards.Furthermore, the crowd funding project has highlighted that a service to produce cards for customers existing wallet addresses (without the private key) would be useful, both for personal use and also from a small retailers perspective. I'm therefore looking to offer this as a website service and also a 2-card pack i.e. one card with the private key and the other one with just the wallet address and QR code, thus allowing for easily receiving payments via another user with a smart phone / app. etc. A retailer can easily keep this type of card in the till for the occasional customer looking to pay with Sterlingcoin, its also convenient to hold one in your wallet to accept payments with perhaps.Sterlingcoin can easily build up a strong brand identity, even more so than lots of other crypto currencies, their is a lot of potential for growth here.A written letter containing a sample Sterlingcoin crypto currency card, being sent to potential point-of-sale retailers could also be an excellent way forward. I'm thinking niche market gift shops, small independent jewellery and silver shops would be good for starters. I'll probably try a sample mail out in the new year - including some retailers in British Territories such as Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man which could make for an interesting test sample to gauge response as they are very familiar with Pound 'Sterling'. I also have a mailing list of international silver / coin collectors which would probably be worth sending a card to with an introductory letter.Any feed back or thoughts on this ? Thanks all. Good to know that the cards have been received well.Very much looking forward to commencing with production of the Sterlingcoin Standard Edition Crypto Cards in the new year.I will probably sell most of the remaining 25 Premier Edition cards via sites like ebay over the coming year - providing some additional promotion for Sterlingcoin. I'll keep a few back for a giveaway thread or two on the new Sterlingcoin forum though.    Thanks!The first batches of the Sterlingcoin - Premier Edition - Crypto Currency Cards have been dispatched both yesterday and today to Sweden, France, Canada and the USA.We still have some orders to ship to US customers, as well as a few other international orders and those will be dispatched before the end of this week.Delivery time is 3 to 5 working days on all international orders and I will be contacting customers with the tracking numbers asap.UK orders are also shipping this week, so Monday the 8th or Tuesday the 9th of December is now the estimated delivery date (although it could take a bit longer at this time of year ofc)....Screen shots of the StartCOIN crypto cards have been uploaded showing those cards with the protective plastic wallet cover - see: https://www.startjoin.com/updates/project/startcoin_cc - Updates tab.I'll look to get some uploaded screen shots of the Sterlingcoin crypto cards with the protective plastic wallet cover (when I get 5 mins. to do so) as we need some good screen shots for the retail website anway.  Herewith, Sterlingcoin Crypto Currency Card - Premier Edition - screen shots (actual) pending some slight alterations before the main print run tomorrow and over this weekend.  All going to plan we will commence with express shipping to our StartJOIN pledges from Monday 1st of December. Herewith a quick update in regards to the Sterlingcoin Premier Edition Crypto Cards.See: https://www.startjoin.com/slg_ccWe are currently running about a week behind on production following an unforeseen delay with the dispatch of some of the materials ordered for producing the cards. However, we should have some screen shots of the cards uploaded within the next couple of days or so with express dispatch to all customers commencing early next week. Orders for our international customers will be dispatched first and all orders will be tracked and signed for with a shipping reference no.Thank you.

Just a quick note to say that we have now received the £1,116 in pledges and contributions to commence with the Sterlingcoin Crypto Card - Premier Edition - wallet project.See: https://www.startjoin.com/slg_cc - N.B. That the funding period has now ended. All the remaining Premier Edition cards will be auctioned or sold separately (TBA).Almost two thirds of the total funding amount was pledged directly using PayPal !!! With the remaining funds being received as StartCOIN.In the next week or so we will have purchased all of the necessary equipment for production and should also have some screen shots ready of the actual Sterlingcoin Crypto Cards before shipping the rewards towards the end of November.I will ofc be providing ongoing status updates for the project as we progress.

Perhaps you could post the errors that your getting or I'll try to test it over the weekend. TBH I'm mining Slimcoin at RunAbove at present and mining Gapcoin at both DO and VULTR.Solo mining works at RunAbove, so it will just be a matter of reproducing the 'error' with rev2 capminer and making it compatible with the P8 chip set.

StartJOIN is a UK based crowd funding platform - so in the main part this does not apply.StartCOIN is listed and traded on Bittrex Exchange currently - which is ofc US based. Its very unlikely though that a coin used on a genuine crowd funding platform would be removed over other 'junk' crypto coins.It would be best to get StartCOIN listed on another EU based FIAT / exchange such as LiteBit.eu - http://www.litebit.eu - ASAP.StartCOIN can already be traded for FIAT via UK based Bittylicious https://bittylicious.com/coin/START We made it ! Its happening ! Sterlingcoin Cryptocurrency Cards is go !  26 backers with £1,056 pledged OF £1000 TARGET 8 (well 7) DAYS TO GO.Still some Sterlingcoin Cryptocurrency Cards left. If you pledge for a reward now you will get a Premier Edition Cryptocurrency Card.Estimated delivery date is the end of November 2014 (might be early December 2014 at the latest for some international customers). This project will be funded on Tuesday Nov 4, 09:47:05 AM GMTAs the project is now over the £1000 target you can contribute through StartJOIN using Bitcoin, StartCOIN and with PayPal.Thanks everyone ! Not as such. I'm unable to change the published rewards for a 'live' project on StartJOIN or to make special allowances outside of their terms and conditions perhaps.However, if its clear that someone has contributed much to successfully funding the project then it would be easy enough to ship some 'bonus batches' of Standard Edition cards for you to load some SLG onto for yourself to do your own giveaways or for resale. I'd be more than happy to do that to get more people interested and using Sterlingcoin.Please send me a PM if you have something else to suggest in regards to funding the project, although we do need to reach the target on StartJOIN before the deadline ofc.Thanks! Dcrypt algo and CPU mining is OK with me! Someone will eventually find a way to mine it with a GPU or ASIC + CPU / RAM combo and cpu coin pools will always have problems from botnets obviously.Anyway, herewith a single CPU instance at RunAbove - http://labs.runabove.com/power8/ - Not totally sure on the billing in comparison to other cloud server providers, but those are certainly some powerful core(s).If you follow my set-up guide from this thread remember to use screen.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=613213.msg9330074#msg9330074Code:screenbefore you start mining using:Code:./minerd -a dcrypt -o stratum+tcp://www.slimcoin.club:41680 -u YOUR SLIMCOIN WALLET ADDRESS -p x --scantime 15 --retries -1 -t 1You can then (press and hold) CTRL + A + D to get out of the screen session.

Both projects are interesting and unique from a mathematical and scientific perspective.I'm currently mining Gapcoin and Slimcoin (and sometimes some Primecoin too).Slimcoin is mostly interesting from an economic perspective in terms of crypto innovation. The Slimcoin developer did a lot of really 'smart' things with this coin to make it different and it remains so.If you look at Slimcoin's posts - he perhaps didn't really want this coin to have a pool and the choice of the unique dcrypt algo has certainly helped and somewhat hindered this coins progress in this regard. Other technical oversights have not helped with the situation or with Slimcoins adoption.Lets put it to a vote to switch algo then - the logical choice being SHA-256 like Bitcoin and Peercoin. I think I would actually vote yes on that. I agree that its perhaps an ambitious funding target for the StartJOIN platform currently, although not entirely unrealistic from an equity funding perspective.Max Keiser has mentioned investing in both StartCOIN and StartJOIN on several episodes of the Keiser Report on RT in the UK in the last few weeks. Its good to have some equity level funding projects on the platform to help attract the more serious VC people.If you breakdown the funding amount then £80k for a year divided by the 4 developers, less server costs and all of the operational extras - then its not much over the UK minimum wage per. year I'd imagine, if that.A single Venture Capitalist or Equity Crowd Funder could quite easily buy up that level of Sterlingcoin in one go and also crowd fund the project to help ensure the return on their investment.Most of the current projects on StartJOIN are at the Indiegogo or KickStarter type of crowd funding level. You have to look at the potential and think bigger. Take a look at one of the UK's largest Equity Funding platforms like CrowdCube http://www.crowdcube.com/ as an example.Good luck though to the Sterlingcoin Team - nothing ventured, nothing gained! WOW Good job! So, just short of £80k within 60 days. I guess if you don't meet the full investment target in the time frame it will at least bring lots of new interest and investors to Sterlingcoin.Actually when you compare the StartJOIN platform to some of the more established crowd funding websites its not unfeasible in terms of high level venture capital for this type of project to get funded. Just informing everyone of how to obtain some 'free' cloud mining for when we have a working pool.It's probably worth mining on windows azure instances in the wallet right now to support the network and to perhaps find a few extra blocks. For those that have not already signed up for the windows azure free trial offer - See: http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/You get enough credits for 2 x powerful 8-core CPU instances for around 5 to 7 days worth of mining. N.B. The 2008 server instances are cheapest to run.When Gapcoin has a working pool:- http://labs.runabove.com/power8/ - has $32 of free credit currently - Steadfast resources S with 1 x CPU seem to be the best option at $9- http://www.hpcloud.com/cloud-credit - "Get a $300 cloud credit when you try HP Helion Public Cloud"Looking forward to finding some new Prime Gaps.    They don't seem to want to let you buy more than 1000 SLG in a single transaction even when your logged in with a verified account.- https://www.litebit.eu/coin/slg/en/ - enter 1001 or more and you get "Max 1000 per order" currently.
Highly unlikely....Does the team acknowledge any potentially missing transactions / payouts from the old fluttercoinpool.com before the change over to http://flt.icarusglider.com/ ? Any ideas why LiteBit.eu have currently set a Sterlingcoin BUY order limit of 1000 SLG maximum per. transaction ? Perhaps we could just order you a pizza or something instead ?       I thought it was a novel idea and should encourage the cards holder to keep the card as 'cold storage' whilst the Sterlingcoin value should increases over the year. With the Sterlingcoin and StartCOIN price flagging slightly in the past week or so their has been a lull in new backers / contributors for the project.I'm going to make a last promotional drive to ensure that it gets fully funded this next week hopefully.It is still possible to buy (pledge) for one of the premier addition cards, above the £1000 funding target, due to a high % being made up of donation based contributions.I'm in the process of buying up the 5000 SLG which will be used to load each of the 100 cards with 50 SLG and will look to make the signed address public.With the current Sterlingcoin price I'm actually thinking that I could back the project with an additional 5000 SLG and use that to stake with on behalf of the initial 100 premier edition card holders and send out the 5% monthly stake to each individual card address, as a bonus. This will allow purchasers to keep their premier addition card in 'cold storage' although continue to receive stake (verifiable on the blockchain ofc). 0.5% stake would be retained for transfer fees and some compound interest. This would have to be a fixed term arrangement of say one year as monthly dividends to the cards. (N.B. This information is currently tentative).What do people who have already pledged for a limited edition Sterlingcoin card think about this idea / concept ? I'll try to help out with a % of the proceeds from the Sterlingcoin crypto cards if we can get that project off the ground. Indeed. My actual mining speed in slimminer is only around 5.25 khash/s (mining with 8 threads)...Someone sent me a link about RunAbove cloud instances https://www.runabove.com/index.xml - which currently have $32 (1 months approx. free credit also)Steadfast resources S with 1 x CPU seem to be the best option, currently at ($0.014 per. hour) so, $9 x 4 (instances) = $36Just testing it myself at the moment - they require SMS verification and payment method verification and you have to generate your own .keys.See: https://community.runabove.com/kb/en/instances/create-ssh-keys.html and http://labs.runabove.com/power8/ - quite powerful cores in comparison to other providers....Also, "Get a $300 cloud credit when you try HP Helion Public Cloud" - See: http://www.hpcloud.com/cloud-credit - I can't get HP to recognize my valid details though atm !?! - Check T's and C's.and ofc http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ - has a free trial offer still.    The pool stats. are way off. Seems to be stable though.Perhaps some more folks would spin-up a free cpu cloud instance and/or start mining in the pool. Just need to find a block to know that were good. Thinking that its probably possible to do some sort of 'hybrid-ASIC' SHA256 + CPU mining of the dcrypt algo as demonstrated by MediterraneanCoin.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=397831.msg4296600#msg4296600   Yep.

Current number of blocks  134905 Perfect! Just the job! I'll get the new banner into rotation asap.Previous CTR % was around 0.11 % (average) on the old banner, which is actually quite good!It takes a month or so to clear affiliate payments with the cloud server providers - I'll set-up a couple more CPU instances for you when they do.Cheers! Source: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/uk-government-continue-supporting-bitcoin/Following previous favourable announcements about the Digital Currency from the Chancellor,  the UKs minister for the digital economy Ed Vaizey demonstrated once again the government s strong ambition for Bitcoin, by asserting that it will continue to support the digital currencies:    Were doing a major program of work looking at opportunities in digital currencies.We want to make these e-payments faster, quicker, we want to make it as safe as possible. And we want to look at the kind of technologies that the digital currencies use to allow end systems to operate in a de-centralized way, with no intermediaries. We want to look at how the new technologies can benefits consumers and the wider economy. So thats something the Treasury is very interested in....Good news for Sterlingcoin - when the establishment and UK public fully recognize that digital currency is certainly not just a one horse race ! In addition to a paid listing at both proxy.org and proxynoid.com - http://boolberry.blue web proxy is now featured on 20 more additional proxy listing websites via top-proxies.co.uk/promotions.phpLots of web traffic incoming and when the new boolberry website is 'live' - obviously the community can start to focus on attracting merchants to build-up our boolberry based economy. Yes. The UK is certainly more forward thinking in this regard. Good to know that you are approaching the established authorities with professionalism.- N.B. some of my posts should always be read with a large degree of satire.   
Indeed. They also offer other registrations that could help with Sterlingcoins validity, recognition and acceptance.It's rather ironic though to be seeking official verification from institutions who indirectly support the endless printing of essentially 'worthless' paper currency and therefore deflation through unlimited money creation.- Sterlingcoin - How to Re-start your own countries economy !   That's brilliant."An authority that has the monetary sovereignty to exercise legal control over the currency of a country or countries""In most instances the monetary authority is the central bank of the respective country"...It's such an archaic approach. You should write back to them asking exactly which 'monetary authority' would be able to provide ISO registration for a decentralized monetary system ?Using Sovereignty as the basis of 'legal control' is in fact hilarious.I recently posted about some research I conducted some time ago with regards to 'Nation States' and 'Sovereignty as an Individual'.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=815529.0 - Bitnation.co - Governance 2.0 or just a Stateless Alternative ?!?Basically, in existing International Law, through Polity and Entity it can be put forward that an individual (or group) already has monetary sovereignty on the blockchain.According to the Montevideo Convention https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_ConventionThe state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.The most difficult aspect is in finding an independent or unclaimed territory to become a fully fledged Sovereign Nation.https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nulliusland belonging to no one, which is used in international law to describe territory which has never been subject to the sovereignty of any state, or over which any prior sovereign has expressly or implicitly relinquished sovereignty. Sovereignty over territory which is terra nullius may be acquired through occupation, though in some cases doing so would violate an international law or treaty.Polity  https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PolityA polity is a state  It is generally understood to mean a geographic area with a corresponding government  body politic was also understood to mean the physical person of the sovereign:Entity  https://wikipedia.org/wiki/EntityIn law, a legal entity is an entity that is capable of bearing legal rights and obligations, such as a natural person or an artificial person (e.g. business entity or a corporate entity).- Even our world leaders have had issues understanding the principals of Sovereignty - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdimK1onR4o   ...Perhaps an alternative might be to designate some land or property as " Sterlingland " and to declare it as a Sovereign Micro Nation.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syujTp5m5Vk - How To Start Your Own Country - Episode 1 of 6   ...On a more serious note what about the commodities or assets ISO route ? Its interesting to note that Bitcoin is in fact already listed on http://www.xe.com/ as XBTAnyway, excellent work in making the 'regulatory authorities' more aware of crypto currencies in general and specifically Sterlingcoin ofc. At this difficulty we really need to have a working pool set-up again.You could try cloud mining at VULTR instead. They currently provide cloud servers with (at least) x2 the cpu power per. core and more RAM.They also accept Bitcoin - https://www.vultr.com/news/45/Now-Accepting-Bitcoin!Did anyone try contacting sandor111 ? as they set-up the original Slimcoin NOMP based pool I think. 468 x 60 web banner, similar to the one posted in the link above. It will mostly be shown at traffic exchange websites, so only has a viewing time of around 4 sec. min. to 30 sec. max. Thus the banner should be very eye-catching and also present the boolberry brand and cloud mining offer clearly.~ I'll set a 1 CPU cloud mining instance running in the next 24hrs to your BBR address, as a thank you. If the new banner increases the sign-up ratio then I'll look to add another instance or two perhaps. Thanks clintar - that's great.Perhaps we should commission Bitcrea to produce a better web banner for this. I'm now serving 10k+ banner impressions across manual traffic exchanges (on a good day).   Just a quick note that http://boolberry.blue - my BBR themed web proxy has now been submitted successfully with an active / paid listing to both proxy.org and proxynoid.com - two of the main sources for building up web based proxy traffic. Hopefully this will attract lots of new users to Boolberry - with some already having an interest in online privacy, security and anonymity services.I also have a 468 x 60 BBR banner being served from the website across multiple traffic exchanges.- http://boolberry.blue/images/boolberry-blue-banner.jpg - which ofc links to the cloud mining guide here: http://boolberry.blue/boolberry-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.phpWeb traffic, user base and affiliate referrals are building up steadily.If any BBR pools want to add the banner and/or a link to the guide then that would be great. People obviously like free stuff, so this should help bring the BBR hash rate up over time.   Cheers! Yes. Just over 2 weeks to go now and although the project pledges and contributions have slowed up a bit - we remain optimistic that funding will pick-up towards the target date.  Good to see that the project had a mention here: http://cointelegraph.com/news/112755/the-alt-cracks-ghostcoin-gets-some-ghost-coins-sterlingcoin-continues-its-march-bittrex-updates-policy-more...Anyway, Sterling job on the new wallets and features from the dev. team.Keep up the good work! All of the above is a good idea + PeerGuardian.   Everyone should try to stake coins, where possible.If your on windows then install a good free firewall like ZoneAlarm and use a P2P IP firewall with good / up-to-date blocklists- http://www.peerblock.com/ and https://www.iblocklist.com/lists.phpIf you run Linux the you can install PeerGuardian and use the above lists also. Its a bit tricky to get it installed properly on Ubuntu 14.04 - so here is a quick guide.Open a new terminal window using crtl + alt + tCode:sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jre-phoenix/ppaCode:sudo apt-get updateCode:sudo apt-get install gksuCode:sudo apt-get install pgld pglcmd pglguiNavigate to your 'home' folder and do ctrl + h to show hidden files and folders and locate ~/.config/pgl/pglgui.conf and add the following line to the base of the .conf using gedit.Code:[paths]super_user=/usr/bin/gksuSave > Done. Now you can search applications PeerGuardian to run the gui and add new blocklists etc. Tip: Don't use the default blocklist option i.e. select 'no' at install.  Coolio. Update my nodes without a hitch. Good progress.~ Raspberry of approval from our mascot Indeed. Slimcoin is certainly not just a 'copy and paste' coin and has many innovative features.Its quite remarkable that Slimcoin has had a relatively limited following up until now and that it was almost left to just crash and burn. (pun intended) Maybe it is or maybe it isn't ? I sent you a block of 15 SLM the other day. I'll send you another block now.  Keep up the good work! A new block explorer and a pool would be perfect I think. We should also thank d5000 as they have helped to bring much new interest for Slimcoin. Both 1 GB RAM VPS instances running Slimcoin have remained stable with low RAM usage and even with a bunch of other applications running, thus far. So, the block pruning and other changes appear to of worked in that regard - log files are also much reduced in size as expected.I did see an Estimated Total Block count of 470000 on one VPS, although the Current Number of Blocks was correct with the node in sync. Restarting the client fixed that ofc.Original dev. Slimcoin should be interested in the changes / improvements and may look to move them into the main / now old branch. He is / was contactable by using the email address presented in the Slimcoin white paper and also via forum PM ofc. If not and if the checkpoints continue to present an issue moving forward then entirely removing PoS is perhaps the best option after all.As I understand it, PoB block generation is 'random' after each new PoW block anyway. At the low percentage return PoS is perhaps more of a hindrance, both from the technical and economic perspective. A new pool should bring plenty of 'CPU only' miners to secure the network. Slimcoin being one of the few 'CPU only' coins left in the crypto sphere. Would seem to be a big improvement overall.Still getting the Checkpoint error, but I guess that will clear if the blockchain is downloaded a fresh - not doing that just now though and will just let it run over 24hrs for error checking etc. Good job! Will test this on my windows VPS now. OK - So, marketing then...It's almost the start of proxy season - I'm about to submit http://boolberry.blue to http://proxy.org/advertise.shtml as a 1 months bold listing (all of $20). TBH most proxy ads revenue for an entire year is generated within the next month or so, as these types of proxy websites become very popular with uni students.Wondering if the BBR community would want to 'crowd fund' one whole years worth of advertising (as a bold listing) for the sum total of $240 or perhaps just 6 months at $120 ?I'd go BBR > BTC > PayPal and purchase the full listing. Job done. I could replace some of the current a-ads banners with banner rotators for Bitcoin related ads for referral links by our BRR community members in return.The web host I'm currently using for the proxy site is http://flokinet.is - who I could probably enable a BBR accepting 'white label' VPS service with and/or find someone else to build up a paid Boolberry accepting VPS service that I / we could advertise / sell via the proxy website with some form of revenue sharing etc. If anyone is interested or wants in then please PM me and we can consider some options.- Goods and Services build economy and create value folks, not financial markets, which are just a means of exchange. You won't get 'to da moon' without hard work, investment (of your time or otherwise) and promotion by yourself and/or the community. Not everything can be 'free as in beer' anymore, especially if your a bankster.Having said that I'll add some links to the proxy site for the three major BBR exchanges for people to discover how to purchase some boolberry if they desire.Now go do your bit (erm... boolberry).   Whoops...Some 'default' packages are missing in Ubuntu 14.04 x64 at VULTR - you need to install the following additions:Code:sudo apt-get install git screen automake build-essential libboost-all-dev libdb5.1-dev libdb5.1++-dev libminiupnpc-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgmp-devI'll mix the package lists and update the guide asap.- Have set one VULTR $5 VPS instance mining BBR to @zoidberg as my project donation ! Should run for over a month or more, if I see some referrals, I'll look to add another instance.Single CPU instance at VULTR is mining BBR at  > 40 kh/s    Hey fellow Boolberry pickers,   My Boolberry CPU Cloud Mining Guide at: http://boolberry.blue/boolberry-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.php - has been updated to include an additional $5 free offer from VULTR - (please see the website for sign-up details). The VULTR cloud instances are at least x2 faster than a Digital Ocean single instance CPU and also come with 768 MB RAM instead of just 512 MB RAM !You can also get an additional $5 bonus for funding your account using Bitcoin: https://www.vultr.com/news/45/Now-Accepting-Bitcoin! Added SWAP file creation to the guide - which will probably work well for a 512 MB RAM instance at Digital Ocean (currently untested though).cncoin.farm is now the recommended pool in the guide, although I've included a link to this forums OP to help folks find other pools.The promotional pop-under banner has been removed from the 'proxy' homepage of the website and I'll be commencing with advertising the site in various proxy listing websites - it's now very much proxy / internet promo season.Cheers!   
MailBigFile is quite good - https://www.mailbigfile.com/ Code:addnode=107.181.250.216:41682addnode=107.181.250.217:41682Nodes back up and fully synced to the ones shown at http://www.slimcoin.club/ - hopefully stable. Good work and great website.Trying to get wallets / client synced now again. PoS generation can ofc be temporarily disabled by setting a reserve balance above your current eligible stake balance in the slimcoin.confSo, say:Code:reservebalance=10000I have almost 4000 effective burnt Slimcoins, so I'll donate some SLM once I've hit a couple of PoB blocks.   Have started mining Magi using Digital Ocean and VULTR as per. joelao95 guide.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=735170.msg8800103#msg8800103I actually had a bunch of referral credit surplus after signing folks up to mine Boolberry at Digital Ocean.  Anyway, I have used your link at VULTR - which has pretty impressive VPS instances, currently being x2 the hashing speed (on average) over Digital Ocean with more RAM for the same price.VULTR gives $5 free credit as well when you register a valid debit card or deposit with PayPal and they now accept Bitcoin deposits with an additional $5 credit on the first deposit.Can't find a better reason to not try mining some Magi ! I'm wondering if an 'official' Sterlingcoin multi-pool might be a good idea even during the PoW phase - keeping it simple and only mining good long-term crypto coins - say;SHA-256 - Bitcoin and/or Peercoin, other ?Scrypt - Litecoin and/or Cryptogenic Bullion (which has actually been consistently profitable to mine on occasions over LTC), other ?After PoW phase adding x11 - StartCOIN and/or Darkcoin, other ?...I have a couple of Scrypt ASIC mining rigs that I'd happily hash with at a Sterlingcoin multi-pool. It might actually help with the overall distribution.   Thanks for supporting !- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hythe,_Kent- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hythe,_Hampshire- http://www.hytheonline.com/Ferry/About-the-pier-train.html    Lets hope so ! Much appreciated and thank you.I look forward to presenting updates for the crypto cards as we progress. I'm looking to have some finished production prototypes for the cards well before the end of the crowdfunding period and delivery of the cards to project backers is estimated before the end of Nov. 2014 - providing we meet the funding target of course. Hello Fierce,Thank you for making a pledge for the Sterling crypto card wallet project on StartJOIN.The process for generating the crypto card wallets pub.key (address) and priv.key (redemption code) are to be performed in a secure environment.A new wallet.dat is first generated in an 'online' Sterlingcoin wallet to ensure the necessary key pairing. This networked PC is fully encrypted and uses an advanced P2P firewall. The individual wallet.dat is then copied securely to an encrypted USB drive and then to a fully redundant (always offline) PC. Only then is the "dumpprivkey" command used to extract the priv.key for the wallet address. The priv.key is printed directly onto the back of the card using an (always offline) redundant printer and is then immediately sealed with a tamper-proof-resistant hologram / unique bar coded sticker. All copies of the priv.key and wallet.dat are then destroyed using a military-grade DoD 5220.22-M file deletion process. This process will be certified on our future website dedicated to the crypto cards.I will be the only person (or another certified person) who ever sees the individual priv.key and we are also working on additional quality assurance certification for the cards, which will be put in place when the project has the required funding.There is a 'trust' element to this of course, as with the provision of any 3rd party product or service, although I am looking to implement extended security well above and beyond all other existing providers of paper wallets and crypto cards. It is certainly in my best interests to do this properly and to ensure the longevity of my future business. We will be ensuring as much transparency as possible throughout the process as well. A quick update for the: Sterlingcoin Cryptocurrency Card Wallet - Premier Edition - project currently 'active' on the StartJOIN crowdfunding platform.See: https://www.startjoin.com/slg_cc15 backers - £379 pledged OF £1000 TARGET - 25 DAYS TO GOAgain, special thanks to all StartJOIN'ers who have pledged to this project thus far !...Some of the folks on StartJOIN liked our Sterlingcoin crypto cards project and asked us to submit a similar project for StartCOINs. So we did just that.See: https://www.startjoin.com/startcoin_ccAnyway, getting both of these projects successfully funded could probably allow a small UK based IT business to employ some new staff dedicated to production and sales for these crypto cards, as well as for some other upcoming products - only being produced for genuine and quality crypto currencies of course.That's crypto currency in action ! Keep up the good work Sterlingcoin Team and everyone involved !   StartCOIN Crypto Card Project has been Approved and is now 'live' on StartJOIN.See: https://www.startjoin.com/startcoin_ccDraft for StartCOIN Crypto Card Project - Wallet Design: Project Pitch:26 backers - £360 pledged OF £1000 TARGET - 30 DAYS TO GO   Thanks to all StartJOIN'ers who have pledged and contributed thus far !  ...Get involved ! Get on StartJOIN ! Start your own crowdfunded project or concept and support other peoples as well ! #FundFriday  Exactly this. Someone is just spreading FUD.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=817001.msg9136919#msg9136919 - which is total FUD as said BitSWIFT has absolutely nothing to do with either StartCOIN or StartJOIN whatsoever...." StartJOIN Technology Ltd5th Floor24 Hanover SquareLondonEnglandW1S 1JD "See: https://www.startjoin.com/pages/contact Looks great! Its a bit of shame that the badge(s) don't have a URL backlink though.  Bitnation - http://bitnation.co - Governance 2.0 - launches in a few days.I have decided to share some of my internet ramblings on the Bitnation forums...  - http://forum.bitnation.co/topic/off-topic-2/#post-911 Very shiny indeed !I look forward to placing an order with them in the future. Sounds like a plan !N.B. That the current StartCOIN wallet does not have built in QR codes.It will take around 24 to 48 hours to get a basic design concept produced for the crypto card and to commence with the submission of the pitch.I would require written permission (if some form) to commence with print reproduction of the StartCOIN / StartJOIN logo. It might be good for the community to have some say over the final design of the card ?Pre-loading the cards with StartCOIN is not presently an option as I do not currently hold a reserve of StartCOIN. So, these would have to be produced as 'blank' gift-able StartCOIN crypto card wallets.Perhaps it would be better to create this as StartJOIN Concept instead of as a fixed Project with a view to express funding of an initial print run / production ? I'm open to options. Sterlingcoin crypto card wallet - crowdfunding project on StartJOIN - See: https://www.startjoin.com/updates/project/slg_cc6 backers - £248 pledged (thus far) OF £1000 TARGET - 28 DAYS TO GO -  Again, special thanks to all contributors and supporters, financial or otherwise - lets do this ! Yes. The software must have built in QR code functionality to present a QR code on the front of the plastic card. Although, a gift style card with just a wallet address is possible ofc.These are effectively much more durable versions of 'paper wallets'. Production is actually quite time consuming, as the keys must be securely generated and printed in an always 'offline' environment on an individual basis. We are working to provide additional authenticity and certification measures for added security and transparency in this regard.We would look to create a new crowdfunding pitch for this in the future perhaps. @d5000: You are right in regards to the Peercoin version releases. What is interesting is that the 1st Slimcoin release was seemingly quite 'stable' in comparison to now.Having three algorithms for block generation is partly causing these network propagation issues. Its possible that these issues were somewhat unrealized with fewer networked nodes and less of a blockchain.It is not going to be easy to fix this and it may be better to try a different or similar PoB implementation altogether. Again, a coder with an extensive working knowledge of the Peercoin base is the best option to provide advice on whats possible here - I'd imagine. I do have an account on the peercoin forums, but I've not logged-in for a while, so as you are a mod. then go-for-it.   @AizenSou: Being a 'Hero' member on this forum, sadly does not make us magic men. The term 'Hero' is used to much these days imho.Although, lots of us have put time and resources into mining and supporting Slimcoin, so it would be a shame to see all that just go to waste.
The more I look at this it is PoS that is the main issue over PoB aside from the networking protocol bugs. If Slimcoin had been just PoW and PoB then that would probably of been much better.The 'randomness' of the PoB implementation is also an issue. We essentially have a code base from early Peercoin - thus the best person to ask for help is most likely Sunny King or another or the Peercoin devs.They were / are busy with Nubits and PeerShares, but now those are mostly launched maybe someone can take a look at this ?Sadly it might be best to start again with Slimcoin 2.0   Helping to progress this Sterlingcoin crypto cards project on StartJOIN.comSee: https://www.startjoin.com/slg_ccIf we meet our funding target then it would also be possible to put these types of crypto card wallets into mass production for other crypto currencies - including StartCOIN perhaps.Cheers! OK Thanks.I'll PM Spencer (a Sterlingcoin Dev.) with a link to this post now. I've already had a discussion with them in regards to your new http://banx.io exchange service.Anyway, I'm just building bridges.Regards, Interesting.Do BanxShares become PoW minable after a certain block number is passed ?I did try solo mining using the wallet after seeing the listing on coinmarketcap.com on Saturday, however the block reward is ofc 0.00 currently. I didn't check the github code fully yet.  ...Also, could you perhaps look to add Sterlingcoin (SLG) to your exchange fairly sharpish ? - As your also a UK based business / entity I think it would be appropriate.See: http://sterlingcoin.org.uk and https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=721936Cheers! Thanks for your support and continuing development for Sterlingcoin.- https://twitter.com/startjoin - StartJOIN twitter account as quite a lot of followers, if we can get them to re-tweet a tweet by the official Sterlingcoin account, that would be great! Also, could we look at getting Bittylicious to add Sterlingcoin perhaps ? Thanks Spencer and the rest of the Sterlingcoin Development Team !I can confirm that although I'm not part of the 'official' Sterlingcoin team - I am responsible for overseeing the development and production of these Sterlingcoin cryptocurrency cards.Project Pitch:The price of a single cryptocurrency - Premier Edition - card has been set at £15 incl. express worldwide P&P. It is possible to get a cheaper price if you pledge for a batch of 5 or 10 cards.Successful crowdfunding for the project will enable us to move forward with the mass production of the standard edition Sterlingcoin cards - which will initially come pre-loaded with fixed quantities of 1 , 5 , 10 or 20 SLG and will have a lower retail price point than the Premier Edition - which is basically designed as a rare Limited Edition and/or Collectors Edition card.Making a pledge on https://www.startjoin.com/ is possible using StartCOIN 2.0 (which is a PoW crypto currency) See: https://startcoin.org/ or with PayPal. Pledging with Bitcoin on StartJOIN is possible once the project has reached its minimum target of £1000 and before the project deadline which is Tuesday Nov 4, 09:47:05 AM GMT.The website https://bittylicious.com/ provides an easy and reliable way to purchase StartCOIN 2.0 in the UK and it is also recommended by the StartJOIN crowdfunding platform. Holding more than 100 StartCOIN 2.0 on the StartJOIN website currently earns you rewards: "The more you do, the more you hold, then the more you are rewarded." - StartJOIN is a UK based platform and I would also encourage everyone to get involved with starting and/or crowdfunding other projects.Thank you....Additional: We are also in the process of designing Sterlingcoin crypto bullion cards to accompany the standard edition crypto currency cards. The planned crypto bullion cards will feature real, genuine and certified 100% recycled Sterling Eco Silver as a physical asset and store-of-value and will be made available as an add-on purchase or as a combined gift-set. Anything bellow $250 I think would be cause for concern, especially if that price is reached before the end of October, without any retracement in November.If I remember correctly that was around the 'real' economy 'value' before Mt.Gox (and some others) probably started to artificially inflate the price. Lots of media interest around that time as well ofc which brought buy support.~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ku1A5Ox8UI'd imagine strong buy support at $100 or above from speculators alone.~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7TuFy0fcuw$1 = 1 BTC is very unlikely indeed.~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_wIuDH0wFQ Seeking short-term profits over potential long-term gains ?Sterlingcoin is designed as a strong asset-based and store-of-value currency with a big focus on building up a real economy with goods and services to support it.Furthermore, I'd say that you actually made a good investment choice currently - as you probably brought SLG with your BTC before / during the ongoing BTC price decline ?Personally - I'm mining, staking and making BUY scalper trades because I want to own as much Sterlingcoin as I can + I also require some spare for my upcoming projects.  Bittrex - https://bittrex.com/Market/?MarketName=BTC-SLGCryptsy - https://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/304 Good project.I have pledged $25 support for now using StartCOIN on StartJOIN.com and will watch this project with interest.Closed source identity and reputation systems will no doubt become more prevalent in the near future - It is therefore going to be essential to have open source alternatives. Now create two wallets;(1) Bank / save 1000 SLG to stake with long-term (example).(2) Create a 300 SLG checking / current account and purchase stuff over time from new merchants as they come on stream month to month (example).(3) Everyone's a winner!Rules to follow: Don't save everything and don't spend everything either (I did and its certainly no fun!)~ Money is only money when its moving. PoS coins are the future as they always keep the money moving.I continue to learn to hate bitcoin a bit less everyday!    ...That's good. Hopefully Sterlingcoin has a great future as a genuine asset based currency. The pure PoS aspect of this coin makes a lot of sense moving forward.The saving vs spending rut is something to be mindful of with these rarer asset based crypto-currencies. A good example for comparison would be CryptogenicBullion - CGB - which also has a numismatic and/or association with metal / bullion in its name and does present some future potential. However, without actually being backed by anything much and in not having a wealth of goods and services to purchase using the currency we potentially end up holding a bunch of worthless digital tokens with their only real value being perceived and relative to the market and/or the time and energy used to create them.The Sterlingcoin team seems well aware of this fact and they are actively looking to get merchants to accept the currency - which is really what this is supposed to be all about - better money!I'll link to my 'Bitcoins, Alt. coins, Pizzas and Haircuts.' post, again - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=323188.0  ... Merchants, Merchants and more Merchants ... and if they should need an additional reason why they should accept Sterlingcoin over fiat: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/inflation-robbing-money/Of course as a saver or speculator one only has to accumulate and not to spend for best results - which is perhaps the biggest irony with any asset based currency, as it is the transfer of ownership in exchange for goods and services that truly builds up value and actual worth. Stealthcoins Tor usage actually provides quite good network anonymity when compared to most other 'anonymous' coins.I've posted about this elsewhere, but pure proof-of-work coins are potentially much better in terms of providing anonymity for the user over proof-of-stake coins.For example, an adversary can quite easily match a transaction to a change in your wallet balance and considering that most pure PoS coin balances are purchased via exchanges, after the initial PoW phase, then such information can easily be used to identify you. Basically, the ability to make 'anonymous' transactions becomes totally pointless when considering that privacy of acquisition and ownership are really the key to your anonymity.Arguably, mining Bitcoin (or another PoW coin like Darkcoin) over Tor at a .onion address enabled pool, such as eligius.st and only ever connecting your wallet over Tor, receiving the coins, making a transaction and then dumping the wallet / used address provides much better anonymity when using crypto-currency than say purchasing coins from an exchange, which again is highly traceable. The very action of staking your balance on the network shows on the blockchain which coins you own. PoS and 'true' anonymity are in fact poles apart to begin with.No single crypto-currency has got the anonymity / privacy mix quite right yet.With Sterlingcoin your buying into a potentially very strong asset based crypto-currency with a growing economy and a user base to support this. This is not investment advice, although I will say that I currently hold more Sterlingcoin than I do Stealthcoin.   BoolberryRUNEAureumBoolberry - http://boolberry.blue - Option AThanks! Really great information sheet - That's what crypto-currency is all about: merchants, merchants and more merchants - not markets, markets and more markets !Well, we do require some exchange services obviously, but we definitely need more goods and service providers who accept Sterlingcoin.   ...With Sterlingcoin being more of an asset based crypto-currency - I think its perhaps relevant (in terms of staking too) to hold two main wallets, one for staking and one for spending. You can think of one wallet as your checking account for purchases and one as your savings account. Whatever your personal split / ratio is in this regard is unimportant - what is more important is for the early adopters and miners to spend their coins and to buy good and services with them.The overall stability of the market to date is actually very reassuring. When Sterlingcoin is fully PoS in a approximately 6 months from now the low power Proof-of-Stake minting will power the network and transactions.A while back I looked at what would be possible with existing tech in terms of 'eco-friendly' minting for Mintcoin - now a pure PoS currency, much like Sterlingcoin will become.How-To: Build a Solar Powered Raspberry Pi - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpAYDcW_Jx0Raspberry Pi Raspdock by alivemaker - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoANgBYFCEYAnker 14-Watt Foldable Solar Panel Battery Charger with Astro E5 15000mAh External Battery - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYDn5M1Vb3MWhich is certainly a much more eco-friendly alternative to this...A LOOK INSIDE AMERICA'S LARGEST BITCOIN MINING OPERATION  - http://youtu.be/5CjldZLXiAU?t=3m14sEDIT: ...

Run the software once to ensure connectivity with the default settings, if possible, and then try to add one of the configs. and re-start the TBB.You should first look to remove UseNTorHandshake 1 from the example config. as this is probably the most likely option to cause start-up errors. Also, try using this version instead as it doesn't contain specific node listings and just the avoid countries lists: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg6677546#msg6677546If you still get start-up errors then take a look at the log, as it will probably indicate what the cause is.I'll look to review all settings over this weekend hopefully, as the avoid countries list is due for an update anyway.Remember that its your Torrc and everyone should edit the config. to best suit their own requirements when using Tor.  Thanks for the link!I've put a load of useful information in this thread that aims to empower Tor users to be safer online and when using Bitcoin or Alt. coins over Tor.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.0I'll look to update the recommended avoid countries lists asap. (1) Don't panic and don't diversify your Bitcoin or Litecoin holdings or sell low.(2) Peercoin would be the 'safest' and best choice alternative imho. Mesh Networking is the future of 'the internet' both for the people and by the people - you are 100% right about that - and Mesh Networks will also be good for both Bitcoin and for other future Blockchain technologies.For example, the Free Network Foundation - See: https://www.thefnf.org/ are already actively working to 'Free the Network'.This is a great and very informative watch: Free the Network: Hackers Take Back the Web - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx93WJPCCGs Yes and No.A government or your ISP can try to make it as difficult as possible to use Bitcoin by blocking your network access to Bitcoins default P2P port or by restricting / throttling your P2P traffic / bandwidth.However, it will still be possible for a user to connect with the Bitcoin network by changing the default P2P port or by using a VPN or an anonymity network such as Tor for connectivity.Governments and regulatory authorities have been unsuccessful in preventing the downloading of movies and music with P2P software like BitTorrent and the Bitcoin network protocol functions in much the same way. Basically if you have working internet access, then you have access to the Bitcoin blockchain. Whilst I believe that a crypto-currency should not really involve nationalism, it is a very different thing for crypto-currency to present a strong local connotation or geographical affiliation.Take for example the Lewes Pound: http://www.thelewespound.org/ or Bristol Pound: http://bristolpound.org/ already in use within the United Kingdom....It will be good to get back to using 'Sterling' as real money - See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling - " ... At various times, the pound sterling was commodity money or bank notes backed by silver or gold, but it is currently fiat money, backed only by the economy in the areas where it is accepted ... "For cryto-currency to work well you need economy (goods and services), people who use and who trust in it (to drive the economy) and a 3rd party means of exchange which allows people (and businesses) to effectively back (or buy into) the currency with existing assets and/or to provide the equivalent of liquidity in markets.It's clearly apparent that the Sterlingcoin dev. team understands the importance of such factors and they have begun to put in place the fundamental basics even prior to the launch.- Bitcoins, Alt. coins, Pizzas and Haircuts. - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=323188.0- Philomena Cunk on Money from "Moments of Wonder." - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YKw8w-e50   - Shire Silver - https://shiresilver.com/ - A good example of 'real money' that isn't even a crypto-currency !
Boolberry has just been added to new exchanges.Boolberry is a cool and unusual name that can build a strong 'brand' identity.Their is nothing wrong with the boolberry name or the current boolberry logo.The 3 proposed name changes are all terrible when compared to boolberry - in my honest opinion.At best I'm thinking to stop mining BBR for now and at worst ? Although the technical fundamentals are mostly their - does this project actually have a clear direction moving forward ? Is a 2nd name change and re-branding really worthwhile at this stage ? " 2. Spacedrop gives 50 SLG per entry to worldwide audience (1 entry per IP address). "Would indeed seem to be the best and fairest option for all. The proxy blocking that you have put in place for the space drop and faucet appears to be quite effective in this regard....Sterlingcoin is looking very good quid pro quo !  I think that the 5.5% Annual PoS Interest rate is actually spot on, as around 4-5% is well above the interest rate obtainable by most savers with regular banking and the 1.5-0.5% basically covers any transaction fees regardless of being a saver, trader or merchant. It's also low enough to not cause any issues long-term linked with inflation etc. I'll continue maintaining the https://twitter.com/FreeMintCoin account for a while longer. Currently doing a promo to target #Freebie and #FreeStuff accounts and their twitter followers. Seems like it could work quite well !  Indeed.The concept is for a physical product in relation to an alt. coin (not to finance an alt. coin) and so crowd funding via StartJOIN is an option for consideration certainly....Having used both StartCOIN 1 and StartCOIN 2.0 - I'd say that the switch from Scrypt to x11 was probably a good decision overall. The difficulty re-targeting is much improved for pool mining and x11 is going to provide a more even distribution long-term.I've registered on StartJOIN and will look to become active with project contributions in future.    Perhaps rather ironically it could be described as a StopCOIN 1 and StartCOIN 2 type of scenario ?...On a more serious note I do very much like the idea of a digital currency being used for crowd funding. StartJOIN is not fully live though yet, right ?@BankToTheFuture did you get my PM seeking clarification if BankToTheFuture is only interested in looking to fund Bitcoin related start-ups and not alt. coin related projects as well currently ? As a UK citizen I have decided to join the UKDCA with a paid individual annual subscription.It will be interesting to monitor the progress of the UKDCA, although I'll probably remain the cat amongst the pigeons. A Mintcoin community update in regards to the @FreeMintCoin twitter account.I stared this giveaway account some time ago to help promote Mintcoin and to giveaway a token amount of 20 free Mintcoin's to anyone who tweeted their Mintcoin address via twitter to @FreeMintCoinI have not had the time recently to maintain the account fully and an unforseen issue with the giveaway script / wallet access also presented a temporary issue with the originally allocated giveaway funds.I contacted 'cryptomommy' before the weekend to ask if someone would be able to take over the giveaway account on my behalf and this is likely to happen once I have sent / honored any outstanding requests missed by the script. Someone will continue to keep the account active in the meantime.The @FreeMintCoin account operated from a Reserve account of 2 Million MintCoin, which has now minted above the original 200,000 MintCoin allocated to the original Giveaway wallet.The new / re-instated Giveaway wallet address is: MvChM1UPsJkavUv2qoXCKUrfaCsCWJUkyBDate: 15/09/2014 11:22To: MvChM1UPsJkavUv2qoXCKUrfaCsCWJUkyBDebit: -200000.00 MINTTransaction fee: -0.10 MINTNet amount: -200000.10 MINTTransaction ID: e73c073af9a72a43e410c8e0df7628e63746887dbfc037d75c690b3b085794a8Sent from the original Free Mintcoin Reserve wallet address: MipkErj7S3c7g1AZvXTvZWTDq6ygAwiXTCI propose to always maintain the MintCoin Reserve wallet and to top-up the Giveaway wallet as required. The free Mintcoin giveaway amount will be increased from 20 to 200 free Mintcoins for the time being. Your welcome. Remember that nothing is for certain in the crypto world, except perhaps for the math!One good thing about Mintcoin is that it has been floating within a stable range - top 100 (in a sea of other alt. coins both old and new) see: http://coinmarketcap.com/ - for a considerable number of months now. There are quite a few factors for this, but stability is generally something to watch for! The value of Mintcoin should increase nicely in line with the PoS reductions ...- PoS variable interests: - 1st year: 20% - 2nd year: 15% - 3rd year: 10% - 4th and subsequent years: 5%Which can in fact be compared somewhat to the block halving in Bitcoin i.e. 50 , 25 , 12.5 etc...Everyone will most certainly wish that they had been minting Mintcoin with the 20% interest rate, just as everyone wishes that they had been mining Bitcoin (and held) at the 50 BTC block rewards.Mintcoin can be considered a truly innovative PoS crypto-coin in terms of its long-term economic potential and viability as a currency.Hold and keep on minting... Very good FAQ's and HOWTO's sonoIOOnly three more things everyone needs to know: boolberry boolberry boolberry.      Oh and I wrote a CPU cloud mining guide here: http://boolberry.blue/boolberry-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.php - which is just about still relevant for some extra BBR hashes! Indeed. I can't find a public example of a transaction to an IP address prior to this one. I'm told that the Bitcoin sourceforge mailing lists (including the private bitcoin-security list) does not appear to have an example of an IP transaction before this one either.I'm assuming that the 'Satoshi to Hal' transaction was sent to a Bitcoin address and that all other IP transactions were to private ranges. The posts show that others were aware of how IP sending worked in practice, the question being - did anyone else actually test it ? Base networking protocols are often assumed to be working correctly when the layers above them are functioning.It will be easy enough to find the transactions on the blockchain i.e. 2 x 0.01 BTC transactions on the same date / time as your post. Hey SmokeTooMuch,Do you remember when you sent me 2x 0.01 BTC to test IP sending ?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34.msg236#msg236Was this the first public Bitcoin transaction to an IP address ?Wonder if either of us still has that wallet ?  Guess I might go and have a dig through some empty wallets then... Your welcome ofc.The Bad-Behavior script is quite good for preventing 'abuse' issues: http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us/about/ when combined with a php http:BL API Key.EDIT: Blockscript - http://blocked.com - is actually free for a certain number of user requests per. month and blocks numerous open proxies. Your server requires the ioncube loaders for Blockscript.You can also find updated proxy lists here: https://www.iblocklist.com/lists.php - and a list of Tor exit nodes from the Organizations tab. I do not really approve of any website blocking Tor exit nodes, although if you were to only block the space drop page for the initial giveaway, then I guess its not so bad. It would help to ensure a fair distribution.Non-collection and/or minimal collection of users data, where possible, is certainly the best option. I just had to post this here:Philomena Cunk on  'Money' from "Moments of Wonder."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YKw8w-e50~ "Increasingly, these days, money isn't something you can hold in your hand or bite on like a pirate, because its stored in the imaginations of computers..."   Philomena Cunk on  'Computers' from "Moments of Wonder."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92dLXSbrmakWhat if Satoshi actually worked for the Bank of England ? Time for Plan  BTC  then  ?   Firstly, very much looking forward to the launch of Sterlingcoin - good job guys !Option 2 for the 'Space drop' - will probably provide the best overall distribution for Sterlingcoin to those who are interested.People will always find a way round an online application system, no matter what safe guards you put in place.For example, here is a short list of free UK sms / text dump websites: http://hs3x.comhttp://receive-sms-now.comhttp://receivemysms.com/http://www.chaka.biz/http://receivesmsonline.com/http://www.freeonlinephone.org/http://www.receivesmsonline.net/http://receivefreesms.com/http://receive-sms-online.org/The UK DDI: http://www.ukddi.com/ provides up to 10 free UK local numbers per. account for most area codes for voip users.Postcodes are easy to find and their are countless free UK based proxies.   Is it still possible to exchange Startcoin 1 for Startcoin 2 ?I started mining Startcoin 1 when it was first released with high hopes for its future and actually purchased Scrypt mining equipment to dedicate to mining Startcoin 1. Now that Startcoin 2 is x11 - I'm basically mining other crypto-coins instead - I guess I'll re-evaluate Startcoins future potential... I recently took a review of my own alt. coin holdings / crypto-currency portfolio.Here is a list of the more innovative crypto-currency projects and/or digital assets that I personal think stand the best chance of continued recognition and/or long-term adoption / usage by the masses as currency (in some form or another). There are a few others, although these are the ones that I feel matter the most, currently. This is not investment advice... and no I don't personally hold large amounts of all of these alt. coins.BBR - Boolberry - http://boolberry.com/BTSX - BitSharesX - http://bitshares-x.info/CGB - CryptogenicBullion - http://cgb.holdings/CURE - Curecoin http://curecoin.net/ (EDIT: and Gridcoin)DRK - Darkcoin - http://www.darkcoin.io/LTC - Litecoin - https://litecoin.org/MINT - Mintcoin - http://mintcoin.cc/MYR - Myriad - http://myriadplatform.org/NMC - Namecoin - http://namecoin.info/PPC - Peercoin - http://www.peercoin.net/XPM - Primecoin - http://primecoin.io/XST - Stealthcoin - https://www.stealth-coin.com/Being from the UK - if the launch of Sterlingcoin goes well on the 20th of this month, then that could well be a digital asset to watch.SLG - Sterlingcoin - http://sterlingcoin.org.uk/  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-creator-ted-nelson-claims-shinichi-mochizuki-469161or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B8B2PHZzEk    OK Thanks. Do we have any volunteers ?
Yes most probably a $pork - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spork   Any sign of Slimcoin or I guess this is now a community effort already ?*Sings* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ahc-oEFQ7k    Only 11,000-ish emails to the known email address for Satoshi as shown in the Bitcoin white paper - https://bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_white_paper - probably being an 'inactive' or abandoned email address? I'd imagine their to be that many emails in a month or so, not including any spam.This inbox was probably nulled many times over. Confusion is what confusion does. Well, mostly uneventful really, thus far.Probably the most interesting accomplishment was in allowing anyone to temporarily view the bitcoin-security posts from the Bitcoin sourceforge mailing list.I learnt some stuff from the early bitcoin-security posts to both discredit and reaffirm my own knowledge and some assumptions made in regards to Tor network usage in Bitcoins early days.Bad hacker vs open sourced info - all quite sad really, although interesting and somewhat entertaining.     Yes. There are a couple of user interface discrepancies in this regard still.The check point error is just that, we need updated checkpoints or automated check pointing built in. Slimcoin probably started updating some seed node stuff for the updated release too. A GMX account can have up to 10 registered and active email alias addresses. So, if it is the actual account then.  EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNLrNFbcevM    Indeed. It has been apparent for sometime that the issues and 'crashes' are just over RAM related exception errors.Hopefully you won't see any crashes at R-Pi levels of RAM now then.  Even windows systems with large RAM seem to be more stable using only the current release, probably as the network, hash rate and block propagation is becoming more stable once again....PoS blocks take a while to confirm and will show as 'ticked' in transactions whilst still being 'staked' in balance, this is even more confusing if you have multiple stakes active. That's possibly what your describing m5j0r ? That's very useful clintar and ofc makes it slightly easier to start mining Boolberry on a vps / cloud servers etc.When some of my affiliate marketing commissions with Digital Ocean add to balance - I'm intending to have a go at building an efficient BBR cloud based beowolf cluster - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster    I don't much care for the pump and dump coins and prefer to support the alt coins that have some innovation or that are actually alternative.I should utilize my trading skills more to try and consistently profit in the alt coin markets, but I don't and mostly just mine and hold the coins that I like best on their merits, such as Slimcoin....ROOT coin (as one example of a future PoB coin) has announced that it will try to implement a technology similar to PoB and Korecoin has also announced that it will look to add PoBA (Proof-of-Burn-Anonymity), which as you will appreciate as a participant in this thread and Slimcoin user should be most interesting to watch!Moreover, my main point being that their is actually increasing developer interest in the PoB concept and that Slimcoin will always remain the original 'stand alone' implementation of Proof-of-Burn - much like Peercoin has spawned many PoS alternatives such as Mintcoin and other coins like Cloakcoin with PoSA (Proof-of-Stake-Anonymity).The likely hood that we will see increasing interest levels and community development for Slimcoin is therefore quite high.I'm someone who spent well over a year mining, trading, researching, testing and promoting Bitcoin in the very early days of this forum - who cashed out at low value to pursue other projects - simply because it was taking longer than I envisaged to really take of - So, don't just delete / sell everything and quit Slimcoin, because that's just no fun whatsoever. OK good to know. The priority being a more stable Slimcoin client wallet that functions as described.If the wallet is stable (again) then I'm certain that more people will get involved with mining and trading Slimcoin once its on a few exchanges.One person can't do everything and this is a centralized development approach anyway. Lets get a stable wallet running and the community will just have to run with it from here. PoB and the economic crypto-experiment presented by Slimcoin is worthy of more research and interest imho, perhaps by university economics, mathematics and computer science departments, for example. Sure. I look forward to see just how PoBA is implemented.The obfuscation of sent transactions does not equal 100% 'true' anonymity and never can.Coin ownership (your balance) and any changes to it at the time of a transaction can be used by an adversary to identify you. Thus, PoS and PoB are perhaps always less anonymous than PoW.However, in terms of the network, the process of PoW mining (in the main and when mining in a pool, for example) is less anonymous than PoS(A) and PoB(A).In other words, the real issue becomes one of ownership and acquisition of the asset, over and above the ability to make anonymous transactions.EDIT: Basically its pointless to be able to make 'anonymous' and obfuscated transactions if an adversary already knows who owns the coins. PoS and PoB make this worse, because future balance increases can be linked more easily to the origin of ownership and/or spending patterns. You get more anonymity, in many respects, by just mining PoW coins over Tor to a new address! The more anonymity provided to all users from the get-go, then the better the anonymity for the entire system. Basically, a functional system (ofc), which is also a total mess i.e. where 'real' transactions get fully 'lost in the noise'.~ Anonymous mining stage via Tor (pools only using .onion addresses) and mining pre-set to connect that way for all users, automated coin mixing on the network and in the wallet by 'default', wallet connectivity only via an anonymity network such as Tor, then PoSA and maybe PoBA - this is the only route I see currently to 'perfect anonymity' with crypto-currency. Last commits by Slimcoin on Github see:https://github.com/slimcoin/slimcoin/tree/master/srcinit.cpp    Added excess orphan block pruning    20 days agomain.cpp    Added excess orphan block pruning    20 days agomain.h    Added excess orphan block pruning    20 days agoShould mostly 'fix' the windows memory exception error.EDIT: https://github.com/slimcoin/slimcoin/commit/afd8ef7e18e17f876f0bc7b44e79ee867f0b3ac1 See:Before Slimcoin went awol he posted an 'untested' fix to github that should mostly resolve this issue. I don't think that anyone has compiled or tested the fix for windows yet.I see the exact same errors with the current release on my windows VPS nodes each with 1 GB RAM, however another PC with 16 GB of RAM is 'stable', although these memory issues are still present ofc.Windows OS below windows 7 is also worse for some reason.I had a PM discussion with Slimcoin about compiling the new code for testing - I suggested that he should compile it - maybe he is re-writing the code base from unity instead ? It is doubtful that he would just abandon Slimcoin. PoB (Proof-of-Burn) was first implemented in Slimcoin: https://slimcoin.orgSlimcoin White Paper: https://slimcoin.org/images/downloads/slimcoin_whitepaper.pdfBitcoinTalk.org thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=613213.0Slimcoin is perhaps one of the most underrated alt coins in regards to its economic model and also its technical implementation as a CPU mining (Dcrypt algo), PoS and PoB coin. However, the Slimcoin network has been somewhat fraught with issues and forks due to being built from earlier versions of both Bitcoin and Peercoin's code base. From a purely technical perspective PoB theory is quite sound.In terms of PoB for anonymity - mining PoB blocks obviously confirms that a wallet has made proof-of-burn transactions i.e. has destroyed coins. Net Burnt coins , Effective Burnt coins , Immature Burnt coins and Decayed Burnt coins are live on the network and this information can easily be used by an adversary to identify which wallet / address actually burnt the coins.Innovative and "new revolutionary technology" features are important with all alt crypto coins and I'll watch this implementation with interest, but without knowing the detail of it, I would say that there are much better ways to provide anonymity.Remember that even PoSA isn't really truly anonymous (yet and if ever) and PoB (even without an 'anonymous' implementation) is still something very new in crypto.Kontinue... Good post.Did anyone test a windows build yet with the devs. last commits ? They should help to fix the RAM issues at least. I can run Slimcoin again on 2x windows vps nodes and provide a build myself if necessary, if we know if that build does fix the RAM exceptions.v0.3.2.0-2-g53d7c33-alpha is the devs last 'official' build ?Anyway, have just got the above client in sync. and currently see a block height of 90540. Boolberry boolberry boolberry.I'd be delighted to put my random skill set to good use and to help wherever possible. You just have to pay attention to the stop signs. The 'truth' is probably so much more complex than we might all imagine. The Cypherpunks built Bitcoin.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=358790.msg8484376#msg8484376"The creation of cryptocurrencies is technically illegal and could be prosecuted under title 18 U.S.C. 336, Sec. 336. which states Whoever makes, issues, circulates, or pays out any note, check, memorandum, token, or other obligation for a less sum than $1, intended to circulate as money or to be received or used in lieu of lawful money of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. However, this statute hasnt been enforced in a published court opinion since 1899, a good sign for the budding currency."Source: http://invisiblemoneydocumentary.wordpress.com/2013/12/29/fincen-on-the-legality-and-classification-of-creating-bitcoins-in-the-usa/ This was actually quite an informative, neutral and impartial documentary for the BBC.Eugene Kaspersky's views on internet anonymity and Tor are quite frankly astonishing. He basically stated that anonymity was a bad thing and that its not related to online safety, privacy or security.~ Everyone should be made aware that the Kaspersky company is currently running Tor nodes! Obviously they are not running them to help with Tor users online annonymity, but most likely for their own commercial gain / insight (at best).See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg8363660#msg8363660"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." - Benjamin Franklin Some do, although it is still used much less frequently than it should be within said organizations and institutions.

Some free / basic Stealthcoin advertising: http://stealthtalk.org/showthread.php?t=12These sites already get a fair amount of hits / traffic from proxy listing websites - probably won't last forever though.Also, supporting the Tor Pluggable Transports project - See: https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/ - with their web badges.  
Good to know.- Indeed. Peer / client networking seems to be OK.- Stealthcoin as of 1.1.1.1 is using Tor 0.2.5.1-alpha-dev - current Tor 0.2.5.6-alpha - offers a bunch of security enhancements.- Tried experimenting with upnp=0 and some other networking settings in the conf. as per. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin - which should be checked to prevent any dns leakage etc. and then hardcoded to what works best for privacy.- It's important to properly acknowledge the Tor Project. See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html.en - although I think your within their remit. It perhaps wouldn't be a bad thing to contact them and to join their mailing list for updates etc. If more folks are aware of your project then they can help with it.- Easy access to Torrc settings can be very important for a users anonymity, privacy and connectivity. Some Stealthcoin users might actually need to add and use Tor bridge nodes for connectivity, for example.Check LongLivedPorts , ExcludeSingleHopRelays and EnforceDistinctSubnets Torrc options from the Tor manual -See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.enThese are potentially useful additions to improve network throughput and connectivity. It would also be possible to create a Tor enclave with some hardcoded nodes using AllowSingleHopCircuits and even AllowSingleHopExits - N.B. that whilst these last options would potentially reduce Stealthcoin client anonymity - if they were only being used by selected hardcoded nodes for additional backbone connectivity then this can really help speed things up. So, perhaps very useful for increasing client mobile connectivity, for example!It is really important to select P2P ORport settings that are Tor Relay and Exit friendly...See: https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node  and  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicyWhilst not essential - doing this will actually provide much more diverse connectivity over Tor - as Stealthcoin will be able to connect through a much wider selection of Tor Relays - automatically. Darkcoin connectivity over Tor is really good because it uses port 9999 which is included in most existing Tor Relays Exit policies by 'default'. Selecting a port commonly associated with another applications networking would also be much more stealth-like....Lastly, please don't try to do much stuff at once and focus on the fundamentals of privacy and anonymity. The rest will follow imho. TBH it was probably way more, as I also bought and sold quite a few as well.

I just didn't make large gains on the digital assets that I once owned.Anyway, lets not send this thread off-base. Installed Stealthcoin on a VPS to take a better look at it.

Any known DNS leaks / Upnp ?Anyway, in terms of networking and Tor this probably already provides better anonymity out-of-the-box than a lot of coins claiming 'advanced' privacy features. If Stealthsend 'works' OK then this could well be a coin to watch I guess.~ Forever the privacy and anonymity issue's of ownership and acquisition with crypto-currency ofc.  Remember that: "Tor" and the "Onion Logo" are registered trademarks of The Tor Project, Inc.Although, Stealthcoin would seem to be just about within their remit - it would be cool to add the above to the OP and on the website though.Any plans of having Torrc options more accessible in a future release ?

"The Darkness" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRYNYb30nxU I'm simply inferring that naming such a project "DarkTor" is perhaps not the greatest idea.Example: http://detector.io/DetecTor.html    "As suggested by Roger Dingledine, renamed software to not include the term Tor, to avoid confusion with official Tor project software. The term DetecTor will continue to be used as the name of the project and the design."Lostinthenoise.   Darknet / Darkweb / Darkmesh"Anything that cannot be indexed by Google"  ~ Again, http://youtu.be/dBtmzY5gcO8?t=18m11sRemember that Tor is : https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html.en Fairly certain that the new commits will fix what is essentially a RAM issue.~ I've seen the EXCEPTION: St9bad_alloc over flows on a system with comparatively low RAM, although a system with 16 GB of RAM appears mostly stable.Has anyone else seen a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library APPCRASH seemingly unrelated to the exception ? Which seems to happen more frequently when solo mining and/or PoS minting using an unlocked wallet ? If your able to reach IP 76.127.202.17 then you should first fully sync the blockchain using the following in slimcoin.conf ; listen=0maxconnections=1connect=76.127.202.17When you are fully synced you should shutdown slimcoin and alter the config. ;listen=1maxconnections=8 (or more)addnode=76.127.202.17addnode=107.181.250.216addnode=107.181.250.217Which should help you to bootstrap more p2p connections to updated nodes.My nodes are not 'official' slimcoin nodes, although these vps servers have good uptime and I will try to ensure that they stay up and running. I've not long finished re-syncing 2 x US hosted vps nodes. You are welcome to try connecting with those;connect=107.181.250.216connect=107.181.250.217...I'll try to capture a random debug crash, slimcoin - I've experienced a few, although things might be more stable now. OMG ~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYXXhn9fMYs   All example torrc configs. have been updated today 16th Aug. 2014.- added current known 'Bad Exit' nodes to ExcludeNodes and some revisions to named servers. Interesting projects, including the Abscond project / I2P (Tor) browser. Good work meeh.I notice your including a couple of potentially useful privacy addons for Firefox and TBB. As always, everyone has to be careful that addons 'default' options do not revert or effect privacy settings already put in place by the TBB to work best with Tor. Anyway;Private Tab - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/private-tab/Random Agent Spoofer - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random-agent-spoofer/   The above reminded me of this:~ http://youtu.be/dBtmzY5gcO8?t=18m28sCoins and notes are just so, 'old world' !   Oh, the irony. Indeed. That's exactly why I personally really like the name. It's a bit alternative, which can make it very memorable. Absolutely nothing wrong with Monero, although it sounds like and means money.Ask yourself does visa, mastercard or amex sound like money? Not really - Its only by association and familiarity of course.Ask them - Do you accept boolberry ? Latest wallet additions are Booltiful !   Keep up the good work.   
Additional : Optional avoid servers list for ExcludeNodes :Tor Entry Nodes run by Kaspersky Labs - See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_LabRO (Romania): kasperskytor01kasperskytor0237.221.162.226Code:kasperskytor01,kasperskytor02,37.221.162.226N.B. These Tor Relays would appear to be kept updated and are actually fast Entry servers.However, as regular Tor users its probably preferable to avoid connections with a commercial 'research' company. They are very likely to be collecting Tor network data and metrics for their own commercial gain i.e. to help improve their products and services and to further protect their customers. Such activities are perhaps not conducive with preserving individual privacy on the internet.So, lets help Kaspersky Labs by reducing our genuine and 'good' Tor traffic to their Relays by avoiding their Tor nodes, perhaps then they will have much less data to sift through to locate the automated 'bad' robots and malicious software that also utilize the Tor network - then we will all be a bit safer on the internet! Please keep this thread on topic and lets focus on trying to improve speed, privacy, anonymity and security for regular Tor users by helping everyone to better understand how Tor works and how we can best utilize Tor to protect ourselves online. Tor can help to protect against traffic analysis and provides improved anonymity and privacy when browsing on the internet.No one should ever consider using Tor or the wider internet for any type of 'illegal' or malicious activity.- "Tor can't help you if you use it wrong!" Never confuse your 'Right to Privacy' with anything else.

The main 'mighty' block of servers have all been running for 107 days approx. (at the time of writing this post), so were started / installed at the same time. They are all utilizing almost 0 bandwidth availability. They are all running Tor 0.2.4.20 (as are many Tor servers) - which is an old version of Tor now known to have a security vulnerability.Furthermore, all of these nodes have the same admin. / contact info. which can be found via http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ The provided admin. contact is for a senior lecturer in computing, security and cryptography at a UK academic institution - yet these Tor servers have not set a list of fingerprints as advised for such a large set of Tor routers. RTM !?See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en" NodeFamily node,node,    The Tor servers, defined by their identity fingerprints or nicknames, constitute a "family" of similar or co-administered servers, so never use any two of them in the same circuit. Defining a NodeFamily is only needed when a server doesnt list the family itself (with MyFamily). This option can be used multiple times. In addition to nodes, you can also list IP address and ranges and country codes in {curly braces}. "and"MyFamily node,node,    Declare that this Tor server is controlled or administered by a group or organization identical or similar to that of the other servers, defined by their identity fingerprints or nicknames. When two servers both declare that they are in the same 'family', Tor clients will not use them in the same circuit. (Each server only needs to list the other servers in its family; it doesnt need to list itself, but it wont hurt.) Do not list any bridge relay as it would compromise its concealment.    When listing a node, its better to list it by fingerprint than by nickname: fingerprints are more reliable."How many Tor servers should one individual or entity operate, from the perspective of privacy and security, without even setting the torrc NodeFamily or MyFamily options ? Perhaps not this many.You might also like to take a look at the administrators .me website - which you can research easily.   Do you realize how much the Tor project developers care about genuine privacy and anonymity on the internet ?Jacob Appelbaum 29C3 Keynote: Not My Department - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNsePZj_YksThe Tor Network [30c3] (with Jacob Applebaum) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJNxbpbHA-IJacob Applebaum: To Protect And Infect, Part 2 [30c3]  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vILAlhwUgIU This.

Which is certainly one of the trickiest things to obfuscate properly. Howto enable an Encrypted DNS when using TBBWhat is DNS ? - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_SystemDNS explained - http://www.opennicproject.org/dns-explained/DNSCrypt : http://dnscrypt.org/ - A tool for securing communications between a client and a DNS resolver.Originally conceived and built by OpenDNS: http://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/ this is perhaps the "last mile" of internet security....For Windows Download: http://dnscrypt.org/dnscrypt-proxy/downloads/ and https://github.com/Noxwizard/dnscrypt-winclient1. Create a new folder named dnscrypt.2. Extract the above .zip's : dnscrypt-proxy-win32-full-1.4.0.zip and dnscrypt-winclient-master.zip3. Copy the contents of dnscrypt-proxy-win32 into > your dnscrypt folder i.e. the bin , includes and plugins folder(s).4. Copy the contents of bin into dnscrypt.5. Copy dnscrypt-winclient.exe into your dnscrypt folder from dnscrypt-winclient-master > dnscrypt-winclient-master > binaries > Release6. Add a shortcut to dnscrypt-winclient.exe to your desktop and start it.7. Tick box / Select your correct internet network adapter and select an appropriate DNS server from the drop down menu / tabs.N.B. plugins don't function fully just yet.8. Done now your using an Encrypted DNS.This makes it even harder for your ISP and other potential adversaries to 'identify' your Tor browsing activities.The 'default' list of servers included in dnscrypt-resolvers.csv can mostly be referenced here: http://www.opennicproject.org/DNSCrypt (and other OpenNIC servers) status: http://wiki.opennicproject.org/Tier2 Most addons for TBB are unnecessary in terms of their ability to increase your privacy or anonymityAdblock Plus and Adblock Edge (with easy privacy lists) are probably useful for most users. It will certainly make browsing faster by blocking ads and tracking elements.Filter subscriptions for Adblock Plus and Adblock Edge are updated automatically when you are browsing or if you restart Firefox - if you don't disable this option. You can find settings to control automatic updates via Tools > Add-ons > Extensions > Options. It would probably be best to set automatic updates to 'off' and to manually update your lists via 'Filter Preferences...' when you deem that necessary.Adblock Plus and Adblock Edge also log 'Count filter hits', although this is only a local setting, it should probably be switched off. Interestingly enough this option is 'unticked' in a default install of Adblock Edge. I have not used Cryptocat in a while. Their was a discussion somewhere that it might be implemented as a 'default' Add-on in the TBB. If you install it then check all settings and options etc.In terms of Add-ons the Tor advisory is really in relation to Plug-ins.See: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en"Want Tor to really work?... c. Don't enable or install browser pluginsThe Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into the Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy. The lack of plugins means that Youtube videos are blocked by default, but Youtube does provide an experimental opt-in feature (enable it here) that works for some videos. ..."Shockwave Flash and JavaScript are the worst for totally breaking your anonymity. If you enable Shockwave Flash for youtube (for example) then you might as well not be using Tor. Shockwave Flash installed on your local machine basically reveals your true IP to any Flash enabled website....A 'plugin' that is OK to install would be the CAcert.org Certificate Signing Authority PEM. See: https://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3Installing this will allow you to visit websites that use CAcert.org Certificates without seeing any 'errors'.For example, I run several web based proxy services that use this Certificate Signing Authority.One of which can be found here: [proxy closed] - whilst Glype proxies are only one-hop server proxies and Tor certainly provides much better privacy and anonymity - combining Tor and an SSL enabled web proxy for certain browsing activities can massively increase your 'security'. My site has a 4096-bit SSL cert. (the highest level of website encryption - most sites only have 2048-bit SSL maximum - just inspect a few websites SSL Certs. in your browser, the current bitcointalk.org cert. is 2048-bit with the root cert. only being 1048-bit, for example - which is actually very common) - Anyway, browsing http web pages through this site over an SSL (https) connection and over the Tor network will add 4096-bit encryption across all of your Tor circuits. That makes for very very strong anonymity, privacy and security - ofc the reduction / offset is that it's quite slow.The added benefit of doing something like this is that the websites that you visit won't know your using Tor and won't see your connection as a Tor Exit node. Also, in terms of server logging (which most web servers do automatically) my service does not know your real IP address because your using Tor, which is also really perfect....DEFCON.19.Moxie.Marlinspike.SSL.And.The.Future.Of.Authenticity - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmj_xe7EIQIts a real shame that Convergence hasn't been updated to work with the latest version of Firefox.

Original - xeronet Torrc - v3.6.3 - 'Anti-FiveEyes' - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg3551345#msg35513452. xeronet Torrc - v3.6.3c (a) - combined censorship resistant version - includes some US and CA Exit servers - probably faster than the above torrc.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg4570984#msg45709843. xeronet Torrc - v3.6.3f - 'fastest' version - includes 'Five-Eyes' Exit and Entry Servers.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg4959371#msg49593714. Bitcoin (crypto currency example torrc) with the addition of port number 8333 added to LongLivedPorts etc. and including avoid nodes with safer P2P connectivity.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg6677546#msg6677546- If your downloading a fresh Tor Browser Bundle v3.6.3 which is strongly advised for a recent bug fix then you must bootstrap fully to the Tor network at least once before importing (copying) any one of the example config's into your torrc. Otherwise you will probably experience connectivity issues. So, use the blank 'default' torrc once until your see the Firefox TBB window and then shutdown to add / test the conf (torrc).Various updates have been made to the example config's including:- the removal of retired (previously recommended) servers.- the addition of some new fast servers from highly 'privacy focused' organizations.- updates to the avoid list of known 'bad' exit nodes.- added UseNTorHandshake 1 (see above post) and the Tor manual ofc.- removed Western Sahara - {eh} from the avoid countries list as it is not currently assigned in GeoIP and Tor can't read it.- https://calyxinstitute.org seems to have moved its server's / IP's back to the US from NL (except for their Tor mail server IP, guess that is harder to move!?)  ...Again, these are all just example configs to help empower all Tor users. Everyone should learn to edittheconfig !...Additional tips for safe browsing:Install Adblock Edge (now recommended over Adblock plus) and disable JavaScript  !!!See howto: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg4410668#msg4410668Cheers!- Next updates to include optional avoid lists for Tor servers known to be run by educational establishments and/or institutions known to be collecting Tor 'metrics' or doing 'research'. Such factors are perhaps not ideal for ensuring individual privacy online.For example, it can be noted that the PlanetLab - See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PlanetLab has recently started running a bunch of Tor servers, along side their 'transparent' proxies in multiple .edu facilities in various countries around the erm... globe.  - http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/   A very interesting research paper, which is 100% genuine and can also be found via its original sources.See: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-incentives-research-roundup-goldstar-par-braids-lira-tears-and-torcoinAs a Tor Relay operator myself, I will follow this with interest. You do know how much the Tor developers care about their project and internet privacy and anonymity in general ? Right ?The Tor Network [30c3] (with Jacob Applebaum) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJNxbpbHA-INot my department [29c3] - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mnuofn_DXwJacob Applebaum: To Protect And Infect, Part 2 [30c3] - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vILAlhwUgIU Your welcome darkproton. Thank you for your support....Remember that the Tor network's anonymity relies as much on its users as the Tor software itself.Imagine if everyone on the planet ran a Tor Relay! This would provide much better protection against 'traffic analysis' for everyone.Personally, I've run a Tor Relay on and off for years from my 'home' network and also from various VPS servers, without issue.No one should have any 'fear' about running a Tor relay! Just choose good default ports (9001 and 9030 are good, because they won't effect your regular internet traffic) and block 'bad' traffic with Peer Guardian (linux) or PeerBlock (windows) by using up-to-date lists from www.iblocklist.com - In PeerBlock you can actually Alllow IP's i.e. https://www.iblocklist.com/lists.php?category=organizations "The Onion Router" - thus blocking known bad traffic, whilst still allowing Tor traffic.So, what are you waiting for ? Go and run a Tor Relay and run cloakcoin through Tor 24/7. Their have been some 'issues' with the Tor network recently.See:  https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attackWhich is partly why I've posted to say that I've updated my cloakcoin .onion nodes to Tor version 0.2.4.23You still get much better anonymity using Tor than only being connected via the regular internet or even a VPN. The Tor dev's are working hard to maintain the network and to fix some other 'bugs'. Updated my cloak .onion dual stack Tor nodes to the latest version of Cloakcoin. All is well thus far. Quite impressive actually.See howto: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=637704.msg7517890#msg7517890Tor hidden_service nodes are running the latest version of Tor.DNS requests are encrypted with DNSCrypt: http://dnscrypt.org/ to various OpenNIC 'no logging' servers: http://www.opennicproject.org/- Get encrypted DNS folks it's 'the last mile'.

Ronald J Deibert at TEDxTorontohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAJ6BtZDhUkPublished on Apr 27, 2013"Ron Deibert is professor of Political Science, and Director of the Canada Centre for Global Security Studies and Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto. The Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary research and development "hothouse" working at the intersection of the Internet, global security, and human rights. He is a co-founder and a principal investigator of the OpenNet Initiative and Information Warfare Monitor projects. Deibert was one of the founders and (former) VP of global policy and outreach for Psiphon."Well worth 20 mins. of anyone's time interested in this thread / topic. All 'pre-snowdon' as well. Indeed. All vital additions for 'true' internet privacy. Perhaps a contradiction in terms, still Satoshi seems to manage it OK, so it must be possible !?!  " This Address Space is Unallocated " / Unknown    Using Encrypted DNS provides increased privacy and security against an adversary tracking your internet requests, including your ISP.Usually your DNS resolver is provided by your ISP and requests are sent in plain text to these servers, even if the requested server is using SSL / https etc.See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_SystemYou can think of an Encrypted DNS as being much like https instead of http i.e. its much more secure.To get this running on windows you can find and download these files from the links I posted above;- dnscrypt-proxy.exe- dnscrypt-resolvers.csv (a list of 'open source' encrypted dns enabled servers to connect with)- dnscrypt-winclient.exe (which runs dnscrypt-proxy.exe with a simple GUI and dropdown menu to get it working)Place those files in a folder and send dnscrypt-winclient.exe as a shortcut to your desktop.Using DNScrypt will automatically route all of your DNS requests through the dns proxy via your PC's localhost ( i.e. 127.0.0.1 ) port 53 (dns) to 443 (server) etc.~ Whilst applications such as adblock , noscript etc. will help to protect you against end-point tracking they do not provide any protection against way-point tracking (i.e. traffic analysis), such as snooping or logging by your ISP, VPN or an internet backbone intercept point.Using Tor does help to protect against way-point tracking (i.e. to prevent traffic analysis) and adding an Encrypted DNS into the mix will help further to prevent the above entities from tracking your connectivity to the Tor network, for example, as well as to other internet services. One of the main issues with using Tor is that Tor traffic (and Tor servers) are very easy to detect. Via the meta data its very easy for an adversary to say "you are using Tor", they may not be able to gather information about your requests though of course. In short, using an Encrypted DNS makes it increasingly difficult for an adversary to track or monitor you.- We should look forward to an internet that is owned and controlled by the people (the many) and not by the few (corporations and governments) who increasingly exploit our data to maintain their position and control. For now, we must all use the tools that exist."First they gather YOUR data, then they sell it back to you!" - Its YOUR data, they should be paying you to both collect and to use it ! Indeed. Good to know that you got it up and running again OK.Yes. You can of course attempt to 'Torify' any application by pointing it to your localhost ( i.e. 127.0.0.1 ) 9150 whilst the TBB is running.The TBB now starts Tor directly and also closes Tor when you close TBB Firefox (which I agree is far from ideal).It is possible to get a standalone Tor client running without using the TBB, although this does require some more technical knowledge of Tor.If your running Tor 24/7 for your Bitcoin client mostly and not really using Tor for browsing the internet - then you should probably investigate how to set-up and run as a Tor Relay, as you actually get slightly increased anonymity that way.Additional: I'd also recommend setting-up and running an Encrypted DNS as this makes it much harder for an adversary to track your connections when you bootstrap to the Tor network itself.Here is a post I made with the links: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=705746.msg8073451#msg8073451 - There is a Mac version of the DNS crypt client.  Here is the "Web 3.0" we seek: https://thefnf.org/~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx93WJPCCGsIn the meantime - I'd also recommend using an encrypted DNS i.e. the last 'secure' mile of "Web 2.0".'Invented' by OpenDNS, although now with a growing list of free, open source, no logging alternatives.See: http://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/ and http://dnscrypt.org/See: https://github.com/Noxwizard/dnscrypt-winclient and https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxyJust drop the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv into your dnscrypt-proxy folder.See: http://wiki.opennicproject.org/Tier2 and http://www.opennicproject.org/Of course you still need Tor and a bunch of other anti-tracking solutions where possible. The TBB socks port is now 9150 (instead of 9050).You might find this interesting: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg6677546#msg6677546 (I will try to update this thread soon).I too miss Vidalia - although the new TTB is actually an improvement for regular internet users seeking increased privacy, once you get used to it, imho.However, recent updates have made running a relay or exit node unnecessarily complicated and somewhat difficult to update. I learned some time ago now (and the hard way), that if everything is mostly good from an innovation and technical perspective - that the rest (marketing, mass adoption and investment etc.) will probably follow, although not for sure ofc.Boolberry is some what leagues ahead in terms of privacy and other technical features, when compared to some other coins that are claiming to have these features. I also really like the name. It reminds me of when I used to tell people about Bitcoin and they would say Bitwhat?Alt. coins should be Alternative ! Just got around to taking a proper look at CryptoNote and specifically Boolberry.My conclusion is... it's all about the Boolberry!  CPU mining is working great at  Digital Ocean Most of you will probably already know that you can get $10 free cloud mining with Promotional Code: SSD2014 or OMGSSD10  You will need to use the 1 GB RAM / 1 CPU instance, as a 512 MB RAM instance will truncate when you run minerd.Once you have created a droplet and logged in via SSH / PuTTY (for windows) copy / paste into the terminal...Code:sudo apt-get updateCode:sudo apt-get install libjansson-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libncurses5-dev pkg-config automake yasm git makeCode:git clone https://github.com/cryptozoidberg/cpuminer-multiCode:cd cpuminer-multiCode:./autogen.shCode:./configure CFLAGS="-O3"Code:make...Code:apt-get install screenCode:screenUsing 'screen' allows you to run a separate and virtual (desktop) screen for mining. Just hit the space bar twice to return to the command prompt.Code:./minerd -a wildkeccak -o stratum+tcp://bbr.farm:7777 -u YOUR BBR WALLET ADDRESS -p x -P -D -t 1 -k http://bbr.farm/download/scratchpad.binMinerd should now start mining. You can of course use port 5555 (instead of port 7777) if your server instance has more than 1 CPU. Changing the -t value to the appropriate number of CPU threads.- You must use (press and hold) CTRL + A + D to get out of the screen session. Then type exit and press enter to close the terminal, although continuing mining Boolberry.If you log back in to the terminal type: screen -r and enter to check that your still mining Boolberry.If you need to stop mining Boolberry type: sudo killall minerd and press enter.To restart mining type / repeat only steps:Code:cd cpuminer-multiCode:screenCode:./minerd -a wildkeccak -o stratum+tcp://bbr.farm:7777 -u YOUR BBR WALLET ADDRESS -p x -P -D -t 1 -k http://bbr.farm/download/scratchpad.binFinally, I have a graphical guide here: http://darkproxy.eu/darkcoin-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.php that I posted for darkcoin - when CPU mining was just about still relevant.N.B. DigitalOcean Singapore servers are closer to http://bbr.farm pool (for reduced latency) and Ubuntu 14.04 x64 LTS should be your chosen OS.  - Trying to make myself useful and increase / spread the hash rate. Thanks! Yes. So far so good !The addnode's I posted have seen upwards of 100 connections on each node.Dogecoin logo on the windows installer made me wonder for a moment, although everything else seems to be OK.My single AMD 8950 won't go above intensity 15 - anyway suprnova.cc pool is working perfectly. No - they are set-up to help with network connectivity.Have also added:addnode=fresh.hardcoreminers.comaddnode=fresh.suprnova.ccaddnode=37.59.21.199 I will have 2 VPS nodes running at launch, hosted in Germany.addnode=144.76.142.47addnode=144.76.142.49256 maxconnections on each node should help with connectivity at launch.They will not be permanent nodes, so please prefer any nodes listed in the OP. See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_mean_time"In the United Kingdom, GMT is the official time during winter; during summer British Summer Time (BST) is used.

Correct me if I'm wrong - this is the only alt. coin currently attempting (and seemingly making good progress) on PoS Anonymity / Privacy of any kind ?Even if the scheduled release has some issues and isn't fully working etc. - as long as it can be built / improved upon, then it will make for an important crypto currency milestone.At the current price its probably worth acquiring a few cloak - that's not investment advice, although nothing ventured - nothing gained perhaps. BitcoinFX - "Bringing you tomorrow's technology, today!"  Herewith, 2 Cloakcoin .onion Tor nodes:jm5qligbzm2a5hmn.onion:29662dtqtz4rxwewp4jgh.onion:29662Example Tor cloakcoin.confCode:gen=0socks=5proxy=127.0.0.1:9150maxconnections=8addnode=jm5qligbzm2a5hmn.onion:29662addnode=dtqtz4rxwewp4jgh.onion:29662You can also add the nodes from the OP. Note that the Tor Relay and Exit Bundle's use port :9050 instead of :9150Ensure that: Cloakcoin - Wallet > Settings > Network > Connect through SOCKS proxy: is ticked and restart the wallet.maxconnections=8 is recommended for a good balance between connectivity vs anonymity - obviously the more connections you make through Tor the less anonymous you might be to an adversary. 8 connections is enough to ensure sufficient broadcast of network transactions.If you need a guide on how to get this working - See: http://darkproxy.eu/darknet.php - which is a similar guide for my darkcoin Tor .onion nodes.The following additions will be useful in your torrc file for increased connectivity:Code:ClientOnly 1EnforceDistinctSubnets 0ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0LongLivedPorts 21,22,80,443,706,1863,5050,5190,5222,5223,6523,6667,6697,8080,8300,9001,9030,29662NumEntryGuards 8UseNTorHandshake 1Note that the current 'default' cloakcoin p2p port 29662 has been added to LongLivePorts - which helps a lot with connectivity.I'd recommend that the dev team look to change the port number in a future wallet release to make connectivity more Tor friendly.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=637704.msg7465395#msg7465395Reasons for other suggested settings can be found via the Tor manual - https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.htmlAlso see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg3562794#msg3562794 - which I'll get around to updating sometime.N.B. This is an 'unofficial' - although fully working guide for Cloakcoin connectivity via Tor.The dev teams implementation of Tor into the Clockcoin wallet in future updates will in theory render this guide mostly obsolete.However, having fully functional Cloakcoin .onion addresses is always useful moving forward - especially as the PoSA implementation seems to be making good progress. I'll look to add a further 2 nodes in the next couple of days.Any donations towards upkeep of these Clockcoin .onion nodes would be appreciated: CAXVRFjvddzd9d3QTaxTY6zbTZbgX1shHGCheers! This ... and especially point 5 !I once provided some example Tor configs to the Guardian Project in an attempt to help to reduce latency and lag when using Mumble / VoIP over the Tor Network.See: https://guardianproject.info/2013/01/31/anonymous-cb-radio-with-mumble-and-tor/Here is an example of how this might be done: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.0It is possible to almost eliminate lag if all parties have specially highly configured Tor relays and also have the Torrc set to use only '1 hop' enabled Tor nodes - which also seriously reduces your anonymity.So, fully functional video and voice calls over Tor (utilizing crypto-currency p2p protocols) - that's hilarious ! - This technology is probably at least 5 to 10 years away - Its not just about networking protocols or code - Its about a network fundamental i.e. speed. I missed mining Cloakcoin at release as I've been busy the last weeks - nvm - however I'm still interested in this coin and support genuine anonymity projects.Its important to choose a good networking port for use with Tor.Most established Tor Exit / Relays use a reduced exit policy.See: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicySee: https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-nodeAn additional option is to ensure that their are a sufficient number of dedicated Clockcoin .onion Tor hidden_service nodes running as dual stack p2p nodes i.e. on 'clearnet' and also within the Tor network.Most of this: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea is still very much applicable when using any p2p related protocol over Tor !I've described in several posts in this forum how a 'Tor enclave' of dedicated nodes can be created for the benefit of crypto coins. This is a good alternative in providing additional Tor nodes (and bandwidth), instead of effectively 'clogging' or bloating the Tor network / nodes with 'unnecessary' p2p traffic.Anyway, I can offer to add up to 4 dedicated Clockcoin .onion hidden_service addresses into the mix (on existing Tor relays) for folks cloakcoin.conf etc.Any available bounties ?    Do you have plenty of free CPU and RAM on those PC's when your staking the wallet ?

I've only being mining with the wallet thus far - apart from a few hours test in the temporary pool.Again, I did see accepted shares with the slimminer in the temporary pool.~ Are you mining via linux machines only ? No. Did you delete the slimminer folder C: > cygwin64 > home > 'account name' > slimminer  ?Try doing that and start again in case something got borked. Yep. Its still not working.I was seeing accepted shares from sandor111's temporary pool the other day, so its not slimminer.Let me check all of my settings - think the code is missing something - might be me being daft though.

Although, its not working with the current release.slimcoin probably did this intentionally to help prevent and limit the effectiveness of botnets at launch.Slimcoin is built from an original release of Peercoin and has some 'missing' functions.

Notes for building a static binary with MinGW are included on the Git page: https://github.com/siklon/slimminerGetting a fully working 64-bit MinGW build environment on windows is tricky in comparison to using Cygwin. Some recent updates have also changed the directory locations slightly, I think.Anyway you can search for something like " Compile minerd x64 MinGW Windows Guide Howto " etc. and have fun with that.Someone will be kind enough to post some static pre-compiled windows binaries I'm sure. One was posted earlier in the thread, although I noticed that the siklon/slimminer repo has been extensively updated around 10 hours ago, presumably to work optimally with the new pool.I'll try to post up a working guide as its always best to do your own compile to get optimized binaries for your chip-set.Anyway, I'm interested in building a more optimized version of slimminer, although I'm fairly busy with some other stuff at the moment. Great stuff !Here's the windows guide that I posted earlier in the thread to build your own optimized slimminer for sandor111's pool:You can find information on your chip-set to improve mining performance (when compiling slimminer) using CPU-Z - http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.htmlFor example, for best performance with an i7 with AVX support : Code:CFLAGS="-O3 -march=corei7-avx" ./configure Great stuff! Its really good to see all of the dedicated Mintcoin supporters very active in this thread and the progress thats being made.I have some changes in my personal life that are keeping me very busy at present, but I'm looking forward to being more involved with Mintcoin again in the coming months.The automated payments system for the @FreeMintcoin twitter account got 'stuck' whilst I've been busy. However, I've just tweeted and will update and catch-up on the requests for all Free Mintcoin.I also offered to do a new promo. via https://mywl.lt when Mintcoin was / is added.It looks like Mintcoin was recently selected - not sure if its been added yet, but I'll commence with the new promo. over the next week or so.Still holding a good number of Mintcoins, Minting and multi-pool mining 24/7 ofc  Keep up the good work all !
Indeed. The PoS reward seems to be a bit insane - I put it down to a low number of folks staking at first, although on my most recent sync. its certainly much higher than 10% or a 'multiple of' in the code is wrong.I'm not the best of coders, but I'll get around to checking the current repo. and finding what the actual values are vs the published values etc.Ofc this might mean that the coins distribution is actually a real mess and will cause issues with further adoption / use.A basic review of the code and a working block explorer are the priority I think. tertius993 and noise23 ...What would you suggest your additional funds being used for ?Increasing bounties ?

I've not brought a single coin. Not complaining here, its just a discussion. I believe that a new PoB block can only be generated after a new PoW block, or possibly a PoS block. Then the % 'weighted' chance of PoB.I have just under 1000 'burnt' coins now in total myself. Not sure if I will continue burning coins much past 1250 or 2500 max. depending on the difficulty increases when a PoW pool is online. This will give my wallet a reasonable % chance at PoB generation whilst I continue to mine PoW and allow the wallet to effectively switch over to PoS in 30 days and onwards.I'm unsure for long-term, but I don't think I'm prepared to burn many more coins over the short-term in this experiment, which may of course be a long-term mistake. Although this could make for a nice retirement fund perhaps. How about lets not.  Some folks must just have to much 'money to burn'.  "Greed is bad, very very bad".- Hopefully good progress is being made with a PoW pool though.I can see this coin becoming quite valuable in time with its fast reducing money supply. Rarity vs scarcity - supply and demand and all that.Guessing that well over 1/2 to 2/3rd's of the total money supply will be 'burned' into the either that is PoB. Well, if slimcoin (the dev.) doesn't return - I guess we can wait to see if PoS will restart the network by itself !   src/main.h   Code:static const int STAKE_MIN_AGE = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7; // minimum age for coin agestatic const int STAKE_MAX_AGE = 60 * 60 * 24 * 90; // stake age of full weightAnyway, jokes aside, I think this is probably something to do with checkpoints being used from Peercoin (or a similar type of issue).This happened with Emercoin where the network couldn't accept PoW past a fixed block / checkpoint. Tried mining in your temporary pool for a while sandor111 and it seemed to be working OK.  Here's how windows users can compile a more optimized / cpu specific build of slimminer for the main pool when its back up.1 - Download and run Cygwin installer: http://cygwin.com/install.html > 'Cygwin Setup' folder on C:2 - Ensure that you add the following extra packages to the 'default' install from the menu settings window (a few tabs into the install process); devel / gcc-g++libs / libcurl-develdevel / automakedevel / makearchive / unzipnet (web) / wgetdevel / gitnet (web) / openSSL-develRemember to add: "automake: Wrapper scripts for automake and aclocal" - along with the latest auto make release - or slimminer won't compile.3. Start the Cygwin terminal from the desktop shortcut you created at install. Now copy and paste the following:Code:git clone https://github.com/siklon/slimminerCode:cd slimminerCode:chmod +x autogen.shCode:./autogen.shCode:CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ./configureCode:makeCheck for errors during the process, however your minerd.exe (slimminer) should now be built in;C: > cygwin64 > home > 'account name' > slimminer4. You can start mining from the Cygwin Terminal. Ensure that you cd into slimminer dir after starting the terminal window with;Remember to set the correct pool address, port and your own wallet address. You can also add -t 'number of cores'.--scantime 15 (is probably optimal for pool mining) and --retries -1 will try to resubmit shares if the connection drops.  ...To get an optimized build of slimminer for your chipset you need to change -march=native before compiling slimminer.For an i7 : Code:CFLAGS="-O3 -march=corei7" ./configureThose values can be found at: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/i386-and-x86-64-Options.html#i386-and-x86-64-OptionsJust delete everything in the slimminer folder if you want to recompile whilst trying to find the fastest CFLAGS for your chipset.N.B. your miner will be dependent on your cygwin environment and is therefore not a standalone miner, but it will be optimized for your chipset and should certainly be much faster. You can also compile a working 32bit slimminer on windows this way.Good Luck. The richest person on earth is the one who has nothing, yet is content.The wisest person is the one who knows that he knows nothing ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLlwpZQrQUU~ Conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact. This."The Five" are estimated to have personal 'funds' in excess of 65 trillion dollars as 'petty cash' alone.Wake up to who really runs the world folks. Looking at the forbes or times rich list is like looking at who is no.1 in the music industry charts this week and totally ignoring the music industry bosses, i.e. the ones really in control and having much more money.See: http://rense.com/general79/tril.htm or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_GroupThese are the > 0.01% of people that 'own' and have influence over the entire world.

Is Slimcoin an entirely new Economic principal in practice ?Slimcoin is something that is only made possible by the very foundation of crypto currency.Imagine walking into your local bank, tearing up some bank notes of paper currency and then asking the desk clerk for a slightly higher fixed % rate of interest on your savings account because their is now less money in circulation.  That is Slimcoin. Destruction of the existing money supply with the mathematical hope / chance of getting a larger return in the future based on that destruction and in essence what is also a deflationary action.Slimcoin actually helps to test what will happen with Bitcoin in 140+ years when all of the 21 Million Bitcoins are in cirulation and we begin to see the existing money supply deflate, initially creating additional value (in theory) and then the certain very slow decent back down to 0 worth ? Again, I describe the economic principal that 'you cannot trade in diminishing intangibility' - fact.Certainly in our recent history only government institutions and issuing monetary authorities have been involved in the creation and/or destruction of the money supply.See: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/the-destruction-of-money-who-does-it-why-when-and-how/236990/See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creationSee: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supplyI cannot think of another direct example where the destruction of money (or in fact any form of commodity) is directly linked to the creation of new money, without being directly linked to the economic principals of supply and demand / inflation and deflation.I'm no economist - is their a direct term for this - or is this indeed something totally new ?Finally, here is Philomena Cunk on 'Money' from "Moments of Wonder." - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-YKw8w-e50      Well, at least your a senior member of this forum with a slight positive trust rating. Which is better than the alternative, I guess.  PoB pooling is going to be somewhat beneficial in terms of variance and evening out rewards over time.It's perhaps like running an escrow service with 1000 times the responsibility. "Rather you than me" type of thing really.Even if its fully automated its going to be nearly impossible to make it fully trustworthy and decentralized at the same time. Good news!Pools will of course be able to generate PoB blocks if miners are willing to set a % of their mined coins to be 'burnt' into the pool with a fixed % return.This is obviously risky as the pool has to be trusted with a large (centralized) PoB balance, although with PoB the opportunity for this type of pool exists.Also, PoW only pools, PoW and PoB combined pools and even PoB only pools. Its going to get interesting - that's for sure. OK. Thanks slimcoin. Will review the code base and put that into practice.Can anyone else confirm if they found a PoB block with a 'locked' / encrypted wallet perhaps ?The PoS button used in Mintcoin and a few other coins would be a useful feature in Slimcoin I think....Has anyone compiled a x64 version of the miner for an i7 / AVX on windows yet ? I'm thinking I'll try compiling it to see if its much faster. If the wallet is encrypted does PoB minting function without walletpassphrase ? i.e. is it only necessary to unlock the wallet for PoS minting ?

Again, you gotta speculate to accumulate...~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ifNTb1Xx_I   ~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCCzf8PrdjI - would like to thank 'THE FIVE' ... You should now have a number of confirmations on the mined block, so it will eventually be added to your SLM balance. The above text is really a standard notification in regards to how PoW blocks are generated and is much more relevant to coins with lower block times also using fewer confirmations, however this is always applicable to PoW block generation - mostly when solo mining.Trying to solo mine PoW blocks is still well worth the effort. It might take 2 days or more to find a PoW block at the current difficulty, however the overall reward is likely to be much more than if you could mine in a Slimcoin pool for the same duration at present. When pools are set-up for Slimcoin you can expect that their will be even more people mining and the network hash rate will see a big increase, again lowering the PoW block rewards.Building a working pool for Slimcoin requires the technical know-how to get it up and running and working properly. This is a new kind of algorithm / block reward system - thus we are likely to see much fewer, although quality pools being set-up - it will be very similar to how Primecoin pools (and mining) evolved in this regard. People are busy with getting a pool up and running, for sure.Again, its still well worth trying to solo mine a PoW block to get started with PoB.

Burn Hash = multiplier * [Internal Hash] "and" Proof-of-Burn Block Generation Specifics ...Like proof-of-stake block generation, the hashing operation occurs of over a select search space (one hash per burntransaction per proof-of-work block). The hardware required to maintain that hash operation is minimal, thus the energyconsumption and hardware maintenance can be considered to be near none. The block generation of proof-of-burn scaleslinearly, meaning if 200 coins were burned and subsequently generated 10 proof-of-burn blocks over the course of 1 day, itcan be expected that if 40 coins were to be burned, 2 proof-of-burn blocks would be generated over the course of that sameday, assuming the effective burnt coins in the network remained constant. ...

I'm not 100% sure on that. Trying to the match transactions with 'burnt' coins etc.We could use a block explorer ~ looking though the code too. I did just hit a PoB Mined block for 60.96 SLM on the wallet with the screen shots that I've posted earlier.Was burning through the remaining balance with 8 SLM left in balance, so I'm UP when it confirms !  slimcoin - please clarify if spent PoB coins provide any ongoing ROI over time or if once slimcoins are spent (without reward) they are fully spent i.e. 'burnt' ?Somewhere in the thread you described PoB as being similar to buying mining equipment, which of course is not really guaranteed to provide any return on investment over time either. So, is it simply 'luck of the draw' i.e. random ? or does having 'burnt' PoB coins increase PoW etc.- off to read the white paper fully and study the full source code etc.Thanks!

"Mint by burn" Burning through a single 31.74 SLM block that was found on a VPS instance - I've burnt 1 coin every block or so for the last 15 to 20 blocks.No increased balance though either, as of yet. This is related to PoS minting, only if you have encrypted your wallet (I'm currently unsure if this will effect PoB minting)To 'unlock' your wallet for PoS minting goto debug and type:walletpassphrase 'YourWalletPassPhrase' 99999999 trueyourwalletpassphrase = your encrypted pass phrase and 99999999 is just the duration for unlocking the wallet. Gotta speculate to accumulate though, right ! Coolio. How about Max. and Min. coin age ?Does PoB reset staking ?Really should just go and RTM !   P.O.B. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqxZo_myyA    Will be reading the white paper in detail - slimcoin.How about PoB, if 1 SLM is burnt what is the output / variable based on ? In the future, if/when Slimcoins have a 'value', folks are going to be looking at: Net Burnt Coins: x and be saying wow - those are now worth X $$$  Reducing the total money supply will make existing coins in circulation worth more, of course.Keep mining this one - it could pay of really well !
PoB reward is a max. of 250 Slimcoins - So, guessing that it will be from 0 to 250 ? (Need to check the code - busy setting up instances etc.)Not sure at present if PoB has a 'difficulty' as such or is just a luck based variable ? The block reward won't be much below 15 SLM for a good number of PoW blocks, I'm guessing.Well worth trying to mine a block for the PoB reward.~ 520 confirmations required on mined PoW blocks before coins can be spent or burnt. Congrats! Its quite similar to Primecoin in that respect with 50 being the max. PoW block reward and that it reduces with the difficulty.

It will help to give my sites more exposure and increase page rankings - which is also good for Darkcoin promotion ofc. Link please - If it's one of those PoS coins then that's currently very unlikely. Proof-of-Stake with true anonymous transactions would be something special.The top newest alt. coins for myself are Darkcoin and Mintcoin.Anonymous transactions with Darkcoin and an interest bearing / savings account with Mintcoin (hopefully with increasing value as more folks realize its full potential). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEaBqiLeCu0    Darkcoin accepting Flokinet in Iceland is a good choice.

Its also possible to add some settings to improve on circuit build times, to prevent shares being dropped and their is also the option to use Single Hop Relays with ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0 etc. See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html and my other BCT forum post here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.0 - which is a work in progress, although highlights why some torrc settings and recommendations exist....A good few pages back in the thread I posted a list of VPS companies providing privacy and anonymity focused hosting. Anyway, a really good updated list can also be found here: http://www.exoticvps.com/    So, Darksend is upon us - we still need to think about end-to-end privacy and this is something that is mostly up to the end user.Ownership of Darkcoins by the process of mining is still potentially traceable on the blockchain and it is therefore possible for an adversary to identify you at the point of spend. For example;- Registering and mining in a pool could allow an adversary to link your wallet address to your IP address and/or email address to identify you. (Darkcoin pools should implement strong https encryption to help to avoid this - at least 2048-bit or 4096-bit - Self-Signed certs. or even using free certs. like CAcert.org are preferable to having no SSL at all). - When mining in the pool you are identifiable as being in a sub-set of user accounts due to the tcp http pool address and info. being sent in plain text.- P2pool users addresses are shown by 'default' and should at least be obfuscated on a pools static pages.- Changes in a Darkcoin wallet balance at the point of spend could potentially be used to link a transaction to a purchase, given the above.Darksend obviously makes these examples much more difficult for an adversary to establish and is an improvement on Bitcoins blockchain technology in terms of a users privacy and anonymity.What we need next is to implement Dark mining.This can actually be done already by using existing privacy tools and by making all Darkcoin users more aware of what they can do as a community. We also need to develop some new tools to make this as easy as possible for all Darkcoin users. In fact, the more people that adopt these techniques the better:"you can't be anonymous by yourself" !A good way to go about this would be to build and use P2pool's running as dual stack nodes through Tor network .onion addresses.Setting minerd or sgminer to use this type of pool correctly and efficiently is already possible with existing tools and some know how.The host system should ideally be connected to a VPN with Tor running through it. The user should create a new dedicated wallet.Linux users could use proxychains - http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/ - http://proxychainsgui.sourceforge.net/ to route traffic via the Tor network.Windows and Mac users could use ProxyCap - http://www.proxycap.com/ - or 'Proxifier' - http://www.proxifier.com/Here is an example of minerd running directly through Tor on the localhost machine via 'Proxifier'. Proxifier > Profile >Proxy Servers:Address:Port : TypeProxification Rules:Applications: minerd.exe or sgminer.exeTarget Hosts: as P2pool address or .onion addressTarget Ports: as P2pool portAction: Proxy from Proxy Servers i.e. Tor on localhost (127.0.0.1) Socks5 (9150 TBB or 9050)Name Resolution: Proxifier DNS Settings: Resolve hostnames through proxy (only i.e. Tor) to avoid DNS leaks.... Paid for solutions are obviously not ideal in terms of a users privacy. If I'm not mistaken the original stand alone Stratum protocol had support for Tor / Proxy connectivity ?? using;  --socks PROXY - Use socks5 proxy for upstream Stratum connection, specify as host:port  --tor - Configure proxy to mine over Tor (requires Tor running on local machine)However, windows (particularly version 7) is notoriously bad at forwarding and has issues with DNS leaks etc. This is something to implement fully into new (free) darkcoin mining tools across all platforms....Initial testing has shown that any loss of accepted shares / work etc. is in fact almost completely negligible with out-of-the-box settings. However, their are some tricks and configurations, both server side and client side, that can be implemented to increase throughput and connectivity.New P2pool's running on Tor .onion addresses is the first requirement. I'm OK with doing the node hosting and Tor set-up if any experienced Darkcoin P2pool operators want in or to help implement this. Just waiting for Darksend to officially kick-in and for the latest P2pool code to be trusted as stable pending the fork. Anyone else with good knowledge of tcp http address obfuscation and scrubbing ? This is becoming quite unrelated to darkcoin, but some of the commentators and their 'facts' are quite amusing really. A pizza was certainly not the first thing to be purchased with Bitcoin, not even publically perhaps. I've forgotten more than I can or care to remember.Darkcoin is really important in terms of creating a more 'anonymous' digital e-cash (making good progress) - and not for illicit or illegal purposes either - but simply to equal the anonymity provided by cash or paper money, although for our online digital lives.Watch the video posted on NewLibertyStandard in 2009 " Privacy and Money " - http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/video/7769399/Privacy+and+Money or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTRFuWtxawM This is certainly not a 'crazy' person. Such progress and yet such a long way to go.EDIT: Additional - Cash is likely to remain more anonymous than any form of digital currency for a long time imho. There is always the issue of ownership and acquisition with all forms of money. However, the current economic system is undoubtedly broken, corrupt and failing. Decentralized crypto-currency is at least a step forward. In terms of online transactions - speed, privacy, security and anonymity - pick any 3.I'm just another random guy from the internet really.~ Maybe there is a light at the end of a dark tunnel - oh yeah - It's a big train coming the other way!   I was one of the very first Bitcoin miners and earliest bitcointalk.org forum members. I found Bitcoin when doing extensive internet searches on e-currency.I mined with an ASUS Terminator A7VT - which had a single core Sempron processor - it was faster at mining than my other tech. due to having a VIA KM266 chip-set with some very basic on board crypto acceleration. I mined 24/7 for several weeks / months. I remember solo mining loads of 'extra' 50 BTC blocks on an Asus 700 EeePC laptop in an afternoon for 'fun'. The difficulty was obviously very low and their was also only about 10 to 20 nodes in total at most for a good few weeks.NewLibertyStandard had an exchange to PayPal - See: http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+Rate (that's a wiki page of the actual site!) and calculated the exchange rate with an electricity meter. I also ran a manual exchange for LR <> BTC for a while.I'd sold, traded or exchanged all my mined BTC well before they were worth $0.50 and decided to pursue some other projects in the period just before graphics cards and pool mining - I also left due to some personal reasons. One of the last things I did was donate 500 BTC to Gavin's Faucet - which I almost kept in cold store instead.  I didn't have a good enough graphics card and some server companies had started to use massive CPU farms - their were no pools - so I couldn't mine anymore. The rest is history. I'm certainly not a rich guy.As for forum members by user name - you can search in chronological order pretty much. 3rd darkcoin themed web proxy is now live!- http://www.darkproxy.net - with cloudflare caching - https://ssl.darkproxy.net - Comodo 2048-bit SSL (no cloudflare on https) - USA hosted.- http://darkproxy.eu - hosted in Romania - 4096-bit SSL by CAcert.org - for browser root certs.

It will be much simpler for developers to include this type of function into non-PoS coins.In terms of Alt. coins, Mintcoin and Darkcoin are perhaps two of the main and most important coins looking forward, imho.Mintcoin - a pure PoS 'energy saving' coin that serves as an interest bearing / savings account.Darkcoin - an energy efficient PoW algorithm and true 'anonymous' transactions, when Darksend is fully implemented.

See: http://www.proxynoid.com and the widget at the base of the page including the bold listing. In the next week or so, I'll be adding a bold listing at proxy.org - i.e. mass traffic....Any master nodes operators that can add darkcoin .onion connectivity and let me know the .onion address for the website?  I sent ziplibrary a PM about a potential server side security issue on the exchange and they patched it very fast.  Received my Sharecoins a few days ago and have purchased 3 FeeShares on the exchange.Looking good, keep up the good work!...I'd like to see MINT added to the exchange, as I think it could be extremely popular in the near future with very good trade volume.Also, new Libertycoin (if the distribution / pool payouts are OK) and Version [V] if it gets an update and a new lease of life.  P2pool is always the better option when its available. So,http://p2poolcoin.com:8877http://coins.hashfaster.comI can confirm that I've received payments from http://coins.hashfaster.comEDIT: and have ceased mining this coin for now.~ Will be interested to see how Libertycoin progresses in light of the malicious pools.  Lowendbox has some reasonable options. Some alternatives;http://www.orangewebsite.com/vps.php - accepts Bitcoin - hosted in Icelandhttp://www.ccihosting.com/vps.php - accepts Bitcoin - hosted in Panamahttp://www.anonymoushosting.in/vps.php - hosted in the Netherlandshttp://www.yohost.org/offshore-hosting.html - accepts Bitcoin - hosted in the Netherlandshttp://www.securehost.com/dedicated-servers/ - hosted in The Bahamas and Bermudahttp://www.cinipac.com - accepts Bitcoin - various locations including Iceland and Romaniahttps://www.1984hosting.com/ - hosted in IcelandMost of these companies have been in business for a good while and have competitive pricing.They should really consider accepting Darkcoin ! Try following this guide for cloud mining, as well as mining with your PC: http://www.darkproxy.net/darkcoin-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.php   I'm not really super smart and sadly I have some time constraints at present. I'm not that good of a coder either and mostly do networking stuff. I am making progress on some dark mining protocols off the existing P2pool software, but I couldn't take on a bounty for that deadline or even help with it at the moment due to having some other obligations.   I guess that depends if your a business or a hobbyist ?  Again, a secondary static IP address, encrypted DNS, VPN (optional) and I reckon your set - If you decide that running a Darkcoin master node is right for you as an individual.- People get paranoid about running Tor relays, for example, I've run one from my 'home' network 24/7 for around 2 years without having any issues whatsoever.The thing about 'anonymity' projects is that any log keeping actually makes you more liable to revealing those logs. Not keeping any logs and having no knowledge of any processed transactions or data is probably beneficial, perhaps over storage of the Bitcoin blockchain, for example. This is obviously dependent on your jurisdiction.I'll be running Peerblock and/or Peer Guardian with some free and paid lists from iblocklist.com - in an effort to prevent my relay / node from being used by any 'bad' actors.At last you can present that you are running your node in the interest of internet privacy and anonymity, as oppose to supporting any criminal activity and in fact put measures in place to prevent such activities, where possible.Darkcoin is potentially the 'anonymous' eCash that Bitcoin claimed to be. In fact, using cash is still potentially more 'anonymous' than using Darkcoin! It's probably going to be the cheapest option too. Linux Box with a 2nd IP on your existing provider.DNSCrypt - http://dnscrypt.org/ and compatible DNS - https://dnscrypt.eu/ - http://wiki.opennicproject.org/Tier2Riseup.net VPN - https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn+1000 DRK = Done. www.earnforex.com/forex-vps-hosting/ has a useful list of forex vps hosting companies, which you would hope have reliable up-time and reasonable 'default' security, although the focus is mostly on windows for use with the MT4 platform. Lower prices though.bosonvps.com has very cheap linux servers which are reseller packages for privatelayer.com - for the Switzerland hosted option. I've had very mixed success with bosonvps though, although privatelayer.com itself is OK.Best bet is to track reseller packages to the source and check the T's and C's, although all non-us VPS are still much more costly.Their is a good list of Tor friendly VPS servers somewhere on the web.Another option (perhaps the best choice imho) would be to host the node on a home server and ask your existing provider for a 2nd static IP address for a game server or something, then exit that through a good VPN provider perhaps. Their is a lot to be said for owning and having access to the physical equipment for your master node.If I find a good option or two I'll post them up, but it certainly makes no sense for everyone to be using the same cloud resources. Yeah. Kind of cool isn't it. This is the stuff that gets forgotten about.The following will work as well, although not with all browsers...http://3225440618 - Decimal IP'shttp://0xc040516a - Hexadecimal IP'shttp://0xc0.0x40.0x51.0x6a - technically a dotted Hexadecimal IPhttp://0300.0100.0121.0152 - dotted Octal IP'sYou can add loads of 0's to dotted Octal IP quads, for example;http://000000300.00000000000100.0000121.0000000152It's also possible to mix and match the correctly ordered quads of dotted hexadecimal and dotted octal IP'shttp://0300.0x40.0x51.0152  or  http://0xc0.0100.0121.0x6aYou can also try adding 'fake' authentication to help bypass web filters etc. For example,http://darkcoinstodamoon@0300.0100.0x51.0x6a - (no I'm not trying to trick you), basically everything before the @ symbol is ignored.~ Always check that the static IP address has not changed - or you might end up 'pinging' the pentagon or something! It's a bit like using http://0xc0.0x40.0x51.0x6a (Hexadecimal IP) to resolve http://darkproxy.net    It would be good to get Version updated and revived if possible.StayCrypto dev. is listed on the mintcoin.cc website as offering protocol support to the Mintcoin project.I'm wondering if someone might have contact with StayCrypto still ? Lots of bugs in new TBB release 3.6... EDIT: fixed by the Tor project developers in the v3.6.1 release of the TBB.It seems that GeoIP in TBB 3.6 is mis-configured to be located in a sytem folder in windows 7, for example."[WARN] Failed to open GEOIP file C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\tor\geoip6.  We've been configured to use (or avoid) nodes in certain countries, and we need GEOIP information to figure out which ones they are.The following torrc setting is ignored:GeoIPFile C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\Tor Browser\Data\Tor\geoipCheck "Copy Tor Log to Clipboard" for additional errors when starting TBB.Configs. I've posted still work if you exclude GeoIP country settings for ExcludeNodes and ExcludeExitNodes.Can't really post updated configs. until its 'fixed'. Sent several bug reports. Good suggestion to be put to the folks at the Tor Project.There are some existing addons for Firefox to change User Agent string, although not currently to the most common ones. Your welcome!Most folks here should also be able to get the $200 Windows Azure 'free trial' offer.You can mine on 2 x 8-core servers for a week or so until all your trial credit is used up.  Here's a youtube guide someone posted for quark: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg0XOverro0
Good job! A very useful Darkcoin guide.I'll put a link up from the cloud mining guide on my darkproxy.net website in the next day or so.See: http://www.darkproxy.net/darkcoin-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.php  or  https://ssl.darkproxy.net/darkcoin-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.php Indeed. Thanks.I don't claim full credit for the guide though, as I've only expanded upon a blog post by kvvs, adding some more detailed screen shots and updating some settings / info. etc. ...See: https://darkcointalk.org/threads/cloud-mine-darkcoins.349/Again, credit to kvvs - so please donate some Darkcoins and choose either sign-up link - with a coin flip. ...When the Darkcoin master nodes stuff is a bit more finalized I'll look to write a detailed set-up guide.Howto lock down security settings, the best server locations and choice of VPS provider are all going to be important factors.A list of hosting providers who are already known to be Tor friendly will be very useful.Hoping to earn enough Darkcoins through this website to host my own master node or two.Some initial profits will go towards funding some extra dedicated connectivity nodes for Tor and I2p support - 6 nodes in total - 2x Tor (only) , 2x I2p (only), 2x Tor and I2p for chaining both networks. My darkproxy.net website now has an easy cloud server mining guide to help folks new to crypto get started with mining some Darkcoins.See: http://www.darkproxy.net/darkcoin-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.php or https://ssl.darkproxy.net/darkcoin-cpu-cloud-mining-guide.phpI've also started working on a pseudonymous Darkcoin mining protocol which will allow P2pool mining via Tor .onion's or a secure VPN tunnel.~ Full promotion of darkproxy.net commences from this weekend. By Nov. 2014 the site aims to be serving well over 2TB+ of traffic avg. per. week / month.Expect lots of residual hits to the Darkcoin project website.    Great improvement over the existing website design.It also matches my free web based proxy / promo sites template: http://www.darkproxy.net and https://ssl.darkproxy.net...Whilst I'm here - can I recommend / suggest that the Darkcoin project and the community supports the Reset The Net initiative by Fight For The Future.Watch: http://youtu.be/qKk8MHFLNNESee: https://www.resetthenet.org/ - Reset The Net, before June 5th, 2014 - #ResetTheNet You can support this initiative via Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr by linking the Thunderclap.it app to your accountSee: https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/10619-reset-the-net/This will potentially bring alot of interest to Darkcoin and its also a very worthwhile campaign in terms of promoting Internet Privacy.BitcoinTalk.org forum thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=573931.0Cheers! Yes. Sunabōzu - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Punk   Sings: "... where did all, their money go, tell em we don't know" ! - http://youtu.be/TPKQSQSVVos   Let innovative coin features and the markets decide.

New Darkcoin themed - darkproxy.net is now up and running.Anyone using this type of web based proxies should also have an interest in a privacy-centric crypto-currency such as Darkcoin.  http://www.darkproxy.net https://ssl.darkproxy.netThe http homepage is currently serving a single on-click pop-under ad per. browser session for darkcoin.ioMost privacy and security users here will want to browse via the SSL website, as the http homepage is accelerated by cloudflare and has caching enabled, whereas the SSL site does not use any caching whatsoever.Any (accessible) websites that won't load may work if you allow Scripts and/or Objects, although this can break your anonymity. bitcointalk.org is actually one good example of a site that won't display properly without scripts. Most youtube videos are working with a new plugin, however for some reason youtube won't proxify fully over SSL - so if your using youtube the http and cloudflare version of the website is really the best option....Also, working towards launching a 'darknet' service for pseudonymous Darkcoin mining either via a VPN / encrypted tunnel and/or Tor (most likely using the one hop circuit option). A darkcoin.conf will also be available for download including .onion Darkcoin nodes for easily connecting your Darkcoin wallet over Tor....darkproxy.net will serve as good promotion for Darkcoin and will be continually submitted to over several 100 proxy listing websites over the coming days / weeks / months.http://youtu.be/JM4Ze5-DPhk     The icon in the task bar of this screen shot is showing the original 'xcoin' logo, which means that your using an outdated version of Darkcoin ?Download the latest darkcoin-qt2.exe from here: http://darkcoin.io/beta.phpHope that helps. The up trend is still fairly strong - using a simple crossover system: EMA 1 Period: 5 and EMA 2 Period: 34 on Poloniex charts 24h with 15-minhttps://poloniex.com/exchange/btc_drk   Could use some more connections - If you have updated to RC1 v0.10.4.0 please add these nodes ...Code:addnode=198.100.127.34addnode=198.100.127.36Thanks! Will do. I'm now the proud owner of darkproxy.net (just registered) which will serve as a general web proxy to help promote Darkcoin, although I intend to introduce some innovative features on the sub-domains. Anyone know if their is a standalone Stratum_Proxy build that supports X11 mining - linux and windows would be useful.Also, is their an existing windows p2pool build for Darkcoin ?Looking to enable Darkcoin mining on a .onion address using p2pool over Tor.Darksend is fine, although it seems logical that the only way to provide more comprehensive anonymity would necessitate being able to mine some Darkcoin pseudonymously and/or via a VPS or proxy / tunnel. Only out of courtesy to Tor network / servers bandwidth really.Although, even with the 2 .onion nodes running it takes a good while to get more than that many connections through Tor.8 connections was the original setting in the first Bitcoin client to ensure minimal 'optimal' connectivity, times have changed, but Satoshi tested that extensively. More connections are obviously preferred if possible.You can set maxconnections to a higher value ofc.P2P over Tor is a 'mess' at best. Luckily port 9999 used by Darkcoin works quite well over Tor as its included in the 'Reduced Exit Policy' list of a large number of Tor Exit Nodes. See: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicy Dedicated Darkcoin Tor Hidden_Service nodes / working darkcoin.conf example :Code:socks=5proxy=127.0.0.1:9150maxconnections=8addnode=33rkrxcfoeduijtb.onionaddnode=hgyvmhd7p2ihasu2.onionSome recommended Torrc settings / additions that work well with the Tor Browser Bundle and Darkcoin :Code:ClientOnly 1EnforceDistinctSubnets 0ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0ExcludeNodes agitator,46.30.42.152,46.30.42.153,46.30.42.154,atlas,hosg,kapler,miller,Musicmail,Octavian,Parker,iiioooeee,squarcio,Unnamed,default,{bh},{by},{mm},{cn},{mo},{tw},{cu},{ir},{kp},{sa},{sy},{tm},{uz},{vn},{eg},{er},{in},{kz},{my},{ru},{ua},{kr},{lk},{th},{tn},{tr},{ae},{am},{cd},{cy},{ci},{ps},{gq},{gn},{gw},{id},{iq},{il},{lb},{ml},{so},{sd},{zw},{mx},{co},{ng},{td},{ly},{cf},{et},{ye},{af},{pk},{bd},{la},{ph},{id},{kh},{??}ExcludeExitNodes {al},{dz},{ao},{az},{bj},{bt},{ba},{bn},{bg},{bf},{bi},{kh},{cm},{km},{cg},{dj},{ga},{gm},{ge},{gh},{hk},{hn},{jo},{kw},{kg},{lr},{mk},{mg},{mw},{mv},{mr},{mu},{yt},{mn},{me},{ma},{mz},{ne},{om},{rw},{qa},{sn},{sl},{sg},{sr},{sz},{tj},{tz},{tg},{ug},{ve},{eh},{dk},{be},{it},{fi},{no},{ie},{gb}LongLivedPorts 21,22,80,443,706,1863,5050,5190,5222,5223,6523,6667,6697,8080,8300,9001,9030,9999NumEntryGuards 8SocksPort 9150See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.0 for explanations and additional settings.I'll be adding these config. downloads / info. pages to a few web based proxies that were created to help promote Darkcoin.http://darkcloud.cu.cchttp://darkproxy.cu.cchttp://darktunnel.cu.ccWondering if anyone from the community would be interested in funding a 'Darkcoin themed' SSL (https) web Based proxy on a TLD to seriously promote Darkcoin ? I have unused promotional credits for new proxy TLD's - with available / extra server bandwidth being the only real restriction for mass traffic to further promote DRK.I have suitable hosting and can handle all the technical aspects etc., although a much better page design would be useful. Anyone interested? Cheers! Certainly an option. Although quite impractical perhaps.The best solution is to fully disable Java Script in Firefox (TBB).See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.msg4410668#msg4410668I just ran a new test at https://panopticlick.eff.org/ using the latest Tor Browser Bundle with Java Script fully disabled and the ID score was below 10.Java Script is required for the following identifiers; Browser Plugin Details, Time Zone, Screen Size and Color Depth, System Fonts and the Limited supercookie test. With Java Script completely disabled all of these tests will show 'no javascript', which will be the same for all visited websites i.e. a massive privacy boost! All of the example Torrc configs. for the Tor Browser Bundle have been updated.Countries deemed to have 'high' or 'extreme' levels of human rights abuse issues have now been added to our ExcludeNodes .Source: https://maplecroft.com/themes/hr/ - Maplecroft Global Analytics - Human Rights Risk Atlas 2014See: http://maplecroft.com/portfolio/new-analysis/2013/12/04/70-increase-countries-identified-extreme-risk-human-rights-2008-bhuman-rights-risk-atlas-2014b/Countries being classed as 'Authoritarian Regimes' and/or countries with existing trade and/or arms Embargoes have also been restricted in our ExcludeNodes .See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism   and   https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargowas last UPDATED: 22nd Apr. 2014 and is still current.Again, using these lists does not block Tor users in these countries, but instead can actually help in preventing internet censorship for Tor users both inside and outside of these countries. Tor Browser Bundle users using these lists also helps to protect any Tor Relay operators located within these countries.   A list of 'real' Micronations - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_micronationsThough this one seems a bit like New Utopia: http://www.new-utopia.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-CFz9kYBJIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syujTp5m5Vk     Herewith, a free web based proxy to help promote Community Coin and the following initiatives:Community Coin themed web based proxy: http://comm.cu.ccSet-up and Run a Tor Relay Server and Receive CommunityCoins - http://communitycointalk.com/index.php?topic=316.0Inspired by a talk from HAR 2009 by Roger D. of the Tor Project: http://youtu.be/WJD1hDKDqlo?t=4m57s   Add an Internet Freedom Badge to Your Website or Blog for 100 COMM - http://communitycointalk.com/index.php?topic=317.0Cheers!

Indeed. A very worthwhile initiative. This will be BIG and will hopefully have a positive impact in improving the awareness and usage of internet privacy and cryptography based tools. This should include Bitcoin and Alt. crypto-currencies !Any doubters should checkout the historical projects and initiatives by Fight For The Future: https://www.fightforthefuture.org/They helped fight SOPA, PIPA, CISPA and more! They also created The Internet Defense League: http://www.internetdefenseleague.org/ who's logo can be found on the homepage of the Tor Project, for example.So, let's help to "Reset the Net" and get more people to use Bitcoin, Litecoin and other crypto-currencies ! Reset the Net - June 5th, 2014 - https://www.resetthenet.org"Don't ask for your privacy. Take it back.""Governments have abused the Internet and twisted it beyond recognition.

It should be possible to do fully 'off-grid' Minting by using one of those mobile phone USB dongle things.I'm not sure if the tech. would have a longevity issue with the number of charge cycles, but it would also be possible to chain the batteries. Some of those high mAh external batteries actually have built in solar panels as well. I've seen portable versions up to around 30000 to 50000 mAh with solar panels built-in, but anything higher starts to look a bit like a mini generator. When Proof-of-Stake kicks in...#Eccoin is certainly much more #EcoFriendly too !    I saw this tweet today from Mattatat ‏@BrownleeMathew Apr 10 "Weird...had a dream that my laptop was solar powered and minting physical #mintcoin.

I'll be adding a rotator into the proxyfied pages with text links to Mintcoin exchanges and merchants in due course.   Indeed. I've placed the Mintcoin logo on the home pages of my web based proxy sites:www.xeronet-proxy.orgwww.xeronet-proxy.bizwww.xeronet-proxy.infowww.xeronet-proxy.netwww.xeronet-proxy.comSo, some free advertising!

I'm no longer running on the nodes that I posted as they went out of sync. and the network is a total mess.Don't really have the time for it atm sadly and I will therfore wait for the devs solution, if any. That's tempting fate sacskate. I can't easily copy and paste my addresses either atm.I'm sticking with this chain till the morrow. Good luck everyone! " No information available about transaction(Error Code: -5) " addnode=198.98.120.30From the OP is the official block explorer at http://explorer.shacoin.co/The nodes I've postedaddnode=198.100.127.34addnode=198.100.127.36are currently stable and in sync with that chain.It seems that there is a higher chain. Although, the block explorer chain may now be moving the fastest.Its an interesting one anyway.   Indeed. The chain on my nodes matches http://explorer.shacoin.co/ which is the block explorer for the devs website ?I'm thinking that the higher chain is from old clients and the only 'run away' pool. I'm guessing the dev. would go with the block explorer's chain. Well this chain is on 18789 now and counting.Are you OK with backing up your wallet sacskate and re-downloading with the nodes I posted ? You can go from the longer chain with the other backup if necessary later on.Is your current chain finding blocks ? How many connections do you have ? Just hit 18773 on all my nodes, so this would seem to be the 'main' PoS chain. Going to try staking.... and staking. Height 18779 and I 'think' we are good. Guessing that the pool didn't update ? Have 18767 now and my own client is almost in sync with the addnodes. At 18757 right now - max height.... and 18760+ on both nodes with 10+ connections on each node... and 18762+ on both nodes with 20+ connections on each nodetrying to sync my one node and will try to stake if it stays synced The chain seems pretty borked.PoS blocks obviously can't be successfully pushed to the network when this happens. When PoS chains go wrong they become their own worst problem.Quite a few old clients on the network still and everyone restarting won't help nodes to find a consensus, if that is even possible.Code needs to be reviewed.Anyway, I've set-up 2 addnodes.Code:addnode=198.100.127.34addnode=198.100.127.36...

I am not a developer of CommunityCoin. Anyone want to make a block explorer for 10,000 COMM ? Anymore for anymore ? Confirming that I have received my CommunityCoins - thanks!I've been considering some ways to increase the distribution further within a growing community without doing the usual giveaways etc.I remembered one of the Tor project devs. once giving a presentation on 'Incentive Mechanisms' for running Tor Relays !So, I propose to giveaway 50% of my initial CommunityCoins over an extended duration to anyone prepared to run a Tor Relay.Anyone doing this will receive an initial 'set-up' donation and also receive a weekly ongoing payment for as long as the node remains active. These rewards will diminish over time to cope with demand and their will ofc be a total max. allocation.Each Tor Relay should be a new named Relay with proper port forwarding on the router. This could make for the perfect opportunity to turn your old 32 bit windows xp machines into a linux Tor Relay running on your 'home' router.CommunityCoin Tor Relays can be identified as active via the Atlas and also torstatus.blutmagie.deI propose that Relays are named as something random+COMM i.e. MyTorRelayCOMMI'm still working out a possible payments structure with my available CommunityCoin funds and will start a new thread soon.Up to 500+ additional Tor Relays should be a very good way to create interest in this new coin and help to build a community.See: https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/relays.html.en for set-up information of a Tor Relay. The Tor software has great settings to control bandwidth usage if your worried about any restrictions with your ISP. Its even possible to have your Relay set to switch on at night and to then switch off during the day when you want to use the bandwidth for yourself.Send me a PM if your actually interested in running a Tor Relay for FREEDOM and to help others and not just because you want to try and get some free Community Coins.   Yes indeed! That's the spirit. If you want to make any recommendations please do so.All four variation example configs on the first page of this thread have been updated to include some of the revised lists from the above research. Everyone can still edit the configs for their own requirements and hopefully have a faster, safer Tor Browsing experience.I'm still testing some configs for Bitcoin and Darkcoin etc. One of the main additions is obviously to add the coins port(s) to LongLivedPorts in the torrc config. Luckily most Tor Exit relays (even those using a reduced exit policy) still open ports 8332-8333 for Bitcoin and even 9999 for Darkcoin.See: https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node  and   https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicy  
Agreed. Although this clearly isn't an 'Official' award - hostmaster is certainly putting the effort in on all fronts with regards to making ECCoin a great success !Proof-of-Stake interest at higher percentages is generally taking sometime for folks to gain a full understanding of in terms of the benefits and as to how it all works. Network security not being an issue, these types of crypto currencies should have a bright and certainly more eco friendly future ahead of them. Posted on the Ecoiner Forums User ID: ECCoinFXA crypto-currency with proof-of-stake interest, shared with others to build up a community could work well.One slice of CommunityCoin pizza please! Thanks! The following list includes countries which undertake extensive, pervasive, substantial and selective censorship or filtering of internet content. Censorship within these countries is often related to pornographic material (which might be considered to be legal in other countries), gambling and/or alcohol related websites might also be illegal or prohibited in these countries. Censorship can also include the restriction and/or filtering of social media websites, news sites and other content deemed to be politically inappropriate or objectionable within a regime. Example:The purpose of this 'block' list is not to prevent Tor users in these countries from accessing the Tor network and it is presented to be beneficial for all Tor users in resisting censorsip.For example, someone running a temporary Tor Exit node in a Middle Eastern country (trying to use Tor to access the free and open internet and help their fellow citizens), does not really want a Tor user in a Western country trying to access banned content from their ISP. The user probably won't get to the requested 'blocked' content anyway and the Exit node operator could get into trouble with their ISP or local authorities.Tor has some measures in place to prevent these types of scenarios, but again these lists are probably useful for the majority of Tor users."Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by a government, media outlet or other controlling body."See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_by_country   and   https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_countryRecommended Internet Censorship prevention list for ExcludeExitNodes - See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.enExcludeExitNodes node,node,    "A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes and address patterns of nodes to never use when picking an exit node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network. Note that any node listed in ExcludeNodes is automatically considered to be part of this list too. See also the caveats on the "ExitNodes" option below."This list can be used in ExcludeNodes, however allowing these nodes as Entry and Middle nodes in the Tor network provides a much more diverse possibility of circuits, whilst still helping to protect all Tor users against censorship.N.B. That this list is designed to be used in addition to the "Enemies of the Internet" and "Countries Under Surveillance" lists and duplicate listings have been omitted.This list does not block Tor users in these countries, but instead actually helps in preventing internet censorship for Tor users both inside and outside of these countries.

Tor Browser Bundle users adding these lists also helps to protect any Tor Relay operators within these countries.Previously recommended configs will be updated when these settings have been tested with existing settings.Bitcoin conf. to follow. I decided to make a full review of the recommended ExcludeNodes and to help provide a clearer explanation as to whats going on and what we are all up against with regards to our Right to Privacy on the internet.The original lists were expanded from the Open Net Initiative - See: https://opennet.net/ and also the aforementioned wiki on Internet Censorship. The situation in regards to a few countries internet policies and practices has changed in recent years.So, recommended ExcludeNodes as per. https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_by_country - Reporters Without Borders:"Enemies of the Internet"... - Node restrictions are included in the 'default' example Tor config. from the OP.BahrainBelarusBurma (Myanmar)China including Taiwan and Macau - as ExcludeNodes | Hong Kong - as ExcludeExitNodes - Updated 22nd Apr. 2014CubaIranNorth KoreaSaudi ArabiaSyriaTurkmenistanUzbekistanVietnamCode:{bh},{by},{mm},{cn},{mo},{tw},{cu},{ir},{kp},{sa},{sy},{tm},{uz},{vn}"Countries Under Surveillance"... - Node restrictions are included in the 'default' example Tor config. from the OP.Australia - already included as a Five-Eyes server in our example configs. - Updated: 29th March. 2014EgyptEritreaFrance - omitted from the main configs after reviewing redacted legislation.

It is also relatively easy for an adversary to continue to observe traffic between Tor servers even when using these kind of country blocks. However, avoiding certain countries will be beneficial for some Tor users. One of the best options for privacy when using Tor is to set a block in ExcludeNodes for your own country and/or location if it is not already included in your ExcludeNodes list.   Whilst the title of this thread is perhaps sensational this topic is really about demonstrating how Tor can be used in different ways.The configs that I have posted do make Tor faster for regular internet browsing and are also geared towards improving privacy, anonymity and security for the user, whoever they may be. Remember that this config also attempts to avoid known 'bad' Tor nodes as well.These configs also take into consideration which Tor servers are the most useful when building fast circuits. The Tor network is actually not very big. The ideal situation is for more Tor users to be running Tor relays ! Join the Tor Network ! - https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/relaysWhen using these configs the Tor software will still randomly select servers as the middle node and can also still make connections to all existing Tor servers (when not enforcing StrictNodes 1) These configs simply let the Tor client know what the preferred servers are to attempt to build circuits with.As I've stated if you don't like an existing setting or you want to try to avoid building certain circuits then you can edit the config to that effect. My aim is to empower Tor users to get the most out of Tor for their intended purpose. All countries, internet service providers, internet backbone providers are pretty much 'spying' on their citizens or customers and logging internet traffic and/or blocking various websites etc. Almost all Tor circuits will cross most major internet Tier pipelines at some point during your browsing session and being on the busiest routes can actually be beneficial to a users privacy.Five-Eyes countries: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_EyesECHELON: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELONInternet Backbone: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backboneInternet Censorship: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorshipYou do make a valid point with regards to perhaps building a config that tries to avoid the major Tor nodes and main routes. It would ofc be much slower by comparison....I in fact run a Tor Relay from my 'home' ISP on a static IP and have done so for a good number of years now.Lastly, what happens on the internet is not always a reality or real life. All four three example Tor configs. have been updated.Optimized Bitcoin and Darkcoin config. examples to follow towards the end of next week.If anyone has a working list of Bitcoin enabled .onion addresses then please do forward me a PM.Thanks! Cheers! Thanks! I'll have to pass on buying pizza - unless your getting hungry ?Anyway, let me know if its working well with Tor. You can ofc just download the Tor Browser Bundle and change your darkcoin.conf to the one I posted. addnode=33rkrxcfoeduijtb.onion addnode=hgyvmhd7p2ihasu2.onionHowever, you will get much better connectivity and faster Tor if you edittheconfig as well.    I've not posted in this thread before, so congrats to everyone on DarkCoin.DarkSend is coming along well and this is a great feature for this project and also for using crypto currency more safely in the future.I was intending to start a 'Tor Enclave' project for Anoncoin, however I'm a fan of CPU coins and some 'default' features of DarkCoin actually make it more suited to network connectivity when using Tor.So, I have set-up 2 DarkCoin nodes which are running as dual stack i.e. they have connectivity through Tor as well as through the clear (regular) internet.Here is the darkcoin.conf settings to enable connectivity via the Tor Browser Bundle.Note that the Tor Browser Bundle uses Socks 5 port 9150 instead of 9050.Code:gen=0socks=5proxy=127.0.0.1:9150maxconnections=8addnode=33rkrxcfoeduijtb.onionaddnode=hgyvmhd7p2ihasu2.onionI think this method of connection is preferable to using;  -tor=<ip:port>  and  -onlynet=<net>   although thats up to the user.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=309716.msg3324942#msg3324942Re: Official Anoncoin Information, FAQ & Description thread.

ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0 , AllowSingleHopCircuits 1 and the addition of DarkCoin port 9999 as a LongLivedPort.Please note that these settings are advised for DarkCoin connectivity, although potentially enforce making single hop connections via Tor when browsing, which can actually lower your anonymity when using Tor for browsing, although making Tor very fast.These single hop settings ensure connectivity with the hidden_service nodes that are using these settings, hence referred to as a 'Tor enclave'.See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en"ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0|1    This option controls whether circuits built by Tor will include relays with the AllowSingleHopExits flag set to true. If ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set to 0, these relays will be included. Note that these relays might be at higher risk of being seized or observed, so they are not normally included. Also note that relatively few clients turn off this option, so using these relays might make your client stand out. (Default: 1)""LongLivedPorts PORTS    A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running connections (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for streams that use these ports will contain only high-uptime nodes, to reduce the chance that a node will go down before the stream is finished. Note that the list is also honored for circuits (both client and service side) involving hidden services whose virtual port is in this list. (Default: 21, 22, 706, 1863, 5050, 5190, 5222, 5223, 6523, 6667, 6697, 8300)""EnforceDistinctSubnets 0|1    If 1, Tor will not put two servers whose IP addresses are "too close" on the same circuit.

If set to 1, clients can use this server as an exit even if it is the only hop in the circuit. Note that most clients will refuse to use servers that set this option, since most clients have ExcludeSingleHopRelays set. (Default: 0)"~ Which is what makes connectivity faster as the exit nodes supports single hops on port 9999 and also treats the connection as a LongLivedPort.  Tor hidden services provide much better anonymity for the user of the service than for the hidden service operator.My thinking is that this adds a very fast layer of 'mix' anonymity for DarkCoin users in addition to using (or when using) DarkSend. The Tor Enclave also reduces the issues with P2P connectivity over the Tor network regarding [scrubbed] connections etc. This is ofc less of an issues of DarkCoin than it is for Tor nodes and the Tor Network as a whole.Unlike Anoncoin (or other crypto coins) port 9999 is actually allowed in the majority of Tor Entry and Exit servers already within the existing recommended Reduced Exit Policy as:ExitPolicy accept *:9999      # distinct   See: https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node - Tips for Running an Exit Node with Minimal Harassment.See: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicy - Reduced Exit Policy.I will continue to work on and update the config. and perhaps start another thread or add it to the existing Torrc thread.If anyone knows of additional working DarkCoin Tor hidden_service .onion addresses - please send me a PM.Also, some static IP addresses for existing nodes and pools would be useful for increased connectivity.Thanks! Uti possidetis"as you possess, so may you continue to possess"    https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_is_nine-tenths_of_the_law  Exchanges can easily operate on a fractional reserve basis.At a guess a minimum of 10 to 25% for a hot wallet. Thus leaving perhaps 90% of your Mintcoins to mint from or to keep for themselves or to dump.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=450381.msg5769563#msg5769563I have always kept my own Mintcoins in my wallet and instantly transferred anything I brought from an exchange.A main principal of crypto currency is ownership of your 'money'. Leaving Mintcoins on an exchange is like paying banks your interest !  This is the way forward.Look at it like this ...(1) Keep your 'money' in a bank, get no interest yourself (let the banksters have it) and watch it lose value.(2) Keep your 'money' in your own pocket (PC wallet), receive interest at up to 20% and watch it potentially gain in value as well.... Its a no brainer really isn't it. Indeed. So, the price has fluctuated between a few sat. low and 60-ish sat. high.I understand the need for day traders to make short-term gains and profits, but I'm in for the long-term and not really looking at the price to much...Consider that these Bitcoin prices from 2009 http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+Rate are not even a blip on today's charts. It is merchants providing goods and services that creates value in the first place.Please read this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=323188 - Bitcoins, Alt. coins, Pizzas and Haircuts.The more merchants that will adopt Mintcoin (or any alt. coin for that matter) the better it is for crypto and everyone involved.My advice is to hold Mintcoin and to focus not on trading introspective markets wondering when the price might go up, but instead think about what goods and services you can offer for Mintcoins.It does not really matter what you sell. This was perhaps the very first 'online' shop to sell anything for Bitcoins. Selling stickers, envelopes and stamps!See: http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/Specialty+ShopNewLibertyStandard ran the very first Bitcoin to Fiat exchange for Bitcoins (with PayPal and Pecunix) and calculated the exchange rate in terms of electricity usage. That is all that was available for our 'worthless' digital tokens (Bitcoins) at that time. Go and take a look at the calculated exchange rates.Again, financial markets do not really create value and are simply a means of exchange. Goods and services i.e. labor creates 'value'.Mintcoin has real potential to be a valid currency. Find me a merchant that does not want to get interest automatically on their sales or someone unwilling to spend their generated interest on goods and/or services ! Buy and hold Mintcoins and one day you might even be able to live of the interest just like Satoshi's hair dresser ! The other coin is probably a more genuine effort by all accounts.However, its still quite assuming to claim to be the 'official' crypto currency of an existing sovereign state.Again, what algo is this 'official' UK Coin to be Crypto-t ?~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np6gyUb0E7o What algo are you planning to use for this 'other' UK Coin ? Proof-of-Stake ? Any premine etc. ? I'll support this from the @FreeMintCoin twitter account: https://twitter.com/freemintcoinWe already hit our target for the FREE MintCoin Thunderclap, although it would be great to get more supporters.MINT Thunderclap: https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/9388-free-mintcoin-giveawayMintcoin Forum Giveaway / Info. thread: https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/9388-free-mintcoin-giveawayGJ What ! Looks like the end of March 2014 is crypto promo weekend on twitter.   I sent freshly mined blocks from my VPS nodes to my 'old' wallet address in the latest client without issue and have confirmation on the transactions.On that basis I opened my main wallet for PoS minting and that was also OK.  Also mining on my nodes without Long Poll is working fine now.Version is not as borked as I thought, I guess everyone is just off mining SHAcoin ?Just need some pools up or I might try compiling a P2pool for Version. The 'best' Proof-of-Stake Scrypt coin to Mint is now an excellent choice for Scrypt Mining (again) !coinwarz.com is now somewhat mis-leading. A big thanks goes to all other alt. coins ofc.  PoW is getting to be so 2009-2013 ... !?!Welcome to the future. Its Minty Fresh !
My VPS nodes are on that chain as well. I'll restart the daemon for full inbound.Mined a total of 7 blocks since the last update across both wallets just with CPU mining whilst the difficulty (reset) was low. Hopefully the pools can be up and running again with a fixed wallet and daemon soon ? This is still a SHA-256 coin, right ?      I have that chain on both of the nodes I posted with around 20 connections on each. Looks like there may need to be another updated wallet release soon ?v0.8.9.9 appears to of caused a wallet compatibility issue. Indeed. Sorry to hear that you lost your job!I'll keep my nodes up and watch the chain. Not sure that everything is 100% though, however the network does seem to be becoming more stable. Had to re-sync / restart a couple of times. Yes. It looks like it might of been trying to sync up with the 'old' chain, before the newer consensus kicked in. -banscore=<n>          Threshold for disconnecting misbehaving peers (default: 100) -bantime=<n>           Number of seconds to keep misbehaving peers from reconnecting (default: 86400)   ...    Its a real shame that Version has had such a problematic start. It has real potential as a great store of value crypto.Looks as if the blocks are being harvested intentionally again.Going to have to take a close look at the distribution to continue with this.Anyone want to try a mod. of p2pool for Version and I'll run it on the nodes I posted above ? I've set-up 2 Version addnode's on a couple of my VPS / Tor servers. addnode=198.100.127.34 addnode=198.100.127.36Both nodes are connected to each other and to the seednode. Not routed through Tor. Indeed.Looks like someone is solo'ing most of the blocks with the low diff as the blocks are racing.Testing solo mining on a node with a 2GH/s Ant Miner USB - something wrong with the daemon ? "Various company logos have been shown to contain all sorts of symbolism or not as the case may be."Examples, from the 'crazy' conspiracy theorists;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rxo4oJfccEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ygwq0MJk-g Please stop spreading this FUD. * Jokes *           Correct.

Indeed. Although, not really. Its already on the internet anyway.Dorian has already confirmed that he is not Satoshi and Satoshi has already confirmed that he/she/they are not Dorian.However, said Dorian Satoshi 'Locomoto' is obviously a 'Blocktrain' enthusiast and is perhaps wearing a cap with what would appear to be a Crypto Libertarian / Entrepreneurship style symbol on it which could also be interpreted as 'here I am and welcome to the future'.This is both conspiracy theory and the stuff of true legend 'hidden in plain sight' or alternatively just a load of coincidental bunkum !Did anyone really expect anything less ? So, I did some research into the Ecco Domani wine company logo which is somewhat similar.It seems the company name can be translated as "here's tomorrow" or "there's tomorrow".I found another forum which more accurately translates the phrase as "here's to tomorrow" which seems to originate from a very old Italian toasting custom "Ecco IL Domani". This can be directly translated as "This is what tomorrow is"."Ecco" - Here is, there is"Eccomi" - Here I am"Eccolo" - Here it is (masculine)"Ecco" is an important word."Domani" is tomorrow.Interestingly enough, most Italians don't seem to recognize this phrase as a modern toasting custom. Perhaps there are other links to be found in Latin and/or secret society symbolism ? GJ for getting an SSL cert. on the banknotes / wallet gen. - keeps it function and highly secure.CryptoAve exchange is looking to add a new crypto. I suggested Version amongst others.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=502900.0~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPWucqna9Eg   Yep. Both good selections.I say be totally random and go with new-ish Version - V - Limited Edition SHA-256 Proof of Stake Only 2,500,000Version Digital Asset - See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=478176.0CryptoAVE  Just like DGC and SRC there was NO PREMINE and NO IPO with this crypto commodity and it also has fast block times. My thoughts exactly."MintCoin - It's MINTor perhaps CryptoGenicBullion - CGB or new Version - VCryptoAve Exchange should have a strong 'Store of Value' based coin."Thus, microCoin and I guess Ultracoin would also be a good choice.Now that Mintcoin mining is done and its onto the Minting phase we could see some price increases as the available 'holdings' get bought up.microCoin is now my main 'scrypt' mining choice, after DGC ofc.   The History of The Tech Model Railroad Club of MIT is considered very important for all 'hackers'...See: Anonymous The Story of the Hacktivists Full Documentary) - http://youtu.be/2rlfJ4V7Zu0?t=6m30sThese are true jokes and pranks for the lulz !"

MintCoin - It's MINT  or perhaps CryptoGenicBullion - CGB or new Version - VCryptoAve Exchange should have a strong 'Store of Value' based coin.  I hereby declare myself an honorary citizen of the new Crypto-Republic of Iceland - lol  N.B. transferred to/from my own personal wallets - so, no need to panic.    Very cool and well thought crypto that somehow manages to have a futuristic and yet retro vibe at the same time.Started mining at around block 5000-ish with a few giga hash. Pools seem to have had some issues, although stable with regular payments in the main.I'd like to see an SSL cert. for the website paper wallets though.5 day minimum proof-of-stake coin age is a bonus. MintCoin should really be taken more seriously as a long-term investment / currency project.Take a look at the early Bitcoin exchange rates from 2009 >http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+RateImagine that these figures are not even a blip on today's current Bitcoin exchange charts.At these sort of prices the most sensible attitude is to buy and hold for the future.Up to 20% interest with MintCoin and you don't even need to keep on buying expensive mining equipment.There is nothing much not to like about MintCoin really. Social media users also seem to be responding well to the coin minting / PoS concept with this one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCsfHVM5x_I     So, I've started a Free MintCoin giveaway account on twitter - https://twitter.com/FreeMintCoinMintCoinTalk Forum info. thread: http://www.mintcointalk.com/index.php/topic,59.0.htmlMintCoin is perhaps the first crypto to enable such long-term social media style giveaways.I look at it as giving away some of my interest to hopefully create additional interest. The 'true' Bitcoin price for sometime now is really around $500 - We may see it go lower, but I reckon $500 is around the current stable / actual price.Bitcoin and Litecoin are here to stay along with a number of Alts.Now watch this ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ku1A5Ox8Uand get your deck chairs out.      I overlooked MintCoin in the first week of its release and started mining in the second week.If nothing else this coin will make for an excellent proof-of-work experiment, although I can see MintCoin being quite valuable in the future.A large ongoing proof-of-stake percentage of this coin should really be given away to as many people as possible via social media.If MintCoin is to act as a true currency then its distribution must be increased. Without increased distribution held coins will have a more limited value and its economy could stagnate not long after the proof-of-work phase is completed.Early adopters and miners of this coin need to recognize that in terms of total future money supply they are perhaps holding the equivalent of a central bank or small / medium sized nation state in the long-term.I ran a distribution model and the forecast for MintCoin is looking really rather good if many initial holders were to donate / giveaway around half of their staked coin profit to new potential users i.e. at least 50% of the 20% (in the 1st year) onwards ... So, 10% or less (or more!) or whatever you can afford.The wider population both understands and likes to get interest on their 'money', especially 'high' fixed rates of interest that is guaranteed. Thus, putting a few MintCoins into the hands of as many people as possible is going to create good demand. People will be saying: "Yes. MintCoin works and 20% (even 5%) is a better rate of interest than my bank on my money. I think I'll buy myself some MintCoin!" , "Got to speculate to accumulate"... etc.The energy saving feature is also obviously a good selling point.A wide free distribution of around 20 to 200 coins per. person is probably about the right amount. This could decrease against the PoS reward over time i.e. 15 to 150 in the second year etc. This coin (and others like it) could bring a really bright future for crypto-currency in general.Alms to the crypto-poor - give and you shall receive !   P.S. If said giveaway's do not happen freely then everyone will probably be left holding a big 'bankster' style bag of worthless 'nothings'.Hint: If your wallet balance looks 'obscene' - think about giving away some of your MintCoins. They will be worth more that way. Probably. Sad news indeed. May this work live on. This thread actually highlights some of (finite) crypto currencies long-term economic flaws.For example, in the case of Bitcoin, once all 21 million Bitcoins are in circulation the process of diminishing availability is in fact inevitable.Most agree that this actually makes the remaining supply of Bitcoins even more valuable for a time i.e. rarity vs scarcity etc. and that you can still ofc spend 0.00001 of a Bitcoin etc.However, this does eventually become an issue: "You cannot trade in diminishing intangibility", well you can, although not at an ever increasing level of 'value'.When something finite isn't being produced anymore, eventually their will be nothing left. Fact.Ironically, it is in fact the finite nature of Bitcoin that actually gives it most of its intrinsic value in the first place.Yes we can't.  ...I have also given much thought to this long-term 'problem' and looked at ways to try and avoid this situation without effecting this finite value.We humans actually cause most of the diminishing availability issues; we loose our wallet passwords, we leave our laptops on the subway, we leave 0.00000001 transaction in wallets that we abandon because they are 'worthless' (which all add up eventually) and sadly we also die, sometimes unexpectedly and without leaving a last will and testament etc., ...The solution ?See: http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/google-death-a-tool-to-take-care-of-your-gmail-when-youre-gone/274934/"Google has now rolled out a technological solution, a euphemistically titled "Inactive Account Manager" tool ("Control what happens to your account when you stop using Google," the company says, i.e. die)."This is where the best solution is probably found. A wallet should contain a slider where its owner selects a period of time that determines if coins from the balance have not been spent within X duration and then automatically 'will' the balance to X specified address.It would also be possible to do this against coin age i.e. something similar to a proof-of-stake mechanism - we can call this a Proof-of-Transaction Again, if coins have not been spent from the balance within X number of years then the balance would be automatically spent (perhaps distributed as transaction fees over time) and would therefore go back to the miners and back into active circulation. The 'default' value could be set at 100 years.This is actually very difficult to implement as it is vulnerable to something similar to a time travel attack on the blockchain, as well as numerous other factors.   Good work here guys !I used to participate in the Grid Republic http://www.gridrepublic.org / World Community Grid.I'll look to get a lower-end box set-up to do my Emercoin PoS minting on and bung a DDR3 Nvidia card into it.I guess a 2GB GT 640 is probably good enough to do some Folding ?

(a lead Tor dev.) often reports being asked when giving presentations to the 'security' services regarding Tor: How can we make Tor faster ? Well this is one way.This config. is an example of the fastest and perhaps most diverse way to use Tor for Internet Browsing. The selected nodes also have high bandwidth / up time and are (mostly) using the latest Tor client for their relays / exit nodes.Lots of Tor servers have the potential to be added in this list - the simple fact is that these really are the 'core' of the Tor network anyway.In fact, most Tor circuits will include one or more of the listed nodes if you use Tor out-of-the-box.Some Tor servers just make for better Middle nodes !  If you compare the Tor Network to a transport or road network, these config's are perhaps not dissimilar from sticking to the main super Highways or Motorways / A roads when driving. Arguably, these routes are likely to have the most surveillance - in terms of anonymity they are also the busiest routes with the most traffic.Example: If you watch a couple of people walk into a tunnel and they change clothes in the middle and you also watch them exit the tunnel - its fairly easy to identify them still. If you watch 1000 people do the very same thing, its a lot more difficult to work out whats going on.The selected Tor servers can also cope with such traffic volumes....A recent study showed that using only 1 entry guard perhaps provides better long-term privacy / anonymity for the user - the original Tor 'default' was 3. Perhaps 8 Entry Guards is unnecessary, however if we can explicitly trust our entry guards then a higher number is better for connectivity. 8 was a number tried and tested by Satoshi as the min. number of nodes necessary to ensure good p2p connectivity in Bitcoin. I've found this to work well with Tor also. Again, these configs are an offset between speed, anonymity, privacy and security....So, here are some other very fast / stable / long-standing nodes (good for browsing - port 80 and 443) that you might add to diversify your own Torrc ...Entry Nodes (USA):Code:FSFhttps://www.fsf.org/ - Free Software FoundationEntry Nodes (USA):Code:torEFFhttps://www.eff.org/ - Electronic Frontier FoundationEntry Nodes (USA):Code:NYCBUG0,NYCBUG1http://nycbug.org/ - New York City *BSD Users Group  xeronet Torrc - v3.5c - censorship resistant version - Strict - without 'Five-Eyes' Exit Servers - New: UPDATED 29th Mar. 2014The main example Torrc is now sufficiently 'censorship resistant' and this release is currently no longer required.Please use the main example Torrc from the OP or the example above.N.B.

Real Argentum is almost here... Purchase genuine 1gm Sterling Silver cards with your Argentum (ARG) currency.More details soon ! Bit of a delay in the final production, but here is the retail version of the Premiere Edition 1gm Sterling Silver CGB Card.Shiny !  The first ebay auction has been delayed, but will be active in the next day or so, featuring one of FiniteByDesign's pre-loaded hologram cards with one GCB.I'm still waiting on delivery of the gold sheet to start production on those.   ebay link coming soon ! Good work here. DGC FTW ! This is what crypto-currency is all about. Looking really good FiniteByDesign ! I notice that your constantly increasing the range of Alt. coin cards on offer.I'll be ordering some more cards soon as I've also been a bit busy myself lately.These make for a fantastic way to advertise and sell crypto-currencies via auction sites.   Good to know the USB flashdrive has arrived. I sent you a PM before checking the thread again.Final Auction 5 in session - anymore for anymore ? Foreign Exchange is a very specific thing. What is the exact detail of said ruling or legislation exactly ?There are lots of Icelandic companies that still advertise that they accept Bitcoin - if I'm based outside of Iceland and I purchase goods or services in Iceland is that considered to be a 'foreign exchange' ? Or is this just in relation to financial markets and instruments, for example ? Thus, further investigation is required.Auroracoin is also not Bitcoin, if the ruling does not directly mention all p2p / crypto-currencies, although this can obviously change public perception.Still might be worth mining a few thousand of these while the difficulty is low. Long live peer-to-peat.   Is there any significance with the date of this 'Airdrop' ?Iceland volcano eruption - 2010 ... "This is a video taken on March 25 2010 at Fimmvörðuháls in Iceland in between to large glaciers." ...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4VULM3gmOcDo you plan on using a helicopter ? Or are you going to be sending out paper wallets or something ?   Bitcoin for Microstates: How Iceland could adopt Bitcoinhttp://www.slideshare.net/sweyn/btc-london-slides02072013v02final...Whilst I'm mostly against pre-mining crypto-currency, in this instance it does make some practicle sense.There are many reasons why Bitcoin is right for micro-economies and why Bitcoin is also probably unlikely to be fully adopted in a country such as Iceland.However, if the adoption of Auroracoin in Iceland only reaches a low percentage of the population it will still make for an interesting experiment in crypto-currency and could realistically make for a better currency than the existing one....I'm mining some Auroracoin because I've recently lost some hosting for proxy and privacy related services previously hosted in the EU and I'm looking for a suitable alternative. Hosting in Iceland is high up on my list of alternatives due to having good freedom of speech and privacy laws, eco friendly hosted and renewable energy source data centres and some other factors.If Auroracoin is a mainstream success in Iceland, then I quite like the idea that I'd be able to pay for hosting services in the future using Auroracoin. Appologies for the finishing time of the auctions in regards to China / Asia timezone etc.Depending on the number of bids and popularity of the auctions I may look to change the finishing time for some of the future auctions.Maybe you can still be the highest bidder at the finishing time !...Auction 1 - Frozencoin 1g Sterling Silver Laminated Cards - Limited EditionItem no. #7 of 71st bidder is welcome to bid the starting bid of 1 FZPlease place your bids only in the Frozentalk.org Forum thread:Here: http://frozentalk.org/showthread.php?tid=88Thank you and good luck with the bids. Auction 4Going, going, gone... Sold to mingophoria for 100 EMC.Congratulations and thanks to everyone for bidding.Final Auction 5 - Bidding starts at 8 EMC ... anyone ... ? You are welcome. I've not had time to sort the autohits for traffic ranks this weekend as I've been busy - I'll get around to it during the week probably.Keep up the good work ! Good to know that you got your flashdrive K1773R - Thanks!Perhaps not the fastest of write speeds, but its compensated for by the faster read speeds, thus making them great for certain tasks. Auction #4 finishes in just under 1 hr from now.Highest bidder is currently portice for 75 EMCAnymore for anymore ? Yes. Remember to check the RAMdisk options / settings carefully and think about what your doing and how this works etc.Always save the RAMdisk after you close down Huntercoin and it's also probably best to back-up the entire ' wallet ' folder to preserve a copy of the chainstate and game logs etc. Again, make all back-up's to your HDD and not on the RAM drive. I can agree that this has unfortunately not been the most perfect of coin launches.Always remember that this is experimental software and should be treated as such and that the innovation here is still massive and very commendable.Even as a fairly experienced user I have also seen all of the forking issues already described by most in this thread and it has been quite frustrating at times. I myself have only just got everything working well and managed to mine my first coins on the correct blockchain after starting this a fresh.How to run Huntercoin on Windows in a RAM drive.1 - Download and install AMD RAMDisk: http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/radeon-memory/Pages/ramdisk-overview.aspxThe 4 GB max. Freeware version can be found via a link in the text on this page: http://www.radeonmemory.com/software_downloads.phpN.B. You really need a min. of 8 GB of system RAM to create the maximum 4 GB RAM disk.If you have say only 4 GB of (free) system RAM then create a 2 GB RAM disk. Less that 4 GB of system RAM is not really recommended for this.2 - Create your AMD RAMDisk - I choose drive H - although make sure that you don't choose a drive letter that conflicts with an existing device such as a printer or other storage device etc.3 - Copy the contents of the latest version of Huntercoin from the link in the OP to the new RAM drive and make sure its not in a folder.4 - Create a new folder on the RAM drive and name it: wallet5 - Copy (or create) your existing huntercoin.conf to the new wallet folder. N.B. This is basically your %APPDATA% folder.6 - 2nd mouse button click on huntercoin-qt.exe and > Create shortcut (on the RAM drive)7 - 2nd Mouse button click on the new Huntercoin-qt.exe - Shortcut and > Properties8 - After Target: H:\huntercoin-qt.exe type: -datadir=.\walletSo, Target: H:\huntercoin-qt.exe -datadir=.\walletand click > Apply > OKThis Shortcut will now run Huntercoin-qt.exe from the RAM drive and store your %APPDATA% in the folder named wallet.This folder contains your wallet.dat - Back-up this wallet.dat to a drive location which is not on the RAM drive.If you want to get a better idea of how this works see: https://bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin - Configuration File...This will run Huntercoin in RAM which in almost all cases is much much faster than running it from a HDD or even SSD.Most issues with the syncing of the blockchain in Huntercoin are now only due to drive read / write speeds etc. As Snailbrain has already stated...It was taking over a few hours to sync with the blockchain for myself - However, when I used the RAM drive method above and the latest addnodes I was fully synced to the full block chain and mining in 5 mins. You do not need to run the miner from the RAM disk.Happy Hunting! It's going to be amazingly amazing !   Great news!addnode=144.76.142.46Cheers!   Frozencoin 1g Sterling Silver - Laminated Cards - Limited EditionSee: http://www.frozentalk.org/showthread.php?tid=86Only 7 of these Limited Edition cards will be produced and they are individually numbered.6 of these cards will be auctioned via the FrozenTalk.org Forum in a seperate thread only for Frozencoin. Including free worldwide P&P.The last auction i.e. #1 of 7 will be held via ebay to help advertise Frozencoin to a wider audience.Each auction will run for 7 days and the first auction will commence from Sunday 2nd Feb. 2014 at 00:00 (midnight) GMT.Thank you.Regards,FrozenFX on FrozenTalk.org Forum I was lucky enough to play a few of the beta / testnet versions of Huntercoin.

That was when I was doing the Ping , Robot and Search Engine Submissions.  It will take a while for residual traffic to increase through Search Engines etc., although it does make the site easier to find for the fans.I'll send some targeted hits and auto-traffic over the weekend - it will help to get the page rank up. Have a re-count then.   Thanks!I'm guessing that the new website will be at the same domain ?~ The metal in the drafts above has been re-set quite often tbh, so its not presented quite as pristinely as it will be for retail with added quality control.Still, the cards are better than paper money imho, will help to advertise CGB and also make for a nice gift set / collectable item. Final Cryptogenic Bullion Cards - 1st draft - Premiere Edition.Rounded corners and fully black text to further enhance the metal / 'bullion' featured.The Silver and 9ct Gold pieces have arrived in stock to start production. The technique for setting the metal has also been improved for production.100 Premiere Edition cards (approx.) for each metal will be produced with demand.The 1st - Premiere Edition - 2 card set should appear on ebay over this weekend. The aim being to attact physical metal / coin / numismatic collectors to the world of crypto-currency and specifically CGB. The auction will include one of finitebydesigns hologram cards pre-loaded with 1 GCB. Link to follow.

Looking to have these real Sterling Silver laminated cards produced for Argentum, which of course is Latin for Silver - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ArgentumSee: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=245086.msg4668999#msg4668999Each laminated card will house just over 1 gram of Sterling Silver and are being designed as collectable 'add-on' packs or gift sets linked to FiniteByDesign's hologram cards ( see: http://finitebydesign.net ) , soon to be available for Argentum.The final proof design will have fully rounded corners and perhaps the option to receive the card set without a printed / linked wallet address.Mock-up design to follow in the next week or so. Sounds odd. I reverted to solo for a while when the hash rate dropped, but you are probably better off in a pool still, depending on your hashrate. http://cgb.smalltimeminer.com is probably the better choice of pool right now. - Securecoin distribution is much fairer than Quark's over the long-term.- SRC currently maintains the highest hashrate over most of the other CPU coins in existance - making the network automatically more 'secure'.- It is part of a 'family' of 3 great coins i.e. Digitalcoin (DGC) , Argentum (ARG) and Securecoin (SRC) which will also feature on the CryptoAve Exchange.- Securecoin follows a similar economic model to Bitcoin - which to date has proven to be successful.- baritus is the lead developer. A very active, competent and caring dev. who demonstrates both a good understanding of economic principals in crypto-currency as well as a technical ability and the necessity of fairness.~ "Those of us who are not totally Quark'ers - mine Securecoin".   Yep current block reward is 0.15625000Moreover, due to the recent decline in hashrate I've already made more CGB this month than last month when the block reward was 0.3Looking to the future only a couple of Scrypt coins get my vote for mining at present for long-term profits, being DGC , ARG and CGB.The silver CGB cards that I posted a few pages back - I'm also going to have produced for Argentum.IMHO anything backed by or related to real metals or bullion, albiet in small quantities, is going to do very well in the future and for good reason !Another Scrypt-Jane coin to watch is YbCoin - http://www.ybcoin.com/ - currently mostly sandboxed in chinese markets. This is the 'real' gold coin, PoS also !Just like you ModGod I've mined a load of GPL as well   OP requested some port forwarded addnodes.

You do need to provide valid account details, windows live ID and credit card number etc., although it works well for mining FZ - I'd recommend just 2 x 8 core servers and you need to use windows server 2008 as it uses less credits. About 10 days or less worth of mining.Here's a youtube guide written for quark : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg0XOverro0...VPS mining FZ - The cheapest windows VPS with the most cores that I could find is with Boson VPSIts $16 a month for a fast 4 core VPS. Promo code: BOSONOFF10  should be valid for 10% off recurring. In my experience the servers based in Germany currently have the fastest cores for mining. Better value than digitalocean ! Cheers!...I'm thinking to produce some Silver - Frozen cards similar to my Cryptogenic Bullion cards.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=245086.msg4668999#msg4668999Any interest in this ? Quite like the idea of 'Frozen as Cryptogenic Bullion' and perhaps accepting FZ for CGB card and vice versa.   Auction 3Going, going, gone... Sold to K1773R for 160 EMC.Congratulations and thanks to everyone for bidding.Auction 4 - Bidding starts at 8 EMC ... anyone ... ? Auction #3 will close in just under 1 hr of this post.Current highest bid is 130 EMC by Anduck. Here's the 9ct gold - 1st draft mock-up of a Cryptogenic Bullion card concept that I've been working on.These cards are being designed as collectable 'add-on' packs or gift sets linked to FiniteByDesign's CGB hologram cards ( see: http://finitebydesign.net ) and will be available in Sterling Silver, 9ct Gold, 18ct Gold and Platinum. Each laminated card will house just over 1 gram of each metal - frozen as cryptogenic bullion.The final proof design will have fully rounded corners and perhaps the option to receive the card set without a printed / linked wallet address.Does anyone have any suggestions regarding the existing design ?...Its quite remarkable that the hash rate for Cryptogenic Bullion has declined slightly over the past month. Even with the lowered block reward I've actually been able to mine more CGB this month than in previous months because of this.CGB should really be seen as a more serious long-term investment crypto-currency, being backed by physical bullion.These Cryptogenic Bullion cards should start to be available from early to mid.

EdqJfBfURLGaCbT5MX5e3z7QvSGeQHcnHaThank you !See: Emercoin - Cryptocurrency of Emergence - 8 GB USB Auctions - 5 separate auctions - 1 per. week for 5 weeks.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=399891.0 Great stuff ! I wonder how long it will take the Exilecoin guys to build a bot for Huntercoin ?  I really enjoyed playing this on the testnet though and I hope the 'non-beta' gets a solid hash rate and lots of players / supporters.In many respects this project is more important than Bitcoin and I'm being serious - the potential and innovation here is huge. Gratz ! Hear, hear ! Those of us who are not totally Quark'ers mine Securecoin instead.   That stuff.tv article should be quite an interesting read for the masses. Good one !...Offerings is probably the best cpu coin to try mining at digitalocean vps currently.Here's my sign-up link: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=3893cccaf65f  Using the code: 2014SSD - should get you $10 free credit - Expires on 01/31/2014Also check: http://www.retailmenot.com/s/digitalocean for new promo codes.You do need to sign-up with your full details and a valid credit card number. Anyway, $10 free credit gives you 2 months free mining on a $5 droplet vps at around 45 khash/s.Simply create the droplet as 12.04 ubuntu vps - download Putty (for windows) and enter your own droplet vps IP address as the Host Name and click > Open. Linux and Mac users just use the terminal with SSH. Enter your root username and password (sent by email) and copy paste the following script, after replacing your offerings address in the first line.Original script by gigawatt - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=284831.msg3042990#msg3042990 So do send some donations / offerings.Script edited and updated by myself for offerings - mining at japool.com ...

This coin had a fair launch, unlike similar coins released around the same time. The hash rate has increased considerably recently pending the launch of the CryptoAve exchange. Good dev. and ever increasing community support.digitalcoin has also been featured on the crypto-trade exchange for quite some time with the other 'big' coins - https://crypto-trade.com/trade/dgc_btcAlso see: http://cryptolife.net/digitalcoin-the-diamond-in-the-rough/Securecoin (SRC) - A CPU only coin based off Quark, although using Bitcoins economic model, again without a 'pre-mine'. Same great dev. as digitalcoin and this coin is also to feature on CryptoAve at launch.Take a look at the cryptsy charts for both of these coins - even in turbulent times they have both remained mostly rock solid against BTC and even indicate a potential for an upwards trend with the increasing chance for breakout.CryptogenicBullion (CGB) - A proof-of-stake coin for the more serious long-term crypto-currency investor. It could start to retrace in value soon.The usual suspects - Peercoin, Primecoin, Litecoin, Anoncoin.Perhaps Sexcoin and even Stablecoin are ones to watch this year for some big gains ?...A coin that I find really interesting is Ybcoin (YBC) - http://www.yuanbaobi.org/Its a scrypt-jane coin with Proof-of-Stake - Its certainly the real 'gold coin'.Its practically sand-boxed itself in the Chinese market - exchange: http://www.yuanbaohui.com/   I recently saw this quote in someones forum sig. (or something similar to it anyway)"The best day to start mining or buying crypto-currency was yesterday. The second best day is today !"  Hopefully this can remain correct for a very long time.

You might also use the USB to run portable apps. such as the Tor Browser Bundle etc.Each auction will run for 7 days and will finish on the following Sunday night at 00:00 GMT.Bidding starts from 8 EMC in 1 EMC increments. So, if the previous bid was 8 EMC then you must bid at least 9 EMC or more. The winner of each individual auction must be able to provide a valid shipping address. If I'm unable to contact the winner or receive the correct EMC payment from them within 48 hrs of each auctions finishing time then the previous bid and bidder will be considered the winner.

Furthermore, Tor hidden services are known to provide much better anonymity for users than for their operators.I've been giving thought as to how it might be possible to increase Anoncoin connectivity with Tor whilst actually helping the Tor network, instead of slightly hindering it.This concept is for an enclave of Anoncoin nodes running hidden services as relays / exit nodes with custom settings to potentially increase the privacy of Anoncoin Tor users. An Anoncoin mesh network within the Tor Network if you like.Howto: Tor config. - dedicated Relay options (See: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en - Tor Manual):ORPort 9377 - Optional - identifiable as Anoncoin.LongLivedPorts 9377 - port addition to help connectivity."A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running connections (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for streams that use these ports will contain only high-uptime nodes, to reduce the chance that a node will go down before the stream is finished. Note that the list is also honored for circuits (both client and service side) involving hidden services whose virtual port is in this list. (Default: 21, 22, 706, 1863, 5050, 5190, 5222, 5223, 6523, 6667, 6697, 8300)"AllowSingleHopCircuits 1"When this option is set, the attached Tor controller can use relays that have the AllowSingleHopExits option turned on to build one-hop Tor connections. (Default: 0)"ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0"This option controls whether circuits built by Tor will include relays with the AllowSingleHopExits flag set to true. If ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set to 0, these relays will be included. Note that these relays might be at higher risk of being seized or observed, so they are not normally included. Also note that relatively few clients turn off this option, so using these relays might make your client stand out. (Default: 1)"EnforceDistinctSubnets 0"If 1, Tor will not put two servers whose IP addresses are "too close" on the same circuit. Currently, two addresses are "too close" if they lie in the same /16 range. (Default: 1)"As per. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=309716.msg3324942#msg3324942 - How to run Anoncoin as a Tor hidden service?Anoncoin hidden service relays could now have improved connectivity with one another (and with Anoncoin Tor clients) utilizing reciprocal one-hop connections.Some collaboration on the part of Anoncoin hidden service operators and/or batches of hidden services nodes running 'my family' or groups of .onion addnodes is required with each node incorporating lists of known / shared / published addnode .onion addresses.When a full list of running hidden service .onion addresses has been established - client only Tor users can connect more easily with onlynet=tor tor=127.0.0.1:9050 (as per. What/Howto Tor) in the Anoncoin .conf also using maxconnections=8 (example) to help prevent unecessary traffic errors through Tor.Tor Exit Relays should also use:AllowSingleHopExits 1This option controls whether clients can use this server as a single hop proxy. If set to 1, clients can use this server as an exit even if it is the only hop in the circuit. Note that most clients will refuse to use servers that set this option, since most clients have ExcludeSingleHopRelays set. (Default: 0)Furthermore, relay's and clients could use a publicly updated custom Tor nodes config. for targeted Anoncoin enclave connectivity:ExcludeNodes node,node,A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes and address patterns of nodes to avoid when building a circuit. (Example: ExcludeNodes SlowServer, ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234, {cc}, 255.254.0.0/8) By default, this option is treated as a preference that Tor is allowed to override in order to keep working. For example, if you try to connect to a hidden service, but you have excluded all of the hidden services introduction points, Tor will connect to one of them anyway. If you do not want this behavior, set the StrictNodes option (documented below).Note also that if you are a relay, this (and the other node selection options below) only affects your own circuits that Tor builds for you. Clients can still build circuits through you to any node. Controllers can tell Tor to build circuits through any node.Country codes are case-insensitive. The code "{??}" refers to nodes whose country cant be identified. No country code, including {??}, works if no GeoIPFile can be loaded. See also the GeoIPExcludeUnknown option below.EntryNodes node,node,A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, and country codes of nodes to use for the first hop in your normal circuits. Normal circuits include all circuits except for direct connections to directory servers. The Bridge option overrides this option; if you have configured bridges and UseBridges is 1, the Bridges are used as your entry nodes.The ExcludeNodes option overrides this option: any node listed in both EntryNodes and ExcludeNodes is treated as excluded.Anyway, lots of variations and ways to go about this - hint hint. Could make for an interesting P2P experiment using Tor.Start looking for published lists or Tor nodes with ORPort 9377 in the http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ soon ?

If you don't like a setting in this example config. then please change it yourself.Here are the important options from the Tor manual:Use StrictNodes 1 to enforce the server selection. Currently set to 0 'default'."If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is necessary to perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfil a .exit request, upload directory information, or download directory information. (Default: 0)"You can set StrictNodes to 1 to make browsing faster and completely avoid 'FiveEyes' and internet censored countries, but it will 'break' hidden services if they are located in one of those blocked countries. ~ Ever wondered how the security services locate Tor 'hidden services' ... hummm.Use FascistFirewall 1 to force port 80 (http) and port 443 (https) access."If 1, Tor will only create outgoing connections to ORs running on ports that your firewall allows (defaults to 80 and 443; see FirewallPorts). This will allow you to run Tor as a client behind a firewall with restrictive policies, but will not allow you to run as a server behind such a firewall. If you prefer more fine-grained control, use ReachableAddresses instead."When using this option do make sure that your selected Nodes use port 80 and/or port 443 Also, if your firewall does allow other ports (or you want to connect other applications to Tor) then we do recommend changing FascistFirewall back to 0, as this will automatically 'unlock' additional fast entry nodes already included in the xeronet Torrc list.Use UseEntryGuards 1 for increased security."If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term entry servers, and try to stick with them. This is desirable because constantly changing servers increases the odds that an adversary who owns some servers will observe a fraction of your paths. (Defaults to 1 anyway)"Use ClientOnly 1 for the Tor Browser Bundle."If set to 1, Tor will under no circumstances run as a server or serve directory requests. The default is to run as a client unless ORPort is configured. (Usually, you dont need to set this; Tor is pretty smart at figuring out whether you are reliable and high-bandwidth enough to be a useful server.) (Default: 0)"Using additional LongLivedPorts 80, 443, 9001 and 9030."A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running connections (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for streams that use these ports will contain only high-uptime nodes, to reduce the chance that a node will go down before the stream is finished. Note that the list is also honoured for circuits (both client and service side) involving hidden services whose virtual port is in this list. (Default: 21, 22, 706, 1863, 5050, 5190, 5222, 5223, 6523, 6667, 6697, 8300)"These additions are somewhat experimental, however the overall configuration does seem to work better when including these port settings; especially in relation to the StrictNodes option above where the configuration was found to be much faster overall than when enforcing StrictNodes 1. Thus, we have reverted to using the 'default' StrictNodes 0.xeronet Torrc - v4.0.4 - 'Anti-FiveEyes'.Requires the latest Tor Browser Bundle for correct operation.N.B.

The aim is for a Radio based hardware product, which can automatically find and sync. with other similar devices, also linking in chains to the Bitcoin network through 'main' nodes which are conected to the internet to enuse connectivity.Some installations could also be connected directly to the internet / Bitcoin network, as well as broadcasting both by Radio and WiFi for anyone to connect to send and receive transactions.Pre-installed blockchain data on a radio hardware device will only require low bandwidth, as above posts.2x radios (min.) in each device are probably required for this purpose i.e. one set to sync. and one set to broadcast, receive and relay transactions + optional LAN and WiFi connectivity.'The Bitcoin Freedom Box'.

This will help to test the latency issues which will be encountered when using Mesh networks, but can also provide both anonymity and security. Sometimes you have to take a step backwards to move forwards. Mesh networks are the future of the internet and P2P software, infact they are much the same thing.This concept might initially work better as a store of value as opposed to a currency, whilst still allowing for transactions to take place.This idea reminds me of the http://wrgpt.org/ - WRGPT = World Rec.Gambling Poker TournamentProbably the world's oldest and biggest free email poker tournament."Since the entire tournament is run via email it is slow as compared to online poker sites.

If it still exists ?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=358790.msg3839053#msg3839053 I was one of the early Bitcoin miners. My port forwarded node had around 15 to 20-ish stable connections for around the first few months. On occasions it would drop to around 10 connections. At around 6 months to a year the total number of connections increased quite quickly.You had to mine with the Bitcoin client wallet back then using the CPU - it was the only way to mine. I dedicated an older Asus Terminator A7VT as my mining rig running 24/7 to support the Bitcoin project. Its single core Sempron CPU and VIA chipset had some limited crypto accelerator functions and it therefore got a much higher overall hash rate than some of my dual core PC's and other laptops I used at that time.Most of the early network connections were via proxies / VPNs or through the Tor network. Aside from the IRC node I was one of the few individuals that published a port forwarded static IP. I also ran a Bitcoin node through Tor.I knew deep down that bitcoin might get very big some day, although sold and traded almost all of my bitcoins within the first 2 years and well before any major price increase. Due to personal cirumstances I had to stop mining for quite sometime and it sadly wasn't 'worth' mining with my limited resources when things started taking off.If you look at some of my early posts you will see that I predicted a price increase similar to gold/usd. My predictions were correct, although my timing was off - it just seemed to be taking way to long against my calculations for the project to be gaining momentum.I'm proud to be an early Bitcoin supporter - I helped to advertise Bitcoin and did one of the most important things to help the project i.e. I traded, spent and donated my Bitcoins. I would personally think that those coins current market cap could be easily exceeded by other coins.Anoncoin is a really great coin, its just perhaps not a coin to be adopted by the masses.People also tend to get 'buzzed' by various coins when they are new or see a revival. I'm currently unsure of the future position of Stablecoin.Quark (like Securecoin) is great for some obvious reasons. These two coins don't really require specialist computer hardware to start mining them, this is something that new people to crypto currency should really appreciate.Its also a better and somewhat fairer approach. You shouldn't really need to buy expensive computer hardware to participate in crypto-currency mining - in a ideal world. It actually helps to keep these coins decentralized. Growth in terms of user base and growth as value / worth are two very different things.Litecoin should now be considered a mainstream coin. So, in no particular order...PeercoindigitalcoinSecurecoinCryptogenicbullionThe coin I'm voting for is Securecoin. Its quite possibly the most underrated alt. coin in existance right now. Its basically Quark (super secure), using bitcoins proven economic model. It had a fair launch, unlike a lot of the alt. coins released before it.The popularity of Feathercoin puzzles me greatly: http://cryptolife.net/an-in-depth-look-at-feathercoin-the-coin-that-started-it-all/I'd be more of a fan of either Worldcoin or Megacoin, but digitalcoin is just a much better coin imho and this thread is about growth. digitalcoin has a much greater potential for growth as of right now, simply because its less popular. When the CryptoAve exchange launches, both digitalcoin and Securecoin could see major popularity increases in both user base and value / worth. You got the S.P.H.E.R.E ? - lolhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f8wAXDZ9D0 This was in Switzerland and not the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Swiss to vote on $2,800 monthly income for all adults:http://news.msn.com/world/swiss-to-vote-on-dollar2800-monthly-income-for-all-adultsRT report on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xi4g9lfodYNice idea though, right ?  Remember: without 'Satoshi' there is no gold and no truck either.
Yes. In 140 years (approx.) and at the exact moment when all of the 21 million Bitcoins are in circulation then Satoshi's Bitcoins will be equally distributed to all active addresses on the blockchain.Erm... well maybe.   Right now (and in no particular order).PPC - PeercoinLTC - LitecoinDGC - DigitalcoinSRC - SecurecoinCGB - CryptogenicBullionPeercoin has a good long-term potential as a currency. As an investor Proof-of-Stake is a good option for you.Litecoin is 'silver' to bitcoins 'gold'. Enough said.Digitalcoin unlike similar alt. coins did not have a pre-mine, has a good developer and has much potential for growth. CryptoAve exchange is coming.Securecoin is perhaps the most underrated alt. coin in existance. Its basically Quark (very secure) using Bitcoins proven economic model. Also built by the digitalcoin developer with a fair launch.CryptogenicBullion is your bank vault or high-interest savings account. Another Proof-of-Stake coin. Rarity and Scarcity is a good investment choice. Other coins have attempted this and are perhaps to rare in comparison. CGB seems to have got the balance just about right. Also has a good development team.Other's you had mentioned:Worldcoin and Megacoin have potential, but right now DGC has more potential as an investor.Feathercoin is a Fork of Litecoin - http://cryptolife.net/an-in-depth-look-at-feathercoin-the-coin-that-started-it-all/ (Hazard is an interesting character - the critiques and information on that blog are very accurate to date - well worth reading imho.)Watching Quark and Stablecoin. Anoncoin is to often overlooked ! Datacoin has potential, although it's early days.Anyway, with my current top 5 as your alt. coin portfolio - I think you could pick worse - However, this is not investment advice. All aspects considered, using:  --icarus-options 115200:1:1 --icarus-timing short=90instead of:    --icarus-options 115200:1:1 --icarus-timing 3.0=100Should provide most BE users with a slightly higher overall hash rate, more Accepted shares and a higher WU value to match. Depending on your host / set-up and the mining pool I'm fairly sure that there is a slight increase in the overall hash rate.It is certainly not as high as the hash rate that appears to be shown in my original post, hence why I refered to it as 'an illusion'.The actual speed is probably similar or less than that posted by Raptor2213The real question is can these settings generate more Accepted shares. I'm fairly certain that with some set-up's using stock block eruptors - they do, but again it is highly dependent on the host and the individual set-up.Some of my own rigs are seeing more Accepted shares at various pools with a higher WU rate. I'll continue testing and moding the block eruptors and software. I'm certain its possible to get faster stock speeds with BE's, because of something else that I'm working on. I've just found something that jogged my memory from early 2010.I remember reading a forum board about something very similar to bitcoin / bitgold that I think I found via a search engine. I had registered on bitcointalk and was searching for bitcoin history at that time. So, the date of the board was probably 2007-2009.The board had very few contributors - I got the impression that one of the 3 main contributors was a university professor / lecturer type and had an advisory role over the others. I also got the impression (and this is from memory) that the other main contributors were 1 male and 1 female - perhaps students.The 'coat of arms' that I think I remember on the board was that of the George Washington University.https://www.gwu.edu/seal-mace-coat-armsI've searched many Universities and College websites for this 'shield' and this one is the closest match to my memory of it.I don't want to find 'Satoshi', but I would like to find and read that board - I've looked for it and I can't find it. Obviously it was freely available on the internet, but maybe it got archived or deleted ?Perhaps Phinnaeus Gage or someone else could help to find this ? Re: Yossi Nagy Moti - Cryptovirology and Bitcoinhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206630.msg3647012#msg3647012Here is Nick Szabo's 'unenumerated' blog post on Bit gold circa 2008: http://unenumerated.blogspot.co.uk/2005/12/bit-gold.htmlWhere we can see Daniel A.

HAR 2009https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJD1hDKDqlo - Pay attention from 4.57 "Incentive Mechanisms"... micro payment approaches... with a reference to Tor bittorrent users directly before talking about a similar system to 'Bitgold'.The real irony is that Satoshi is probably just some random guy who knows some or none of these individuals and/or closely followed their work and rightly deserves to remain 'anonymous'. Are you running with: --icarus-options 115200:2:2 --icarus-timing short=90 on those ?Has your WU value increased ? Are you getting more hardware errors than stock settings ?Thanks. Nope. I probably should do though. I've just made sure that they have adequate spacing in my hubs.I do have a fan on my main set-up and after running overnight on 2 sets of 4 BE's, one with a fan and one without, the 4 with the fan do have slightly less hardware errors, which could just be a coincidence of course.These seem to be the best heatsinks that I can find:http://www.frozencpu.com/products/14951/vid-177/ModMyToys_Solid_Copper_Passive_Micro-Heatsink_-_8mm_x_8mm_x_8mm_Pack_of_4_-_Black_Electro-Plated-MMT-HS-8X8-CU-BK.htmlOne of them on the main BE 100 chip and a good fan is probably all you really need to do. Although the main heat source is actually from the back of the BE chip, so replacing the main heatsink on the back is best when using moded chips.

In theory the price will continue to rise long after the 21 million coins are mined, then (in theory) Bitcoin goes down hill back to $0."You cannot trade in diminishing intangibility" - BitcoinFX - well you can, but not forever...Bitcoin is a bubble - a very big bubble !

Is this mearly an illusion ? I think not...These are 4 'stock' USB Block Eruptors running off one 4-port USB hub with the 'best' tested settings I could find.The avg: An all time average hash rate - appears to be doubled in some respects, which is somewhat questionable, however U: The Utility defined as the number of shares / minute - and - WU:  The Work Utility defined as the number of diff1 shares work / minute (accepted or rejected) - appears to be quite a bit higher. Mine has increased from 18.8 avg to a steady 21.5 (up from 19.3 in this early screen shot). The U value starts lower, but has now exceeded the previous avg.  --icarus-options 115200:2:2 --icarus-timing shortCan be used on a dedicated mining PC with good CPUs for increased performance.  --icarus-options 115200:2:2 --icarus-timing short=90Can be used on slower PCs that are also in-use.EDIT: The --icarus-options 115200:2:2 is unlikely to give most users more Accepted shares, depending on your set-up and the pool.N.B. I've tested these settings on windows and linux on both Bitcoin and Peercoin Pools. A single Block Eruptor mining PPC on a pool is currently reporting 768 MH/s (although it seems to range from around 448 MH/s to 665 MH/s) with the above settings.IMPORTANT: I'm currently unsure if these settings will decrease the life of a Block Eruptor USB using standard cgminer.Free CPU is essential for these settings. I'm also still testing if the number of accepted shares against rejects and hardware errors is really beneficial long-term.I have a moded build of cgminer 3.1.1 (not the one pictured) and a moded BE that appears to be running at almost 1.5 GH/s - stable. If the device survives into early January 2014 - then I'll consider documenting the modifications for others to use.Cheers!Additional tip for windows users: go to Computer Management (My Computer) > Device Management > Ports (COM & LPT) > Silicon Labs ... (COM1) , (COM2) etc. > 2nd mouse button click > Properties Tab > Select: Bits per Second 115200 > OK and repeat for each mining device. Then start cginer again.I've set my windows miner ports to the maximum 128000 - cgminer overrides these 'default' windows settings, but with the ports default being 9600 - one might as well at least match it. You can't and don't need to go above 115200 in cgminer as this setting is the maximum, but it is windows afterall. 2 GB USB Slim Flashdrives - White - printed with the digitalcoin logo - bid today ! 02/12/13 (from 2nd December)Clearance stock and great holiday gifts !!!5 day listings:http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230913482http://www.ebay.com/itm/1112309143697 day listings:http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230915807http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230916339http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230916904http://www.ebay.com/itm/11123091736210 day listings:http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230919216http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230920889http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230921364http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230922051Thanks !

In fact, out of the three, CloudFlare was the least effective." 2015 Probably Securecoin - although its a bit more popular than it was a week or so ago.Hummm... also now watching Stablecoin. 2 GB USB Slim Flashdrives - White - printed with the digitalcoin logo - bid today ! 02/12/13 (2nd December)Clearance stock and great holiday gifts !!!5 day listings:http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230913482http://www.ebay.com/itm/1112309143697 day listings:http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230915807http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230916339http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230916904http://www.ebay.com/itm/11123091736210 day listings:http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230919216http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230920889http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230921364http://www.ebay.com/itm/111230922051Thanks !

Hence there is no need for any prize draw.Anyhow, I'll be sending all 14 winners a PM for their shipping address to receive one of the 16GB USB Flipcard's. Lucky for some !Winners: jdebunt, techbytes, Bitcoin!, Reborn, saif92, MobGod, faiza1990, kylie.v, GoldBit89, waqas, Snail2, orco#2, dupee419 (digitalcoin forum), EDIT: + dealhunter (digitalcoin forum)  Nope. Not really. The link (URL) you have reported from your software indicates a 3rd party upload site probably used by someome for a link on the forum that was / is in just one thread as a download etc.That's enough to get bitcointalk.org temporarily and incorrectly listed. I don't see a reason to do a re-install at present.Malwarebytes is just being over sensitive, when you pay for an anti-malware solution, they have a legal obligation to 'protect' you.Sometimes these companies get things wrong, because they must protect their customers. Lets also say that they can sometimes have other interests as well.There might be a genuine problem, but at present I can't find anything or it might of been removed already, but I'm not an admin. wth server access either.Looks like a 'false alarm' to me though.    I've just scanned bitcointalk.orghttp://sitecheck.sucuri.net/scanner/ - Cleanhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/url/7354af8427d7b8d4236356d0bca680ad3186fce415cb51971f3793cee59e4291/analysis/1385144339/ - CleanHowever, I found that hpHosts is currently listing bitcointalk.org - i.e. 'Malwarebytes'.See: http://hosts-file.net/?s=bitcointalk.org this is probably an error and the admin. should contact 'Request removal' for more info.Not 100% sure how ads are being served here, but it might be to do with temporarily hijacked 3rd party content and/or in relation to linked content.This report, I suspect is actually a 'false positive'. Thunderclap has an app for that. Thats what Thunderclap does. The DGC USB project won't get a social boost if it does not receive 100 followers. Thuderclap increases social reach. Fair enough though.I'm not taking pre-orders. Thats what this avoids me doing. I do have the first 50 Flipcard USBs in stock, as I already stated.I'm keeping 2 of then for myself, 10 are going to techbytes and 5 are going to FiniteByDesign. 15 are allocated to the forum comp. (the other 15 are the old 2 GB stock) So, that means I've got 18 left to sell out of the first 50 batch right now. Well techbytes, we still have 2 days left for the thunderclap: 24 of 100 supporters, so we just need another 76 twitter accounts to follow / link the app by:Time Left - 2 days - Ends Nov 23, 4:00 PM EST - http://thndr.it/1aVQ4gRThis sends a re-tweet for the indiegogo project which still has 9 days left to run:http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/digitalcoin-portable-usb-flipcardCrowdfunding was supposed to provide an easy way to buy the DGC USB's really, because all funding is kept and 1 pledge = 1x DGC USB.Also on bitcoinstarter.com with 1 pledge: https://bitcoinstarter.com/projects/279  So, at least 1 person likes the idea - lol Its really about the production costs. I paid for a stock of 50 up front, which just about gives room for some profit after shipping costs and my time.I've had them printed to support and advertise DGC really, but as a business model it only really works if the production print run is at least 500 to 1000+ units.Hence the fairly high amount for the indiegogo target figure.When DGC is more popular then yes I'm also sure that I could perhaps be selling more of them with higher DGC denominations as well.The crowdfunding projects were to help ensure I would clear the 1st batch of stock and could order more, whilst generating some additonal interest in digitalcoin. These crowdfunding projects normally get most contributions towards the end, but its not looking very hopeful currently. I was thinking a black logo would stand out the best, although I agree that the vector logo in grey that you sent to me could look really cool.The metallic shine tilts in a similar way as the reflection on say a vinyl disc.It might be possible to get them printed and shipped in time for the holiday season, but it really depends on the work load for the print company. Thats what the 'print run' is LaudaM - Yes they would come with the CGB logo printed on them. The image above is to present and discuss options. Its also possible to add the CGB wallet running only from the USB drive and for it to come pre-loaded with some CGB. Price point is completely dependent on the drive capacity and the print run. However, 16 GB at a min. print run of 50 should be around $25 to $35 US max. with shipping included. A larger print run and lower capacity storage USB is a lot less expensive. If folks just want a back-up device for a wallet then 1 GB or 2 GB is the way to go.Only looking to cover costs with a small amount of profit really - things and time cost money though.We are probably looking at January 2014 for production and shipping.I can obviously offer a discount structure for bulk purchase. Not always. The 10 blocks I found in the pool did not earn me the same amount of CGB paid out in shares - if I had found the 10 blocks solo mining ! I've recently had some promotional USB Flashdrives printed for digitalcoin DGC See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=324420.0where you currently have a day or so left to try and win one - before the existing stock goes on sale directly.Anyway, I've discussed having a batch printed for CGB. Here is the metalic base USB that I've selected for a test print run:Again, these are intended as back-up devices or storage for your wallet. They are not mining devices.It is possible to create a Portable version of the CGB software to run from the USB perhaps including a pre-loaded CGB wallet, which does really require a min. 16 GB capacity.Although, as a promotional USB device or wallet back-up sizes can range from just 1 GB to 8 GB, which are obviously a lot cheaper to produce.Would members of the CGB community be interested in purchasing such a USB product ? What is the preferred storage capacity ?Printed using the standard CGB logo ? or printed in back or white to stand out better ?I've already approached forum member Finitebydesign to do US distribution, as I'm based in the UK to cover Europe and worldwide.Cheers! Mining CGB with around 500 kh/s to dedicate at present.Found about 10 blocks for a pool in 3 days with some downtime, so decided to give solo mining a try.Anyway, 2 blocks found in less than 24hrs with a better return at present, did I just get lucky or with this hashrate at this difficulty is solo mining actually a good option ! I'll certainly give it another 48 hrs.   I posted a budget / entry level DDR3 build on the digitalcoin forum: http://digitalcoin.co/forums/index.php/topic,101.msg898.html#msg898The price of these components is also dropping and you can increase the graphics mining capabilities with: SAPPHIRE R7 250 2GB DDR3 WITH BOOST.This build was designed with power saving in mind though, whilst being a multi-mining / quality PC also.You would be better off going with a USB ASIC (i.e. as many cheap Block Eruptors as you can) for mining PPC (peercoin) and not really bothering with graphic card mining.However, if you need a quality low-end budget PC to run them from that can also mine some other scrypt coins and a few additional PPC then thats not a bad build. You would get a fair amount of Primecoin with CPU mining too, if properly overclocked that Trinity Quad Core can reach 5GHz CPU mining with air cooling.Best way is to shop around for cheap components.There is always something to be said for using quality architecture for overclocking, even at budget / entry level.As you have free electricity you have many options for a better build. Indeed. I know full well what that feels like.When I sent you prices in EUR and USD it was to give you an indication for conversion.I'll happily accept DGC, BTC, LTC, CGB, SRC and consider most other alt. coins to.This first (and only ?) batch was more expensive on the initial print run, as before, but I still think the price as per. the indiegogo is reasonable, as shipping is included. Its a promotional item afterall. I can do a discount as before on more than one Flashdrive. I was just printing some labels to send you a couple of samples for being a previous customer techbytes. I've got to ship some more off tommorrow anyway. I'm sure we an discuss some sort of deal / discount on a few more.  
I do have an initial stock of 50 that I'll be selling in due course.The whole idea of this is to create additional interest in DGC through promoting a crowdfunding project.Do you think that 15 BTC was alot in 2010 ? This is how you create value and worth for your coins - or try to anyway.

To true. I also choose to make this post for historical purposes. Thank you I guess.Its hard to portray to people today that when I donated 500 BTC its wasn't worth anything.I did think at the time that one day I might regret it and perhaps I should keep it, but it took another year or so for some of my personal predictions for Bitcoin to take hold and for Bitcoin to start being more widely accepted.I did intended to be able to mine more, but for various reasons it wasn't to be.We continue ! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=183.msg7536#msg7536With Bitcoins value currently at an all time high its increasingly difficult for myself to accept my 500 BTC donation to the first faucet.This is now a life changing sum of money for anyone.As someone who has struggled for years with various IT projects and who fell on hard times, its really sad not to have this kind of capital available.It's not so much the money, its really more about the missed opportunities and potential as to what I could now do with that kind of money i.e. the projects I could easily start, the people I could employ, the projects I could of helped other people to start or the charities and individuals I could of donated to, not least some members of my extended family who are quite ill. For myself, it would just be good to be debt free again and to be able to properly focus once more on the work and things that I'm good at.Anyway, there are many more people in this world in a fair worse situation than myself. Although, I don't think there can be many of this world who can say that they once made a monetary donation that was larger than all of the money they ever had or probably ever will have.I continue to mine Bitcoin and support alternative currencies along with everyone else and maybe someday I'll be able to find some luck once more, but I'll also continue to work to make my own luck.Oh well, I guess that some of us were just here to soon... "C'est la vie".Although it does feel rather good to know that you were mostly right from the outset. Bitcoin at these prices is still a good thing.Congratulations Satoshi (and others) ! So far, so good ! Hopefully we will all still be around when BTC1 = $10,000 (If dollars are still around then ofc).It only happens if people make it happen afterall, well supposedly.    Bitbar had a big pre-mine and is perhaps to rare.Devcoins are OK, but if you want the best chance for a good % increase on your $100 bucks then right now I'll stick with suggesting GCB. I'd go with CryptogenicBullion. If your not mining then at least you can get some PoS (Proof-of-Stake) interest, while your waiting for the price to rise.Rarity and Scarcity being your best option.

Some good advice here.digitalcoin (DCG) - your checking account with some interest over time. digitalcoin could become very spendable in the near future.CryptoGenicBullion (CGB) - your high-interest savings account or even your very own bank vault.These are two very different coins with strong and growing community support. Hedging both of these coins now is unlikely to be a bad decision in a year to two years time. However, there are other good choices and you should spread your portfolio.Personally, I would advise people to avoid goldcoin. I've considered its reward structure and future position in the market place and its hopeless. Its a real shame that such a good name for a coin has been adopted by this one. http://cryptolife.net/goldcoin-the-scam-that-keeps-on-giving/Peercoin, Primecoin, Litecoin and Securecoin are all good coins.eMunie is going to be big.I'd be more of a fan of Worldcoin, but I just prefer digitalcoin. Oh, and don't overlook Anoncoin ! Well I have a long history with bitcoin and forex trading, also meeting most of your other requirements.I've designed various profitable MT4 grid, scalper and swing trading systems (which I do trade with myself) and can demonstrate that I'm a long-term profitable trader on some micro and cent accounts.I'm not sure where you are looking for a BTC/LTC robot to trade exactly, but I have various systems that I was looking to start tuning and testing for profitability with MT4 on BTC/USD over at btc-e See: https://btc-e.com/news/183If your looking for API functionality directly at exchanges then it would be good to have someone else onboard, mainly due to time constraints, but if you need profitable trading strategies to adapt then I'm certainly in the market for a capital investor.

I don't use the pirate bay, but when using BitTorrent its probably best to use a good VPN.Tor should not really be used to try and download torrents (clogging an anonymity network is bad karma), but its OK for downloading the .torrent files.You need Peerblock for P2P - even Bitcoin and Litecoin etc. (which is why I decided to post in this thread).Peerblock - http://www.peerblock.com/iblocklists - https://www.iblocklist.com/lists.phpMost of the bluetack lists unfortunately have not been updated in a long time and are outdated and somewhat inaccurate.The other I-Blocklists, TBG, CI Army and malc0de lists are updated currently. The best lists are subscription based.I'd recommend deleting the default Peerblock lists and blocking 'Primary Threats' , 'Hijacked' , 'Malicious' (CI Army) , 'malc0de' and the other I-Blocklists.Linux users can do the same with Peer Guardian (ex MoBlock).

DGC to the Moon !!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPWucqna9Eg~ During a visit to the NASA space center in 1962, President Kennedy noticed a janitor carrying a broom.  He interrupted his tour, walked over to the man and said, Hi, Im Jack Kennedy. What are you doing?The janitor responded, Im helping put a man on the moon, Mr. President.      Keep having the same issue. It's mostly related to the increasing size of wallet.datBack-up wallet.dat and delete everything except your huntercoin.confRe-download the blockchain - close the client and replace the blank wallet - re-start the client, maybe with -salvagewalletSeems to work well for me. I'm trying to move all my chars. back to the spawn area to bank and send my coins to a fresh wallet to start again with just a few chars. Increasing wallet size from the 1000's of transactions from player movements is a major issue.This is one reason why proof-of-stake might be a good idea for this coin, for those that can operate a dedicated banking / mining / savings wallet or node - in addition to a gaming wallet. However, it could also make the problem worse.Maybe this would be better as a CPU only coin. I quite like the idea of limiting the number of mining threads in each client.I still think that the map needs to be reduced in size with some coin generation areas that are more random. With a larger player base and lower 'human' based player rewards, this will actually make coins more difficult to gather ihmo.@snailbrain - I have 1 character in my wallet with an error message when I try to move it. Something about the coins not being in my wallet. I'll clear my other players to spawn and transfer my balance to a new wallet, if you want to take a look at the wallet. Sadley I've cleared the debug logs. Quite probably. I'm actually thinking that the map does not need to be this big. There should be more coin collection areas with a greater distribution of coins. More spawn points are also needed and perhaps the map can be more maze like if reduced in size too.

If I can get my wallet backup I'll send you some coins.Might need to wait for my 100 chars. to reach there destination first though, if at all.  I think the re-sync is failing because my client wallet is basically being spammed with transactions i.e. the player moves.Everyone else able to sync-up and play OK still ? Seems that the waypoints are a destination and the player moves go into the blockchain each round until the target destination is reached.I created about 100 yellow chars. and set them all moving at once from one wallet to see what would happen. The 1000's of transactions have crashed my client and corrupted my wallet.  I installed and synced a fresh wallet on a different machine and put some hash rate to it.dns=1dnsseed=1discover=1listen=1addnode=80.229.2.127Currently trying to re-sync my main game wallet on another PC after doing a -salvagewallet although the 3rd attempt just failed. Going to try downloading a fresh blockchain with a clean wallet and then replacing the wallet.Having a different encrypted banking wallet is certainly a very good idea, as snailbrain has suggested.After playing on one wallet for some time, its probably going to be necessary to cash-in and move funds to a new wallet to start playing again. Having thousands of transactions in one wallet increase load over time.This is a great experiment though. Very cool. Youre welcome.

Those who forget that are greedy, evil, mostly-capitalist-fools.Bitcoins, Alt. coins, Pizzas and Haircuts. - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=323188... text that was on the original bitcoin.org website and was probably written by Satoshi ...No mention whatsover of big business, corporations, investment banksters etc. - just of hard working people in a local economy, providing goods and services, using a better form of 'money'. I personally stopped linking any alt. coins future worth or current exchange value directly with Bitcoin exchange sometime ago.Whilst the BTC/DGC , BTC/LTC etc. exchange value is obviously very important it is certainly not the be all and end all.The very fact that DGC held strong, stable and level during the recent BTC price rally clearly demonstrates that all is well with digitalcoin.If Bitcoin is the kernel, then alt. coin are like distros.Bitcoin is on its way to becoming a de-(centralized ?) store of wealth and Litecoin is probably heading that way as well in terms of 'gold' vs 'silver'.Digitalcoin is designed for making fast transactions over being a store of wealth. Sure, I'm guessing that holding a fair number of DGC is probably a very good investment for the future. Its unlikely that DGC will ever have a value above BTC, thats really not the aim here, digitalcoin is about making transactions and being spendable. Digitalcoin therefore should see better price stability and as wider adoption increases the price should also rise against both BTC and fiat currency.Vlad2Vlad had advocated ixcoin to myself in a thread a few days ago, because of its similarity / differences to Bitcoin (which is fine and I do merge mine a few of those myself). My interest in DGC is not just about seeking big returns, its also about continuing to make better, faster and safer 'money' for the masses. What Bitcoin aimed to offer from the outset and what it still does offer people today.The digitalcoin community understands this and supports what DGC has the potential to accomplish. Just look back in the thread over the last few weeks - new online web wallets, smart phone apps. and portable USB products are being created by the growing DGC community with active marketing and support, outside of crypto forums. I don't see this actively happening with very many other alt. coins currently in quite the same way.Lastly, If you want a coin thats similar to Bitcoin and stands a good chance of going somewhere, then with the launch of CryptoAve exchange soon you probably wouldn't go a miss checking out Securecoin.  
Yep the testnet client is stalled. Tried setting up another node and hashing on that as well with a few more BE's, the chain might of forked.

Unlucky for some.ixcoin as in http://www.ixcoin.org/ - Really ?I already merge mine a few of those. Going to read the official thread. Please point me to one of your posts regarding your theories on ixcoin. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172664.0..."The crypto model adopted by bitcoin is inherently 'unfair' and 'flawed' imho, just like in capitalism where the already rich and powerful become increasingly richer and more powerful at the expense of others. We are already seeing this with bitcoin. Soon, (if not already) only established and large corporations, big banks, already very wealthy individuals, governments and nation states, with access to super computers will be the only people able to generate any bitcoins. This 'free market' will be totally monopolized, this has already started to happen." - Myself ...This entire post makes for an uncomfortable read, I wrote it around the time of the bubble crash not long after returning to this forum. I didn't even include the effects of protocol failure, I just described the entire model over time. At that time I don't think many really appreciated what I actually ment by a very long time.There's a youtube video where Gavin describes the certainty of centralization and that us 'home' bitcoin miners and the community at large are not really going to like it very much when it happens. If bitcoin does gain mass adoption with said transaction volume then its really a given - very similar to what Vlad2Vlad is saying.financialcryptography.com "Where the crypto rubber meets the Road of Finance..." Its fun to be part of the experiment though, right ?   You can checkout the thread post to try and win one through completing the social media tasks and supporting the indiegogo project or I should have some for sale on various websites in a day or two. I can also sell you one for DGC or BTC or SRC if you send me a PM. Got about 50 in stock currently of the 16GB Flipcards. Sure. You are welcome.Infact, I've just done some testing with both browsers and also tried switching user agents.NoScript and the TorButton addon defaults in the Tor Browser Bundle (as FirefoxESR Portable) scored:"Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys 17.53 bits of identifying information."JonDoBrowser out-of-the-box (Firefox 24) scored:"Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys 13.95 bits of identifying information."Switching user agents seems to give a generic score of 21.77 bits of identifying information.For the traffic analysis reasons regarding JonDo 2 hop proxies that I described in my above post. It would seem that the best combination for privacy, anonymity and security would infact be the JonDoBrowser routed through Tor (not JAP) using my xeronet Tor config. or one similar.EDIT: The latest Tor Browser Bundle release with Firefox 24 ESR has the lowest score, if you disable JavaScript - see below posts.The main issue with the Tor Bundle Browser identifiers relate to it being based on FirefoxESR.See: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/I'm guessing I'll be able to find a browser configuration and plugins combination that will give a lower score than both of these browser configurations, although most of the remaining identifiers actually only relate to screen size, choice of language-pack and to which browser is the most popular at any given time. You are correct with regards to browser fingerprint tracking being difficult to avoid. Also See: https://wiki.mozilla.org/FingerprintingSome of the identfiers are actually potentially increased when using anonymity software itself.Interesting article: http://www.idcloak.com/learning-center/noscript-chrome-noscript-firefox-browser-fingerprint-protection/a583.htmlMaking your browser seem more generic can be advantageous. Continually spoofing your browser agent is also an option.See: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/See: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-overrider/See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agentUse of the updated Tor Browser Bundle Portable is still going to be the easiest option for most. I stated that JonDoBrowser has a free and paid version.JonDoBrowser is not based on Tor, it only has the option to use Tor servers instead of the JonDo servers aka JAP. JonDoBrowser does not include Tor by default and nor does it use any Tor servers by default.My browser ? The xeronet Torrc config. file for the Tor Browser Bundle is to demonstrate the use of custom circuits and routing. So, you can use whatever browser, settings or plugins you want with Tor and the config. You could use the JonDoBrowser, install Tor and edit the default conf. with the xeronet Torrc settings and select to use the Tor network in the JonDoBrowser, if you feel that browser is better at hiding the '21 unique identifying pieces of info.' that the EFF projects checks. I'll run some tests as well. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=324420.0More support is required please. Just 100 thunderclap supporters are needed to increase the chance of getting the indiegogo project funded.I'll start sending some tweets about where folks can buy some DGC and links to favourable articles and blogs etc.   Anymore for anymore ?All support is appreciated. Just 100 thunderclap supporters are needed to increase the chance of getting the indiegogo project funded.  EDIT: Example torrc config. removed due to being outdated in the latest Tor Browser Bundle 3.5 release - see OP. I've had not tired JonDoBrowser or JonDoFox for over a year or so now. So, I downloaded the latest release for comparison.JonDo (formerly JAP) is a 2-hop mixing service. Default Tor (and the 1st config. for Tor that I posted) is a 3-hop proxy.There is a very good reason why you must use 3 hop proxies for true anonymity i.e. A doesn't know who C is. B knows A and C, but doesn't know you or your destination.The free mixes (hops) available with JAP are (currently) as follows:Germany > Internet (original "Dresden (JAP)"Germany > Czech Republic or United KingdomGermany > United States or AustriaGermany > France or United StatesLuxemburg or Bulgaria > France or United StatesCanada or Germany > United States or United KingdomUnited States or Germany > USATherefore, it is practically impossible to avoid the 'FiveEyes' countires hosting JonDo nodes. When I have used JonDo (free) servers in the past for browsing I found it to be slower than Tor. Today it was actually quite fast. However, the mixes have available slots ranging from 400 to 1000 and most were around 2/3 full on average, when most of the US was offline. The more users at anyone time, obviously the slower the JonDo free service becomes. I'd imagine that the paid version avoids this slowdown issue. Although, the less users that are in the mix, the less anonymous you become.Also, when you purchase a commercial product you somewhat relinquish your anonymity, especially with a subscription product such as a VPN. This is something which is quite surprisingly overlooked by most people. Tor is free and open source.Browser 'fingerprinting' is not really an issue with either Tor or JonDo privacy / anonymity solutions. Tor provides much better anonymity and flexibility over JonDo imho, both out-of-the-box and/or when using my xeronet Torrc config. Both Tor and JonDo provide better anonymity and privacy over regular internet browsing without a proxy.A lot of research and knowledge of both the Tor network and online privacy / anonymity / censorship circumvention has gone into this config. For example, some fast Tor servers have intentionally been omitted from the config. so that they are more likely to be randomly selected as Middle Nodes. For regular internet browsing this config. is perhaps the best example of the off-set found between speed and anonymity when using Tor.Some from the Tor project have argued that my xeronet Torrc config. might carry an increased 'fingerprint' in terms of network analysis. I in fact consider it to have less of a fingerprint than the default Tor config. and I've started doing metrics to demonstrate this. Using EntryGuards has obvious advantages.One of the main issues with Tor is that most Tor network traffic is easily recognisable on ports 9001 and 9030, setting FascistFirewall 1 is a good way to overcome this for regular browsing, as your first hop will only be on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https). If your not intending to access any Tor hidden services, then setting StrictNodes 1 can also make browsing somewhat faster. To me it makes a lot of sense to tell Tor which servers are the fastest Entry and Exit nodes and also which servers / locations to avoid for numerous reasons. Some Tor servers are malicious and/or badly misconfigured. My config. avoids those nodes as well.If you don't like anything in my Torrc then you are of course free to edit it, add remove bridge nodes, entry nodes, exit nodes etc. etc. That's the idea really. In fact, it makes more sense for everyone to use a slight variation of the config. and to occasionally mix-it-up.Remember: "Tor can't help you if you use it wrong!"   Thought that some of you in this thread might appreciate my xeronet torrc config.Advanced Tor Browser Bundle config. - Anti-Spying - Anti-ECHELON - Anti-FiveEyesSee: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=331077.0  Someone contacted me regarding the PirateBrowser see: http://piratebrowser.com/"PirateBrowser is a bundle package of the Tor client (Vidalia), FireFox Portable browser (with foxyproxy addon) and some custom configs that allows you to circumvent censorship that certain countries such as Iran, North Korea, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Italy and Ireland impose onto their citizens."The torrc additions are as follows:Code:# Configured for speed ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0EnforceDistinctSubnets 0AllowSingleHopCircuits 1# Exclude countries that might have blocksExcludeExitNodes {dk},{ie},{gb},{be},{it},{cn},{ir},{fi},{no}As they state on their website the Pirate Browser's focus is on censorship circumvention as opposed to better overall anonymity provided by the default Tor browser bundle.

If ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set to 0, these relays will be included. Note that these relays might be at higher risk of being seized or observed, so they are not normally included. Also note that relatively few clients turn off this option, so using these relays might make your client stand out. (Default: 1)"EnforceDistinctSubnets"If 1, Tor will not put two servers whose IP addresses are "too close" on the same circuit. Currently, two addresses are "too close" if they lie in the same /16 range.

Currently set to 0 'default'."If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is necessary to perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfil a .exit request, upload directory information, or download directory information. (Default: 0)"You can set StrictNodes to 1 to make browsing faster and completely avoid 'FiveEyes' and internet censored countries, but it will 'break' hidden services if they are located in one of those blocked countries. ~ Ever wondered how the security services locate Tor 'hidden services' ... hummm.Use FascistFirewall 1 to force port 80 (http) and port 443 (https) access."If 1, Tor will only create outgoing connections to ORs running on ports that your firewall allows (defaults to 80 and 443; see FirewallPorts). This will allow you to run Tor as a client behind a firewall with restrictive policies, but will not allow you to run as a server behind such a firewall. If you prefer more fine-grained control, use ReachableAddresses instead."When using this option do make sure that your selected Nodes use port 80 and/or port 443 Also, if your firewall does allow other ports (or you want to connect other applications to Tor) then we do recommend changing FascistFirewall back to 0, as this will automatically 'unlock' additional fast entry nodes already included in the xeronet Torrc list.Use UseEntryGuards 1 for increased security."If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term entry servers, and try to stick with them. This is desirable because constantly changing servers increases the odds that an adversary who owns some servers will observe a fraction of your paths. (Defaults to 1 anyway)"Use ClientOnly 1 for the Tor Browser Bundle."If set to 1, Tor will under no circumstances run as a server or serve directory requests. The default is to run as a client unless ORPort is configured. (Usually, you dont need to set this; Tor is pretty smart at figuring out whether you are reliable and high-bandwidth enough to be a useful server.) (Default: 0)"Using additional LongLivedPorts 80, 443, 9001 and 9030."A list of ports for services that tend to have long-running connections (e.g. chat and interactive shells). Circuits for streams that use these ports will contain only high-uptime nodes, to reduce the chance that a node will go down before the stream is finished. Note that the list is also honoured for circuits (both client and service side) involving hidden services whose virtual port is in this list.

Thanks digitalindustry. I've conceived another name, which also uses some alliteration.CryptoCAPs   Still undecided though personally.   Perhaps we have all overlooked the most obvious choice, which also uses alliteration and therefore has a good ring to it ...CryptoCAPs    Yep. Great post. CapCoin is a good name. Simple and effective is often the best choice. RiseupVPN beta if you are able to get an account is ok: https://help.riseup.net/en/vpnproXPN http://www.proxpn.com/ still has free accounts, I've not used it recently though.VPNSecure.me https://www.vpnsecure.me/ has a free ad-supported version now with limited servers.None of them are really for torrents though. Hear, hear - Satoshi's work maybe be open source, but it was obviously first developed in private before release.The industry is very different now, Fuserleer's approach seems both fair and sensible in the long-term. I've run several of the eMunie beta releases now and I have to say that each one has seen both feature rich improvements and increased network stability and security in each version.I don't see eMunie as a threat to Bitcoin or even to the good alt. coins.eMunie feels like it could fit in very well and provide much innovation, perhaps somewhere between Bitcoin / Paypal and other exchanges for the masses.Its certainly not a 'funny-e-munie'. This could be really great for everyone ! I can fully understand why the dev. is having to keep it closed source for now. waqas - 15 DGC sent.

So please log into twitter and click the support button on the link above.  Again, this is a great advertising opportunity for digitalcoin and crypto alts. in general. I notice folks are often sending a retweet in support, but are not always linking the app. which is essential for the thunderclap promotion to activate. Currently 17% with 15 days to go.Thanks ! I'm not the one making any decision, just suggesting alternatives.I wouldn't recommend changing the CAP currency symbol at this stage though. Just suggested some alternatives in the main thread after putting my thinking cap on.  A new name;(1) Must associate value and worth in this increasingly competitive market.(2) Should not detract to much from the original theme / name to remain recognizable.(3) Should incorporate the PoS 'savings' aspect over time.CAPs as in - Capsule - a Time Capsule.GoldenCAPsDigitalCAPsDigiCAPsTimeCAPseCAPs Moving with the thread role, added some alternatives from my last post one page back...GoldenCAPsDigitalCAPsDigiCAPsTimeCAPseCAPs Agreed. I put my thinking cap on.  A new name;(1) Must associate value and worth in this increasingly competitive market.(2) Should not detract to much from the original theme / name to remain recognizable.(3) Should incorporate the PoS 'savings' aspect over time.GoldenCAPs ?CAPs as in - Capsule - a Time Capsule.I think this is a workable name and introduces a more marketable concept.Also thinking about digital gold i.e. DigitalCaps, or just DigiCAPs ? TimeCAPs ? eCAPs ? I will make reference to the original gldcoin forum thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=205789.msg2414861#msg2414861Which clearly demonstrates that Microguy and AZIZ1977 were well aware of my username here on bitcointalk.orgThe folks at Wikipedia have already identified these actions as ' sock puppetry '.I offered my help and support at one time, but I will have nothing further to do with Goldcoin. Good luck. When Goldcoin was fairly new - I expressed an interest in Goldcoin and offered some support on one of their 1st forums.Anyway, I recently re-registered on the current forum and began to discuss with Microguy about my XAUUSD FX trading.I later discovered the following post regarding ' Goldcoin on Wikipedia ' See: https://www.gldtalk.org/index.php?topic=690.msg3784#msg3784Clearly members of this community have used my bitcointalk.org handle to post their own wiki entries. I have never submitted anything to any wiki on behalf of the Goldcoin community or otherwise.I posted about this in the thread and politely asked why? Anyway, my posts were deleted twice regarding this issue and my user account has now been 'banned'.Not exactly a scam, although apparently just a coincidence according to Microguy and AZIZ1977 Satoshi Nakamoto is Charlie Wong ... 100% proof ...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhMV37a7xmYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl1nPssCL1Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nlQH5pycp4     https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/1438-thebottlebank/Liquidity, liquidity, liquidity - CAP is great!  I don't really like banks or centralization... but perhaps its worth a shot ?

Without the goods and services that create 'economy' in the first place we in fact discredit our means of exchange. Think about the central banks just printing more money in our currently broken fiat economies! The bankers who have created and traded fake derivatives on top of fake derivatives only to make this situation worse. Again, we must listen to Satoshi. Great alt. coin. Its a Securecoin, you know!  I have just one always on multi-CPU PC that's worth mining with and I've mined this coin since launch.So, I'm not biased in anyway ofc. Oh, did I mention - Its a Securecoin.  "Don't put all your eggs into one basket."~ To avoid this situation we require more than one egg and more than one basket.  When I returned to this forum I worried that the plethora of alt. coins were stealing liquidity from the Bitcoin market with new exchanges being based in BTC i.e. BTC/LTC etc. Although a logical progression I think this partly explains the recent down trend, actually it was a major factor.In terms of fiat we are all aware (or should be aware) that Bitcoin does in fact have comparatively low levels of market liquidity.Alt. coins are a double edge sword. Some will rise, some will fall and others will completely disappear. The markets and the people will decide which flavor they like best. If bitcoin is the kernel then alt. coins are like distros !Do these numerous alt. coins (and associated markets) reduce bitcoins credibility or actually increase exposure ? Therefore, isn't an 'alt. coin for everyone' just long-term beneficial for bitcoin and crypto ? Undoubtedly, bitcoin is currently positioned at the center of these new markets. I see 'money' flowing into crypto-currencies from all sides and most importantly out of fiat.Money is only really money when its moving. I've said it many times.A couple of billionaires can easily move money into Bitcoin and create market liquidity (some did). However, we will only really know that were getting somewhere when a billion people have moved at least a dollar into crypto (and spend it).I say create as many alt. coins as humanly possible until the world wakes up to the fact that fiat money is broken and ridiculous.Be your own bank. Make whatever 'money' you want (the corrupt capitalist overloads do this anyway). Free software for freedom. Free money for everyone.In the early days of bitcoin I said that the best way forward would be to get as many people as possible to start using bitcoin as quickly as possible. I'll stand by that. No money without the majority. I don't have much to do with Bitcoin really, aside from my own advertising and ofc mining it again.Still trading the forex markets on micro accounts and building automated trading robots.Working on a homebrew scrypt FPGA project, a big internet privacy project and some other stuff. What like 'crazy' low ? http://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/Exchange+Ratehttp://newlibertystandard.wikifoundry.com/page/2009+Exchange+Rate   Kramer on CNBC said "Hit the BUY BUY BUY button"  ...Trading what you think...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktKNEGSqLB4 I've started promoting the digitalcoin - Portable USB project on indiegogo.com via my proxy websites:http://www.xeronet-proxy.orghttp://www.xeronet-proxy.bizhttp://www.xeronet-proxy.infohttp://www.xeronet-proxy.nethttp://www.xeronet-proxy.comSee the main project page here: http://igg.me/at/digitalcoin-usb/x/5215693 - Again, backing for the project ends on Sat. 30th November 2013.Anyone with a website or blog can embed the standard indiegogo widget to support the project and help to promote digitalcoin to the masses.Code: <iframe src="http://www.indiegogo.com/project/573323/widget" width="224px" height="486px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>If you would prefer to use the floating ad that I've created for above websites then please contact me via PM.I'll allocate a number of 16GB Flashdrives to anyone that promotes this widget for the duration of the funding period.

This offer is completely separate to indiegogo and from the new stock....On a separate note if the community would be able to crowdfund my Bitcoinstarter project very quickly, then driving mass traffic to further promote the indiegogo project and digitalcoin long-term can easily be accomplished. See: https://bitcoinstarter.com/projects/191Cheers! No. That was laszlo. I was on this forum back then though and I did offer to buy laszlo the infamous pizza.  See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1183#msg1183The pizza was purchased by someone else. With Bitcoins changing hands and private PM's at that time I only really give myself the permission to jest about indirectly purchasing a slice of said pizza - as per my current form sig.As someone once said Bitcoins for pizza ? or Pizza for Bitcoins ? Its a mystery.No one involved with crypto-currencies or this forum really owes me anything. The price is the price, right!For various reasons, I'm one of the few early adopters who sadly didn't make it big. I'm here again to do my bit. I'm continually pursuing new ideas and concepts for crypto related projects and online privacy in general that I hope to make a reality some day soon. I'll work to earn my way up the bitcoin ladder again - its more interesting I guess.Having the 2nd post in this thread is more of an honor for me than the whole pizza debacle - Topic: Welcome to the new Bitcoin forum!See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5.msg188#msg188  (I do wonder exactly who was on the old Bitcoin forum   )Some folks had to be the first forum members and I just so happen to be one of them. How randomly I discovered Bitcoin is sometimes of question even to myself. At one time I think the way back machine's stats show me as the 4th (or something) most active contributor to this forum - mostly ramblings. However, much of the potential for bitcoin and crypto-currency that was discussed in those early days - i'm pleased to know has since been made a reality by others. Anyway, I digress and we all contiune ...I remain the multiple and the multiplex.   I'm pleased to announce that I've successfully added the digitalcoin - Portable USB project to indiegogo.comSee: http://igg.me/at/digitalcoin-usb/x/5215693Backing for the project ends 32 days from today on Sat. 30th November 2013.Please tell your family, friends and co-workers. Tweet about it, blog about it and/or anything else you can think of to promote the project and to further support digitalcoin.Any questions, comments or suggestions please send me a PM (preferably via the digitalcoin forum).digitalcoin forum topic: http://digitalcoin.co/forums/index.php/topic,203.0.htmlThank you for your support.   Not that much difference really I guess. You can aim to make blocking visitors as user friendly as possible though.  I was going to offer to accept your redirects perhaps. I'm fairly sure that the free version of Blocked.com® blocks Tor exit nodes by 'default' for a certain number of requests per month.See: http://www.blocked.com/pricing.php...iblocklist.com has a Tor node list that you could block with .htaccessSee: https://www.iblocklist.com/lists.php?category=organizations  (The Onion Router).Most main Tor exit nodes don't change IP. You could probably update it around once a month. Do you want to just block traffic and/or redirect it ? Yes your probably right in respect of comparatively low-volume / slow-moving crypto markets.Short term quick gains with 'ping pong' are more viable I guess, a bit like scalping systems in forex. I'm interested in using MACD to try and identify pivot points and trend reversals, basically making a long-term buy a short term sell and vice versa, potentially making said system more accurate.I've done a lot of work on MACD in FX over the last 5 years, mostly unpublished, but I have a very solid, optimized and profitable private trading system. Well, so far so good anyway. From 'Modern Money Mechanics':A 'Bank' must: "maintain legally required reserves equal to a prescribed percentage of its deposits." This is usually no more than 10%This theory could and should be employed by institutions and exchanges for PoS generation on 'hot' wallets etc.Ofc at least 10% of total customer deposits held and a reservebalance= %PoS generation can be more interesting this way on personal balances too i.e. 10% , 20% , 30% to 90%, although perhaps not literally  As I described before a: 'Frequency of proof-of-stake', prescribed by a % of eligible stake balance.You don't need to generate all eligible stake at once, in terms of the network, it's in fact better if you don't, as we have seen recently.This can help to avoid PoS clustering and smooth difficulty ? I'm in and bid 0.32 BTCWhat's the CPU load like and or recommended RAM requirement etc. ?EDIT: 'Ping-Pong' strategy. What technical algo's are you using ?I'd be interested in trying to implement something using MACD signals.
Thank you for the update with BottleCaps V1.5 - mullick, John's and others.  My BottleCaps coin wallet's appear to be updating OK.addnode=80.229.2.127which is currently downloading a fresh blockchain with 24 connections already - it takes a while to write to the SD card on an old Asus Eee PC, although it runs stable once downloaded.  Updated the link to V1.5 on the free web proxy: http://bottlecaps.cc.aiAgain, its a rather random free domain name, although the proxy host is a good one. If it gets enough traffic I'll consider registering a TLD. I'll start promoting it to some lists within 24hrs. Also changed the pool link to http://cap.coinmine.pl - will bottlecapspool.com be back online soon ?Cheers! The addnode I posted has 87 connections now. Ooops yes that's correct 0.05 too. addnode=80.229.2.127I'm correctly port forwarded with 70+ connections currently. No coins are stored at that IP folks !I'd recommend adding;dns=1listen=1dnsseed=1maxconnections=100Good job btw Baritus - nice launch !Crazy number of orphan blocks at the start to be expected I guess. Network seems to be very stable now.EDIT: Block rewards were actually 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.25 , 0.50 , 1.00 , 2.00 ...    Its this v1.4.2 release by mullick (i.e. the same person that posted v1.4.1). I'm guessing the OP will be updated soon enough... I don't store any coins in the wallet at the static IP I posted above, so...    Updated to BottleCaps v1.4.2 and seem to be correctly in sync currently.addnode=80.229.2.127gen=0dns=1dnsseed=1listen=1port=7685maxconnections=100Port correctly forwarded.I've updated the download link at http://bottlecaps.cc.ai to v.1.4.2 Good Job on the v1.4.1 BottleCaps release!

In regards to market and exchange liquidity I'd say your best options for GPU mining are Peercoin (PPCoin - PPC) and digitalcoin (DGC).Both have excellent / active developers and strong community support.

Premium Hugshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-TT1STMos  mullick has kindly provided me with a download link to a fresh windows compile for BottleCaps-qt.exe which has solved the 'crash' issues that I reported earlier in this thread with v1.4 when using encrypted wallets.I'm sure that BottleCaps will be fully back on track soon and that issues with PoS / transaction fees should also be sorted out in the future releases. PMmRq3R1tyoda5pDxiquPRebD1PZBBXRdvSign it is!      I've got some ebay auctions up and running for the 2GB digitialcoin USB Flashdrives I've had printed.Please see the digitalcoin forum community thread for more info. here: http://digitalcoin.co/forums/index.php/topic,99.0.htmlI'll get some up on the DGC market sometime tomorrow probably.Thanks. I believe in Cosmic Ordering - https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_OrderingNo I do. I really do ...   Sure. I'll have a read of that sometime. I'm not looking to create another coin though.I'm considering a mining pool that includes PoW and PoS rewards for the benefit of the miners, 'savers', the pool owner and also increases the security of the network and the pool node.With a coins PoS >2% (5% planned implementation for CAPs) it is possible for a PoW pool to offer additional incentives and rewards. Pools often have a fixed fee or % donation / contribution. Why not add a simple PoW % savings option on mined coins for a % share PoS payout on existing reserves, much like banks do, with a user specified duration and the principal sum also being returned.I have a theoretical way to maximize PoS (or at least to ensure the upper bound reward over time) on balances, which I must first test. We can perhaps increase the 'Frequency of Proof-of-Stake'. At worst it is beneficial to network and pools security / stability.Basically a fairly large balance would be equally spread across multiple wallets as the pools 'Reserve Repositories' eligible for PoS minting already with 30 days coin age. The % of reservebalance= in the .conf would be changed after each PoS minting so that there are always more coins to be staked again and again within a 30 day period.A fixed % of the PoS reward goes to the pools 'savers' as payouts from each wallet, with the rest increasing the wallets balance and therefore slightly increasing future PoS rewards. This Frequency of Proof-of-Stake will ensure a more stable avg. overtime against difficulty. Having many active reserve wallets also increases the pools overall chance at generating stake and/or maintaining this avg.Note that this model works without the need to take deposits. In fact it is (optional) 'Deposit Money Creation' as described in 'Modern Money Mechanics' which is currently being improperly managed by banks in our failing world economies and by the likes of the federal reserve etc.However, this actually works if the human factors such as trading, hedging, loans etc. are completely removed from the system and it could therefore work really well with PoS in crypto-currencies, which is essentially an automated fixed return.I don't like centralization, but this could be very interesting for future development in crypto money. Coins will require additional development.However, the creation of a Proof-of-Stake Fractional Reserve Depository and Repository 'BottleBank' is nonetheless very amusing!   No worries. As long as its being looked at - definitely something odd with the v1.4 windows qt build.I'll have a go with it myself in a few days maybe.Cheers!BottleCaps to the erm... 'BottleBank' Repository then.   No worries. As long as its being looked at - definitely something odd with the v1.4 windows qt build.Otherwise I'll have a go with it myself in a few days maybe.Cheers! TheSeven's PPCoin Pool - http://theseven.bounceme.net/~theseven/pool/Stratum - ESMPPS - PPLNSShould see some increasingly stable hashing power from the recent PPCoin forum USB Block Erupter group buy.Although some nice big rigs are already floating past for at least 24hrs once per. week.   Nods.Something major is wrong with the current v1.4 qt build. It crashes on sending coins from all of my CAP wallets on 3 different Windows PC's.A linux build seems to be OK. Although these forks are also of concern and need investigating.
Bottlecaps is a great alt. coin and I also really like the fact that its a PoS coin.I think I first referred to Bitcoins as 'Electronic Bottle Tops' on this forum way back when a small group of us played a game of Texas Hold'em via PokerTH for Bitcoins! Its amazing how ideas go full circle.  However, I'm finding that the current 1.4 windows qt release has a few major problems (as I reported a few pages back) and its crashing for me when sending coins from an encrypted wallet.A Linux build seems to be working properly and I've not found the time to try a new windows build yet. Hopefully mullick (and others?) are almost done with the new v1.4.1 build ? If there is another fork then we must look to spread out and increase the hash rate and continue from there.Not looked at the math yet but how would 5% PoS with say a 10 day coin age pan out long term ? I'm considering a concept for a Fractional Reserve Proof-Of-Stake 'BottleBank' Mining Pool. Where miners would have the option to 'lock-in' a percentage of their mined coins, for a fixed duration, to both add to and take advantge of PoS payouts from a large % of reserve CAP held in pool wallets dedicated to continual PoS minting, also helping to secure the network. Yes, I'm against centalization, but its good to try some new experiments and it wouldn't really be an issue with several PoS type pools up and running.Anyway, just looking to know that those who started this coin are still keen to keep it going. I'd look to factor in >1% to the Foundation.   Re: Topic: [ANN][DGC] Fundraiser to take DGC to the next level | 100K DGC Donated - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=262648.0I'll donate 10% DGC on any sales of my 2GB digitalcoin USB Flashdrives if purchased with DGC before Midnight GMT tommorow - 4th August 2013.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=209508.msg2840188#msg2840188  Status: 7 confirmations, broadcast through 5 nodesDate: 03/08/2013 15:39To: DHgXvhswV9j3t9VTKu1QfAu6kYM1HHD5sJDebit: -500.00 DGCTransaction fee: -0.08 DGCNet amount: -500.08 DGCTransaction ID: 3880c926c8c6e942d02c5c01a4e16e3f94916b534fc8c6725fcbb316cf4a01faI'll donate 10% DGC on any sales of my 2GB digitalcoin USB Flashdrives if purchased with DGC before Midnight GMT tommorow - 4th August 2013.See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=209508.msg2840188#msg2840188  Coolio. Its worth considering that PoS will be generated from the first eligible block that you mined. Therefore you might want to wait until a good number of mined blocks are eligible for PoS minting.  Wondering if any of 'The Original Hobo Nickel Society' modern carvers might be interested in carving a batch of physical CryptoHobo Nickles for digital HoboNickels ?See: http://www.hobonickels.org/modern_carvers.html (some amazing artwork and carvings)Lets not all email them at once now though! Oh go on then...If your HoboNickel wallet in not encrypted with a pass phrase then any balance older than 10 days can mint PoS blocks.If your HoboNickel wallet is encrypted the padlock text will show 'wallet is encrypted and currently locked'. You can unlock your wallet for PoS minting in the qt client by going to Help > Debug Window > Console and typing the following:> walletpassphrase yourpasspharse 99999999 true'yourpassphrase' is your pass phrase and the 99999999 number is just a long time to leave the wallet unlocked.If you did this correctly the padlock text hover over will show 'wallet is encrypted and currently unlocked', if you have an eligible PoS balance you should see some of you balance move to stake (probably within a few hours, if not its worth restarting the client every 4 hours or so, if your really keen to get your first PoS block). When the PoS block is fully confirmed your balance will be re-credited with the stake and the PoS.Your eligible PoS balance (coin age) resets when it has been staked i.e. it will take another 10 days to generate more stake from the same balance.If you don't want to stake all or any of your coins then you can add reservebalance=100 (example) to your hobonickels.conf i.e. if you have a 1000 balance eligible for PoS minting (more than 10 days coin age) if you set reservebalance=100 then only a maximum of 900 of your balance will be staked.Some PoS coins require a .bat to unlock an encrypted wallet when using 'bitcoind'. Hope that helps.P.S. If only I could of told my future self in 2009 that in 2013 I'd be mining BottleCaps and HoboNickles... lol  CryptoHobo FTW !!!   As above post ^^  If your CAP wallet in not encrypted with a pass phrase then any balance older than 30 days can mint PoS blocks.If your CAP wallet is encrypted the padlock text will show 'wallet is encrypted and currently locked'.

Indeed. I confirm that techbytes has ordered and paid for >10 digitalcoin USB flashdrives from myself and I've shipped them today in fact.So, unless your ordering more than 10 units then forum member techbytes is now the best person to place an order with in the US. I'll still handle orders for Europe and the rest of the world.Perhaps we can start doing digitalcoin treasure hunts via Geocaching or something similar with these ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4VFeYZTTYshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwohadcUv4AJust an idea!  Yes. Most folks seem to interested in a bigger capacity flashdrive, so the next round of the slim and new flipcard designs will all be 8GB.2GB is plenty of space for a backup / wallet storage device, although I agree that if the intention is to run digitalcoin from the flashdrive pre-loaded then 8GB+ is necessary for future usage. Thank you for your interest in the digitalcoin USB flashdrives.  As I've stated in PM's to everyone the price point on the initial print run of just 50 units has been slightly higher than I hoped for. However, this is as much a promotional exercise for digitalcoin as it is about making a small profit on the initial test run. I'm reordering with the supplier to get a much lower price point on these and the 2nd round Flipcard design.See: http://digitalcoin.co/forums/index.php/topic,99.0.html (updating the thread with new info. soon)1 - 5 units at the standard price.6 - 10 units at 10% discount.11 - 15 units at 12.5% discount.16 - 20 units at 15% discount.21+ units at 20% discount.The cheapest tracked (bulk) shipping from the UK to the US is Royal Mail Airsure at around $23 p&p (depending on the order quantity)...Forum member techbytes is looking to order around 15 units for USA re-distribution. This might be the best option.I'll have some single units listed on the DGC Market and on ebay within the next 24 hrs.Cheers! Thanks.I've had 3 people interested from the US thus far.Maybe someone can organize a group buy ? It would save on the shipping costs to the US from the UK and will help reduce the price point per. unit. Ref. my forum post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=209508.msg2706284#msg2706284The 50x 2GB (1.87 GB Usable Approx.) USB Slender Flashdrives printed with the digitalcoin logo have arrived with myself today!I'm looking to sell around 10 of the 50 units for just digitalcoin, with the rest being placed as ebay auctions and on other online market places.If you are interested in purchasing one with digitalcoin then please PM me with quantity and your country of residence for accurate p&p pricing etc. First come first served.Very happy with the high print quality and compact size!  N.B.

For sure, which is very sad indeed. Like making an important scientific discovery and deleting the results.  Actually I do very much understand, although some maybe do not or would not know how to do this easily.With the gap increasing between finding a block its not really time consuming at all. Even less so in fact if you automate the process.Perhaps there are other reasons why this is also a good idea ?   THIS ^^I just posted this idea in another thread, but I'm posting it again to reach more XPM miners.I've started 'banking' single mined blocks in encrypted wallets with each block I find by making a back-up and creating a new wallet each time (where possible).I figured that if / when someone happens to find a block with an exeptionally long chain, then at least it will be a mined block on a single wallet.This could give the block a higher value in the future as the coins will also be unspent.Primecoin is a Scientific Computing Cryptocurrency afterall.

I'm not seeking world peace through religion. I'm an Agnostic.I've spoken with many Muslims who have stated that being tolerant and accepting of other peoples religions and faiths is their interpretation of parts of the Koran. It is not as such a requirement (loose choice of words by myself), but an interpretation of scripture, by some Muslims on how to be good Muslims. The same applies to Christians and the bible.Yes. Religion and nationalism are responsible for many wars - perhaps our new social media style 'global village' will help us all learn lessons from our past during this continuing process of increasing globalization, which can be seen as problematic as the 'tribes' of the human race increasingly merge themselves together.We should all look to enlighten and educate ourselves to be 'one world and one people', with extreme religious beliefs set to one side if not forgotten.I personally do not endorse, mine or trade any crypto-currency of religious, existing nationalistic or purely of a political persuasion.These are things that using Bitcoin and crypto in general will help to solve and to change. We are seeing the collapse of the global economy and even of nation states.I look to a brighter future, but no utopian dream is for certain or even desirable. Surely the human race can eventually progress to something better than this capitalist mess and current dystopia ? A pessimist is never disappointed however. Promoting crypto-currency for evil I cannot agree with. Promoting crypto-currency for good I can agree with.Best wishes World peace maybe a wishful ideology, but I've already stated that Muslims and followers of the other major religions alike are actually required to be Tolerant and Accepting, both towards their respective faiths and beliefs as well as each other.This is not an easy topic and people are entitled to their opinions. A peaceful co-existence is the right way for all humanity. That is all I really meant by the above sentiment. As in togetherness. It is said in many religious texts that the world only really needs one currency, this is perhaps the better option for all humanity. I doubt it will be any of the currencies on this forum, but we are certainly making progress I think... ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerpGwbLSM8One World. One People.

Because certain iblocklist.com lists (and other lists) ping like crazy! i.e. it's being totally tracked.Besides, I thought that some Muslims are not allowed to accept certain types of 'wealth' from non-Muslims ? Perhaps a Muslim here could explain how this works in practice in terms of crypto-currency ownership, with spent coins of unknown and perhaps of questionable origin ?

Very nice looking website anyway...   I'm running the v3 build on an i7 3930k (6-core 12-thread - Sandy Bridge-E - Windows 7) and have found 2 blocks so far running with 11 threads.Found a block with primecoin0712 (v1 build for avx from Sunny's 0.1.1 updated code - from another thread) and also found a block with the v2 build before switching to v3. pps is around 2200 to 2500.Maybe a bit of luck, but just confirming that I've found blocks with all three builds. I've not experienced any network or block 'lag' either (yet), as reported elsewhere with those builds. Seems to be all OK to me, until I find time to review and build. Seems good to go. Cheers. OK. Thanks. I'll try building my own version tommorrow from the official code base or just wait for a new windows client build.Back to the offical build then? Even with increased pps when testing some of the builds posted here the number of blocks found has actually remained fairly consistant for me vs using the offical build. I mean considering a mostly increasing total network pps and factoring luck etc., the overall variance in finding new blocks isn't really that different actually (although this could just be variance also). Better to keep a stable protocol... I've have a slightly lower pps and found 2 blocks in the past hour, with the previous block around 8 hours prior to that.
Hear, hearSeems to me Sunny was just reasuring the PPcoin community that two (quite different) coins could be better than one and that long-term development would be maintained for both.There is plently of room for every Alt. coin and competition is good for any market place....Back to the thread roll... 'Build 8' seems to give the best pps and blocks found on my i7. Seems to be an OK build to use for now ? That's great! I'll keep you posted for when the stock arrives with myself, then I'll have an exact purchase price including shipping.I'm also looking at printed USB wristbands, flipcards (credit card size USB's) and some rounded stick designs, but I'll see how these go first and make a separate poll for voting on designs.If anyone else is interested then please drop me a PM.Cheers. I'm pleased to announce that I've confirmed an initial order proof for 50 x 2GB USB Slender Flashdrives printed with the digitalcoin logo!The 2GB devices should arrive with myself for international shipping around the 1st August 2013. I intend to retail them for digitalcoin's and for PayPal and perhaps via sites like ebay etc., both with and without digitalcoin wallets on the USB drives and in different denominations.I'm also looking to expand the range to include different designs and memory sizes. We are based in the UK, so you should consider this if / when placing your orders. We may consider an Asia region and USA distributor, if anyone would be interested.I'm also working on dedicated scrypt mining devices and some other cool products.  Anyway, order proof for the initial 50 x 2GB USB Flashdrive's - digitalcoin backup / storage devices.I'll look to create a separate thread within the next few days so that people can register there interest etc.A website for the product range is currently in production.

Safe browsing!  It's to easy to just "Blame it on MT.GOX" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ku1A5Ox8U   I can agree with much of this. I do also wish I'd put a question mark in the threads title. My main aim was to try and make people aware of the facts and to promote discussion. Folks taking the time to construct good thought through responses to the issues Bitcoin will face in the future is what I really intended.I'm a Bitcoin and crypto-currency supporter, I wouldn't put the time in myself otherwise! I have considered and modeled all of these factors. It does not matter how long it takes, it is a certainty with the current Bitcoin model.Other factors include population growth vs total number of coins, hold vs spend, a realistic percentage of accidental wallet loss or theft, rarity vs scarcity, supply vs demand etc.When there are say 0.0000004 and 0.0000002 Bitcoins left who are you going to trade them with exactly ? Indeed. Thank you.Yes and No. Bitcoins do become more valuable over time (in theory), until all 21 Million Bitcoins are in cirulation. Then rarity will cause them to become even more valuable, until scarcity causes inevitable decline.You can't trade in diminishing intangibility. Fact. Which is currently inevitable and certain. Definition of SCARCE. 1: deficient in quantity or number compared with the demand : not plentiful or abundant.https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcityhttps://wikipedia.org/wiki/IntangibilityWe have a long way to go. If Bitcoin is like a roller coaster, the we only just dropped of the first incline!   Maybe a loop-the-loop is approaching ?   The exact same reason why people want to mine or buy into Bitcoin when the price is seen to be increasing. Speculation aside.This is what I meant to demonstrate with the triangle diagrams that I posted.Rarity will theoretically cause massive price increases, this is obviously very different to the economic principle of scarcity or Bitcoins becoming scarce.Definition of SCARCE. 1: deficient in quantity or number compared with the demand : not plentiful or abundant.  Please understand that I'm looking very far into the future. I'm a big crypto-currency supporter and I love Bitcoin! Here is my post...How, Why and When the Bitcoin Model will Fail - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=172664.0The current Bitcoin model is a fixed and finite commodity and someday their will be no Bitcoins left.As I've stated elsewhere, when the oil eventually runs out are you still going to be putting gasoline into your car ? There is currently only one correct answer to this question that was not included...Supply Will Not Increase And It Will Be Beneficial and Damaging.BeneficialOne of the reasons Bitcoins have any value whatsoever is because Bitcoins are a finite commodity.DamagingWhen all Bitcoins are in circulation (and no more can be created), eventually their won't be any left. This is further compounded by ones inability to trade in what I will call ever decreasing or diminishing intangibility.Don't worry. The train has only just left the station! The bitcoin model has many many good years to run 'as is', well after the 2140 estimate and the value should sky rocket before and after that time, followed by theoretical and certain decline of the current model. Besides, something else will probably be in Bitcoins place within that time frame or the current model will adapt beyond recognition with code changes to accommodate these factors, if we get that far. ..."For myself, I am beginning to get the hang of how you obtain the virtual currency - it is spending it which is the bigger problem. I already had a Bitcoin wallet on my phone, which meant using the ATM at the conference was relatively simple. I showed the machine the barcode which is the public address of my wallet, and once I'd inserted a £10 note into the slot, it popped up as roughly 0.2 Bitcoin on the phone screen within seconds.In all I had 0.7 Bitcoin - worth about £43 at Tuesday's exchange rate. And by this time I was hungry. Sadly, nowhere nearby seemed to take Bitcoin in exchange for food. Evangelists for the crypto currency say it's flexible, durable, secure and transportable. Now all they need to do is make sure it's useable."...I mean seriously, what's the matter with all you 'new wave' corporate types ?Yes. You bring new fiat money and increase public interest in Bitcoin by developing expensive ATM technologies for the masses, but neglect to sell slices of hot Pizza to members of the hungry media ! This is basic Bitcoin economics - lol   I'm of no importance at all really.

Although, I can only find snapshots of the homepage on there. As I mentioned I'm looking for the page extension text regarding how the Bitcoin economy might develop, which gave a very specific example of a Bitcoin using, Pizza eating, hair dresser... Does anyone have a backup of Satoshi's original Bitcoin.org website text or can anyone provide a link to a backup source ?I'd be really interested to re-read the 'about' ? page that described the possible workings of a Bitcoin based economy.This page in fact described something about how a Bitcoin using, Pizza eating, hair dresser might use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, in a local economy.Its what inspired laszlo (the infamous Pizza for Bitcoins? guy) to open the very thread with said request. See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0and for myself to respond with:This Pizza is described as the first known public Bitcoin transaction for goods (on the wiki), which I don't think it actually was...Anyway, a link to that text would be appreciated.

I've even mined a few BitBars, Argentum and some other alt. coins.Proof-of-Stake coins like PPcoin should be seen as a true innovation.A percentage of the alt. coin that I've mined in the past few weeks I've traded up and exchanged on sites like cryptsy.com for Bitcoin. These are quantities of Bitcoin that I could not of aquired by mining Bitcoin in the same period of time. Moreover, I've purchased x4 Block Erupter USB ASIC (thus far) with those very Bitcoins, increasing my own Bitcoin hash rate, thus making a contribution to the Bitcoin economy as a whole.Alt. coins will allow others to discover, trade, aquire and buy Bitcoin and vice versa. Hardcore Bitcoin supporters should use their old GPU mining rigs and FPGA's to mine Litecoin and other alt. coins, as Bitcoin becomes dominated by ASIC's.Yes. Some alt. coins are total garbage and will probably just phase out by themselves i.e. there is certainly no need for anyone to collude to destroy others creativity.I'm sure Satoshi would in fact think that all these alt. coins are really great!

Good to know the pool issue is 'fixed', I was referring to the current issue with the GLDcoin blockchain itself. You should bare in mind that Tor hidden services and just that i.e. hidden and not anonymous.If you know what your doing (technically) and combine this knowledge with other factors, such as historical / real-time data, it is possible to work out exactly which IP (or Tor server) a hidden service is being operated from. Its not very easy, but it is possible to do it, hence hidden and not anonymous. Tor client users have better anonynimity than the hidden service operator in fact.In less than 20 boot straps of Tor, using a highly edited config. it is fairly easy to determine (currently), with more than 90% accuracy, say which country a Tor hidden service is being run from, for example.The rest of the work is done just by using a simple process of elimiination. That's all that is required.Aside from that your described concept seems fairly sound.

Posting to say that I'm supporting digitalcoin as best I can looking forward and congrats. to baritus (+others) on a great coin.Since returing to crypto-currencies and this forum I've flitted between a few alt. coins and have been somewhat undecided, however digitalcoin is increasingly becoming the coin of choice for the many I think.I've been mining digicoin on the down low for a good few weeks now and I'm currently putting more hashpower towards DGC than to LTC mining!My DGC seed node is running at: addnode=80.229.2.127 which is a static IP address on my 2nd 'home' network / router located in the UK. I'm sorry to other alt. coin devs, but I've stopped seeding all other coins from this IP for now. Two Tor relays run from this IP address i.e. addnet1 and addnet2. Anyway, the DGC node is correctly forwarded on port 7999 and I intend to keep it up and running 24/7 365 with only the occasional restart.How else am I supporting digitalcoin ? Well, I've added the DGC logo and link to the homepages of my web proxies. See: http://xeronet.primeoptic.netI have five other established web proxy domains similar to this one that I've also added the DGC logo and links to. I've not been advertising these sites that much recently, but they do get a lot of traffic, serving more than a couple of TB+ a month in fact. I'm working on updates and revising blocklists etc. at the moment with lots more stuff planned. Anyway, 4096 bit SSL certs.

Hence why you are using 2400 thread-concurrency i.e. 5 x 480 =  2400The info. in the cgminer read me suggests to use 4 or 5 times shaders for best operation. This series of card seems to function better at 3200 and above. I in fact have mine (stable) at 3680.cgminer -o --scrypt -I 14 -g 1 --thread-concurrency 3680 -w 256 --auto-gpu --gpu-engine 900 --gpu-memclock 800 --no-submit-staleGPU overclocked by 100 and default memory clock. N.B. These are not my fully overclocked settings, these are safe / stable settings.Once you have installed MSI Afterburner - try pushing the GPU Core Clock setting up by 5 or 10 to find a stable (highest) value, where you don't see any screen or graphic glitches etc. The higher up you get just add 5 each time instead of 10. If you see a screen error then quickly move it back down by 10 to 25-ish and that will probably be close to the optimal value. You can re-set it and do the same for the Memory Clock and then try both settings together, again reduced by around 10-25 each. If the screen locks up, then you need to hard reset your PC (by holding down the power button) and waiting 10-30 seconds before a re-boot. You have a good amount of system RAM, so you should be OK to move the sliders back down, if your quick, before a full freeze-up (also give the system 30 seconds to respond if this happens).You can't cause your GPU any real damage by doing this, only increasing voltage etc. will potentially wreck your card or make it unsafe.I was incorrect in my post above and your default clock speed on that card is also 800 MHz ? So, around 900 to 920 is probably the max. ?Please post your results so that I might try to help you further. Also, bare in mind that your card does not have a fan, so watch the temp. It should be OK though as it looks to have some crazy heat sink. This is interesting for me in regards to something that I'm working on with system RAM and scrypt mining.  Thanks OK. So I sent Operatr a PM regarding some FPGA 'tinkering' that I've been doing on my 'lame' AVNET Spartan 6 FPGA LX9 Microboard for scrypt mining.See this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=220621.0Basically, scrypt mining is very RAM intensive and you can currently get the best performance in windows utilizing the available host system RAM as the FPGA equivalent of CPU / GPU 'Hyper-Threading' / 'Hyper-Memory'.I'm trying to find a perfect balance between hardware and software with my 'home brew' project, so that I can perhaps look to scale it up on bigger and better FPGA boards.Operatr's response thus far has been 'nothing'. A simple not interested would suffice. However, I'm sure he is busy and this might just be an oversight.Although, I hope this isn't going to be another BFL type project i.e. 'style over substance' ?I think I'll stick with my 'home brew' project / boards for now and might look to sell them via ebay if they are worthwhile, cost efficient and stable enough. Good luck anyway. It's an interesting project and I might consider purchasing one in the future.Cheers Download MSI Afterburner - see: http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htmYou need to enable UNOFFICIAL overclocking to change the 'default' settings.See: http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=338906You will get errors and crashes if I don't disable ATI PowerPlay in the MSI Afterburner config. i.e. "Set UnofficialOverclockingMode to 1 to keep PowerPlay active (may not work on old ASICs), 2 to traditionally disable PowerPlay or to 0 to temporary disable unofficial overclocking path". Sure. Please download GPU-Z - http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/ and let me know how many shaders this card has. I have a SAPPHIRE HD 6670 2GB DDR3 in one scrypt mining box that I have.See: http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?cid=1&gid=3&sgid=1088&pid=1218&psn=&lid=1&leg=0I brought it recently because I wanted to test some stuff with scrypt mining which is very RAM intensive.This card has 'Hyper Memory Support' See the chart in the link.Up to 2.8 GB Memory Support with Hyper MemoryEnjoy the big memory frame buffer with Hyper Memory Technology.Hyper Memory Support Matrix Under Windows Vista and Windows 7.On Windows 7 x64 I've managed to push this card to around 130 kh/s (stable-ish) to 145 kh/s un-stable with some serious overclocking and messing around with the voltage settings and some other stuff, which is generally unsafe to do and not to be advised.Interestingly enough it struggles to get above 90 kh/s in Linux Ubuntu, even with the (correct) same drivers and overclocking. In other words the Hyper Memory Support can really make a big difference when scrypt mining.Your card: http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?cid=1&gid=3&sgid=1088&lid=1&pid=1240Has a faster clock speed and more video memory, although it doesn't have Hyper Memory Support. However, if your using the 'default' thread-concurency of 3200 ? then I can probably dig you out some settings to improve on that using cgminer.Again, as someone mentioned above, in many respects its almost best to under-clock the memory and just over-clock the CPU to save on power and get the best ROI etc. There will probably be a ratio for this card, where under-clocking the memory, won't affect the highest possible hash rate, once you have found the optimum thread-concurrency and the highest most stable CPU overclocked speed.You probably won't get much above 120 kh/s tbh, but correct optimization will save power and can churn more shares!

Even if Bitcoin hit say $5 a coin, that might actually be a good thing long-term.The opportunity to buy into any stock with known extreme volitiity at a low price should make it an attractive proposition for anyone and not just investors.At lower prices Bitcoin is better as a currency. At higher prices it becomes more of a commodity.

Could probably try limiting the hash rate to make it more efficient by avoiding overflow, if that makes sense.Someone made a useful post on the Litecoin forum - FPGA Development threadSee: https://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,2702.msg22071.html#msg22071Anyway, I got this board hashing Bitcoin via a Linux box, started doing some Litecoin / scrypt coding and testing and messed up my installation.Links for historical projects I've found useful include:Open Source FPGA Bitcoin Miner : https://github.com/progranism/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-MinerXilinx Serial Miner : https://github.com/teknohog/Xilinx-Serial-MinerFork : https://github.com/teknohog/Open-Source-FPGA-Bitcoin-Minercgminer and bfgminer ofc and the original scrypt paper is obviously worth a look: https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdfI'd be interested to here from anyone who has already got this LX9 microboard hashing Bitcoin in Windows.The Scrypt FPGA concept is becoming more popular: https://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,2725.0.htmlI'll stick with my homebrew project for now.   Yep. All 100% correct and the speeds are going to be pretty lame indeed. You will get much better hashing speeds with good multi core CPU's and even a low-to-mid range (much cheaper) ATI 5xxx card for the price.I'm mostly doing this for the fun of it, as I already have this board and it makes of an interesting add-on project for a PC that's hashing to the max. with it's CPU's and GPU's already. I'm looking to do something with all that free system RAM.Knowing what might be possible and having experience with these FPGA's and developing code for scrypt mining will be applicable to better / faster FPGA boards in the future. Hopefully that explains why I'm even bothering with this. You must use a Random (and long) password for these settings and a different user name or you can have your .wallet 'hacked'...Following this post I saw numerous network access attempts, from known 'bad' IP ranges, scanning rpcport 8122 probably for this very purpose.Please read this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=205789.msg2362993#msg2362993 You're welcome. Trying to help, but there are some issues that are beyond anyone's control once set in stone...I saw in this forum post : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=224026.0 - [ANN] Gold Coin Hard Fork - Update your Binaries Immediatelyadvice to use: rpcuser=1 rpcpassword=1 in the goldcoin.confYou must use a Random (and long) password for these settings and a different user name or you can have your .wallet 'hacked'...Following the related thread post I saw numerous network access attempts, from known 'bad' IP ranges, scanning rpcport 8122 probably for this very purpose.I'm investigating the block chain and the full source code for each release. I probably should of done that before.Anyway, the ongoing calamities vs the potential of GLDcoin is whats keeping me interested at this time. With regards to GLDcoin network sync. issues please read my post here: http://www.gldcointalk.org/index.php?topic=131.msg777#msg777Suggesting 'strict' .conf additions to help re-establish GLDcoin network connectivity and client stability:gen=0dns=1checkpoints=1listen=1dnsseed=1banscore=10bantime=604800rescan=1checkblocks=0checklevel=6txindex=1reindex=1Please also make sure that you have updated to the latest binary found in the devs. first thread post on this forum.Thanks Erm... They are ready. ^^Scanned new gldcoin-0.6.4-win32-setup.exe binaries and they are OK. As in fact were all of the previous 'official' downloads for GLDcoin.http://virusscan.jotti.org/en/scanresult/49d372d4eba68701b8155ea0fc003e7375ce2f70 OKhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/0df66f90f405aa163e9081a2c886ece585e391c37824ac665f31b5351f71dd8b/analysis/1370208806/ OKSeeding again soon.Also, does anyone know the owner of gld.vircurpool.com ? I set some clients mining at that pool, but its 'lagging' at the moment due to requiring the update. Sent 2 emails already. Might even set-up my own GLDcoin pool if things are going well. I lost 'money' with Bitcoin that I never actually had ?Now I lost 'money' in LR that I transferred from BTC that I never saw or physically owned ?It's a true story...I used LR for legal and legitimate purposes such as real forex trading with regulated LR accepting brokers, such as RoboForex and others. I've designed and built profitable automated forex trading robot EA's (expert advisers) and have spent over 5 years tuning them to make profits on my trading accounts.Before I have had the opportunity to release most of my hard earned trading profits back into fiat currency (or Bitcoin) and declare my accurate paper trail for tax purposes in the UK (despite forex trading being tax free), LR gets closed down and causes problems with most of my chosen FX brokers and my funds and trading profits are in limbo...In short, any currency, including cash can easily be used for 'illegal' purposes by anyone if they are that way inclined. LR was a payment system being innocently used by individuals and businesses to conduct legal business activities on the internet. Governments have basically stolen peoples hard earned money (yet again, just like they did in Cyprus) without compensation or justification, because they need to fix their own messed up fiat currencies (and over inflated BS economies) that are in fact themselves nothing more than elasticated ponzi schemes. Banks and governments, go ahead and steal our money back and print more worthless pieces of paper over and above GDP again and again (or just add more zeros to computer screens in the form of treasury backed bonds).The real criminals here are governments and politicians, not to say that the owners of LR are completely innocent either. Although, if you want to 'legally' launder money then it clearly helps to be a banker or a politician of that persuasion it would seem!All 'money' is in fact a ponzi scheme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3DixfL9o0 - Zeitgeist Addendum - Modern Money MechanicsFACT....Bitcoin and Liberty Reserve ? Humm... I think their was a song about it in Eurovision 2013.The real question is which shoe is which and is he singing 'Spain', 'pain' or 'faith'? - lolhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VLhnzk_dAs What a true legend!I continue to use Bitcoin (and love and hate it at the same time), but can no longer put any 'faith' in LR, because I have no choice in the matter."Don't let the thieving b******s get you down". Its really not their fault!?   I have a windows PC with 16GB of RAM.It appears that running cgminer in a 4GB AMD Radeon Memory RAMDisk has increased the overall stability and throughput when mining.AMD RAM Disk Software 4.0 (free): http://www.radeonmemory.com/software_4.0.phpWatch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=xhtfMGUTLEA - How it workshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8xYSvmP_tUU - Best Use Caseshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ZxZsy7ETNvw - Advanced Configurationhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRgbRE-knX0&feature=player_embedded - Double your SSD SpeedIf you can't use a 'Striped Volume' to link the RAMDisk because you have a standard HD or perhaps some other reason (make sure your watched 'Advanced Configuration' to format the RAMDisk correctly), you can probably also use Properties > 'ReadyBoost' to make most of the RAMDisk available back to your system, whilst keeping a fixed percentage of the new drives space free for cgminer mining in RAM.Don't get me wrong, this won't get you a higher hash rate, but it does increase stability and throughput. Its also very funky!I'm discovering all sorts of ways that this can be useful with scrypt based coins (with memory intensive mining) and linking said dedicated RAMDisk's with FPGA boards to get increases in performance, stability and throughput.  These are mostly useless for Bitcoin mining now.However, I'm actually working on a project for a USB FPGA miner for scrypt based coins.I'm using one of these Xilinx® Spartan®-6 FPGA LX9 MicroBoards: http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/AES-S6MB-LX9.htmwith 2 added PmodSF2 - Serial PCM, 128 Mbit: http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,401,840&Prod=PMOD-SF2This is a personal project atm and I'm having to design / build software to get these working fully to try and overcome the difficulties of scrypt mining being very memory intensive. If / when I can get these hashing scrypt properly then I may offer them for sale with the software as custom built scrypt mining kits. Running 4 sticks with an Rpi might present an opportunity for ROI vs electricity usage and purchase costs etc.However, to get these hashing scrypt at a reasonable and stable throughput, the way that I've currently found to improve performance requires around 4GB+ of free RAM on the host machine for one FPGA (and around 2GB+ for each additional FPGA). I'll have more info. / updates after doing much more testing in my free time over the coming weeks / months. This might well just end up being another fun project though. Indeed. Ironically I actually own 2 of these 'gold' USB sticks that I brought off ebay last week with the intention of putting a BitBar .wallet containing a BitBar (and perhaps a few Bitcoin's as well) to add some 'novelty' value for resale and advertising purposes. You can find these 'gold usd sticks' on ebay ranging from 4GB to 128GB for under or around £10-£15 and they have nothing to do with mining.I'm also part of the German group buy for the pictured USB ASIC (real). See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195037.0These ASIC sticks run so hot that if you did actually manage to put one of these inside the 'gold' USB stick housing, it would melt the plastic components and also protrude from the sides as well. Also, you can't mine BitBar (scrypt) with an ASIC, as already stated above.I'm actually working on a totally separate project for a USB FPGA miner for scrypt based coins.I'm using the Xilinx® Spartan®-6 FPGA LX9 MicroBoard: http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/AES-S6MB-LX9.htmwith 2 added PmodSF2 - Serial PCM, 128 Mbit: http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,401,840&Prod=PMOD-SF2This is a personal project and I'm having to design / build software to get these working to try and overcome the difficulties of scrypt mining being very memory intensive. If / when I can get these working then I may offer them for sale with the software as custom built scrypt mining kits. Running 4 sticks with an Rpi might present an opportunity for ROI vs electricity usage and purchase costs etc.I will start a new thread, away from this BS thread, when / if I have everything fully working and some units built and ready to ship. "ONE is not amused" - lol -  Is any dev. actually working on this and/or new binaries or a fork? I did make a complete back-up of both repositories.It's a real shame to spoil the potential of a 'gold coin' through such calamity.   An eventful 24 - 48 hours for GLDcoin to say the least. All a bit odd really!Anyway, I've just written an 'Easy GLDcoin Client / CPU Pool Mining Guide for Windows' over at: http://www.gldcointalk.orgSee: http://www.gldcointalk.org/index.php?topic=75.0You can help to support the GLDcoin network and earn a few extra GLDcoins in this way. Even if your GPU mining already.Cheers.   DT55ATNGXxaNtRkbuqxdGGQF9azfWQpAhgThank You! I can confirm that I successfully sold 2,500 XRP to OP Chuck for an agreed amount in BTCI'm pleased to say that the transaction was completed quickly and efficiently.Thanks Chuck Yes.

Erm... I guess that you are welcome.  Just like with twitter where you often see 'my tweets are not endorsements', neither are my forum posts.However, this does appear to be a good alt. coin with clearly very active and enthusiastic supporters.I do like the block / reward structure with this one. "Money is only money when its moving" and I think that GLDcoin should have enough 'liquidity' to allow for both hoarding and (more importantly) for spending on goods and services.Miners want to receive sizable block rewards and the total number of GLDcoins will encourage goods and services being traded above the default decimal place setting for many many years.I'm still studying / modeling the difficulty levels, however this is a sensible alt. coin with a potentially popular name, as people like anything 'gold', they trust in it and its also a bit shiny too.   Indeed. I've been having a few client sync. issues, so decided to send keen GLDcoin thread posters in this forum a PM with my addnode address as well.It helps to make the network stronger. Thanks.With regards to firewalls and security I would recommend http://www.peerblock.com/ and http://www.iblocklist.com/lists.php blocklists. Do you remember the New Liberty Standard ?See: http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/page/Exchange+RateI do - lol   I've just voted for GLD and not because I want free GLD, but because of all of the listed coins in that vote I think it stands the best chance of being successful in the long term, perhaps even more so when it makes it onto more exchanges.Here's my GLD address anyway: DxXpdyqJ2jZXzN72mXZYNuvUF7Z9n17dHT  This is actually an alt. coin with huge potential. The network seems quite stable at the moment, with a reasonable difficulty structure and GLDcoin seems to be building up a dedicated following. Despite the pre-mine the total number of coins and the reward structure should provide some longevity. Congrats to GLDcoin - this one really is a gold rush!I hope that development continues, its clearly partly built from feathercoin, as you can see when you encrypt the wallet in the current (1st) windows version compile.Anyway I'm mining some GLDcoin with my 100+ kh/s scrypt box over at gld.vircurpool.com I think that Goldcoin could be popular with the masses, over some of the other alt. crypto-currencies, purely due to its name.Doing quite well on the coinchoose.com leader board as well presently.  3rd giveaway thread ?DxXpdyqJ2jZXzN72mXZYNuvUF7Z9n17dHTMining GLDcoin with my 100+ kh/s box over at gld.vircurpool.com Thanks!

This mathematical genius is unlikely to of built bitcoin and to of communicated with others on this forum in the way that 'Satoshi' did.I perhaps know more about this than most folks here do. For starters, I was on this forum when 'Satoshi' was. Please understand how I got to my theory.See: Tor - Incentive Mechanisms !?! HAR 2009 - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=191362.0I logged IP addresses from the bitcoin network, when there were less than a handful of forum members and very few 'stable' bitcoin nodes. Shinichi Mochizuki is a very unlikely candidate in my honest opinion. Here's my theory...Yossi Nagy Moti - sound familiar to anyone ?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206630.0 There are some strong historical links between the group of mentioned individuals and my own theory.The field of cryptography and e-cash systems back in 2008 / 2009 (and prior to that) was really rather limited. Most of these individuals attended similar conferences and/or published related cryptography, security and online privacy papers etc.Yossi Nagy Moti - sound familiar to anyone ?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206630.0Shinichi Mochizuki is a very unlikely candidate in my honest opinion. Great video, interesting theory, but still way off in my opinion. This is much more likely...Yossi Nagy Moti - sound familiar to anyone ?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206630.0 *Sings* ..."We are the world, we are the future"... ?WT5re6QugsV6B3xsgh8bDS4bQX5ot5SG5pThanks   The "Block Lock"*coughs* I'd imagine that you might require more than 5 keys (maybe an 8 min. consensus) to unlock a single key ?If so, the key holders probably put in all sorts of conditions and agreements to unlock the keys. They might not even know every holder themselves !?Or perhaps just one individual does have all the keys. No way of ever knowing really I suppose.*Yawns* https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=206630.0Automatic for the people ?     After doing extensive research and a lot of reading I'm almost 100% (CPU) certain that these are the initial 'creators' of bitcoin.The only real alternative is that another genius individual or group used extensive knowledge of their work to hide behind their collective identity.Who are they ?Yossi Matias - "is an Israeli computer scientist, entrepreneur and Google executive."See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossi_Matias and http://research.google.com/pubs/YossiMatias.htmlDaniel A. Nagy - "a telecommunications engineer with a strong interest in mathematics and its various applications."See: http://www.epointsystem.org/~nagydani/homepageMoti Yung - "is an Israeli-American cryptographer and computer scientist, an employee of Google Research."See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moti_Yung and http://research.google.com/pubs/author3060.htmlThese are computer scientists with the desire, knowledge and expertise to create bitcoin. They are respected academics of the highest level and experts in the fields of privacy, security, anonymity, cryptography and electronic money systems. Historically, I believe, that they were also in the right places at the right time. They have access and knowledge of LaTeX ( https://wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX ), popular with academics, who also use double spacing. LaTeX was used to publish the bitcoin white paper.I believe that Mordechai (Moti Yung) used the Tor network to bootstrap bitcoin to the wider internet, although perhaps someone else just chose this name for an unrelated reason. There was a Tor node called 'Mordk' ? (I don't recall the exact name of the Tor relay / exit server). I believe that the IP address used to release the bitcoin white paper from Helsinki? is also conducive to this.Yossi has clearly worked extensively with Moti and Moti has also met with Nagy on more than one occasion. The internet does the rest.See: https://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/cat_conference.htmlFebruary 14, 2008 - FC2008 -- report by Dani Nagy"This was my first time [writes Dani Nagy] at the annual Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference, even though I have extensively used results published at this conference in my research. In short, it was very interesting from both a technical and a social point of view (as in learning new results and meeting interesting people from the field). And it was a lot of fun, too.Pairing based cryptography seems to be all the rage in the fundamental crypto research department. Secure Function Evaluation seems to be slowly inching from pure theory into the realm of applicable techniques. But don't hold your breath, yet.In between theory and practice, was Moty Yung's very entertaining invited talk about Kleptography -- using cryptographic techniques for offensive, malicious purposes, rather than defenses, typically against other cryptographic systems. As an example, he gave a public-private RSA key generation algorithm, which is indistinguishable from an honest, random one in a black box manner, and even if reverse engineered, the keys generated with it can be factored only with the effort of factoring a key half that long. The attacker, however, that pushes this key generation algorithm on unsuspecting victims, will be able to factor their keys with very little effort.""By sheer accident, I found myself on the panel about e-cash. The topic was the gap between real-life electronic cash and academic research. One rule was not to speak about one's own work. The participants were selected from different parts of the world and different walks of life. For me, the biggest news was that credit cards are not common at all in Japan..."...In short, I stopped asking who is 'Satoshi', but instead asked how and why.To understand bitcoin, you have to understand cryptovirology - See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptovirology"Cryptovirology is a field that studies how to use cryptography to design powerful malicious software..."Bitcoin is in fact a 'crypto-virus'. If you think I'm saying that bitcoin is a 'virus' and that it is bad, then you have clearly not yet read and understood about cryptovirology! Find another e-cash system (or pc program) in 2008 - 2009 to use 100% CPU, by necessity. Any other program to do this was / is a 'virus' or 'malware'.On this basis, I don't think that they themselves thought that bitcoin could really work due to public reaction. Bitcoin was basically a P2P botnet where you earned 'worthless' coins for using 100% CPU. Only geeks and hackers would ever consider such a program, right? The only way to know for sure was to release this genius cryptographic P2P e-cash 'virus' into the wild and to see what happened...Everyone should read as many of the papers published by Moti and Adam L. Young as can be found on their website http://www.cryptovirology.com/You should also download / watch a talk by Moti at 26C3See: http://mirror.fem-net.de/CCC/26C3/mp4/26c3-3702-en-yes_we_cant_-_on_kleptography_and_cryptovirology.mp4Other interesting papers and related works can be found via the google research pages for Yossi and Moti.Research papers in 2002 by Moti and Shouhuai Xu are of interest.Shouhuai Xu - See: http://scholr.ly/person/4633379/shouhuai-xu...It is impossible to say that any of these individuals are 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. It is also wrong to do so. I myself am an advocate for online privacy, security and anonymity. However, I also believe strongly in openness and transparency.Yes (you can't  ). You can combine the elements of both, for example, an activist in an oppressive regime can use Tor to reach twitter over https to inform the world of a fellow citizens plight. In a way, this too is 'cryptoviriology' or crypto-anarchism, just like bitcoin.Lets all stop looking for 'Satoshi' and instead learn how to make the world a better place for everyone!There are many individuals and works of note that I believe have contributed to the core of 'Satoshi'. I'm off to start reading every one of those papers.We are all 'Satoshi'. Daniel A. Nagy - http://www.epointsystem.org/~nagydani/homepageNag = Naka ? same thing ?  See: http://www.cryptovirology.com/ - Adam L.

This may well be very close to the mark. As well as all the other posts relating to Dani Nagy and the cryptography conventions around that time and the people who attended them etc.Including the post above it on Michael and Donal's paper: http://www.w3.org/Conferences/WWW4/Papers/228/Please also read my forum post on HAR 2009 and a talk given by Roger of the Tor Project.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=191362.0Anyway, I started to look for related talks and conventions of the time that were given or attended by such developers...See: https://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/cat_conference.htmlFebruary 14, 2008FC2008 -- report by Dani NagyWho's the fellow on the panel next to Nagy? Half asleep because he's way ahead of all of them and dreaming about 'bitcoins'? jet lagged and on his way to Helsinki from the last company meeting, cryptography talk or hacking convention? I'm just guessing...See: http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/10/race-unmask-bitcoins-inventors/43535/They all advised major companies on cryptography and open source... SAmsung TOSHIba NAKaminchi Apple MOTOrola as often speculated and joked about.One things for sure. Bitcoin was created from the ideas of all of these individuals and many others before them, already mentioned elsewhere. There is an entire history to 'e-cash' and lots of individuals, companies and governments that are involved in some way or another. Even Bill Gates once talked about 'crypto mining' and computer time as a commodity / resource.
Yes. There is obviously a history to 'e-cash' its self and to all related computer history for that matter. History closer to the first release of bitcoin is more interesting though.This post is maybe closer to the truth: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5951.msg790088#msg790088 as well as the following post.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5951.msg790094#msg790094"We may never know who Satoshi is (and do we really want to know?), but I think it's starting to be clear where Bitcoin was invented: University of Dublin Trinity College"EDIT: Nope.  Bitcoins initial bootstrapping via Tor is almost for certain though. I'm going from my own Prio (http://prnwatch.com/prio.html) TCP/IP logs from when the bitcoin network had very very few connections. I think that 'Satoshi' is unlikely to be Roger as a single individual. However, the Tor developers have spent many years attending hacker conventions and giving talks on a wide variety of subjects in relation to Tor and cryptography all around the world.It is very likely that Roger was inspired by 'Satoshi' and vice versa in relation to the Tor project. So, I have started to look at where Roger gave some of those talks and who might of attended. This is becoming a bit like wiki leaks... ?

Perhaps a decision was taken to 'fork' such an incentive model outside of the Tor project, so not to further congest an already 'slow' Tor network with additional P2P traffic ?In this forum thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1847300#msg1847300 a fellow early adopter asks if 'Satoshi' was using Tor. The answer is yes, I had several discussions in the forum and via PM with 'Satoshi' on the subject of Tor. There were a lot of Tor users!This thread post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1843408#msg1843408 perhaps correctly identifies the likely usage of a single machine, running individual threads on multiple cores.If you wanted to bootstrap or test a new anonymous crypto-currency, where better to launch it, than from a single computer connected to (inside) an anonymity network, whilst running each thread on an individual core, with each instance connected via its own Tor circuit. It is possible when using Tor to select your Entry and Exit node (ensuring that each circuit was never the same), in fact in 2009 you could even choose the Tor Middle node!This would make 'Satoshi' untraceable, whilst ensuring almost complete protection over most know 'attacks'. It also ensured that any 'external internet' users who downloaded the client at random had multiple nodes to connect to. It would also of been possible to test the network by automatically connecting each individual instance to the other (or not) and to the wider internet, whilst all running from the same machine through Tor. In fact, this is the perfect chaos engine, there was no better way to do this really, it is almost as genius as Bitcoin itself.This probably explains why the block generation looks the way it does: https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/So was 'Satoshi' running the 0.1 client ? Probably not, they would require the same protocol with advanced 'command and control', sensible right. Think bitcoin style Mixminion ?To support the above I will share a 'rare' youtube video from HAR 2009 (Hacking at Random - https://har2009.org/) where Roger D (ex. main Tor dev.) gives a talk on 'why Tor is Slow' (at the time of posting this video has just 79 views)...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJD1hDKDqlo Pay attention from 4.57 "Incentive Mechanisms"... micro payment approaches... "bittorrent users into the network" (when Tor was still P2P 'friendly')... "micro payments, digital cash"... "the idea is all the people who run a relay are given coins, e-cash"... "if you run a relay, then they pay you a coin to run a fast circuit"... "and that means its just like an economy, it will work great"... "collect money" ... "pay money"...This is the most accurate description of bitcoin I know of in 2009. Did Roger just read the 'Satoshi' white paper in 2008 / 2009 and like the idea for the Tor Project. Do great minds just think alike ? Was he only referring to expanding Torbank or was it something new and already in 'testing' / beta ? Was 'Satoshi' in the audience - lol ?To be honest I don't really care and neither should anyone reading this, 'Satoshi' remains 'anonymous'. If those wallets still exist, maybe it is a planned 'safety' reverse 'demurrage', against a central authority!     This is also a great post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37333.msg459194#msg459194http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement.htmlThank you for that. In short - "We are all 'Satoshi'..." and I still do love (to hate) bitcoin ! I've not been back on this board that long and yes I have a lot of reading to do. I'm hardly a troll, although you gotta love the trolls, right ?I was looking way way into the future with this thread, its partly the reason why I don't have the thousands of BTC in my wallet that I once had, in fact I don't think I have any BTC left accessible to me at all anymore.Please don't misunderstand my original post. Bitcoin is a currency and a commodity. That's its issue!When the oil well's dry up are you going to be putting 'gas' into your cars still ? No, it will be something else entirely.I wrote this topic as a warning for the future, that's all! The current bitcoin model does 'eventually' fail. So, just remember that and develop it along the way with that in mind! Most of all look after your wallets.I love (to hate) Bitcoin !   No mention here yet of the 'block lock' ? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=437.0 hehe"We know its true, because we made it up ourselves!"  You can never really know anything, unless they want you to know."The Color Blue's frangibility is a necessity" Correct. More decimal places can be added.However, there is a 3rd fundamental factor to all of this. As the total popularity and distribution increases, the overall rate of lost wallets increases as well.As the decimal places are moved to cope with this and match with the transaction distribution we basically continue to run out of bitcoins against worth. This again makes it even harder to make transactions or to trade anything with others. This also creates a 'human' factor, where the user base declines or migrates to another currency / system and this further compounds our problem.As I described, as soon as all bitcoins are in circulation, there is only one eventual outcome. The time that takes to happen afterwards is the only real unknown.Anyone still want a slice of Pizza ? Get it while its hot !   This is the most sensible comment yet !   No. All value is irrelevant. The model is 'doomed' because there will only ever be 21 Million Bitcoins.There are not enough bitcoins to sustain adoption by the masses, in accordance with population growth against an increasing number of internet users.Aside from this, assume that say only 10 bitcoins a year are 'lost', because someone dies and no one knows the password for their wallet etc.In the early days, on this forum, I once sold someone 1,200 bitcoins, they tried to transfer them to a usb via a linux 'live' cd... and lost them.'No worries' you might say we can still trade 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 . 0.0001 , 0.00001 etc.I does not matter how long this takes, once 21 Million bitcoins are generated, it will happen.Reverse / flip this triangle image, as if it were my modeled graph.C to A is the boom. Point A is 21 Million Bitcoins. A to B is the inevitable and intangible 'deprecation' back to zero.In the actual models I ran C to A was usually more curved i.e. the opposite concave to this...A to B was less steep and even flat, but the outcome is always the same. That's the model, reality will be different, but there is only one overall conclusion. Eventually 0 Bitcoins are left. I have referred to that very price rise, as the potential 'spikes' after all bitcoins are in circulation.It does not matter who long it takes to happen, the model does and will eventually fail, you can't trade in diminishing intangibility.One way or another there will be no bitcoins left to trade with!The system maybe expanded upon or replaced before that time, but with the current model there is no other eventual outcome. It is a certainty. The bitcoin model will eventually fail. Don't worry this won't happen for a very long time (perhaps not). In fact, for everyone reading this, it probably won't happen within our lifetime. Although, it will certainly start to happen in around 130 years (for sure), if not way before. I'm not talking about worth or value, bulls and bears, up and down trends etc., I mean it can't survive as a long-term 'currency'...When bitcoin was first established, a bitcoin was worth nothing, except perhaps for the cost of the hardware (software), an internet connection, the electricity and the time required to generate them, as in fact it remains today.When I first joined this forum NewLibertyStandard had an electricity meter plugged into the wall socket for his PC to calculate the exact cost required to generate a bitcoin. Thus, fixing a simple exchange rate for PayPal and the US dollar, of just a few cents.Whilst most forum members at that time were aware the price would probably increase with a growing demand for 3rd party exchangers and 'real world' exchange for goods and services, few (including myself) could of predicted the very fast inflation or increased 'value' against real currencies. However, what I did model at that time and what I will share with everyone now are the reasons why bitcoin will imho eventually fail as a currency. The model is inherently flawed and unfair.Bitcoin has a hard limit of about 21 Million bitcoins. See: http://bitcoin.org/en/aboutAs per. the wiki page See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "...a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached during the year 2140."Most studies into bitcoin have focused on price, inflation, technical specifications and the model up to the end of this graph. This is certainly the boom time?Bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places yielding a total of approx. 21×10 14 currency units. What will happen when all of the 21 Million bitcoins are in circulation?Bitcoin will, in theory, experience some years of perceived stability (with some initial price 'spikes') with a long-term 'table top' like chart, although still with the potential for sizable peeks and troughs, although leading to eventual and certain pricing decline, with a strong and continual downwards trend throughout. If you like, a 'wonky' table with two short legs!Why? Quite simply because the money supply has stopped.No one will want to buy into a currency that is in constant and perpetual decline. It will effectively be the exact opposite to what we have already seen to date. Bitcoins 'bankers' (the major miners and holders of bitcoins) will be clambering to sell and trade-off their bitcoins, as they become ever increasingly scarce and therefore 'worthless stock'. On this basis, some may also retain bitcoins, with the hope of price increases in relation to rarity, moreover there will be inevitably less and less people to actually trade bitcoins with...Consider in 200+ years just how many of these 21 Million bitcoins will of been 'lost' forever. The 8 decimal places are irrelevant long-term.Now imagine, what would happen if say the US Federal Reserve one day just decided to stop printing any new money. All of the money in circulation would eventually, in theory, disappear. Moreover, Its overall value as a currency would certainly diminish, in favor of other new / existing currencies, crypto or otherwise. Bitcoins will not even be worth their 'weight' in anything! Printing to much currency against your GDP output is very problematic. Again, its boom time for a while and then total bust (in theory). This is currently true for the Euro and the Dollar.See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_TjBNjc9BoNot printing enough currency is also very problematic.See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3DixfL9o0What is much much worse is to stop printing anymore currency whatsoever! Ironically, the bitcoin supply had to be limited for the purpose of implementing the original client protocol, by design. It is in fact the limited and finite supply that gives it any 'value' in the first place. It created the 'gold rush'... Satoshi remains a genius cryptographer, over being an economist? This project remains an experiment, although it is a fantastic and innovative one.The frantic necessity to generate and to save bitcoins is currently inherent amongst bitcoin users.  "I sold all my bitcoins and now the price has sky rocketed" or "I bought into bitcoin high and now the price has plummeted" or "I spent thousands on mining hardware and can never recover my costs" etc. It's very difficult to know what the best thing to do with your bitcoins really is at any given moment actually is, right?In Modern Money Mechanics, money is only actually money if it is 'moving'. All money is effectively 'debt' i.e. it is owed to someone by somebody for something. If this wasn't true, then we wouldn't need any currencies at all i.e. we would all still be happy swapping say apples for oranges etc.The crypto model adopted by bitcoin is inherently 'unfair' and 'flawed' imho, just like in capitalism where the already rich and powerful become increasingly richer and more powerful at the expense of others. We are already seeing this with bitcoin. Soon, (if not already) only established and large corporations, big banks, already very wealthy individuals, governments and nation states, with access to super computers will be the only people able to generate any bitcoins. This 'free market' will be totally monopolized, this has already started to happen.I believe there is a better model and a better approach, although that is entirely another topic.So, when does the bitcoin bubble actually burst? Probably, at exactly the very moment when the 21 Million bitcoins are generated, followed by a 'spike' and then a theoretically 'steady' decline back down to zero? A bitcoins intangible 'true worth'? Probably. Until then, there will be many new bitcoin adopters, users and investors that will come and go, we will see more bullish and bearish movements, although imho the major price trend can only really go one way, until all of the coins are in circulation and perhaps it will even continue beyond that, maybe not!Is bitcoin really the internet currency of the future? I'm not so sure about that. Something very similar to bitcoin probably stands a very good chance for true internet and financial freedom for the masses and there are certainly much worse alternatives.Bitcoin is a 'bubble' !?! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7TuFy0fcuw
Yep. I can't vote. I would only 'double drop' them both as well.   I for one couldn't agree more.Forex traders may be interested in my free MACD Turbo EA. It's actually a re-coded version of the mql4 'MACD Sample'.See: http://www.xerofx.com/free-ea.html (Live Myfxbook stats. as well, trading 'default' values.) I'm still optimizing some new settings.We've added StopLoss, TrailingStop and a ReverseTP (when in profit), TradeTimes etc. It is basically an automated swing strategy, nice and simple.It also works with ECN brokers and 4 or 5 digit price feeds. Open code.I should read this entire thread when I have some more time.  Thanks! How many coins did you sell ?Take solace in my story: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=169140.0  Remember: "Money is only really money, when its moving!"   "Whilst learning forex and starting to trade e-currencies etc. an internet search in late 2009 somehow lead me to bitcoin.org ! A then unknown and mostly unused crypto. currency that interested me greatly.Infact, when I started using the bitcoin software there were only around 10 'stable' bitcoin nodes / or regular users by IP address... Yes, with the proper port 8333 forwarding on my router.  That was the total size of the bitcoin network when I joined it!I was generating over 50 BTC (bitcoins) a day for many months! and we had fun 'trading' them like electronic buttons or bottle tops in a family game of poker. I was active on the forum and even predicted bitcoins inflation and future 'rise to fame'. In fact, at one time I had over 12,500 bitcoins in my wallet.Sadley, I traded or donated all of them (keeping only around 100 BTC, which I still have) in favor of other e-currencies such as Liberty Reserve to trade forex with. Doh!I figured I would be OK to generate more, before the internet masses arrived. However, it was not to be, the CPU difficulty level and generation rate increased quickly (in almost a matter of weeks), as the masses arrived with increasingly powerful CPU's / hundreds of VPS servers, owned by large established tech. companies (not to mention the botnets that followed) and this made my existing CPU power almost 'worthless' and I was unable to generate the large amounts of coins, as before.Safe to say, if I'd kept my bitcoins, I'd be a fairly well-off guy right now (which I'm certainly not at present), infact I sold my bitcoins not that long before the first major price spike. I even did early chart predictions for bitcoin inflation based on gold prices and info. I had found whilst learning about forex trading! - Whilst others were still fixing the BTC price against only the electricity costs used to generate them, at that time around a few cents per. coin. I had also suggested that the price should instead also be linked to other commodities (or goods and services), such as gold and could then be traded on markets in the future, just like in forex i.e. USDBTC etc.Gutted.However, very few people in this world (certainly not more than around 20, I guess) can say that they had personal, although totally anonymous communication with the still 'unknown' pseudonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto. I was one of them and always will be!  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_NakamotoI infact generated a proportion of the very bitcoins that were sold to 'some guy' who sold them to 'another guy', who then brought the now 'infamous' ~$25 worth of pizza for 10,000 BTC! Ah, the good old days!? See: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/HistoryLOL - I have to laugh about it, otherwise I'd cry. I guess I'm just very unlucky. I 'won the lottery' and traded it for lulz.    "Posted by myself on this forum: http://www.donnaforex.com/forum/index.php?topic=9917.msg250993#msg250993"I ran the very first BTC to LR exchange service, the total transactions in LR USD were less than a few hundred dollars, at that time. The domain was on a free sub-domain cz.cc that got closed down due to abuse by other spam websites etc. Some of my LR funds that I exchanged from BTC were also retained (stolen) by various 3rd party exchangers and fx brokers. Most of my converted bitcoins were spent trying to expand and grow my new online businesses, that at the time, were potentially more profitable in the long-term, or were used for my day-to-day living expenses. Basically, I made a lot of very bad decissions, whilst trying to do the right thing or make the best of bad situations!Obviously, I have a love / hate relationship with bitcoin today!""One of the last things I did before leaving the forum was to donate 500 BTC to the Bitcoin Faucet https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/ set-up by GA, who is now one of the lead developers at bitcoin.org http://bitcoin.org/en/development "Anyway, the rest is history and I'm back now!

Testing... Anyone still here ?      I-am-not-anonymous:"Imagine the following Scenario:A Man walks into a liquor store--he strolls up to the counter and stares the clerk right in the face, but says nothing.  The man has a pocket, in his pocket is a cell phone or other mobile device, on this device is the latest BITCOIN App (in the future, his mobile device might even have on the fly encryption, who knows).In the Clerk's pocket is the very same App.The cell phones identify one another and trigger a bitcoin transaction!The Clerk takes a bottle of Jack Daniels off the shelf and hands it to the man."On the house" he says.The Clerk does not record the exchange as a sale, in fact, he writes it off as a loss  GrinThe man is pleased that he was able to purchase his booze cheaply without the annoyance of sales and sin taxes.The man returns to his place of work, he is a high-level engineer and yet his salary is only $6000 a year!  barely enough to tax!However, every other Friday he receives a a large donation of BITCOINS from an anonymous "secret santa" that may or may not be his boss.  He then buys more liquor, and, in the same manner, hemp bedsheets, and organic groceries!  His tech-saavy landlord takes bitcoin as rent and as a result, does not technically own an 'apartment complex" but rather a large private home filled "roomates" who stay there for "free".  This of course is suspicious and attracts attention and one of the phony "tenants" even breaks down and confesses the whole thing to the cops. Problem is, even with all his bitcoin data they can't trace his transactions back to the landlord and thus have no evidence of wrongdoing other than one witnesses testimony and circumstantial evidence. Suddenly tax evasion is about as dangerous as internet piracy.I also have an idea that the number of panhandlers will explode.  You see, let's say you need some bitcoins but all you have is cash.  You go down to the park and see a bunch of homeless people begging.  You come near the homeless people and suddenly your phone vibrates, alerting you to some bitcoin activity!  A message from bitcoin appears on the screen, it is a randomly generated string of words:"The Color Blue's frangibility is a necessity"Suddenly, one of the homeless beggars (who seems oddly well-dressed) shouts "the color blue's frangibility is a necessity!"  To onlookers, it sounds like just more crazy homeless talk, to you it sounds like you want to put a 100 dollar bill in his tin cup.  He takes the bill and pushes some buttons on his cell phone.  You are alerted to a fresh batch of bitcoins (the equivalent of 100 dollars) dropped into your account by yet another 'secret santa".  This might also happen with people "e-begging' for paypal money.These are the revolutions bitcoin, or programs like it, will bring upon us. " An unfortunate situation, which I hope can be resolved as best as possible.I used to consider these 'issues' in the early days of New Liberty Standard accepting PayPal etc. Which is why I chose to only use Liberty Reserve.Seriously, why bother to accept another digital or e-currency that allows for 'charge backs' ( i.e. PayPal / AlertPay ) for one that doesn't ( i.e. Bitcoin ) !" Be safe from the instability caused by fractional reserve banking and bad policies of central banks."PayPal is known to 'freeze' customer accounts without warning, not to mention numerous other 'bad policies' which are fundamentally against what Bitcoin stands for. Howerver, if you just want to purchase stuff of ebay its great... Has no one ever heard of the 'pay pal mafia' ? I'd rather use Perfect Money However, having said this I admire those offering a BTC <> PayPal Service. Its important for Bitcoin and all part of the experiment.Although, as the old saying goes "You can't have the penny and the bun !"...   I'm low on BTC at present, but looking to replenish the BitcoinFX BTC <> LR funds soon. When things become stable again. Whilst I agree that PeerBlock is mostly unnecessary when using Bitcoin, It may become increasing more useful as the Bitcoin network expands.It would even be possible to create a 'Bitcoin blocking list' for know 'bad nodes'.The 'default' blocking lists are mostly outdated and excessive, I agree. It's important to use the correct 'blocking lists' for your activity and to create your own custom lists. You can simply use it as powerful addition to your firewall. I often use it on my windows PC to help block Microsoft.  Here is a better custom list source: I-Blocklist - http://www.iblocklist.com/lists.php@ aceat64. Maybe try using Tor ( or another proxy system ) and always delete all trackers before you connect ( only works with DHT, etc. ofc).P.S. I realize this upsets some Tor exit node operators, although as Torrent clients like Vuze incorporate Tor usage options (and I have also run an exit node) I don't see much of a problem with it. Just respect the exit node operators with acceptable usage.

With the growing number of very talented 'techies' and coders on this forum - I'm sure that a portable version of Bitcoin will not be to far away.Maybe someone has the time to convert is as a Portable App. with the permission of Satoshi of course.See: http://portableapps.com/ and http://portableapps.com/developmentHowever, I've found a nice simple way to make it portable for now on Win32 - XP Only - using MojoPac ! See: http://www.mojopac.com/MojoPac free provides all the functionality that you need. N.B. You need XP admin rights to install and run MojoPac.This has many advantages; the main being that you can store your Bitcoin installation and your Bitcoin wallet on a USB stick or even your ipod !Whilst many of you will spot some potential privacy issues with using MojoPac ( or even XP  ) the ability for portable 'Plug-and-Play' Bitcoin payments from 'random' locations such as a work PC or internet cafe is very cool ! This is also an excellent method for separately storing your Bitcoins.N.B. You will have the usual Bitcoin 'issues' with Microsoft Security Essential if it is installed on the 'host' XP.You should also realize that your wallet.dat is accessible when browsing the contents of the USB stick.I advise using TrueCrypt: http://www.truecrypt.org/ to prevent this. Tor, Firefox and most other applications will run very happily in MojoPac also.The screen shot below shows my 'test' installation connected and downloading the 'blocks' to the USB. Check the E:\ directory N.B. It is XP, I just have the Visual Effects 'off' for performance...I even had Bitcoin running on the host XP ! So, you can instantly 'flick' between MojoPac and the host XP, transfer the Bitcoins back and forth and log-out. Of course there would be no point in running 2 'generating' instances of Bitcoin this way because they would just be fighting for CPU. I've considered the provision of a Bitcoin Bank before now, basically providing interest payments to those unable to run an 'always on' generating node.Whilst this is a nice idea, there is basically no benefit to the operator aside from philanthropy.Also, as Bitcoins become harder to generate the operator ( Bank ) would require an ever increasing percentage of nodes to maintain any viability.This is somewhat unethical. You can't centralize a decentralized exchange / banking system. Every Bitcoin node is its own Bank ! That's the point.The only real alternate; provision of Bitcoin 'banking' via deposits of 'other currencies', then paying interest in Bitcoins should be considered an exchange service... and arguably the operator would still need to generate 'interest' on any deposits. A 'Bitcoin ISA'...Either way you will need a Super Computer or 2, loads of VPS or a botnet to operate with any success.Again, you are forcing capitalism and monopoly on a system which is fundamentally designed against these factors !
Indeed noagendamarket I have.Remember: that different brokers accept e-currencies and / or 'regular methods' for deposits and withdrawals.You can start trading at a low level using e-currency deposits at some brokers, as I described in my first post, or perhaps choose a more 'regulated' broker in your jurisdiction.Signing up through cash back forex and depositing say $500 < to a Micro account and then having a medium to high 'automated' trading volume with EA robots will 'yield' a good amount of Liberty Reserve rebates ! A really nice way to 'fund' an LR account and have other real profits too. Remember: to buy and donate Bitcoins for that LR    At this point I should probably give some advice on the 'commercial' 100% automated - robot EA's that actually 'work'. No robot trader can always be profitable, however I've tested most of the 'commercial' ones available and know whats working for me, when I'm not manual trading. Marketing 'hype' and price within the forex EA product market has nothing to do with the quality or profitability it would seem.I have great results currently with; Forex Shocker, MegaDroid (Pro), Forex Over Drive, Forex Maximizer (not advanced), Forex Cash Rocket / Forex Cash Rocket Turbo and RoboMiner / PipStrider.Here is a good independent testing site: http://www.bestforexrobots.net/ of new 'robots'I'm not a representative for any of the above products, services, websites etc. I'm just sharing my knowledge of automated trading. You trade at your own risk obviously. Good Luck. Happy Trading. I think that avast requires 'registration' ?AVG Free is a 'Top Ranked' anti-virus. It won't cause any issues with Bitcoin usage and it's my choice for a free Windows Anti-virus. OK Last of the 'shameless' referral links...  Anyone who might develop an interest in trading Forex through this thread and for those who may already be trading sizable accounts - please also consider signing-up or getting new trading accounts through Cash Back Forex. See: http://www.cashbackforex.com/?aid=4300They offer 2nd tier rebates to referrals and you will also notice that they make payments via Liberty Reserve ( and other payment methods )The more rebates obtained = a bigger % donated to the BitcoinFX exchange balance !P.S. I somewhat strongly resent the posting of referral links in forums myself. However, I think that most of you would agree that there is 'Method in the Madness'... Basically using retail Forex trading and 3rd party rebate offers to 'psyphon' rebates to e-currency accounts and then using them to help 'back' Bitcoin exchange, via donation, albeit at a very low level.Think about it. The rebates are effectively obtained from the global banking system via retail Forex trading. 100% legal 'low level' backing for Bitcoin through 3rd party referral contribution, as a 'hobby'. If that's not a simple example of Crypto Anarchism at its finest, then I don't know what is.  I also run Bitcoin, Gomez Peer and BONIC ( World Community Grid ) on 2 of my older XP machines. However, they are duel core, So I set Bitcoin to use just 1 Core and BONIC to use 50% resources. I rarely hit 100% CPU usage for both cores, even with additional application usage.You should try to find a good balance between CPU usage, productivity, charity and economics. I forgot to mention that Meta Trader 4 will run 'without issues' in Virtual Machines and WINE.See: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=2893&iTestingId=22068It's also very low CPU usage and only needs about 128 MB of RAM max.BitcoinFX.   OK. So, most Bitcoin users have 'always on' PC's whilst generating their Bitcoins.I support BitcoinFX - My Independent Bitcoin to Liberty Reserve - Exchange Service through trading Forex. Basically I donate around 50% of the profits from 2 dedicated Micro Forex trading accounts to the available Liberty Reserve balance each month. The brokers I use accept Liberty Reserve and other existing e-currencies for deposits and withdrawals. I don't have the time to trade manually on these accounts, so I use 'profitable' EA's (Expert Advisor's) - 100% automated robots - to trade the accounts 24/5. This is allowed on the Meta Trader platform and by the broker(s)So, what I've realized is that if I can do this... then so can anyone who is running a Bitcoin node ! You can use your own generated e-currency 'profits' to help kick start the Bitcoin economy by supporting existing Exchange Services or perhaps even by starting your own exchange ! We are talking  'Micro' levels here, but every Bit helps Proposal / Methods:(1) If you don't have a Liberty Reserve account the please sign up for one using this link https://www.libertyreserve.com/?ref=U9745970 This is the BitcoinFX - Liberty Reserve referral link and by opening an account we will receive $0.25 LR and you will receive $0.05 LR. Do not create fake accounts.See: https://www.libertyreserve.com/en/referral/index.aspxBitcoinFX will always have a min. $10.00 LR USD balance to ensure the referral bonuses.Our $0.25 LR will of course be donated to our available BitcoinFX Exchange balance. (2) Next you would need to open a Bonus 500 Cent account at ForexCent.Please use this referral link: http://www.forexcent.com/eng/forex_bonus.html?p=0209Once the account is open you should send your account no. and Liberty Reserve account no. to the email address on the BitcoinFX website.You should then make a Bitcoin donation to the value of $5 LR USD and I will send a personal payment of $5.05 LR USD (to cover the 1% LR transfer fees) so that you can deposit $5.00 LR to your ForexCent Bonus 500 account. Thus, giving you a starting trading balance of 1,000 cents."Level 3: deposit 5$ and more will increase leverage up to 1:100 and maximum orders number to 15." The deposit is important to raise your leverage from 1:5 to 1:100 !I will then email you the free Expert Advisor to trade with on your account ! Full instructions are included. However, you agree to use the robot EA at your own risk.I receive broker 'rebates' from your trading, which in turn I will add to the BitcoinFX available LR Exchange balance  Any profits you make from trading are of course yours to keep, donate, exchange for more Bitcoins or do with whatever you want.If you have experience of MT4 already and want to take a look at the free robot EA pack just donate me say 100 Bitcoins (which of course will be added to the BitcoinFX exchange balance.) and drop me an email. Obviously, I cannot ensure that the robot is profitable always and again you agree to use it at your own risk, but I use it with much success and it is much better than most 'commercial trash' EA's. If you don't trade it with success, then I'm not getting any ongoing rebates either...(3) Another 'quality' free EA that you might also consider trading with is Euronis see: http://euronis-free.com/free.htmlYou must sign-up at a new broker using the referral links on the Euronis website. You can obtain Euronis with just a $2 deposit at either Master Forex or Lite Forex. T's and C's apply of course. Deposits via LR are available at both brokers. Euronis is no longer available for Micro accounts by the developer team. It starts at around $200.I intend to initially allocate a LR personal 'donations' pool of around $50 to $100 for genuine Bitcoin users / forum members to take up the above proposition. So, please only consider contacting me regarding the above if you are serious about the offer and willing / able to run MT4 24/5.However, feel free to replicate this offer / opportunity with your colleagues, friends and fellow Bitcoin users. Using your own referral links etc.The more Bitcoin users that are also using other existing e-currencies will only help to boost / kick start a more diverse Bitcoin economy for the future !BitcoinFX Hello Stone Man,The Bitcube currently resides on Page 5 and is now worth over £500 ( in terms of You-Cubez advertising space ), not including the added Bitcoin value !It has not been sold nor is it currently for sale  To be honest I haven't increased its value as much as I should of done over the past month, due to other time and work commitments. It's still a standard Cube, but I will upgrade it in the future.I'm looking for a cheap VPS and perhaps using the google app Engine to incorporate the 'interactive' aspects that were defined in expanding the project in the first posts. The most suitable I've found perhaps being http://tinyvps.co.uk/ and I've contacted support to find out if 100% CPU would cause them any 'issues'. They allow IRC and P2P though. The Bitcube continues to serve its purpose of providing 'random' advertising for Bitcoin to internet marketers and the 'pay-to-click' communities, who also keep 'lower level' e-currency accounts. I've run a Tor exit node before and currently run an entry node and I'm not part of any 'three letter agency' Its not always about anonymity and privacy either ! For some internet users its more about circumvention and simply reaching 'blocked' content with a degree of security.Of course the 'powers that be' , malicious individuals etc. monitor proxies, but what is the alternative ?Now, whats the quote about "Privacy, Security or Anonymity ?" Choose any 2, you can't have all 3... not to mention how 'fast' the service is.With regards to Bitcoin it isn't just about the above issues either. Surely, It's about developing a 'pick and mix' economy with linked services and their users.Its totally up to the end user to determine what they require and trust etc. Although, without more quality Bitcoin accepting services people will be less likely to trust Bitcoin.As, for suggesting not to use google !? I think that Bitcoin is making us paranoid Here's a really good free example of using google for circumvention. Ace VPN http://www.acevpn.com/free-proxy-server-to-surf-anonymous/With this GPL Python Script and selection of the best server I've managed to stream ABC in the UK. Whats google got to do with it ? Well, its based on GAppProxy http://code.google.com/p/gappproxy/ Google App Engine http://appengine.google.com/Not that its got much to do with Bitcoin, but I'd just thought I'd share that one to demonstrate that its not always about privacy, security or anonymity. Getting back to the original thread...I've also looked into offering a proxy service that accepts bitcoin. However, issues relating to increased anonymity will always rely on more established proxy services or the "friend-to-friend" trust approach. "You can't be anonymous by yourself"...etc.The best free choice is of course the Tor Project - http://www.torproject.org/ and then perhaps I2P - http://www.i2p2.de/However, whilst searching https://sesawe.net/ for other suitable existing alternatives that might offer advantages in terms of speed, compatibility, flexibility and reliability etc. I was reminded of Your Freedom - https://www.your-freedom.net/Whilst it offers free and paid for options ( the free option not being of much use for a Bitcoin client ) it does support Socks and its client is Java based and highly flexible. It also supports OpenVPN ! - http://openvpn.net/They also offer an incentive scheme https://www.your-freedom.net/index.php?id=189 where you can earn 'points' for running a CGI relay to pay for the extended services. Given that most Bitcoin users have always on PC's / Servers I think that this could provide for an interesting relationship. There may also be the option to sell your voucher codes for bitcoins etc. ? There are many further possibilities for bitcoin service providers.I tested Bitcoin through Your Freedom and the only problem is that it limits 'streams' to 10. So, a GUI option to control this in Bitcoin would be perfect !See: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=223.0It is also possible that Your Freedom might consider accepting Bitcoin as a payment method ! They already accept PayPal, CashU, UKash, Liberty Reserve , Virtual Terminal Network ( an African provider ) and RoutePay ! See: https://www.your-freedom.net/index.php?id=114There are many similarities between the users of such anonymity / proxy / circumvention software also requiring an anonymous payments solution. This type of paid service and relationship is also good for the expansion of Bitcoins exchange service providers.I'm going to contact support to request if they might consider accepting bitcoin and also consider an upgrade to test the paid service. Its important that they don't recognize Bitcoin as an IRC 'botnet' ... which of course it is not. Might I 2nd this request as a 'standard' GUI feature.I've recently tested bitcoin through various socks proxies / providers and the ability to limit connections below 10 would be really useful.    The "Your Bitcoin Address" is now a non-essential field as it is not required for a BTC > LR exchange and I will have a valid email contact if the exchange is LR > BTC to confirm a missing required Bitcoin address.Please use bitcoinfx @ gmx.com if you need to contact me.Thanks.  My BitcoinFX - Liberty Reserve Exchange Service is now buying and selling Bitcoins. Although everything had been correctly running and tested prior to launch I have encountered some unforeseen technical issues.I'm based in the UK and google mail, which I have been using as my email contact and for the web form, has recently decided to change all UK @googlemail.com addresses to @gmail.com !What is unusual is that prior to this optional change I could use either, despite having registered as @googlemail. Due to all other gmail users, especially in the USA, using @gmail I opted for this. However, I have been unable to receive @gmail mails whilst this change has been taking place !As far as I know I have always been in control and therefore the intended recipient of both addresses ( which are now the same account (again) ! ). So, privacy has not been affected. I have just not temporarily been receiving any mails ! I will of course raise this issue with google. Please see the attached screen shots.I have switched to an @gmx.com address for the time being.In the future I will be using a paid email address with SSL and a PGP Key and implementing a secure SSL web form for the exchange requests as this is the only part of my service which actually requires additional security and privacy.Forum user laszlo has been the only Bitcoin user to make an exchange request and I apologize for the delay. The details for the exchange request were held on the server, I just had not received an email to inform me of the request. I have contacted laszlo to confirm the request and resolve this exchange asap. laszlo, OK thanks I will check the web form now and send you a PM.Update: I have the details of your exchange request and will email you to complete the exchange.Please see this forum topic http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155.0 which explains the delay. laszlo I would offer to buy you a pizza, but I'm not based in the USA, so they might think I'm a prank caller.If you don't get any other offers I might look into how to go about buying you one online.Are you getting hungry or do you just like pizza ?  Good News. After much delay my BitcoinFX Exchange is now funded with $50 LR.I have also set-up a Micro Forex Trading account, which is funded with Liberty Reserve, I will be adding 50% of any monthly profits to the LR exchange balance as I go along. So, I should always have some available USD LR. Please add that I now buy and sell Bitcoins for Liberty Reserve on the Trade page.Thank you.P.S. We are all getting there Bit by Bit  Joozero, 'Generated (50.00 matures in 49 more blocks)' means that you have generated 50 bitcoins. They will show as your 'balance' when the total block count reaches 56,503 blocks.I notice also that you only have 15 connections, this is currently the max. if you are not port forwarding correctly. Which of course you don't have to, but if you can afford some more bandwidth / connectivity remember the port is 8333 not 833 as you typed above.Welcome to the forum !   If you are hosting the 'private' game on pokerTH then you have to play in it. PokerTH uses a RNG just like any 'real' online poker software, so it's completely fair anyway.As I hosted the last one and now that we have more fellow 'Bitcoiners' I would be more than happy to host another one ? I suggest the same format as the previous one ( so that newcomers can get used to it ) i.e. 55 Bitcoin entry fee and I will provide an additional 1000 Bitcoins for the prize pool.So, how about Sat. 29th of May 2010 at 3PM ET ? Please send me a PM if you would be interested in playing in this 2nd tournament.Thanks.BitcoinFX. lol   Anyone know of any pizza eating hairdresser's ?   Nice work ! I have a spare Mini Mac that I can test and run it on I need to re-install it though, so will probably be up and running after the weekend... I'm based in the UK. Here are a few innovative companies that I'm considering using when I implement and migrate some of my services.Green Tech. ( Energy Saving / Custom Builds etc. )Very PC - http://www.very-pc.co.uk/Green ISP - http://www.greenisp.net/Please post similar links for your countries / region P.S.

OS, security etc. etc.Sun Crypto Accelerator 6000 PCIe Cardhttp://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/networking/031146.htmMore links soon... discuss... Update:The Bitcube currently has a You Cubez 'advertising space' value of over £250 (which is probably a sale value of around £1.00+, not including the added Bitcoin value)The Bitcube has received just over 1000 hits on You Cubez alone ! and I'm continuing my occasional promotion of the page in other traffic exchanges.The Bitcube currently resides on page 7 and is on target for reaching the 1st page within 6 months. (once I purchase a premium membership.)   Indeed they are and you should exercise extreme caution before even considering 'investing' and also view most HYIP's as a game of chance.I can be considered a trusted admin and my Private Investment Club opportunity is intentionally 'low level' and 'low risk'.Sabunir had expressed interest in the original BitcoinFX Private Investment Club opportunity, so I have offered a 100% free share, for my usage of the banner designs. I will offer more free shares to Bitcoin Forum members in the future.Please understand that what I'm effectively doing is 'backing' Bitcoins with my profitable Forex Trading abilities, as well as, creating an interest and demand for Bitcoins with existing e-currency users at the same time. I have 'backed' both projects with $1000 LR to avoid any issues.This is a much more logical approach than just offering an 'exchange' service where you are effectively just 'giving away' USD or EUR for 'digital tokens' ...However, I fully understand your concerns. I have recently revised my Liberty Reserve Exchange Service website - BitcoinFX - http://www.bitcoinfx.cz.cc/ I will soon be funding and maintaining the availability of both BTC and LR at a 100% ratio against the exchange rate. I have chosen to use a http://www.nic.cz.cc/ domain because it is purposefully obscure ! It is a paid domain for 2 years and is automatically renewable. Its an extremely inexpensive method for hosting a domain with SSL support and Privacy Protect. ( Less than $5 for 2 years ) I have full control over my A Record etc. and the web host is very stable. In the future I will be adding SSL and the LR and Bitcoin API's to make the exchange service 100% automated, as long as their are available funds.I'm also advertising in Bitcoin in Money Share Forums / e-currency Investment Forumshttp://www.moneyshareforum.com/index.php?showtopic=3513 - Bitcoin P2p Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin P2P Cryptocurrency - Free - Open Source Software Project !Whilst I would not recommend 'investing' in most of the 'sites' on this forum. Searching through the posts and links will give some of you an incite into just how popular e-currencies are with this type of community. This type of activity makes up a massive percentage of e-currency transactions and I consider it very relevant in the successful future of Bitcoin.Thank you.  Yes. It would be very useful and it will become somewhat essential in calculating a more accurate exchange rate in the future !Regardless of the number of individual user connections, I would also like to see the total number of connected nodes vs the number of 'generating' nodes in the Bitcoin interface. It would also be good to know the highest and lowest number of connected nodes in any 24hr period.As Bitcoins usage becomes more 'Macro', just calculating daily exchange rates is not going to be enough to satisfy Bitcoins diverse 'digital' community. Using 'Micro' exchange rate calculations from this data and the existing factors that NLS already includes will enable many more possibilities such a 'live trading'.It would also be interesting to see the total number of transactions and the total amount of those transactions, again for a 24hr period.You don't need to affect any aspects relating to user anonymity. You just need to harness the readily available data to plot high, low, medium and the mode.What I'm basically saying is that this is a 'digital' currency (obviously), yet the projects 'base rate' is still effectively being calculated using 'paper' math !!!This is not to say, that NLS isn't already doing a great job ! Not to mention satoshi's ( and any others ) excellent work in building the thing.I think I will make a request list and add a topic in Technical...I'm far from an 'expert' programmer, but with much IT and trading experience I have a good idea of what 'could' be calculated and added for the benefit of future users.Having glanced over the 'active' source code much of the above is already being used in the 'functioning' of the software. I don't know whats planned for future releases, but we must have the foresight to collect and harness this type of data. Can any of the above be 'historically' viewed via irc data ? I've been making backwards neural network calculations and future predictions and would like to continue with this to help the project.  Welcome Xunie ! Good suggestion.Great job ! sirius-mAlong with the usual essential wiki guides... Might I suggest one of the first additions is an API 'how to'  I'm eager to fully open my LR Exchange Service and I'm busy having 'fun' with http://www.libertyreserve.com/EN/help/programmatic-access/api/Thanks. Indeed SmokeTM you are correct.I'm not worried about that. I just enjoy the ability to change the domain address. I'm also able to change my 'static' IP Different usages and requirements for the proxy and / or hosting service of course.  I'm looking to upgrade both my proxy hosting machine and service provider. ( lots of Chinese users will want to access google .com soon for their gmail accounts ! etc. ) I will be expanding the payment methods to accept Bitcoins. The new provider also has 2x split static IP capabilities. I'd imagine I might have enough bandwidth to launch the service, I'm not sure about maintaining it though, if the service was to become very popular. My bandwidth is unlimited though and it is a 'business' account.It would have to be a non TLD with maybe a domain forward. DynDNS.com springs to mind again. How about something like: bitcoin-file-hosting.doesntexist.org Some file hosting services also pay users to download others content. It would be cool if users could offset their subscription by downloading others content and receiving some bitcoins back in return. This would give the subscription a higher 'value' and also promote its usage. However, it would be much more complex to build / operate and downloading would have to be limited per. user account and IP etc. All proxy services and software solutions have advantages and disadvantages for both the operator and it users.The 1st version of Psiphon is very easy to install and implement. Users are only known to the operator via a registered email address, access passwords can be changed on demand and logging is enabled for any 'problem' usage. User accounts can also be deleted.I update the above mentioned .dll's etc. to keep it running as fast and securely as possible.Users receive the https address to connect to, they then accept the self signed SSL cert. (which can be changed) This gives them the login page where they enter the username and password and begin browsing.The https address defaults to https :// xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:443/random_sub_domain I use DynDNS.com updater, so that my IP is protected and so that I can provide any 'blocked' users with a new 'random' domain. i.e. https://random.ath.cx:443/random_sub_domainThis means that my service doesn't even operate on a TLD and I can change the address whenever I like.This has advantages over something like Tor, because it just looks like a secure browser connection to a random service. The main problem with Tor, for say users in China is that Tor is easily identifiable as Tor. In many respects a Psiphon type proxy is much more Private and Secure.I use an Untangle Gateway and OpenDNS with some advanced blocking to control 'unwanted' content access. Quite right. However, given that Bitcoin is 'sudo-anonymous' it means that its more prone to fraud and illegal activities than many other currencies. At least in theory and hence the reason for this being a popular topic for discussion, especially in terms of prevention and limitation.I-am-not-anonymous that is an 'extreme' example... No. You don't come across as a 'know-it-all'. I enjoy reading your post and contributions.However, I would much rather just sit at my desk and transfer 'payments' around by text msg etc. than have to drive across town to post a letter. Only to return home and remember that I'd forgotten to buy the darn hair nets (again) rofl.Google Paper has experience of shipping to http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html Also found liqpay (mobile payments) - https://www.liqpay.com Yep.

I have also heard of 'problems' with Perfect Money.Most of what I listed was for discussion and was not a recommendation. Again, we are here to share ideas and information, good, bad or indifferent.  Yes. I was also highlighting the fact that 'snail mail' is slow. Also, on a 'paranoid' note it's not 'anonymous' to send a 'franked' envelope, revealing your location and which also contains your DNA. Not that this is a realistic consideration for micro payments anyway. Much better to buy a 'mobile' credit card and toss it in a ditch. If you are that way inclined.I'm not saying 'snail mail' is a bad idea. Just discussing the pros and cons... Thanks for the opinion, link and info. I will look into and try that one.We are all here to learn, discuss and share information. You can decide to accept Bitcoins and / or LR/Pecunix, both or neither !It does make sense to exchange LR/Pecunix with Bitcoins and vice versa;(1) You (customers) can generate Bitcoins.(2) You (customers) can buy, sell, or exchange items, goods and services which you can't with just Bitcoins and vice versa.You know you can obtain a bank card to withdraw LR USD from an ATM !

Bitcoins FTW Yes. Any built proxy implementation would be open source and automated bitcoin payments would be great.I will post the psiphon info. and links because the project has just moved from v1 to v2 and the implementations are very different.Psiphon is a free 'circumvention' tool and should remain so. However, I've run a private and personally updated / secured 1.6 version and do accept 'token' donations from some of my users."Psiphon is a web proxy designed to help Internet users securely bypass the content-filtering systems used to censor the internet. Psiphon was developed by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.License: GNU General Public LicenseSource code: http://psiphon.ca/download/psiphon-src-1.6.tar.gzhttp://wikipedia.org/wiki/Psiphonhttp://psiphon.ca/https://launchpad.net/psiphonPsiphon is a user-friendly, simple to administer, web-based proxy application. It allows users in regions with unrestricted Internet access to provide access to denied content to their friends, family, and associates in regions with restricted access.Please contact the project leader if you're interested in helping us take Psiphon forward.NOTE: The Psiphon 1.x and 2.x series are essentially different products with different architectures. Psiphon 1.x is a light-weight web proxy designed to run on a home PC (MS Windows-based) with no central management component. With Psiphon 1.x, a user asks a friend to run a proxy and can then access blocked sites via his or her friend's Internet connection. The Psiphon 1.x source code is available here: https://code.launchpad.net/~psiphon-inc/psiphon/psiphon-1.6.The new project is Psiphon 2.x, a centrally managed web proxy system deployed by Psiphon Inc. to provide censorship circumvention services."Great source code here in reference to designing and building our own separate bitcoin style implementation. I'd grab the 1.6.tar.gz for your reference satoshi, before it becomes to 'historical'. It's also not that easy to compile the 1.6 version on Linux anymore.The 1.6 Win32 version has now been removed from the original project website. I actually run my existing proxy service on a windows box, with additional security. I have the msi and documentation if anyone can't find it elsewhere or would like it for reference etc. I keep it up-to-date and secure from the following sources;SSL - http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.htmlVisual C++ 2008 Redistributables for msvcpXX.dll and msvcrXX.dllhttp://www.sqlite.org/download.htmlPrecompiled Binaries For Windows for sqlite3.dllJava and some flash support is always an issue though !I would be happy to work on and share contributions for a 'bitcoin' proxy software, but have limited time and developer experience myself. Maybe you should contact the psiphon developers for a separate v1.6 style implementation yourself satoshi ?I understand that the Tor project is also looking for a payment / incentive system for it's server operators. Could you change the thread title to "Re: Idea for file hosting and proxy services". Thanks.Regards,BitcoinFX Good idea.I'll eventually be setting up a 'one hop', SSL, http, login protected proxy service (similar to the 1st Psiphon project) and accepting bitcoins as payment.I'm UK based so it will be good for using BBC iplayer etc.  I will be giving bitcoin users priority service, as well as users from 'restricted' countries.I doubt I'll have the spare bandwidth for a file hosting service though, maybe. Good idea. I also think that the advantages would outweigh the disadvantages. It would need to be 'optional' for sure.However, from my basic understanding of public key cryptography I can't conceive a method to implement this without affecting anonymity. Moreover, as the 'service provider' you are already in contact with your customer. Therefore, why 'leak' some of this information with other bitcoin nodes.It would be a bit like signing a 'mixminion' email with the actual 'from' address.    "Banner Statistics - EasyHits4UURL - http://www.bitcoin.org/Alt Text - Bitcoin.org P2P Anonymous Digital CurrencyPer day - 1000Status - acceptedStatsImpressions received - 10000Clicks - 11CTR - 0.11%Every click on your banners ads is worth a lot  those users who click on your ads may become your referrals or even clients.

In addition to 'best computing practices' and network security I wanted to share a simple method that I will be using to securely store and safeguard my 'customers' Bitcoins.As well as, the usual back-up of the wallet.dat, encryption, regular system patching / updates and having a good firewall etc, etc...I realized that I don't need to 'store' the Bitcoins at the Bitcoin address that is (a) managing transactions (b) generating more Bitcoins and which, therefore, is 'online' 24/7 and 'open' to a potential attacker.A 2nd 'offline' machine with Bitcoin installed can be used to store the Bitcoins and only ever be connected to the internet when a bulk transaction is required. This 2nd Bitcoin address is only know to the service provider. This is a very simple solution to provided an always-on 'front of house' with secured 'vault' banking. In the unlikely event that a 'hacker' manages to steal your wallet.dat there will be 'nothing' in it aside from the most recently generated Bitcoins. A somewhat paranoid approach, but I think all will agree, very effective for security and piece of mind.This maybe obvious to some, but I thought I would share this anyway.I also recently discovered and have started using the open source Untangle Gateway. http://www.untangle.com/This is great for Windows and Linux users and quite frankly I don't know of a better, free, 'all-in-one' solution that offers 'business' grade security.Anyone with any other ideas or solutions feel free to add them.

( well, cube ! ) lol    Thanks again.BitcoinFX. Ok thanks again Sabunir. I will get your new logo's / banners uploaded to the photobucket repository this weekend for all to use.6,500+ banners have been served to date.  Less than a 1% click rate, but at least some more folks have actually heard of Bitcoin !  I needed somewhere to serve / host the banner / logos from so I created a dedicated photobucket account for the moment.I hope that that is ok with you Sabunir as you indicated copyleft 'whatever'. I will add the others when I have a bit more time.

Just the job Sabunir. Thanks !Didn't show up with Adblock Plus on for me either, of course, NLS, thanks.10,000+ banners will be server on EasyHits4U and other traffic exchanges over the next few months. Even a gain of 1% in users should start Bitcoin rolling with the masses.  I don't think that any of us were actually going to 'deface' anything or intentionally do anything 'illegal'.  We were just being humorous. P.S. I'm just off to go and get Bitcoin.org tattooed on my forehead.  Good work !Please could someone perhaps design a Bitcoin 'banner' 468 x 60. I have around 10,000 banner impressions that I wouldn't mind donating to promote bitcoin.org on some traffic / hit exchanges. Thanks. wow ! Yeah looking really good As well as GNU GPL why not attach a Creative Commons License http://creativecommons.org/ to them. You can reference the project address and request a Bitcoin donation for their reproduction.  Quality and fantastic Sabunir ! I really like them.Suggestions:(1) The background 'fade' effect somewhat detracts from the text in the smaller versions of the logo. Almost making it unreadable (tricky one as I realize it's taken from the website header)(2) Maybe a mention of 'P2P'. Maybe not...(3) Embossed blue / dark blue outline ?I'd be happy to pay to use the logo's (I have already sent giik a token 100BTC donation) 
@ ihrhaseTo clarify I don't mean that paper money should be printed. I mean to build a 2nd implementation of the existing P2P software, that is directly related to the first, although has an infinite generation. However, I was looking way into Bitcoins future.Welcome to the forum btw.@ NLSYes. Decimal place additions are the obvious way to go. However, most existing currencies rarely show more than 2 decimal places I suppose... Classic idea sirius-m you crypto anarchist you ! Better still, you could make 'rubber stamps' for this very purpose and then set-up a website charging Bitcoins for them ! lolOn a more realistic note I've started promoting Bitcoin.org at various internet traffic / hit exchanges. This should add about 1000+ hits per week.  Good discussions, valid points and constructive arguments are offered by all in this thread. I have enjoyed reading the posts and deliberating on the issues myself. It's probably one of the most interesting threads on this forum so far...I could write an essay in response, but I'm not going to. Instead I will post a few thoughts and perhaps solutions.(1) I don't currently see Bitcoins as a currency. At the moment they are a commodity with potential 'real' economic value for the future. When investigating Bitcoins as a valid currency (using neural networks and comparisons with other existing currencies, commodities and existing markets) the more I see Bitcoins future model behaving somewhat like Gold i.e. a fairly stable 'base' commodity / currency.(2) I don't see the current Bitcoin economic model as unsustainable. The fact that their are a finite number of Bitcoins, is precisely what gives them any potential / actual economic value at all. However, I fully understand Suggester's concerns, particularly regarding hoarding etc.(3) Bitcoins are a finite 'base' commodity / currency. So, when 'production' eventually slows down to an unacceptable and perhaps unusable rate you simply introduce a 2nd 'Bitcoin' client which provides an infinite supply of eCurrency which is based on 'real' Bitcoin production and / or exchange rates. Let's call it 'Bitnote' i.e. an infinite electronic 'paper money' which is based on real Bitcoin 'value' and Bitcoins existing model. Similar to what the banks did with the inception of real 'paper money' ! (4) Concerns over hoarding, bot net control, government and bank intervention etc. can largely be solved by increasing Bitcoins user base as quickly as possible. No one wants to see a monopoly for a peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital currency.So, I'm going to post the Bitcoin pages on some internet traffic / hit exchanges ! People who use these services for promoting their online 'businesses' or personal pages are already big users of existing internet payment and eCurrency services. They are also 'surfing' for 'the next big thing'. Also, they are perhaps the most likely to try and implement Bitcoins into their accepted methods of payment etc. I encourage others to do the same or similar. "Bitcoins for ALL !"The above, in my opinion, will go a long way in helping to solve the perceived issues and future problems with Bitcoins as a currency with 'real' merchantability and 'true' economic value in the future.Get ready for the 'Gold Rush' !  (maybe)  OK I have sent it to:Jotti online file scanning service at http://virusscan.jotti.org/ - All participating AVs will get a copyVirusTotal online file scanning service at http://www.virustotal.com/ - All participating AVs will get a copyAlso, Ad-aware ThreatWork and some other online scanners.I don't expect them to report any real problems. However, this will help to get Bitcoin added to their users 'allowed' lists more quickly. http://virusscan.jotti.org/en/scanresult/965fa033015c3f5be619dbe58dc5706dbde9fdec/2e346be0ba06c1c9a36b00705b92cd34f7d37893https://www.virustotal.com/analisis/8fd5fefced48112b03e9683c52a62daac0b2e007a0a83dc4dd9b856d3dfbe487-1266194710OK. All 'false positives' as far as I can gather ! I'm 100% certain that it is a 'false positive' NewHEUR_PE is a 'Heur'istic-based detection.See: http://www.eset.com/threat-center/encyclopedia/glossary/newheurpeI will repeat part of a previous post.Let me explain further. Bitcoin is not a virus. What you have experienced is know as an anti-virus 'false positive' identification.See: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#False_positives "A false positive is identifying a file as a virus when it is not a virus."This often happens with 'new' software because anti-virus programs have never seen the program before. Anti-virus programs use Heuristic-based detection to try and identify unknown viruses, they basically guess if a program is malicious or not to try and 'protect' your PC.Anti-virus programs are somewhat simple in this respect, however they must enforce an "It's better to be safe than sorry" policy to secure their customer base.Maybe one day they will accept Bitcoins as payment for their products. I'm going to send a copy of the Bitcoin.exe installers to as many security, anti-adware, anti-malware and anti-virus companies as I can find, for clarification.This will make sure that Bitcoin is put on their 'allowed' list more quickly and will reduce the number of confused new users. Welcome XCInteresting links.Thanks. Welcome fergalishBitcoins will 'never' replace other 'world currencies'. That's a bit like suggesting that PayPal will replace the USD or that Gold will replace Oil or that credit cards will replace paper money. They are just not the same thing, however which ever way you look at it they all help the world go around.  Bitcoins are just another currency.Yes Bitcoin requires electricity and the internet to function. However, this hopefully doesn't rely only on Governments, you are ignoring Capitalism, the 'Corporation' and the free market. Are you suggesting that Bitcoin runs on the cypher net ?   Anarchy ? That's wishful thinking ! Such is the price of progress... lol Let me explain further. Bitcoin is not a virus. What you have experienced is know as an anti-virus 'false positive' identification. See: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#False_positives "A false positive is identifying a file as a virus when it is not a virus."This often happens with 'new' software because anti-virus programs have never seen the program before.

You received the NCIS Error because NOD32 incorrectly thought Bitcoin was malicious, when it is not and interrupted the installer .exe.NCIS stands for Nullsoft Scriptable Install System. This is what is used to 'build' the .exe from the Bitcoin 'code'. Basically NOD32 stopped it from being 'complete' and functioning correctly, by mistake. See: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Why_do_I_get_NSIS_ErrorYou may also need to add the bitcoin.exe process to your 'allowed' / 'ignore' list in NOD32 for it to function correctly.Hope this helps. Bitcoin is certainly not a virus. It just uses a lot of CPU power when running atm.Welcome to the world of software development. That is odd !?! I've currently only had 50.00 generations myself.   Indeed. No problems, just more flexible solutions.  Thank you for these sirius-m, giik and all future contributors. I might have ago at producing a logo myself.Is this a logo contest ? How many Bitcoins for the Winner ? Perhaps anyone who adopts a contributors logo for their website might consider a Bitcoin donation to it's creator(s) !  Since New Liberty Standard is currently the only 'open' exchange service for BTC to USD. Then it goes without saying that their is no 'real market' to help calculate a market price or other market influences from...'Which came first ? The chicken or the egg ?' Well, in terms of evolution the chicken of course !However, I understand what you mean and other 'closed' BTC to 'whatever' transactions will of taken place, probably. This is one issue concerning the usage of a sudo-anonymous currency and then trying to calculate market influences from transaction that don't exist ! You have to start somewhere."You can easily create a ฿/$ exchange service. Just provide a place where anyone is able to post bid/ask prices. Whenever there are corresponding bid and ask a deal would take place. A classical market."I agree and such a service already exists for eCurrencies http://exchangezone.com/ - Now they just need to add Bitcoins I'm already trying to build an exchange calculator and exchange rate predictor using a Neural Network and 'known' factors.I will be using Liberty Reserve for my exchange service and they accept USD, EUR and 'back' payments by Gold.So, my Neural Network model includes; XAU (Gold), EUR, USD exchange rates, the New Liberty Standard and Total Daily Block generation Rate / The Finite Number of bitcoins... and more.Oanda Historical Exchange Rates - http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-ratesOf course the value of Bitcoins has 'nothing' to do with the EURUSD at the moment, but these types of models are certainly useful in the future and can go along way to making our exchange rates behave like 'real' markets. From the FAQ:How are new Bitcoins created?New coins are generated by a network node each time it finds the solution to a certain calculational problem (i.e. creates a new block), for which an average solution time can be calculated. The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.What's the current total amount of Bitcoins in existence?The number of blocks times the coin value of a block. The coin value is 50 bc per block for the first 210,000 blocks, 25 bc for the next 210,000 blocks, then 12.5 bc, 7.25 bc and so on.As of October 30th 2009, there are about 26,000 blocks in the block chain, which means 26,000 * 50 bc = 1,300,000 bitcoins in existence. You can see the up-to-date number of blocks in the status bar of the Bitcoin main window.Current Block count as of 06th Feb. 2010 - 3.15 PM - GMT is 38,660 blocks. You can do the math  Welcome m0mchilNLS (New Liberty Standard's) methodology is not wrong, however you are somewhat correct with your thinking.Many factors in the future will influence the buy and sell price of Bitcoins, as well as, their overall merchantability.For example, if a goods or services provider decided to accept 100 Bitcoins for an item that costs $10 USD then this should massively effect the exchange rate.New Liberty Standard is doing fantastic and logical work to help "set the ball rolling". Take Gold for example, it's exchange rates are also determined by the cost of extraction i.e. electricity, workforce, transportation, machinery etc. These base factors are fairly certain before other market forces and influences.As I write this, I'm currently compiling a Neural Network model that takes into account other factors such as the finite number of Bitcoins, daily Gold and Silver fixings, other currency pairs and daily exchange rates and the average number of Bitcoin users etc. I'm of course factoring in the New Liberty Standard. This will be a very adaptable model to help calculate and predict future exchange rates and I will share it with our growing community. I guess if we need to make it a bit more distinguishable then we could adopt the italic version. ฿ BTC has already become the standard for the three-letter code I think and it makes a lot of sense.Using ฿ as the currency symbol I think is acceptable and I approve of the choice.The fact that it is not on many keyboards could easily be overcome by including it in a copy / paste box in the Bitcoin application in future versions, if it is adopted as the official symbol. For any windows or mac users that don't have M$ Office products the symbol is available using OpenOffice.org free and open productivity suite alternative.Insert > Special Characters ( Font = Tahoma , Subset = Thai )P.S. Maybe one day we might be able to trade BTCUSD in a Meta Trader style application !    Thanks SmokeTM.Both Micro donations were successfully received.

Post has been edited after the successful testing ***Anyone is still welcome to make a test payment to my IP. Please send me a forum PM first and stipulate in the comments if you are making a test payment or a donation, so that I can return your Bitcoins to you, if you wish. Any donations will be much appreciated and will help to set up the separate 'exchange service' faster.Please email: bitcoinfx @ gmail.com regarding any issues. (EDIT: no longer in use 2014)You can also visit my website: BitcoinFX - http:// www .bitcoinfx .cz.cc EDIT: Domain no longer active - An early manual e-currency exchange by email only - the domain only provided contact info. etc.Thank you.
