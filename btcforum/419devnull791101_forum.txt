it must be down to the increase in difficulty. i have on average a 2200 kh/s. it takes about 1 day now instead of 12 hours Hiim using the 64bit linux version. i installed two days ago and produced three lots of 50 coins. yesterday i produced 50 coins within two hours of the last lots completing and have had no others even starting since then. the last lots completed 8:51 am yesterday and its now 10am the next morning and ive got no transactions working at all. have i been snubbed for completing the last two too quickly? if so how long does this last?
