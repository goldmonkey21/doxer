OK, maybe one day I will really understand what it is doing, but for now, Ill just consider it as usage of electricity turned into money (roughly said).Thank you for your help! I am getting a hang here, but now I am wondering the next thing: When you launch Bitcoin, it heavily uses the CPU, but after a while, all I am hearing is my hard drive, and my CPU is at idle. I understand its gathering the hash for the blocks, but why is it raping my CPU at the startup, if its only supposed to gather data, process it and send it on? Right. I agree, I didnt read all of the "How to & What now" stuff, but I did not find my answer in the readme or FAQ. I had to go to the really-nerdy-looking-and-sounding-paper and read myself through.Anyways, thanks for the help. Sup, Im new to Bitcoin, I just downloaded the program a minute ago. I am quite suspicious on stuff on the internets, so dont wonder if my attitude is very "suspicioulish".I have read all the "How to start" and the usual, and I understand its a P2P software, but I havent gotten any information on why the heck is it using my CPU so much. "Computational problems" isn't the most informative answer (P2P program is supposed to use only your internets connection, not your processor), so, I am asking here: why in the name of Chuck Norris Bitcoin is using my CPU so much? What is it actually doing?
