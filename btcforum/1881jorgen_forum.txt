Ребята - молодцы! Так держать, быстро и автоматом вывел бтце коды в приват гривну. Can I buy from you now? If yes, give me your BTC address and I pay first. Can I have them for 2.5? Please check your PM I agree to wait till I am verifyed, but WHY THEY DO NOT ALLOW ME TO WITHDRAW MY DEPOSIT IN BITCOINSNOW IT REALLY SMELLS LIKE A SKAM I have opened an account on new exchange itbit.com and provided all documents to verify myself. Then I send 10 btc to provided bitcoin address and it was stated that it will arrive to my account after 11pm UTC 12.11.2013.Now it's 10:00 a.m. 13.11.2013 but BTC are STILL NOT ON MY ACCOUNT and the itbit.com support reply to my e-mail with the following: after reviewing the current system data it appears that your deposit will be processed in 8-12 hours. It's quite strange that this new startup which claim to get over 5 Millions of investments didn't make proper system for even simple bitcoin depositing.I warn all who want to try this new exchange to not hurry to deposit anythig to it.Finally I received bitcoins on my account, but still can't trade with them before my verification will be completed.Now I have another problem when I try to withdraw my "deposited" bitcoinsSystem do not allow me to do it with following message:No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 10.200.100.218:1833210:50 GMT 14/11/13 Finally I'm verified and can trade on the platform but still can't withdraw my bitcoinsI'm waiting reply from support... Yesterday I ordered 100 USD VCC from bitcodes and today still have no codes nor reply to my e-mails. Today, after sending him e-mail my Transaction code from his site show "The transaction code is invalid!" Hope he is not a scummer and this is some technical issue. But be careful with sending any coins to the service. jorgen1JtnTvDQA2Y8kaEDo2e3HGNGMuH6WtPu6tthanks! 60000 CNY    Just sent "Euler's number" in bitcoins   http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/bitcoin-prices-blast-100-driving-speculators-wild-150415225.html With old version of bitcoin clients I can easely connect to bitcoin network using tor, but after upgrading to 0.8.1 I can't see any connection in client. Is it some bug, do somebody else have the same problem? I use windows client, win7 32bit.Solution:New tor browser use 9150 port to connect to tor network, so just change default port value in bitcoin client from 9050 to 9150.

I use OKPay DEBIT CARD for shopping in Denmark and some merchants charged me extra 1,4% long before this news. Officially all POS transaction 0% (free). But in reality as I said some supermarkets charge extra fee. In addition to this en exta 4 to 5 % is lost on currency exchange!   Hej bitstamp support. I have BIG delay every time I deposit USD to my bitstamp account via bitinstant.Bitinstant reported "order complete" instantly, but money appeared on my account only next day in one case and today they also still somewere. How can I contact support by phone?

They promised every week to solve the problem next week and still nothing happened   Спасибо за инфу. Я то-же самое получил на мыло. Есть вопрос, если Вы вдруг имеете отношение к команде ОКПей, когда возобновится прием биткоинов, а то у меня такое впечатление, что весь саппорт дружно ушел в запой/загул. У меня со вчера "в ожидании" депозит в биткоинах и еще сегодня перевел немного с гокса прямым переводом на ОКПей (новая гоксовская фича), так с гокса снялось, а в ОКПее даже не попало в ожидание.  voted, 101st Just send PM to you. just signed your key! -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)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yC8B-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-------SSLID--4599c9e8b820b3194aa55e3f1f0377fd;--LOCATION--laptop;--LOCAL--192.168.2.4:32074;--EXT--91.100.98.25:32074; Now I know it.

Thanks, you are right. 2012-02-11    Bitcoin TerminationEffective immediately, Paxum Inc can no longer accept any accounts related to Bitcoin or Bitcoin Exchange. All current Bitcoin accounts have been closed and may no longer perform any transaction. Account holders will be able to withdraw their funds via wire transfer. This is not true! I use paxum with mtGox and I have no any notifications from paxum support However it's true that they change password because of login security engine upgrade.
Is it bug or not but I can't place bid in total amount bigger than 10000 USD  Recently there was a problem with withdrawing USD to paxum accounts for MtGox users.Now it is reported to be solved, but not for me  I did withdraw 1000 USD to my paxum account at 15 of September and still do not see the money.I did reported the problem to MtGox support on 21 of September and received standard formwhich I completed and return to them and since then I did not hear from them and they do not replyto my numerous requests to all e-mail I know. Please report if somebody have the same problem.Finally at 28/09/11 the problem is solved and money is on my paxum account.  Just the same. Can't login with username/pass incorrect  Mybitcoin support, please reply! Jed and Tux made a lot for bitcoin community in the past and I hope this accident will force them make double efforts to secure the No1 exchange!

Тогда непонятно почему они обещали встречу с представителем в Москва, Краснодар, Ростов-на-дону. Еще бы пообещали встречу в Одессе-маме тогда бы стало все на свои места. PS Так неужели никто таки не удосужился заключить договор? Лично я "пожертвовал" в систему 6856.67 монет но не заключал контракта по причине простой лени и моего удаленного местоположения (Дания).
It would be cool. BTW can I use it in Europe? Неужели никто из крупных инвесторов не встретился лично и не получил никаких гарантий от организаторов? Огласите паспортные данные сбежавшего(их). И пожалуйста перечислите биткоин адреса на которые инвесторы высылали биткоины. Есть возможность проследить транзакции и вычислить где зависли деньги. Возможно еще не все потеряно.Кстати биткоин адреса могут перечислить не только крупные инвесторы. Важно количество независимых адресов от как можно большего количества инвесторов. Даже если был инвестирован 1 биткоин адрес на который он был выслан все равно может помочь установить корреляции и попробовать вернуть потерянное хоть частично.Для затравки вот куда я посылал1Jy7qVfbtq914DEkhD1oYvvKZbXA9pqBpw1EEaZC1wJE9ZNWWQwCvGKcYdqafZJM3AT7 It would be great if somebody make a mirror as a tor hidden service and in I2P network. Doing so we could survive gov/hackers attacks. I was very nervous and can't sleep due to this recent bitcoin.org shutdown. Just place my bid. Check out at biddingpond please. I prefer electronic delivery. Just PM you.   Hope, and looking forward for this! Try to do my best now   Great, what's your ask price? Just payed last 2.97 to open the file. It works great! I used it before and I'll use it in future.I like Liqpay and also buy/sell bitcoins with their help. Dear Madhatter, Your service is the best! I received virtual Visa $100, but I don't want to register on the site. I just tryed to transfer all balance to my Liqpay account but I forget that because of the security measures Liqpay demand that cardholder's cell phone is from the same country as the card is.So I can only use it for online purchases. But if you can help me to transfer all or part of balance of my virtual Visa using yours or someone else mobile from Canada I would be happy! If you decide to help me in this matter PM me and I will securely email you my CC info and my cell phone I use for Liqpay . I used LP for 1 year and had no problems. I did send small amounts like 0,04$ and maximum allowed by the system (2500$) several times. Also I had one trade with bitcoinex -  bought bitcoins with LIQPAY from him. So now it looks quite strange to hear from him that liqpay is not reliable. 50 btc sent. Thank you for support of Liqpay.com as you know I did try to advertise the service here on forum but almost all forumers were suspicious about its chargebackability and did not trust to service originated from ExUSSR country (Ukraine). I use this service for 1 year now and had no problems with it yet. So if somebody want to give it a try, feel free to contact me to sell/buy bitcoins with Liqpay. I keep my prices very close to the highest bids and lowest asks of MtGox's. I'm in with 50 btc   I'm interested as an investor. Please PM or e-mail me your proposal in detail when you find more partners. Currently it would be enough to have couple of persons with personal bank account in each country to make it easier for people from the same country to buy/sell bitcoins with netbank. BTW I can propose for this purpose my acc in Denmark.  You can PM me if you still want to buy/sell bitcoins with Liqpay  Sorry, I didn't try to insult you, there were another users criticizing Liqpay so don't take it personal please.I'm not trying to play in YOUR leage with your                              Bid        Ask        LastNanaimo Gold  :     0.2451     0.2759     0.25004323.51 BTC in inventory worth USD $1223.55I can propose MY OWN leage with 40000 BTC in inventoryand 0.27 Bid and 0.29 Ask yes, you can send your money by snailmail but you can't buy/sell with this method more then 100$   I already proposed relatively easy access to bitcoins with direct Visa or Mastercard purchase using Liqpay or Moneybookers which is better then PayPal in terms of non-reversibility. But unfortunately people criticised both payment systems without suggesting better alternative  
MtGox had used Liqpay for a week or so, but because lack of interest from most users he drop them and swiched to LR. BTW bad reputation for liqpay is originated from false speculations of some forumers. Liqpay is not chargebackable. Go to the site and check it for yourself!to Nanaimogold: you just trying to get rid of competitors and use dirty methods for this. Don't post fake information if you don't know this for sure! If somebody want to make sure the Liqpay transaction is final just try to send as small as 1$ to your friend and then try to rise a dispute to get the money back  to witchspace: You can buy bitcoins directly from me using Liqpay.com to transfer your money from Visa or Mastercard to my acc. It will take you 5-15 min to do it. All you need is CC and mobile phone to receive SMS with one-time password. If interested send me PM for detailed instructions.  I buy LR from one trusted person using Liqpay to send him my money directly from my CC. It takes me 5-15 minutes to gain amounts up to 2500 USD on my LR acc (minus 2% interst he currently take). If you are interested I can directly buy/sell BTC from you for LiqPay transaction. All you need is CC and mobile phone to receive SMS with one-time password from Liqpay. If you do not trust me, you can ask Jed (mtGox admin) about my reputation. thanks, it works. Donated 5 btc cool! donated to EFF 0.9+50 I think 0.5 is not real: somebody is trading with himself. Try to make an 0.4 ask offer and you will see nobody will buy it Edit1: Just put 20btc for 0.47$ and it was bought!!! It's really crazy!But I still doubt about bigger amounts 1150 Where can I read more about your BitCombinator, can I participate as an investor? thanks, 7btc donation sent 1000 BTC 5200 5100 BTC Maximum amount $1000.  Send me a PM.[/quote]Just got the Max from JGarzik! Cool, PP charged only 5$  Excellent! I want to be your client. But I'm not sure I have enough reputation.If you traded on bitcoinmarket you can know my LR acc. Also you can ask infoabout my trade history from MtGox. BTW what is the maximum amount for withdrawal. I agree to Drifter, it is not normal, but this is TEMPORARY MEASURE for those who can't wait and do not want to convert all accumulated Gox$$ back to bitcoins then withdraw BTC and sell them on another markets to receive theirs real $$. Calculate for yourself and you will end up in even more unfair rate.  We need volunteers who will buy MtGox USD for any non-chargebackable e-cash. They have to provide their email and/or username in MtGox and bitcoin forum nik.Also it would be good to see exchange rate for any pairs in direction Gox$ -> Liqpay, LR, WM, etc...I can start from myself:MtGox user: jorgene-mail: jorgen@safe-mail.netRate: 1Gox$ -> 0.8 Liqpay, 0.75 LR  Added: if you for some reason do not want to use liqpay to add money to your balance I can do this for youmy rate for this: 1 Liqpay$ = 1 Liberty Reserve$  My LR is U1727661 (btccollector)My Liqpay is +4542488881BTC addr: 13fZzb9M5MKEtBQTsH5EdwuzXXrBM8VYsVfeel free to PM or email to me and we negotiate terms and amounts. just a proposal: why not using https://vekja.net servers as one or more nodes. They accept bitcoins as a payment and bitcoin community can put their btc together and buy space and bandwidth for the Grid. I can donate 100 btc.  Joined   Liqpay SMS system was working perfectly for me for long time until recently. But yesterday I also had some delay with SMS delivery. So I go to chat with online support and they asked me to fill out the form with the name of my cell provider. For me this did helped. I hope it was temporary technical problem and they can solve it for you in the future. And BTW you can exchange Liqpay to LR manually dealing with trusted private exchangers for only 1-2%.
