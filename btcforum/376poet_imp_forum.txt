Awesome! Thank you! Ok, I can see how that would work. Can I use a port different than 8333? With my router I have opened that port to a single machine.  I was just on my way back to report that I found the answer to this athttp://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=headless_clientThanks for the quick response though! I have more than one computer here at the house that could be selling cycles for BCs. Is it possible to setup more than one computer to run coin generating daemon and place the coinage into the same wallet? I am running bitcoind under linux. I see it chewing up a lit of CPU time but the system is still responsive so I am assuming it is just keeping the box busy. However, I would like to check in on it occasionally to see how it is doing. When I run the bitcoin app it tells me that port 8333 is in use. Is there any way to check on what the daemon is up to?
