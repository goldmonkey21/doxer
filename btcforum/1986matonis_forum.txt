Hopefully, there will be one in every country. The most decentralized approach to forming a powerful educational and advocacy group is to allow associations to grow from the bottom-up where they are able to structure their own boards and by-laws. Networking together is then a force multiplier.The Bitcoin Foundation seeks autonomous affiliates in every country so that we can rely on the local/regional partners for their local expertise and connections. Also, we can provide infrastructure support to their organization that dramatically lowers their startup time and costs, thereby making the overall mission more effective. I believe the thread was originally posted in the open on the membership forums. While I genuinely appreciate community feedback, I dislike the misleading title of this thread. It's one individual's opinion and it may not even be actionable.Committee chairs, just as board directors, are free to have their own opinions on issues. It doesn't automatically imply that it is the policy of the entire Foundation or even that the Foundation has in a mandate in that particular area. Just as forum members here disagree and debate, the members of the Foundation have similar disagreements and debates on a consistent basis. In the end, we represent the makeup of our membership and you can see from the latest election results that it is a wide variety of opinion.  The committee chairs, just as board directors, are free to have their own opinions on issues. It doesn't automatically imply that it is the policy of the Foundation. Just as forum members here disagree and debate, the members of the Foundation have similar disagreements and debates. Also, it is not detrimental for the Bitcoin Foundation to have an office in the US and it does not have to be the only office worldwide. Remember, the Tor Project is a US-based nonprofit as well, because jurisdiction for a nonprofit is not very material.  Thanks to LetsTalkBitcoin for hosting the debate on very short notice and thanks to Andreas for moderating.I appreciate all of the candidates making time over Saturday to participate. Thanks to LetsTalkBitcoin for hosting the debate on very short notice and I am pleased to have had the Bitcoin Foundation sponsor it.Thanks also to the five candidates that made the time over Saturday to participate. Congratulations to Jesse and team! I participated in the beta and I have been following Kraken's progress over the months with great interest. It would be great if Kraken used the XBT designation for bitcoin. Bitcoin Foundation participants should be applauded for their work in providing free educational sessions for Washington DC bureaucrats. We had highly-capable people in attendance and there is not a lot of glory in that work. It is hardly regulatory favoritism to do the following:i. Explain the transparency of the block chain;ii. Emphasize how user-defined privacy and irreversibility is a default within bitcoin;iii. Demonstrate the resiliency of the decentralized and global Bitcoin network;iv. Explain how market-based legitimacy is currently winning over legislation-based legitimacy, which is why trading volume is not centered in the US.For my part, I elected to focus on the developments and good work being done in Germany and other countries while continuing to expand the inclusiveness of the Bitcoin Foundation to other parts of the world. Bitcoin is not US-centric and, with a global footprint, neither is the Bitcoin Foundation.

Consider it done. I fully support bitcoin fungibility across the board without exception. The miners and mining pools are the actual "Federal Reserve" because that's the heart of de-centralized banking. You assign more power to the Foundation than is warranted.When the State enforcement and regulatory pressure comes, it will be swift, decisive and unforgiving. The Foundation will be there defending the individuals and businesses targeted and exploiting the last vestiges of any remaining 'gray areas' to keep people out of jail in a pro bono capacity. Account has been back for over a week. Also, proud to be utilizing two-factor auth for tweets (new Twitter service).I'm interested in how people view current bitcoin dev priorities around privacy.For instance, see:"Mixing without a trusted intermediary is already supported by bitcoin" (via J. Garzik) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=139581.0 (this seems like it would prevent simple analysis, but not smart analysis)Zerocoin has too much overhead (could be optimized); "lower hanging privacy fruit, at the moment, would be getting rid of address re-use and de/refragmenting coins" (via M. Hearn)﻿ https://plus.google.com/u/0/100109831949151899859/posts/Kq6JAxBXS8d I liked the discussion with Pete because he is a trader as well.However, the lending/borrowing function does not really need to change that much. Lenders will price based on perceived risk and level of collateral. Both parties will hedge exchange rate risk via derivatives markets. Happens all around the multi-currency world today.Also, arbitration and a free market for law has been prototyped at http://www.judge.me/about By Paul Rosenberg"Bitcoin has now put governments and banks in the position of judging themselves. They will write their own verdicts."http://lewrockwell.com/rosenberg/rosenberg-p17.1.html LMAO. On-line gaming tokens. Full retard police state.Which government agency has responsibility for regulating options and calendar spreads on air guitars?Is it the cool long-haired regulator? Gavin's answer to #2 is why bitcoin doesn't conveniently fit into Mises' Regression Theorem, which doesn't account for digital mediums, let alone vulnerable ones. I wish more Austrians realized that too.
Thanks for including me on the .info page (but I'm not sure why Roger's tweets show up on my page).Hopefully, your page will start to get picked up in Google searches.Also, you should consider adding the experienced Bradley Jansen:http://www.freebanking.org/author/jansen/http://www.freebanking.org/2013/04/23/lets-talk-bitcoin-interview-on-fincen-regulations/ Technically, it's true that brainwallet assets are immune to confiscation,but if you're sitting in jail for contempt, where's the victory? You are correct about that and I will make the edit.It is most unfortunate that being Canadian cannot be a benefit in this case. He may not be the one, but I have been following Valve and I agree with Kiko. Don't dismiss.Virtual World Needs Laissez-faire Economists: http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/07/06/virtual-world-needs-laissez-faire-economists/ Perpetuating an incorrect observation that the Foundation selected the bitcoin.org Press List, a commenter named Milly Bitcoin left this comment on the Forbes site:"Obviously the Bitcoin Foundation is political as they are now debating who should be listed as media contacts on the Bitcoin.org web site. If the Foundation wanted to stay nonpolitical they would not be posting media contacts and arguing over who should be listed. If they wanted to be transparent they would allow the public to read their discussion board instead of making it members only."I commented after Milly explaining the situation. Author is also affiliated with BitMint:  http://www.bitmint.com/He fails to disclose that fact. As of last month, Tradehill is here with both open order book and dark pool trading: http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2013/03/28/tradehill-exchange-adds-dark-pools-of-bitcoin-liquidity/ +1 MariaI totally love it when regular people comprehend the bitcoin. Bitcoin is like the opera. You are going but you don't really understand it or you are hooked for life. From BLOGDIAL's "FinCEN sounds death knell for US based Bitcoin businesses" (it's worth a read):http://irdial.com/blogdial/?p=3488"Finally, this is a great opportunity for a country to cause Bitcoin startups to congregate in their territory. A 150 year moratorium on any law that touches anything to do with Bitcoin / Blockchain technology would create a new Hong Kong island of super prosperity, as it becomes the worlds hub for all Bitcoin business, and the trillions of dollars in Bitcoin flowing through it, leaving the pitiful democracies in the dust." Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet in the law. The law will be adjusted if the nuance of bitcoin doesn't fit the "redeem" and "administrator" paradigm. The goal is to bring exchangers directly under the MSB and MT regulations. No more casual preemptive compliance like Bitinstant because it will be required and they did it without declaring bitcoin real currency.Also, a decentralized convertible virtual currency has no single administrator as stated in the FinCEN guidance. Glad to see Tradehill back in the bitcoin exchange business. I am sympathetic to this position. The opposing position comes from a belief that zero to no fees is the primary benefit of bitcoin.The free market decides the BTC market price and the free market will decide transaction fees (based on desired transaction times). A state of no (or gradually increasing) block size limits avoids the market mechanism for pricing transaction times. It would be similar to letting the market decide the 21 million limit. They have been acquiring BTC over the last 6-9 months or even earlier, but they wouldn't say their entry price. I'm fairly certain that their average is sub-$15. This is just the first time they've talked about it for a formal announcement. The $3.2 million is an estimate based on current BTC assets of 80,000 at $40:1 BTC exchange rate. +1  The Bitcoin Machines would generate a lot of traffic and I would definitely go to stores that had them (and use them). They're going to need to be bolted down a little better cuz they'll be stuffed full o' cash from all of the people wanting bitcoins privately. I disagree. How is this any different than installing a regular vending machine that sells peanuts and condoms? Why do you automatically assume the worst and shout "Oh my God, it's a currency exchange machine and it's unlicensed!"People, it is a simple vending machine that sells intangible math puzzles. They could also build a machine that sells air guitars. It would be the same regulations. Low-fee bitcoin heroes should take note that the privacy and anonymity theme is pervasive in this article. It is significant in that it is one of the few written pieces that anticipates the forced closure of digital-issuing mints by the authorities. What is explored is the establishment of a trusted central mint (ala digicash protocol) that operates anonymously and therefore can remain operational in the face of direct governmental threats and assaults. How does one audit the reserves of currency issuers if they don't know where they are or who they are? {similarly, voucher-safe has answered this question in a decentralized way by distributing the reserves instead of distributing the trust.} At the time, the authors were responding to the vulnerability of physical gold e-currency depositories such as e-gold. That's why they defined the roles of Bondsman, Escrow Agent, Fair Witness, and Arbiter. http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2010/03/toward-private-digital-economy.htmlThe video/audio presentation from DEF CON 12 can be seen here: https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-12-archive.html#wavyhill Excellent points. Privacy is not by default. Many first time bitcoin users go to the honeypot Coinbase (and other eWallet sites) mistakenly thinking that it offers the same features as a standalone bitcoin client."oh look, ma!  It's super convenient. They even let me do a direct link to my US bank account, just like PayPal." That's true and there are trade-offs. However, since Coinbase is mostly frequented by newbies, it would be wise to understand their identity process and their wallet logs and their bitcoin address logs, especially if a brand new user is going directly from Coinbase to purchase a VPN for torrent downloading/uploading or to play online poker from the US jurisdiction. Don't you think? Thanks to the OP.http://www.paymentssource.com/news/swapping-bitcoin-privacy-for-banking-convenience-3013278-1.html Nice article, Tony. Thanks for posting.
This could be good news for all my French friends over at Bitcoin Central.....http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2013/02/14/france-plans-to-prohibit-cash-payments-over-e1000/ Rainey Reitman leads the activism team at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and she'll be talking about financial censorship (May 17-19th). She is particularly interested in the intersection between personal privacy and technology, particularly social networking privacy, locational privacy, and online data brokers. https://www.eff.org/about/staff/rainey-reitmanhttp://www.bitcoin2013.com/index.htmlhttps://twitter.com/RaineyReitman/status/301034326856957952Also, just so this thread doesn't degrade into a "EFF should accept bitcoin" thread, the stated EFF position is that if they spend time and resources defending themselves, then it becomes difficult for them to do their jobs defending others. Although Bitcoin is not illegal, their goal for better or worse is not to make themselves the subject of a controversy. The discussion about article on HN was a much better read:http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5162958 Excellent article in a gambling pub, Erik. Thanks for "finding" it.When I pumped Bitcoin at the 2011 annual KPMG online-casino-fest in Gibraltar, I started to learn the reasons why they feel the way they do about Bitcoin, the ideal digital casino chip.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5266Gibraltar is home to 22 of the top 28 online gaming companies in the world. The jurisdiction welcomed them with open arms unlike the US. I meet with these guys and also hang out with them. The bottom line is that online mega-casinos do not seem to perceive the payment method as a "competitive advantage" so they happily receive the other fee-based payment alternatives.  They tend to focus more on the competition for eyeballs and affiliates feeding them traffic so in many ways it resembles the economics of online porn. Also, more than one CEO said to me privately that their business has regulators up the ass on a daily basis about money laundering. So, in that context, Bitcoin is the last thing they wanted to entertain.FYI, for your enjoyment, Ruth started the "SatoshiDice" of her day:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Parasolhttp://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/54/biz_06rich400_Ruth-Parasol_TX20.html Stephen,Sadly, governments do not care about efficiency in payments. If they did, they would not be attaching massive amounts of paperwork and compliance via AML which adds complexity and even more cost. Governments care about traceability and identification within the system. That is their dominant care.Other competitor governments that do not likewise "hobble" their economy via FATF/OECD compliance will undoubtedly find themselves in the same position as the "grey" list or "black" list countries of today. The situation today proves that efficiency/speed of international money transfers is not a competitive advantage weapon for nation-States, because they all come into line with the exception of Iran and North Korea. The current empirical evidence shows that even somewhat accommodating nations like Cyprus, Mauritius, Liechtenstein, Gibraltar, etc have actually come more into the fold via tax treaties and coordinated AML/KYC banking guidelines. Great photo, flix. Thanks for posting.Next time, please let me know and i'll try to get there and join you guys. Brainwallet could put these guys out of business. I hope they understand that. Great news, Charlie.Congratulations! SourceForge is responsible for coordinating the blocking. Here's the link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117457.0 Mike, do you know the current status of this type of effort? I translated that post also; however it is from an advisory letter to a particular recipient. We would need to see the full statement or change in bitcoin status announced publicly. While exemption from VAT may be good, any new "legitimacy" or definitions as "real money" would serve to decrease bitcoin's freedom not enhance it. This is an important blog post by Warren Mosler (if you can ignore his flawed economic background). Thanks for posting julz.It's common knowledge that bitcoin is both a payments system and a unit of account. However, the part about 'officially sanctioned' players and the desire of some to legitimately recognize bitcoin as 'real money' contradicts the fact that it is still-in-beta cryptographic play money and not officially recognized as money in any jurisdiction in the world. This will have implications for those that wish to use bitcoin online with businesses, such as businesses that want to offer online poker to U.S. players. e-Gold's Doug Jackson complied w/all licensing and money business regulations until they suddenly changed the rules on him; now he sports an ankle bracelet. Bullion and Bandits article here: http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/06/e-gold/ David, I'm not sure why you have to feel defensive and singled out. This is not personal and it is not only about Paymium/Bitcoin-Central. It is a bitcoin industry question. The level of offensiveness comes from the legal guidelines that companies like yours have to follow; of course I know that you didn't make up the various rules of the financial framework.And, not all markets in all jurisdictions would make you identify yourself for open market trades of seemingly innocuous items. You chose France for obvious reasons, so you must operate within the rules and regulations of France. Bitcoin is neither defined nor stipulated as a "currency" in any country in the world right now, so I reject money transfer/MSB regulatory paradigms that attempt to treat it as such. I also wish that a few attorneys would step up to articulate that defense. Gabi,Is that the best you could come up with? Be glad that you didn't submit that comment to Forbes. Do you have anything else to add because you're not giving me much to reply to?The main reason that I can see for preferring bitcoin at the moment is the option to not associate my identity with my money. Others may see something else like low fees and for sending money overseas. But for me personally, I have other payment methods available to accomplish that so the main differentiator becomes the things I can accomplish with Bitcoin that I cannot accomplish in other ways. I suspect that some others may feel the same way.Also look at some the largest BTC balances on the block chain besides Gox and identified exchange points. You will notice that they did not come from any of the so-called bridges; I'm not saying who they are, but that's point isn't it.  Trace, since you just pasted your Forbes comment here, I'll re-post my reply to it here as well. I think that if you re-read the article and comments, some alternative solutions are offered. It is not going to be an easy or fun road for exchanges in 1st world KYC/AML countries that embrace OECD/FATF guidelines (that is just a fact). I have seen too many unpleasant things happen to not know what lies before them. They may try if they wish, but experience will show that it is not necessarily the road to success.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Trace,Thanks for your comment. Indeed, the censorship resistance feature provides the resiliency. FellowTraveler is a stalwart and he does great work on Open Transactions. I think you may have missed the main point of my article, because no one is suggesting isolationism and no one is suggesting that companies and individuals dont have the right to seek regulation and to integrate with the legacy financial situation if that is their path. I am saying that playing that game is a misguided road to achieve bitcoins promise of a parallel nonpolitical value exchange system. That is the bigger folly.Jurisdictions and other exchange structures should be considered for more of the end points. I dont know about you but I find it offensive that a company would require identification papers for trading a math puzzle just as I would find it offensive if a company required identity papers to purchase toothpaste or rubber bands. Globally, liquidity will not be diminished by refusing to participate in the rules of commercial banking endpoints; it is the ease of use on the software side that is currently holding back mass adoption despite the fact that many exchange avenues exist.Also, as you know from your work in the asset management business, the storing of value is only useful if it is beyond confiscation so depending on the particular situation gold bugs may begin to supplement by storing value on the block chain. I posted this today at the Bitcoin Foundation website:Continued...https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=41 Excellent, Erik!Now the New Hampshire license plate slaves know what BITCOIN is!Bill Morrissey wrote a song titled "Live Free or Die" about the irony of a prisoner serving time in the State of New Hampshire's jails and hand-stamping license plates with the motto Live Free or Die. (Wikipedia) Thanks julz!You have a great media scraper. Very true, grondilu. Companies are starting to ask these questions now. When viable hedging solutions become available, savvy merchants will most likely opt for choice 4 and retain bitcoin balances.
+1 excellent point on not pushing those BTC right back into the banking system...that's the real inflection point and when you'll know that the train has left the station...I do applaud WordPress for a stellar business move (Congrats to Tony G. too). Good point. This is huge news, but you'll know the inflection point is reached when merchants like WordPress decide to hold their BTC instead of pushing it right back into the banking system. Of course Dmytri is not on this forum, but he is defending himself in an educational tweet-a-thon;https://twitter.com/dmytri and here https://twitter.com/jonmatonis/status/267255183443120128 I really miss this thread so I wrote this blog post on "tangible prepaid access devices" and brainwallets:Department Of Homeland Security To Scan Payment Cards At Borders And Airportshttp://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/11/07/department-of-homeland-security-to-scan-payment-cards-at-borders-and-airports/Brainwallets appear to be safe for now:http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FINCEN-2011-0003-0016 Agreed. Coinbase is a bad idea on many levels (bank integration, wallet security, governing jurisdiction). I don't want to buy bitcoin from my bank or my bank's partner. Additionally, I am concerned about the coins that are stored at the Coinbase Wallet. It seems to me that Coinbase thinks of BTC as something like Linden Dollars or Facebook Credits (just another non-convertible virtual currency) and that they are missing the larger picture of Bitcoin (because they just wanted to raise some startup capital without realizing that they are playing with fire).If they think I am wrong about all of this, I would love to hear back from one of the Coinbase VC investors. With Jim's permission, I have made the full audio of this Financial Sense Newshour available here:http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2012/11/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-is-digital-gold.html Things are getting interesting in Argentina...Bitcoin, Dollars, and a 25% Premiumhttp://thebluemarket.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/bitcoin-dollars-and-pot-banging-protests-in-argentina/ Yes, and I cited Del Mar extensively in my article "The Political Appropriation of the Monetary Unit" (p. 46)This is a great thread, BTW. Before it was called money laundering, it was simply called banking. What happened to LegalEagle? Perhaps, he is off reading Brainwallet: The Ultimate in Mobile Money Perfectly stated. A private key, especially in the form of a brainwallet, is an "illusory" and unenforceable construct. If not a legal air guitar, then it is most likely a negotiable verbal IOU with about the same level of enforceability. Are you both suggesting that the core bitcoin development group (who are listed at bitcoin.org) remove the checkbox that blocks SourceForge downloads to sanctioned countries? My understanding was that SourceForge is claiming that the specific OFAC sanctions against Iran would take precedence over the munitions export controls which were indeed relaxed for non-sanctioned countries. It just hasn't been challenged yet. Great (and clear) summary of paid developers and unpaid volunteers in open source environment. I concur. It works best when there is a methodology and requirement for transparency of compensation. Adam Kokesh had some great coverage here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyQaZKi42zw Unless you are attempting to recover stolen bitcoin property, you will most likely be trying to prove that your bitcoin 'property' does not exist and has not ever existed. I like the concept a lot.What has your experience with them been like in terms of liquidity and customer service? I'm not sure if it has been mentioned yet, but I don't see the Foundation representing members or other individuals in their personal legal matters around the world. Bitcoin Foundation is not a legal defense and advocacy organization like the EFF and ACLU.I will, however, promote for the publication of key white papers on the topic that address the impotency of bitcoin-directed legislation and the immorality of not respecting financial privacy (in multiple languages, fyi). Yes, Lydia is indeed interesting. While it may be the first state-issued coin in history, it began in Lydia as private coinage issued by and used within the merchant communities. The State (or King) then appropriated it for obvious reasons. There is the Financial Cryptography and Data Security (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) published every year with cryptocurrency and digital cash academic articles:http://www.springer.com/generic/search/results?SGWID=0-40109-23-0-0&searchType=EASY_CDA&queryText=Financial+Cryptography+and+Data+Security&sortOrder=relevance&searchScope=booksIt is published after the proceedings from this conference: http://ifca.ai/ Thanks for your rational feedback, n8rwJeTt8TrrLKPa55eU (I can't really pronounce your name though).Over time, the case that the Foundation has to make is that an independent, transparent body is preferable to the reasoned whims of volunteer coders when it comes to protecting the integrity of open source protocols.
Thank you for your confidence (and to the others as well). As one of the representatives of the Individual Membership Class, I take my board responsibilities very seriously. When Zimmermann resigned from Network Associates because they were trying to backdoor PGP, I took him in at Hushmail as Chief Cryptographer which is when OpenPGP was launched (2000-2002).Regarding your 3rd concern above, how do you respond to the points that I make in this reply to theymos https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=113400.msg1227798#msg1227798 ?I recognize the potential financial dependency issue, but how does your proposal mitigate clandestine, non-transparent compensation from malicious actors and how does it address succession planning for lead developers? +1 good clarification. Thanks for post here, Jeff. Nice job, Peter. I've answered this on reddit and similar sentiments in the comment section of my recent article, but I also want to post here. [No comment from me on copyrights and patents, because I don't believe in them and I don't support their infrastructure.]theymos, thank you. I considered those issues as well prior to accepting the offer to join the board (and the specific direction is still being debated in multiple venues such as this forum). The success and organization of the Tor Project had a lot to do with my decision.As a libertarian and non-Statist on the Foundation board, I think that other libertarians and non-Statists would mostly agree that a transparent organization is preferable to a 'single anointed individual' that can select the next 'single anointed individual' in a non-transparent fashion (the community never voiced their opinion on Gavin taking over lead role for Satoshi  it just happened). Although it has worked out well, no one can guarantee the longevity of Gavin in that role.Open source software is actually more vulnerable to discreet State pressures and random bribery when only one, or a few, steer core protocol development without any community input on succession planning. A centralized individual is more corruptible than a group and the foundation is actually a step towards de-centralization in that regard.Additionally, I would think that bitcoin users in general would welcome a check-and-balance on the core development group that may or may not have been involved in receiving clandestine compensation on the side. Of course, nothing prevents that from occurring now or in the future but I believe that an accountable, nonprofit foundation would decrease its likelihood. +1 sunnankar  (thanks!) Here's a recent article from Ian on the subject:Is BitCoin a triple entry system?https://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001325.html I love that line in the article. Yes, "Laws that regulate made-up money" could also be used to eventually regulate air guitars.The author gets it correct at the end when he states that using money as identity tracking mechanism is no longer that useful. These are brutal, important lessons in why a cashless society should not strip everyone of their transactional and financial privacy. For those people in Argentina that want to bypass currency controls and also shelter their money from government-induced inflation, this Buenos Aires exchange community claims to buy and sell bitcoin for Argentine pesos. http://wiki.eudemocracia.org/en/bitcoinAnd, the mercaBit.eu exchange sells bitcoin for Ukash vouchers which are available in Argentina.From:http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/09/04/argentina-begins-tracking-all-credit-cards/Also see: Ukash now available throughout whole of Argentina!http://www.ukash.com/media/44801581/argentina_press_release.pdf I recently came across this paper (and I'd be glad to hear your comments on their conclusion):Can We Afford Integrity by Proof-of-Work? Scenarios Inspired by the Bitcoin Currencyhttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2041492I also disagree with Ben Laurie but that is because I don't believe efficiency needs to be the goal of a decentralized, non-political currency. Methodical, authoritative, and coercively-selective breeding will also lead to better and stronger humans, but that's not the world we want. How do you know that about Finland being the biggest bitcoin country per capita? Are you measuring nodes? Not sure what you mean here. Are you implying that bitcoin does not have uniquely-different potential for changing the landscape that banks can prepare for and take advantage of...or, are you suggesting that editor may have other, external motives for discussing bitcoin? Joe, it would be considered a success for BTC if Mastercard and VISA adopted it as a currency unit among their portfolio of 158+ other national currencies (although that is not what the BitInstant card does). Yes, bitcoin is a long-term threat at the P2P payment level and so is paper cash; however, in bitcoin's role as independent nonpolitical monetary unit, BTC is just another 3-letter currency symbol out there in the world.See my related comments here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=102494.msg1125924#msg1125924 +1 That was my initial thought too, because something that was relatively innocuous is now on CNN, etc. However, in reality, the affiliate card programs generate transaction/fee volume for MC; they don't care if it's a Planned Parenthood card or an ACLU card or an NRA card. I doubt that this has put bitcoin on any 'special radar' (it's no different than selling bitcoin on your own and putting the value on your Wal*Mart debit card.)I believe that the BitInstant card will receive approval. The thought that Mastercard is intimidated by bitcoin is funny, because they could co-opt BTC momentum at any time by just adding it to the list of 158 other currencies that they authorize and clear in. Bitcoin is another currency to Mastercard and the chargeback and consumer protections provided by that network are value-adds for certain transactions. Unfortunately, after Slashdot, it spread to the Verge http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3260059/mastercard-denies-bitcoin-debit-card-rumors This still needs to be sorted out because Mastercard wouldn't necessarily have knowledge of partner bank's affiliate negotiations. If it's accommodating $22 million in annual sales revenue on Silk Road, I think it can handle little ol' Wikileaks. elux, I answered you on PM.

I was invited to present bitcoin and its potential application to the gaming industry at the following conference, but I am unable to attend.They have asked if there is anyone in the region that would be willing to present:http://www.beaconevents.com/2012/AsianGamingCongress2012/en/Home/index.jspPlace: MacauDate:  Nov 27-28th, 2012If interested, please contact Rosalind Wade at rwade@beaconevents.com Personally, I do not see Mt Gox as evil and I applaud the work that they are doing in the front lines of where BTC meets national currencies. Furthermore, their non-US legal jurisdiction should serve them well in the future. This is the essence of the issue, really, for any BTC exchanger or vendor. As bitcoin moves into the area of Tor and 'lex mercatoria' with less dependence on State-invented regulations like AML/KYC or the BSA of 1970, trust without jurisdiction moves to the forefront.We are reminded that money laundering is an artificial crime totally made up and non-existent about 20-30 years ago. Before it was invented as a term, it was merely called "banking".http://www.caseyresearch.com/cdd/doug-casey-cashless-societies I suspect that Apple is preparing for a proprietary NFC payment app and I doubt that the iPhone/PayPal functionality would be extended to include that.With bitcoin QR code scanning at the point of sale, BTC poses a threat to any planned ApplePayments roll-out, not to mention the fact that BTC is a neutral, nonpolitical currency unit. Well, partially serious. It's all relative, I suppose. Imagine a scenario where only a few gateway computers with Internet connectivity do exist inside of the Nation-State but not necessarily available to the masses. A wireless mesh (or ad hoc) network is not new technology and it operates on an unregulated part of the bandwidth spectrum. In this scenario, reliance is not placed on the mobile telecom provider which has been a target previously in the countries that have wanted to quell social networking. Eliminating, or reducing, points of failure should be the goal. Have you heard anything back from Apple on your second appeal attempt? Bitcoin apps for existing smartphones can still be used. But this claims to offer bitcoin connectivity without a mobile carrier and without local electricity, both of which could be considered single points of failure under a repressive regime. +1 Exactly. +1 ?   following. This breach (and potential failure of Bitcoinica) had absolutely nothing to do with leverage or margin trading. It was a policy and network security issue and it could have happened to an un-careful Faucet. Unless you don't believe that it was a security breach from the outside.Bitcoinica's broad customer base is testament to the fact that there is a huge pent-up demand for that type of service. Of course, I support Bitcoinica and the concept of leveraged speculating/hedging. We need more of them (regulated and unregulated so you can pick your flavour). You may not see it but large entities are planning on entering the bitcoin economy in a major way; margin exchanges allow them to hedge their currency exposure without having to sell out of their BTC positions.A regulated entity does not always inspire trust. Just look at the poor MF Global customers. LOL. Random guy on Forbes now following this unfortunate event. Yes, if you are short and if Bitcoinica is applying conventional trading terminology, then a limit buy order would be filled at 4.50 or better. A buy stop order would be placed above the current market price to protect your short position against an adverse move. Yes.........but do they know what they don't know?FYI, here's an actual FBI leaked document on 'Legal Aspects of Online Gaming Financial Transactions' (20 June 2011) that also cites the 'Cyber Criminals Exploitation of Real-Money Trading' (8 June 2011) mentioned in page 3 of OP's Scribd document.http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/attach/10/10400_FBI%20Cleveland%20.pdf Hi Patrick,Congratulations on the new role at BitInstant! I followed your work at EngageLegal. Does this mean that you are exclusive now or can you still take on other bitcoin-related clients? Although it is doomed to be hacked within 24 hours of release, it is still useful in the sense that its failure emphasizes the positive aspects of open source (non-black box) approaches. If an article accurately points out pros and cons of Bitcoin vs. MintChip, then I think it's relevant; otherwise, it's FUD. I was told that the SMS-payment service encountered regulatory issues which is why they put it on hold for the moment. Sounds great. Wish I could be there. Maybe you can help out some of these 'confused' Reddit kiwis.http://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/slvgt/new_zealand_first_country_to_offer_bitcoin_margin/ Remember, someone is happily coming up a winner and getting the money, because it's a zero-sum game like the futures market. If Zhou is taking the other side of the trades, then he better win more than he loses. I don't fault the operator unless he fails to deliver.I agree that most people might be happier if they just had a big party with their trading funds. You know the way to make a million dollars in margin trading? --- first you make $2 million then lose half.
+1  I guess the article should be entitled "Asking Permission From the Bitcoin PR Wiki"Thanks for posting, 'World' Zhou, congratulations on the news regarding New Zealand!I announced it on the Forbes site: http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/04/21/bitcoinica-registers-in-new-zealand-for-bitcoin-margin-trading/ Great piece, Erik. Thanks for posting it on your blog. I forwarded it to some of my Austrian econ friends too.BTW, what is the source (and date) of your bitcoin instances chart? http://files.campus.edublogs.org/blogs.umb.edu/dist/2/123/files/2012/01/countries-v5q30e.png  because on a number of hosts basis RowIT shows it as US-1, Germany-2, Russia-3 http://bitcoinstatus.rowit.co.uk/  (scroll to bottom of page) Original Credit Transactions with VISA are explained here:https://developer.visa.com/vpp/docs/methods/OCTand also see: Requirements for Original Credit Transactions processed as Fast Funds (starts on pg 28):http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-summary.pdf Am I looking at the same App Store (in the US)? Bitcointrading found at least 16 bitcoin apps in the App Store but yes only one with current 'send' functionality. Obviously, they "facilitate the trading of virtual currency" at some level. Korea must be a really unique situation.http://www.bitcointrading.com/forum/index.php?topic=312.0 Congrats on Paytunia being released!  If davout is involved, I already trust it. Africa has more mobile phones than homes with electricity. Towns and villages provide public phone charging stations! What about this app at the Store (how did they get approved?):BitPak is the first bitcoin wallet for the iPhone.http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitpak/id489248095?mt=8&ls=1 Thanks for providing these excellent links, Simon. Dwolla has always had a peculiar business model with loss-leader pricing that doesn't scale. Sensing a future acquisition, they are going for market share and mind share more than profits. I predict that they save legal fees and settle it for $300k. +1 Neil, at the 1:04 mark in your video, you talk about examining the evolution and history of State-dominated money and I thought you might find the following of interest.Previously, I set out to answer the question: "How did the State specifically go about appropriating the monetary unit for their own use?" which resulted in my thesis at George Washington University: The Political Appropriation of the Monetary Unit at http://www.slideshare.net/jonmatonis/the-political-appropriation-of-the-monetary-unit This is a good point. "Private money" or "private currency" is usually used to refer to nonpolitical (or non nation-State) issuers, such as Liberty Dollar, e-gold, FB Credits, or Linden Dollars. Bitcoin is private in the sense that it is non-governmental; however, bitcoin is very public in the sense that all transactions are published and that the nodes are collectively managed. It is the ultimate non-Statist public currency.Definitions are important. Digital currency is a very broad term that refers to issuers, national and private, that operate electronically, with digital cash being a specific subset having privacy attributes more like physical cash. More recently, the term cryptocurrency has come to mean a digital bearer instrument that utilizes cryptography exclusively for its issuance and/or verification. For further information, please see http://digitalcash.org Neil, what is your email address please? Yes just saw it on PMF http://www.piratemyfilm.com/projects/346 I just sent a link to Max Keiser also. The OP should follow up directly to promote; Max is on Twitter. +1  Don't punish the innocent for the sins of the guilty; anyone can get 'bad' $20 bills in their change or even from an ATM. +1 Nefario says that the 2012 conference highlights the following areas:- Development- Economics- Law- Finance- Social- EthicsMore so than other economic persuasions, the Austrian School has been in the forefront of debating the economic, legal, political, social, and ethical issues surrounding bitcoin since its inception. Also, as demonstrated by the links below, they don't always agree with one another but they at least have the debate. I think that was Atlas' (boss) point.http://mises.org/Community/forums/t/27611.aspxhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pvt77/robert_murphy_austrian_economist_on_bitcoin_and/ +1  Agreed. Ron Paul is so sick of hearing the B.S. answers from "Sad Princeton Ben" that he just uses his entire 5 minutes now to lecture and get something about this criminal theft recorded in history. Joseph Affonso Xaxo has reminded me on Google+ that the authors confuse Bitcoin with Tenebrix, a CPU-friendly, GPU-hostile cryptocurrency.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45667.0Also see, Would any of the current botnets be able to launch and sustain a 51% attack?  I would dispute the implicit profitability of bitcoin botnet mining which would not even get us to the faulty economic conclusions. The thread here has shown that the authors are not hashing experts and now you have shown that nor are they economists.
Following. The arguments they put forward are very similar to the Ben Laurie blatherings on bitcoin. Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn had a Google+ post reviewing these 'blacklist' and 'whitelist' architecture issues for bitcoin nodes:"What Would You Do With >50% of the World's Bitcoin Mining Power?"https://plus.google.com/u/0/108313527900507320366/posts/6NCqDrZUYiF Bitcoin & Gresham's Law - the economic inevitability of Collapseby Philipp Güring & Ian Grigg, Dec 2011http://iang.org/papers/BitcoinBreachesGreshamsLaw.pdfIan's Blog: https://financialcryptography.com/ Yep, Thiel lost it for me after they caved and rolled-over on their original vision for PayPal.http://reason.com/archives/2005/08/01/who-killed-paypal I like the mathematical art analogy. The first legal case will be interesting when defendant has to stand up and spill the bitcoin out of his head because he used BrainWallet. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet Thank you, Zhou, for your clear post and update. What many people on this thread do not realize is that CFDs operate legally in most parts of the world except for........surprise, surprise........the USA."CFDs are currently available in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Singapore, South Africa, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, France, Ireland, Japan and Spain. They are not permitted in the United States, due to restrictions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on over-the-counter (OTC) financial instruments." --from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_for_difference I looked at your site. Why do you not list the Mastercard issuing entity that is behind the Bitcoin Debit Card? Who is the Mastercard issuing bank and what is their web page?Otherwise, faxing personal ID information to Panama doesn't sound very attractive.  umm... From AVN: Paxum Ends Association with Bitcoin Exchanges by Tom Hymes (well-written)"The virtual currency's volatility and uncertainty are the stated reasons why Paxums banking partners demanded the cessation of any association with Bitcoin."PG Link: http://news.avn.com/articles/Paxum-Ends-Association-with-Bitcoin-Exchanges-464460.htmlOver-18 Link: http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Paxum-Ends-Association-with-Bitcoin-Exchanges-464460.html Charlie...... as they say "good luck with that".I have always supported Paxum, but I doubt that the pipes to BitInstant will be turned on again. Of course. I meant that you're mainly an alternative to processing through VISA/MC/PayPal, so half of your value proposition is retail consumer.On collecting data from the consumer, VISA/MC/PayPal already do this and so would Bit-Pay for transactions that exceed a certain amount. The merchants would have to be in compliance either with transaction amount thresholds or Bit-Pay would have to restrict merchant classes if consumers were not providing data. For instance, could Bit-Pay be the merchant processor for a no-limit anonymous bill payment service without taking customer identity? Could Bit-Pay process Pimpcoin for any daily transaction size without source of funds data? If not, then Bit-Pay has a sweet spot just in the sub-$1000 transaction range -- and that may get lowered. Well..... that just happens to be the exact focus of your business. I think the trouble comes in when there is a series of inbound and outbound transfers because AML also requires monitoring of 40 aggregated transactions of $1,000 each. Each jurisdiction is coming up to speed at different times and Australia will have something to say fairly soon. Pre-emptive measures work now in the OECD/FATF world because they all want to be on the safe side, but a court case is needed in any common law jurisdiction. It will be a precedent-setting case probably getting to the Supreme Court and it only requires a bank and an exchange willing to make the challenge.Bitcoin is not money -- it is an RPOW. If bitcoin is money, then any RPOW can be money. Then, there is legitimacy. Paxum offers the Paxum Prepaid Mastercard issued by Choice Bank Ltd. in Belize, so there is an affiliation with bitcoin sellers depositing proceeds to the Mastercard product.  Seems like a stretch to me.How do Dwolla and CryptoXchange's banking partners avoid the same kind of pressure that Paxum received? Part of it I don't understand, because the banks for CryptoXchange and others still take face-to-face deposits at US banks and those are known cash deposits for bitcoin. In Canada, I think it's a soft warning from regulators because of what the Paxum banking partners may think they'll be encountering in the near future. My analysis is here: http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2012/02/paxum-exits-from-bitcoin-business.html Official response from Ruth Blair at Paxum:http://gfy.com/showpost.php?p=18753403&postcount=1Follow up:http://gfy.com/showpost.php?p=18753657&postcount=22 The U.S. may regulate any entity that they see fit to regulate (look how laws were tweaked to get e-gold). I am talking about the current state of affairs, not what will happen in the future.  No one knows and that's why it is best to select a jurisdiction with some reasonableness and predictability. Thanks for that reference. I went and read the English version. Isn't everything a commodity, really?I will believe bitcoin is a currency when the State accepts it for payment of my speeding tickets. You have also stated in your last paragraph that bitcoin can most certainly be regulated:"The U.S. may also regulate other bitcoin organizations, e.g. banks and exchanges, through the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering act and other securities laws.  Even though bitcoins are not securities, trading bitcoins, or other bitcoin instruments, are still regulated by the U.S."This is just not true. Maybe for a fund like www.ultimafund.com because that enters into SEC, but a fixed-rate exchange not holding any customer funds is decidedly not subject to any U.S. regulation. Because, if so, that would be like regulating the sale of air guitars or a QR code or self-created RPOWs that contain an embedded image of my dog urinating. Currencies don't need fans; they needs users.  Bitcoin users and followers do not need to be timid or ashamed of a protocol that enables transactions with user-defined anonymity and user-defined untraceability. It is a proud and noble cause. Personally, I would like to see greater integration and cooperation with the Tor, i2p, and Freenet communities. And, I know some that are working towards this already.I'm not quite sure how any 'payment medium' can be pushed as a cause for 'good' or for 'bad', except maybe via the bitcoin miners and the protocol revisions that they select to adopt. The reason it is FUD is because she associated dual use as a major dilemma for bitcoin. It is not a dilemma for bitcoin -- it is a feature. Several others have pointed out that knives and pencils and cars have dual use too.  Here are some examples of positive transactions that bitcoin facilitates (be proud....feel free to add your own):1. the financial support of politically-unpopular or politically-incorrect causes;2. the father who discretely wants to support an illegitimate child;3. the woman exercising her right to choose to have a private abortion;4. the person paying for victimless crime transactions, like pot and prostitution (laws against those enforce morality);5. the person paying for a VPN service who doesn't want to leave a payment trail;6. persecuted minorities fleeing a dictator in an attempt to secretly transport their small remaining wealth to safety;7. Libyan living in Benghazi buying handgun to protect his family from Gaddhafi thugs;8. the Iranian, Syrian, or <insert nation-State> man that purchases a gun for the protection of his family;Irdial already has a very successful blog and he has written articles for many years at http://irdial.com/blogdial/ Regarding the video post from genjix on Catherine Flick http://bitcoinmedia.com/catherine-flick-bitcoin-and-the-dual-use-dilemma , Irdial of London asked me to post his unedited reply to the video so I post it below: cbeast, you are exactly right. They (Selgin, White, Horwitz, Wenzel, Murphy, etc.) promote a nonpolitical monetary unit of value but they lack an understanding of the cryptographic primitives that went into achieving bitcoin. Therefore, they lack an understanding of its staying power or of its potential. The leaders are the ones on the front line --- building the bitcoin exchanges, the networks, the miners, and hopefully soon the futures/options market makers.
...except the part about calling it a "uniquely American phenomenon" Thanks for finding this. I read all of George's work. +1 Thanks for your report. Jesse is a good guy. Does anyone know if they've gone live yet or is it still invite-only?? All I could find on their site was a debate about approval for BTC withdrawals, etc. The transactions for smaller amounts will migrate to one of the many fixed-rate exchanges which is already starting. Thanks for that, garethnelsonuk. How can BitInstant grow beyond the volume that it has to capitalize on its own. Do you plan on having 'credit' accounts at some of your endpoints or will transfers ultimately become less Instant? +1  I agree, it's like the old correspondent banking where a bank has multiple accounts at other banks around the world. I wonder how BitInstant does their load balancing across the system. It will be great when the max limits are raised too.One thing I don't understand is why BitInstant doesn't just do the arb trades themselves which would probably make more money than the transfer fees they make from others doing the arb. For those that don't yet know about paysafecard, they have an elegant solution to purchasing items online without revealing any of your personal details. Basically, you purchase a 16-digit code (with cash) at any of the 350,000 sales outlets around the world and then use that code on a website for purchase. It is ideally suited to purchasing small quantity bitcoin, globally.Since several of my clients are interested in the paysafecard product and since it's currently accepted on VirWoX.com for virtual currencies, I asked paysafecard about their merchant acceptance policy for other bitcoin exchanges. Here is their exact written response (which they did not want to attribute to any single individual at the company):The full January 2012 article is entitled "paysafecard Could Be Huge" and it can be found here: http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2012/01/paysafecard-could-be-huge.html Ja, immer noch aktuell. Die Codes sind übertragbar und sie haben einen Ein-Jahres-Ablauf. Muss validiert werden, um nicht doppelt ausgeben zu gewährleisten. Bitte lesen Sie,  http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2012/01/paysafecard-could-be-huge.html +1 It may not be too soon. Amazon can always roll out a trial for limited purchases like certain 'digital goods' only. They could also limit bitcoin to certain countries with restricted payment options during any such trial. Also, I cannot imagine that Amazon is just ignoring the millions of USD/EUR/GBP/etc that could be saved in VISA/MC/AMEX/PayPal merchant processing fees! Are you experiencing anything like this from Western Union:Western Union is Cracking Downhttp://www.osga.com/wordpress/offshore-insiders/person-to-person-online-gambling-payments-get-a-bit-tighter.html I like your idea of 'licensing games' to the majors. And, I believe that is where it is ultimately headed. The nasty little secret in the online gaming business is that affiliates actually set the rules because affiliates and super-affiliates drive the traffic.If you're in London and not already going to this, http://www.totallygaming.com/event/ice-2012-conferences/page/programme/monetising-social-gaming  then maybe you could loiter around the nearby pubs and make some contacts. This is how the bitcoin deals at the majors will likely happen. Unfortunately, I'm not attending but just let me know if you would like some intros. Cheers, Are you asking because of this news?http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/other-top-stories/egypt-central-bank-tightens-money-transfer-rules.html Josh,I just read your piece at http://www.casinomeister.com/forums/blogs/jstrike/286-how-start-casino-lose-money.htmlI don't think you should move to accepting more payment methods. Bitcoin is the competitive advantage WEDGE at this point. In my meetings with traditional online casino operators [mostly Gibraltar], they are reluctant to deploy bitcoin so they move slowly. When (and if) they choose to process in bitcoin, they will all tend to move together eliminating any first-mover advantage. Your time is now. See, http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2012/01/could-bitcoin-be-future-of-internet.htmlAlso, accepting politically-endorsed currency units could open up your casino to additional licensing requirements although I am not sure if it makes any difference in Costa Rica jurisdiction. For the moment, bitcoin is like gambling and trading with 'air guitars'.     ;-) Maybe it's because "repeat posts of the same advertisement are also prohibited." I like the idea of FeedZe Birds but I always did receive repeat posts in my timeline. That's probably the language that Twitter needs to clarify in their TOS. mega +1 Thank you all above for the many informative links. Bitcoin holdings on USB sticks or off-line hard drives will be treated just like paper cash in the mattress or paper cash buried in the floorboards. It will be based on the individual "honor system" of reporting to fiscal authorities. This is the one that I have been using (although it doesn't have a live date):http://blockchain.info/pools KPMG LLP gave some guidance for virtual currencies generally in this Nov 2011 study;"Virtual Currency in Virtual Economies: Implications for Income Tax"http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2012/01/virtual-currency-in-virtual-economies.html
I wouldn't hold my breath too long waiting for this. A specific decision on bitcoin would give greater legitimacy to bitcoin and the US govt does not want to do that. They would prefer to diminish its credibility. Ian, my understanding is that the "ring-change" service is for the outer shell, not the encryption password for the USB data. Futhermore, the use of the password management system is optional.From the Crypteks page:"No way! Thankfully NO ONE can reset your encryption password! Deciphering 256-bit AES encryption is a monumental task! (That's why we love it!). We recommend using and updating your personal Crypteks password management system account anytime you get a chance to change your password! We will be encrypting the entire engine and even we will not be able to view your stored information!"     http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crypteks/crypteks-usbtm-encrypted-and-lockable-usb-solutionhttp://www.crypteks.com-multiple private keys (no limit)-good for off-network bitcoin transactions too Thank you for the information, Blizzcoin. Simplicity is key and your service is the start of a trend. I actually believe that more people will tend towards an instant exchange rather than trading the bid/offer spread themselves. It's like the difference between going to a currency exchange kiosk or trading yourself on the open currency market. There is a role for both. Important thread. This is how correspondent banking works, with the money center bank in the middle with offsetting correspondents in local jurisdictions. Knowing all the local bitcoin exchanges would allow anyone (almost anywhere) to receive and then sell bitcoin; however, the majority of exchangers are now registering and becoming AML compliant in their countries of origin, which entails identity verification of exchange clientele. This is still an evolving legal area and certain jurisdictions are evolving faster than others. In fact, some bitcoin exchangers are actively promoting regulation, thereby seeking to legitimize themselves (i.e., Intersango). I cover this in my post http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/11/air-guitars-and-bitcoin-regulation.htmlAlso, see this Reuters article, Bitcoin exchanges offer anti- money-laundering aid http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/financial-bitcoin-idUSN1510930920110615 Does he mean "minor" or "miner" ? +1 agree. seems like a waste of coinage.... or bandwidth Why do so many people worry about how the law (and courts) will view bitcoin? Bitcoin was designed to route around centralized, authoritarian interference. There is no "silver bullet" in the law that will ultimately save and protect bitcoin because:1. the laws can always be 'adjusted' to accomplish the aims of the State;2. bitcoin doesn't need saving -- laws and regulations written specifically for bitcoin would perversely enhance its legitimacy. StrongCoin represents the future of online ewallets, especially for merchants. It is the bitcoin version of Hushmail for secure messaging which has been using java-based key gen and hashing for over 12 years.  http://www.hushmail.com/about/technology/how-it-works/Also, see the Hush Encryption Engine White Paper http://www.hushmail.com/about/technology/ Securing the workings of an exchange is a jurisdictional issue, with regulations as varied as the number of countries. Choosing to domicile an exchange in the US or UK is of course a conscious decision but it undoubtedly has ramifications for the majority of traders that will choose another jurisdiction for their exchange business. This is evidenced by the lack of support for US-based exchanges. It will become even more apparent for transactions and transfers in excess of 500 USD or 500 EUR. I believe that the win for bitcoin exchanges will come from selecting jurisdictions (or legal arrangements) that are more forward looking in their approach to bitcoin rather than attempting to "beg" or "work" for regulatory recognition as a currency. More latitude will be afforded to bitcoin as a non-currency. Thanks for the excellent insight on this, genjix. Deflation through attrition. Yes, very similar to hawala, although hawala probably serves the function better currently because of the pre-established trust. Existing without paper and/or transaction records for nearly 2000 years, hawala is nearly impossible to prove. Bitcoin solves the clearing function of hawala but not the settlement-into-local-currencies function. Therefore, any bitcoin exchanger/point-of-transfer in a country that is not on the FATF/OECD blacklist will have to comply with AML and KYC guidleines. Here's a related piece on the Bernard von NotHaus case:  http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/04/use-dollar-or-else.html and an amicus curiae brief in support of von NotHaus:  http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/06/gata-files-liberty-dollar-amicus-curiae.html Reading that text made me think that bitcoin regulation is similar to the regulation of "air guitars".  Some fun facts for those that may not yet know:Vili Lehdonvirta advocates regulation: "A New Frontier in Digital Content Policy: Case Studies in the Regulation of Virtual Goods and Artificial Scarcity"  http://www.hiit.fi/~vlehdonv/documents/Lehdonvirta-2010-virtual-goods-regulation.pdf"We are working with the government to make sure indeed the long arm of the government can reach Bitcoin"Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin Developer  http://rulingclass.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/bitcoin-and-agorism/Donald Norman, the co-founder of Bitcoin Consultancy,  advocates for Bitcoin's regulation, according to CNBC. "Norman is pushing to bring Bitcoin away from its roots and closer to a traditional currency  he is reaching out to regulators, looking to get legislation to oversee the system," says CNBC.  http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/06/this-is-what-will-really-crash-bitcoin.html?spref=tw"In the UK, supporters of Bitcoin made an urgent appeal to the Financial Services Authority to regulate the largest London-based exchange, so as to reassure people that using Bitcoin is safe. "Unregulated businesses don't usual cry out for regulation," said Donald Norman, co-founder of the exchange Britcoin. "But because we are unusual, and because we are dealing with people's money, and because of all the scary stories around Bitcoin, we would like nothing more than to have a government authority looking into our accounts  especially now."  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/hack-attack-pushes-bitcoin-to-the-brink-2300384.htmlAmir goes for bitcoin regulation (on national radio program):  http://www.katherinealbrecht.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3768:sat-june-25-2011&catid=20:show-archives&Itemid=44 You are still missing the point. Bitcoin was invented/designed to route around the intrusive regulatory aspects of central planning for monetary systems. That will never change. Of course, no one has stopped challenging themselves, but it is immature to think that you can adapt the bitcoin cryptocurrency into something suitable for the Statist apologists like Vili and the other significant portion of society that you cite. No one cares -- it's a distraction and red herring diverting attention away from more serious discussions (at this conference and any other forum). Have a conference on "Should Bitcoin Exist?" if that's what you want to discuss. Furthermore, you don't understand the essence of bitcoin if you believe that dismissing legal conformity and moving beyond it is "dogmatic" and "inbred".Bitcoin exchanges are constantly under attack in various parts around the globe. Let's truly take your suggestion and "challenge ourselves" on creating decentralized exchanges and creating business models and paradigms that make fitting into the current institutional structure irrelevant. It is a perpetually losing battle to seek minor legal victories within the confines of an arbitrary, subjective court system. Thanks for the update, genjix Seriously. Come on! Do not be fooled by Vili Lehdonvirta and his viewpoints on bitcoin above regarding democratic governments. Here are some of his twitter thoughts (below). While it's genuinely a good thing to have debate about digital currencies and the law, it is a waste of time for bitcoin because the nature of the bitcoin currency is antithetical to governments and regulation and centralized control over what transactions are made and/or identified. Bitcoin is not a project to debate the dilution of bitcoin decentralization, bitcoin anonymity, or bitcoin untraceability.This would be like inviting the CIA or FBI or US Treasury to debate. Who really fuckin' cares? What's at stake for forward-looking bitcoin proponents is the robustness of the transaction offerings and the stability and pervasiveness of the global exchanger network.ViliLe Vili LehdonvirtaWhat matters to authorities is what you can do with it, not whether it's made of bits, paper or gold.5 OctViliLe Vili LehdonvirtaNot sure I agree with that. e-Gold dealt in commodity, yet they were prosecuted.

Exactly. A native market for BTC/EUR will eventually provide the necessary liquidity. The Euro is the world's second largest reserve currency and it is used significantly in global trade. SEPA provides the speed and maintains the low cost for deposits/withdrawals to and from TradeHill. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_AreaThose wanting to fund for the thUSD trading platform can simply instruct their European-based bank to convert to USD and send outbound international wire (non-SEPA) to the USD deposit account https://www.tradehill.com/DepositOverview/USDThis is a positive development for TradeHill. Ben Laurie and paper already discussed over here:https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=25760.0 It's time to clear the air on this. I have read several comments like this one but I chose this one to respond to.My tenure as CEO of Hush Communications was from 2000-2002 during the period that the headquarters was located in Dublin, Ireland. We indeed responded to many international subpoenas during that time period and a special division was set-up to verify the authenticity of the many inbound government subpoenas. Our response was to comply with the subpoena and to turn over the contents of the inbox and the outbox, which of course was encrypted. Due to the nature of the java applet and password hashing technique, Hush Communications did not have the ability to decrypt any data. Sustained non-compliance to subpoena orders would have led to significant legal fees and probably the end of the company's operations. Furthermore, if users had deployed Hushmail properly in the first place, our compliance was not harming any users and this was a major factor in our decision. The change in policy that you refer to occurred after my tenure at Hush Communications when the company relocated its headquarters to Vancouver, Canada. The controversy revolved around compromised java applets served to targeted users where some Hushmail employees, with government coercion, actually cooperated to obtain the user's password. This is distinctly different than merely turning over encrypted data. Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HushmailOf course, this is hindsight, but I would NOT have allowed the company to take that additional step, because I believe that it is a direct, unwarranted intervention and it violates the end-user agreement with Hushmail's userbase. It crosses the line. I would have taken it to court and I would have made it an international media issue for privacy rights. People who know me well would agree that is my stance. Failing that, I could have also resigned in protest.It is important to state that Hushmail is still a valuable and safe service if utilized properly. All security is relative. Physical keyboard sniffers and ceiling cameras can be mounted in a suspect's home to obtain PGP private key passphrases. If one verifies the Hush applet against source code or better yet stores a clean version locally, the threat of a 'spoofed' applet can be eliminated. The only way that this could be beneficial is if the "small renegade nation" established a peg to bitcoin for their national currency, thereby providing a consistent way for bitcoin to be convertible to the nation-State world of international wire transfers, etc.When it comes to countries that ignore the establishment's OECD/FATF anti-money laundering guidelines and tax information exchange treaties, the only two that I know of are Iran and Libya. Thanks for the memories, Gavin. Maybe someone will purchase ClearCoin.  +1  Of course, have accounts at multiple exchanges in multiple jurisdictions and supports sites like http://ubitex.org/ It's naive to think that disingenuous, 'bitcoin-is-traceable' media interviews will result in congressional votes. What votes does bitcoin need anyway? I just came across this excellent article on Schumer's 'moral' crusade that I thought you all might enjoy:Chuck Schumers New War on Bitcoinhttp://rulingclass.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/chuck-schumers-new-war-on-bitcoin/ Bram Cohen's client for BitTorrent is not the leading client for downloading content from the Internet today. I agree that legal exchanges within a given jurisdiction are a positive, especially since there are still technical issues with implementing a viable decentralized p2p exchange structure. However, money service businesses and Know-Your-Customer rules vary among jurisdictions globally and in many cases they are less restrictive than the MSB regulations in the US. Also, it is jumping the gun to classify a 'crypto math puzzle' as a financial instrument and to suggest regulatory oversight. IMHO, the permitted US-based bitcoin exchanges will eventually become a single point-of-failure. Exchangers in other jurisdictions will mitigate that regardless of KYC rules.I fail to see how maintaining the same features as a $100 bill is an ideological cause. Are you now opposed to people using $100 bills? I have no problems with the technological implementation because it can provide those features when structured correctly and safely. Have the politically-correct co-opted the Forum lately? When will people realize that it doesn't matter what government thinks about a 'crypto math puzzle'.  Nor , does it matter if they like it or support it.  It doesn't even matter if the population likes bitcoin. I don't like US Dollars and the promise-of-a-promise Euro currency, but I still accept them. +1 DATA COMMANDER Not masterful at all. It wasn't just PR spin. Garzik actually believes what he says. Although he was well-spoken, this is fundamentally the wrong position to be taking with the media.  Here's why.Cash is slowly going away and social utopians everywhere are talking about the nirvana of a global cashless society. Well, that all sounds great until people wake up one day and realize that what they have sacrificed in the transition to a cashless utopia is any thread of financial privacy that remained with paper cash. The phrase 'resist digital money unless anonymous' really means don't give up paper cash if the future is even more traceable and intrusive.Therefore, stressing bitcoin's traceability and that bitcoin is not anonymous becomes the worst of both worlds -- cashless and traceable! No one is fooling the authorities by saying bitcoin is fully traceable and some people know safe bitcoin practices. Press interviews like this one retard the 'separation of money and State' cause and reinforce the harmful notion that money can and should be used for identity tracking. Those are bitcoin's positive key differentiators.I ran out of time before I could even write what a bad idea MSB regulation is for bitcoin....but last week I posted my other PR thoughts (Jews as money launderers, etc., etc.) here: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8940.msg164099#msg164099 Bitcoin Money has the video clip (now moving discussion to the Bitcoin Forum CBS thread): http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=13077.msg184200#msg184200http://www.bitcoinmoney.com/post/6305669012/cbs-whatstrending-bitcoin  andhttp://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504943_162-20069780-10391715.html Bitcoin Money has it here:http://www.bitcoinmoney.com/post/6305669012/cbs-whatstrending-bitcoinand CBS video here:http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504943_162-20069780-10391715.html +1 to duncant.  Nice planned implementation. I think I'm the one who found it over the weekend and tweeted it. Sorry to blow your cover, secret squirrel, but things are starting to move fast now. I also posted it to mikegogulski on the Bitcoin Laundry thread where it is being discussed here,  http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=6891.0 It is prohibited by PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy (IMHO, a flawed policy).See: PayPal Freezes Accounts of Two Bitcoin Exchangershttp://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/05/paypal-freezes-accounts-of-two-bitcoin.html I wanted to try this particular exchanger even though my Spanish is not so good. First transaction went very smoothly and I received my confirmed bitcoin within 2.5 hours of funding. Communication was clear on setting the rate, terms, etc. and I would definitely recommend them (English and Spanish). Additionally, if you have an account at Openbank.es then this is probably one of the fastest ways to buy and sell bitcoin. Thank you bitcoin.com.es Hiro, welcome to the forum! Great job on the AgoristRadio program.....listening to Doctor Nefario was awesome. Thanks also for hosting me last week on the program. Exactly. And, no one gets to decide what is a 'moral transaction' and what is a 'real crime'. Transaction done.
Not true...people use these all the time to buy groceries and to go on vacation, restaurants, etc.   http://bit.ly/k3rDSO I don't think that is what Gavin meant, because education works both ways.  For instance, you can point out the ridiculousness of relying on the bitcoin block explorer because bitcoin (private keys) can be exchanged offline on USB sticks or BitBills. Also, education on 'remailer' and 'mixers' would demonstrate to law enforcement that it is impractical to rely on the block chain. I agree. If bitcoins only purpose/advantage is as an inflation-hedge, there are numerous things that would serve that function. The major differentiator, in fact the only differentiator that will have a significant impact on economic growth and taxation policy, is bitcoin's potential for user-determined anonymity and untracability. +1  I have been thinking this exact thought. A few may be prosecuted, as with copyright infringement, because they posted their "one and only" bitcoin address on their blog or Facebook page.  Ultimately, this episode will result in a greater understanding of how to practice safe bitcoining. +1  Definitely, the correct approach. In the end, bitcoin's resilience will be proven with or without certain types of transactions. Money does not make any statement on morality. An "innocent" payment system cannot be held accountable anymore than an "innocent" $100 bill can be held accountable. Unfortunately, payment systems are unfairly attacked because it is the path of least resistance for enforcement, as in the case of the recent US online poker shutdown. Digital tracking tends to make this easier when money is involved.However, the benefit to society as a whole, and ultimately our freedom, requires that we maintain efficient payment systems, efficient telephone networks, and efficient postal networks, even if those same networks are used for things that certain people oppose.  Congrats on the AgoristRadio program. For general economies of scale, it's good to see the two main laundries converge.  I have a question about Bitcoin Laundry and server logs so apologies if this has already been discussed and answered elsewhere (I couldn't find it). What is your company's policy on server logs and client confidentiality? Also, what is your opinion of the approach by https://blindbitcoin.com/security.html I just noticed this thread so I thought I would post here as well to contribute to the overall discussion started by Gavin. Here is my post from the Press Hits thread:Bitcoin is a nonpolitical decentralized cryptocurrency with user-determined anonymity and transaction irreversibility. Most people are happy transacting on the Internet with VISA/MC/AMEX when it comes to plane tickets, hotels, gifts, etc, so bitcoin is not really a breakthrough for spending on the Internet. Terrorists, pornographers, and drug dealers already use $100 bills but that is not the fault of the innocent anonymous $100 bill and they haven't banned the $100 bill (yet). Bad guys use the roads and phones, too.Money going digital does not mean that we have to give up any of the features that already exist with the paper $100 bill. Yet, that is the way things are being positioned by the establishment --- "give up the privacy and untracability elements of the $100 bill and we will give you the nirvana of a digital, cashless society." This is such bullshit!  MOA, I'm not sure if this news about privacy can be broken to the establishment in a delicate way, but it can be based around the common theme of liberty (i mean, come on, who doesn't believe in liberty?):Regarding the media, I believe that bitcoin needs to be positioned as a way to restore financial privacy to the individual:1. Secrecy does not equal concealment, but rather secrecy equals privacy;2. Large-scale private value transfer should not be impeded across national boundaries (money laundering is a pejorative term);3. Individuals should have freedom from confiscation and immoral tax levies;4. Individuals should have freedom from money being used to track identity;5. Individuals should have protection from the depreciating nation-State political currencies.Then, using general themes like PayPal freezing accounts and reversing legitimate transactions will be certain to resonate with Joe Q. Public. Then, if you really, really want to get everyone on your side, mention how the Jews under Hitler would be labelled as 'money launderers' today simply because they attempted to move their wealth to Austria in order to avoid confiscation. The Jews in Hitler's Germany certainly would be bitcoin advocates. Actually, bitcoin should be known for neither. Bitcoin is a nonpolitical decentralized cryptocurrency with user-determined anonymity and transaction irreversibility. Most people are happy transacting on the Internet with VISA/MC/AMEX when it comes to plane tickets, hotels, etc. Terrorists and drug dealers already use $100 bills but that is not the fault of the innocent $100 bill.I believe that, in the media, bitcoin needs to be positioned as a way to restore financial privacy to the individual:1. Secrecy does not equal concealment, but rather secrecy equals privacy;2. Large-scale private value transfer should not be impeded across national boundaries (money laundering is a pejorative term);3. Freedom from confiscation and tax levies;4. Freedom from money being used to track identity;5. Protection from the depreciating nation-State political currencies subject to constant debasement. I seriously doubt that accepting bitcoin is going to jeopardize their tax-exempt status. Would they refuse donations in gold bars because of the potential capital gains?  University endowments thrive on the capital gains.  This is something else which unfortunately diminishes the role of EFF going forward. Maybe somebody needs to send them 'Snowcrash' but their position and their response are laughable. They are now irrelevant and other more forward-looking organizations will emerge. Accepting only legal tender to be able to support civil liberties on the Internet is like cancer research foundations dismissing a cure to cancer so that the foundation can continue its work. Nonpolitical cryptocurrencies will do more to secure online civil liberties than the EFF can ever hope to accomplish. Publishing a static IP is great, but if it gets to that point (which I think it will), then don't exchangers like MtGox require something like this:http://www.fotograf.nu/360/bahnhof/ This sounds like trying to design a technical feature for µTorrent that would charge per download. It was like someone pee'd in my corn flakes when I woke up and read this "Legal tender is the best way to help EFF support online civil liberties" on Bitcoin Money Blog. http://www.bitcoinmoney.com/post/6100385027/eff-bitcoin-donation-reviewHere's my response on Twitter: Legal tender may be antithetical to online civil liberties http://j.mp/iEWB4T this is most unfortunate @JPBarlow @RaineyReitman @EFF #bitcoin Thanks grondilu for the pics. Good times at La Défense....enjoyed meeting the Paris contingency. Of course I know who Ben Laurie is...that is why I wrote the reply post to him in the first place. There is a distinct difference between legitimate criticisms (such as what happens to bitcoin because of IRC vulnerability) and mere impetuous back-of-the-envelope attacks. Maybe you should re-state exactly what Ben's new criticisms are, because I'm sure many would be interested in what you think they are.Regardless of Ben and the others, the fact still remains that today I can digitally transfer $100,000.00 worth of bitcoin value across national/State borders without any reporting requirements, any banks, any identity forms, any Know-Your-Customer rules, and any explanations.  I could not do that prior to a p2p distributed cryptocurrency.  That is the real issue, FYI.  Break it or make it.  Financial privacy restored.  unk, woooaaaa, you're the one that needs to take a chill pill. Most of the people on this forum are not dismissing CS and Ben Laurie. It's just that most of their criticisms have already been refuted and they are the ones that did not expend the energy to properly research the arguments that they were jumping into. These same discussions have been going on for over a year.  It says a lot about a cryptographer's relevance if they are just now discovering bitcoin!See my initial reply to Ben at my blog (link below).  I can happily say that Ben did not delete my comment so I am glad for that. The cryptographers mailing list thread from 2008 is where Satoshi vetted his approach and his protocol with fellow cryptographers (link to that exchange is also on my Ben Laurie blog post http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/05/ben-laurie-blathering-on-bitcoin.html ).  Come on, please don't cater to Ben.  Just because he's late is not what makes him wrong, but he is far from objective.  First of all, he designed a brilliant, albeit centralised, system and he has periodically dismissed the 'proof of work' concept, so a bitcoin recognition from him now would essentially invalidate 10+ years of his own work. You just have to see it for what it is. I really don't know what this ComputerScientist guy is all disturbed about. All I wanted to do was to trade some hash cookies with my international friends. One of the Ben Laurie followers (AnotherComputerScientist) had this to say about the Bitcoin Forum http://www.links.org/?p=1171#comments :Well then, I'm not sure if I'm one of the 4 people he's talking about, but I did reply to Ben's initial post here http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/05/ben-laurie-blathering-on-bitcoin.htmlThen, in Ben Laurie's third bitcoin post since discovering it http://www.links.org/?p=1175 (Bitcoin is Slow Motion, 21 May 2011), I think he misses the point that on the route to deploy more resources in order to form a new 'transactional consensus' it would simply become more efficient to mine upon the existing block chains. Many of Ben's criticisms seem already to have been anticipated. Total link-bait for Ven. Shameful. Chris, I liked your response to @Jason. Even though he wanted to praise the effort of bitcoin, he still believes that it will become patently illegal and that the combined international forces of OECD/FATF will be brought to bear upon bitcoin. I think he enjoys the disruptive part of bitcoin but only as a spectator. The liberation of individual private value transfer is what should be stressed. Laws against bitcoin will be largely unenforceable at the p2p level anyway and it is far better to move forward in making the laws irrelevant than it is to predict legality in certain jurisdictions. If bitcoin were not 'dangerous' to some in the monetary hierarchy, then it would not be disruptive enough. Me too....looking forward to it.
LOL, I like the Labuan and Vanuatu jurisdictions. But any place not on this list http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FATF_Blacklist will ultimately be drawn into the "Down with Bitcoin" club, militarily if necessary. Unfortunately, there is no 'magic' silver bullet in the law that will protect or allow BTC and even if there were, it would be quickly modified to bring about the desired result of the authorities. That's why I continue to state that a legal effort should be directed towards designing infrastructures that do not depend on legal rulings or interpretations or even jurisdictions. To do otherwise would be naïve and grossly irresponsible. For instance, p2p anonymous distributed exchanges can accomplish this (as already mentioned above) as can the use of Tor and i2P networking see http://www.i2p2.de/ Ultimately, resiliency will come from technical design and not from legal design. Here are some thoughts to ponder for a group of legal experts in money and banking:Doug Jackson and e-gold have the money service business rules changed on them (Bullion and Bandits):http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2009/06/bullion-and-bandits-improbable-rise-and.htmlBernard von Nothaus is labelled a financial terrorist for doubting the Orwellian newspeak that "paper=real money"; "gold=counterfeit" http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/03/liberty-dollar-founder-convicted-in.htmlLegal Tender, Illegal Tender: Will Bitcoin be Banned?http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/04/legal-tender-illegal-tender-will.htmlFinCEN Proposes Reporting On All Cross-Border Transactionshttp://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2010/10/fincen-proposes-reporting-on-all-cross.htmlThe Death Of Cash?

This is one of the silliest threads that I have seen on bitcoin forum. It would be like convening the regulators and feed-at-the-trough lawyers to come up with a way to make downloading new release movies via BitTorrent a legal and mass-market activity. Bitcoin was created specifically to bypass or "route around" the regulators and it doesn't need to be mass market to achieve that. The only attornies that bitcoin community will need are defense attornies experienced in defending against attacks from the AML crowd. It would be great to create that Dream Team. grondilu, "la Défense" on May 25th lunch sounds great....please post here when you have final cafe address since i won't have anyone's mobile number. cheers, I don't trust you less.  We should all practice safe code as a matter of routine!IMHO, the wider intelligence community may end up being "closet" bitcoin proponents. If you think about, it makes a lot of sense. Iran-Contra connection under the Reagan administration would have been far more difficult to discover under a bitcoin monetary system. Bitcoin doesn't replace PayPal, bitcoin replaces hawala. This was the Wikileaks dilemma. Julian Assange claims to have spoken up publicly because the non-participants were about to speak up just to fill the void. Let's just hope there's no Swedish blondes involved.  Clearcoin appears to be operating within the law. But an unlicensed US-based bitcoin money exchanger would not be. Mainly because there is no upside and it is unnecessary. Personally, as a humble blogger, I feel that it is an inappropriate audience (less so than the FBI however)!  It will tend to harm his reputation in the BTC community significantly more than it will help (but it is Gavin's personal decision to make). On a non-Gavin collective level, it would be like Pablo Escobar presenting to the DEA or Marc Rich presenting to the IRS or Phil Zimmermann presenting to the NSA. Excellent comment. I agree most with the source code statement because that is what happened to PGP under NAI in 2001. Published bitcoin code will require more rigorous review but that is always the case with open-source crypto code.Even if Gavin reconsiders, someone else from the bitcoin community would step up and I think Gavin realized that. This is merely a show for the CIA to order in some Chinese carry-out and fill time to justify salaries. Trust me, the people that matter are already well aware of the Bitcoin Block Explorer and the vulnerabilities of the IRC network. They even have a separate division/fund that invests in startups. http://www.iqt.org/Even while intelligence community may facilitate transfers with bitcoin, the true threats to the rest of mankind will come from the coordinated multi-government crackdown on the global exchanger network.  There are over 2,000 digital currency exchangers today in various legal jurisdictions around the world and it is fairly trivial for those exchangers to add bitcoin as an offered product. So, an invitation to present at the FBI/Treasury AML crowd will be the canary in the coalmine. Café des Phares7, Place de la Bastille 75004, ParisMetro BastilleCafé Le Bastille8, Place de la Bastille 75012, ParisMetro BastilleThese two cafés share not only the prominent location of the Place de la Bastille and all the historical reverence attached to this Parisian cornerstone site, they were also linked to a sort of renaissance movement in Paris cafes known as the Philocafés. These are spots where people would meet as a club, and whose purpose was to philosophize, almost in ways reminiscent of the art and intellectual movement of the early 20th Century. If not in actual potency, they definitely hit a chord with nostalgia. The two bustling cafés have seen it all and probably roll right along with an amused grin.http://www.myparistrips.com/pariscafes.html Gavin, I will be traveling to Paris to meet there and my current dates are May 24-27th.  Can you please reconfirm that May 25th is the agreed date. Cheers. Tyler, I am confused and shocked by your analysis, especially given your NME {New Monetary Economics} http://www.amazon.com/Explorations-Monetary-Economics-Tyler-Cowen/dp/1557860718 days with RK {Randall Kroszner}. You should know better. Its not that I really care about your analysis except for the fact that economist voices on the topic of bitcoin have a disproportionate impact at this point of its evolution.First of all, you admit to still being confused. I agree with you that you are confused. So, why did you pen an analysis? Once you do some basic research, you will understand that bitcoin is essentially digital gold as far as scarcity is concerned. Gold is merely a byproduct of the big bang (atomic number 79). It has value because mankind has assigned it value through the ages. The bid/ask on bitcoin is no different than the bid/ask on gold. It has value because the market has given it value (probably for its digital properties in enabling a tax-free parallel economy). The central bank may have a monopoly on the issuance of legal tender but it does not have a monopoly on creating a mass illusion. Free individuals can generate a mass illusion just as a central bank creates the mass illusion of paper as value. I just noticed this "It's just a fucking integer" thread...http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=111.msg39861#msg39861Very true. Therefore, the deflation argument that needs to be defended is that even with 8 decimals and the largest nominal attrition occurring in the earliest years, bitcoin supply is not only static but decreasing.  This is a slightly different economic defense than the deflation inherent in a static gold-based economy, because in the case of durable precious metals, they are usually found by someone else. Bitcoins can be completely eliminated and never found unless you luck upon the private key. BTW, Mises Institute articles do fall under the creative commons license for republication. I am not seeking the btc bounty ;-) , but I wanted to point out that eloquent defenses of deflation already exist.  It matters not that the monetary unit is btc or gold or silver. The 21 million decision was an arbitrary number. Any economic defense regarding deflation will most likely point to deflation and metals as the "state of nature" starting point. I think a more critical issue related to the static supply of bitcoin is how the distributed system deals with lost or destroyed bitcoin that never return to the system.  Not a major impact right now but with a 5% average attrition rate, the ~21 million supply could be significantly eroded because there is no expiration. I would suspect that at least 2% are already gone due to unrecoverable hard drive crashes. On deflation, see...In Defense of Deflation by Doug French http://mises.org/daily/4623Deflation and Liberty by Jörg Guido Hülsmann http://mises.org/resources/3726/Deflation-and-Liberty True, but with a futures exchange, trading the contracts requires only a minimal margin deposit and the contracts that do not deliver instead utilize a cash settlement mechanism (like the S&P 500).  It is still not clear to me how the USD balance in your exchange can ever surpass the initial injection balance. But I really like the idea. The exchanger network is sophisticated and established, although most today deal with WebMoney, Liberty Reserve, c-Gold, Pecunix, gBullion, etc, etc. It is only a matter of market demand before the leading ones add bitcoin. They are already localised for their regional focus into and out of some national currencies. I would estimate that there are over 2,000 digital currency exchangers in the world today. grondilu, please stay out of the banking system. If exchange is the issue, I think what we need more is a p2p distributed exchange client. Regarding the confused statements of precious metals partnering with bitcoin, you people miss the entire point of bitcoin.  I am a gold/silver bug myself and a Dec 2010 long position in BTC would have outperformed gold. In the long run, it should keep pace with gold and silver. This attack probably will be attempted and the g-men tasked with it will most likely post to this forum for stress-testing, feedback, etc.However, one fact that is overlooked is that "original" bitcoin enables a parallel economy with a tax-less monetary system. It is not just crypto-libertarians that prefer that economic arrangement but 99% of the non-ruling world. Once he gets "PayPaled" the way Wikileaks did, he might change his preference. Yes, excellent news. Stefan is one of the regular shows that I watch. Maybe he will devote a future show to the topic of Bitcoin and the evolving bitcoin economy.
Colby's article was probably about as balanced as you can be when the immediate, direct audience is the anti-money laundering crowd and those tasked with compliance. I think it's great that the web address is moneylaundering.com instead of antimoneylaundering.com.Money laundering is a pejorative term to begin with because it insinuates that the participants do not have certain inherent rights to financial privacy. The Jews "laundered" their money to Switzerland in order to escape Hitler's holocaust.  Come on, people!  Financial privacy is a fundamental human right that has been consistently eroded and violated by governments.  We must take a step back and comprehend that "secrecy" does not mean "concealment", but rather that "secrecy" means "privacy" in its most basic sense. We all apparently support the "mass illusion" that is called the US Dollar when it is backed by nothing (other than a really big army). Governments only become suspicious and threatened when other groups voluntarily create and support their own "mass illusion", because they view it as competition to the THEIR illusion.  Bitcoin, more than anything, is a study in sociology and human nature. Volumes will increase. True, it would only take a few days to adapt forex software for BTC, but clearing and settlement from/into national currencies is where it touches the "KYC" anti-money laundering world, including OECD/FATF and Fincen. An environment of multiple cryptocurrencies is a likely future but I don't think a BTC clone will come from Google, Apple, or any nation-State because those entities would be centralized in nature and they would not be in a position to exploit the attributes of bitcoin, such as remaining open and operational while under political attack.  It would almost be like Google coming out with their own BitTorrent server to compete against The Pirate Bay. Secrecy=privacy. Those "elements" you mention are a red herring put forth by people who believe that secrecy=concealment. See Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse Yes, I wholeheartedly agree in the public nature of an open-source cryptocurrency (it is a good point).  The Atlantic piece wasn't the best article and a lot of my better points weren't even used.  I had no idea of the article's title while being interviewed.  Actually, I was addressing his question about Facebook Credits (which are a private currency). He seemed to confuse private currencies with digital cash and cryptocurrencies, not to mention the differences between an e-gold ledger-based system and the decentralised nature of signed RPOWs to prevent double spending. Still better to participate in the article then turn it down, which is what I did for the Colby Adams request. Yes, bitcoin as the stateless currency.  We should however focus more time on implementing decentralized p2p exchanges and also address the vulnerabilities of IRC in light of an attack. Bitcoin IS ACTUALLY discussed in The Atlantic Monthly Magazine:http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/how-to-start-your-own-private-currency/73327/ You might also see....  The Tiny Dot  http://youtu.be/H6b70TUbdfs The attendees came from various places (i.e., Malta, Isle of Man, Ireland, UK, Bulgaria, etc) but they were all involved at some level in the online gaming industry. A member of the EU, Gibraltar has its own constitution and governs its own affairs via its own elected parliament. The independent judicial system of Gibraltar is modeled on the common laws of England & Wales which is seen as a benefit in business dealings (compared to Panama or Costa Rica for instance). Financial law follows the EU and the UK, but having said that Gibraltar has been very effective at leveraging the recent e-money legislation and e-money companies do quite well in Gib. Several have been set up and they are permitted to issue VISA and Mastercard prepaid cards without having a full bank license which is required in the US.I wouldn't get too hopeful though about any country formally embracing bitcoin because they all still answer to OECD/FATF and Know-Your-Customer anti-money laundering laws (you would almost have to go Libya or Iran if you wanted to ignore OECD/FATF). Considerable pressure still comes from the US government on these matters and online gambling companies respect the US law of not allowing US players.The bottom line is that the attendees do not seem to perceive the payment method as a "competitive advantage" so they happily receive the other fee-based payment alternatives.  They tend to focus more on the competition for eyeballs and affiliates feeding them traffic so in many ways it resembles the economics of online porn. Creighto, Please see my recent presentation at Gibraltar conference where bitcoin was presented to the Prime Minister of Gibraltar and the leading eGaming companies in attendance.  FYI, Gibraltar is the world capital for online gambling companies and it is the country's #1 industry.http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/03/monetising-game-play-on-social-network.html(the bitcoin section begins on page 11.)My other "pre-bitcoin", Chaumian-type cryptocurrency work was completed during my tenure at VeriSign, Inc. where I was employed after VISA. One such 1995 piece was published by both the London School of Economics and the Libertarian Alliance:http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2009/05/london-school-of-economics-publishes.html(please note that this early digital cash work was subsequently referenced in a leading Economics textbook)http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn063.pdf I am an economist and I already have staked my reputation on Bitcoin. I believe the narrative for anonymity is "financial privacy" as a fundamental human right.  Where along the way did we lose our basic right to simple financial privacy?  Sheeple have been unfairly conditioned to think that secrecy equals concealment and nothing could be further from the truth. It is wrong to preach that we have to surrender basic financial privacy so that TPTB can endlessly chase the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse.  Secrecy = Privacy,  Secrecy ≠ Concealment. See http://www.arraydev.com/commerce/jibc/9601-2.htm Seems natural to me. I just watched the video of the talk.  Excellent job, Genjix. I really enjoyed the highlighting of the money laundering service from Mike Gogulski. You are now added to the great BIG gubmint database of public bitcoin advocates when they come for us.  "Sir, but it's just a math puzzle".....Cheers. Intriguing thoughts from @webisteme on Bitcoin and Fractional Reserve Banking:http://www.webisteme.com/blog/?p=192...and, my comment to his blog post:This is an interesting thesis. At this point in bitcoins evolution, I still see any bitcoin reserves as similar to gold (or silver) reserves with the primary difference being that bitcoin does not suffer the same portability, divisibility, and security issues which gave rise to the gold reserve note in the first place. Back to the demand side of money, why would a user accept a bitcoin reserve note when the actual bitcoin has better overall transactional properties than its derivative?Having said that, in the absence of a parallel bitcoin fork or parallel cryptocurrency, I do not believe that the bitcoin economy will support fractional reserve banking. I disagree with Gavin Andresen on this point. Lending will indeed exist through timed deposit instruments rather than on-demand current accounts. This would not be unlike the gold leasing arrangements that exist today for the worlds above-ground gold reserves (of, course, Im referring to the non-fraudulent ones). Being highly divisible, fungible, nearly real-time, and already decentralized, bitcoin negates the conditional criteria that gave rise to fractional reserve free banking in the pre-bitcoin era. Server Not Found error on the onion address.  Is that correct address? The bitcoin economy will grow and prosper precisely because it has the potential to facilitate a parallel economy that can also operate beyond the scope of taxation. All types of transactions will be attracted to a taxation-free zone because throughout history no- to low-tax zones have always thrived against their counterparts (Hong Kong, US in the 1800s).  This parallel economy will know no political borders so it will not even be clear which taxation authority has the jurisdiction over the economic participant(s).Even if the proper jurisdictional taxation entity could be reasonably determined, they would still be faced with applying a tax to a reusable proof-of-work 'puzzle'. Firstly, how do you tax a mathematical puzzle without giving it monetary legitimacy?  How do you determine the political borders of the recipient key (if recipient is careful)?  How do you determine the total amount to tax if bitcoin laundries and mixers are used?  Today, an individual can work for bitcoin in anonymous fashion from an undetected geographic location and then spend bitcoin or anonymously trade out of bitcoin.  I don't really see that changing. I'd be more worried about an authoritarian shutdown of the IRC network. Not true.  It's only the opposite situation if looking at it from the ¥en-to-Dollar perspective.  When you look at it from Dollar-to-¥en (or future BTC-to-Dollar) perspective, then one Dollar would equal .0070 BTC in future.  Exchange rates are always different sides of the same 'coin'. Just inverted. Second that, noagendamarket. Governments are not going to roll back taxes and create tax-free zones, because it's more in their interest to grow and to expand.  The forces on the side of liberty periodically attempt to rein in the government but it merely has the effect of only slowing its rate of growth.

The Japanese ¥en currently trades at $0.012190 to the dollar and people still use ¥ quite a bit.In fact, when the ¥en was trading at 130 to the dollar in the good ol' days, it was 1¥ = $0.007692  (traders would just drop the first two zeros and trade it as 7692/7694). I need to vent and this forum seems like the best place! For the last two days I have been attending/following via Twitter the 14th annual Digital Money Forum in London hosted by my friend, Dave Birch.  Here is the agenda link: http://www.chyp.com/  (click thru to get to agenda) ...or...  http://www.chyp.com/digitalmoney/agenda-2011/Keep in mind that the speakers and attendees are paid many thousands of dollars/pounds/euros per month to study and implement electronic money concepts for multinational banks, payment associations, and payment companies. For Hushmail, I even presented at the Forum in 2001 regarding web-based digital signature technology but i think it was Digital Identity Forum at the time. And, this is why bitcoin is going to blindside everyone:1) there is not an awareness of market demand for decentralized p2p digital currency;2) many 'experts' do not understand the difference between centralized vs. decentralized as it relates to digital cash;3) many 'experts' do not recognize that bitcoin requires the chain to prevent double-spending;4) people react with the same antipathy that they have towards gold standard or else, conversely, they fail to understand that bitcoin value doesn't rest upon the intrinsic value economic argument;5) quasi-competitors, Facebook credits and Linden dollars, etc. as virtual currency, restrict two-way convertibility;6) generally people dismiss it as a fad and they are not aware of the floating exchange rate;7) lastly, it was mentioned that they could invite someone from bitcoin to attend the forum next year (I guess that would mean Satoshi if anyone can find him or if he wants to be found, but if I were him, I wouldn't attend -- that's the whole point of distributed p2p value).You can follow the hashtag #dmf14 on www.twitter.com if you want to view the conference comments. Godspeed. The EFF is probably dumping their bitcoin on the market and that's what is keeping the price under $1.00 now. Posted by Sebastiano Scròfina, a decentral banker at kakigarden.comIs Bitcoin doomed to fail ?http://www.quora.com/Is-Bitcoin-doomed-to-fail?srid=uLsHe states:"I love the concept of Bitcoin. I believe the Internet will redefine currency in the following years. But I've got 5 major concerns about Bitcoin's scalability (other than the block chain size)".......... v-tim,Are you a venture capitalist or angel investor? Thanks to kiba for launching this.  I am just now seeing this post so apologies for being a few days behind.  IMO, the reading material needs to be at a more 'granular and focused level' for direct relevance to bitcoin.  Human Action is indeed a powerhouse, but that can be read on one's free time/beach time.The Austrians have been very specific in monetary theory, for instance:1. Mises, The Theory of Money and Credit2. Rothbard, What Has Government Done to Our Money?3. Hayek, The Denationalization of Money and Competition in CurrencyAdditionally, I have painstakingly gone through all of the academic journals (1990-2010) for articles related to digital currency/digital cash/precursors to bitcoin/etc and the links are hosted at the right-hand side of the blog page for http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.comYou can find it by scrolling down to the middle under the heading:Selected Digital Currency Articles and Academic Papers (2000-current); andSelected Digital Currency Articles and Academic Papers (1990-1999) IP addresses are not a 100% replacement for domain names; try it with some of the seized domains and see what happens.

Good post TTBit, especially the part about MtGox functioning as an online financial institution. Other MtGox implications, besides the PayPal debacle, are jurisdictional.  The bottom of the web page lists an entity that looks like it's registered in Panama, but I believe that large balances retained at MtGox would be subject to shut-down by the local jurisdiction, if they ever received enough pressure to do this.  The issues would be:1. does LibertyReserve support secondary account redemptions if the primary MtGox account became compromised/confiscated?2. What happens to MtGox bitcoin balances if servers are confiscated?3. does MtGox maintain backup servers or servers located in a different jurisdiction than the primary mgmt entity? You got that right, caveden.  It took me about three weeks to get over the "concern" with currency backing and the whole intrinsic vs. extrinsic debate, but I finally GOT IT and now i almost lose my temper every time i have to go over the concept with other economists, traders, and even developers.  Paper currency notes have no intrinsic value (without considering the law and gov't payment preference).Until we can use molecular transport pods to send a gold coin across the internet, decentralized P2P money will gyrate towards reusable proof-of-work methodologies. Not the best wording but the article has received a lot of attention. I don't think that the EFF is in a position to grant legal protection...maybe "legal assistance".However, bitcoin does not really need any legal protection -- it is not legal tender, it has no "intrinsic" value, it is not pretending to be a political monetary unit, and it doesn't break any laws -- it is simply a reusable cryptographic proof-of-work. It doesn't even violate copyright laws. So, for governments to legislate against it or to attack it with existing laws, they would first have to recognize bitcoin as having value. If they did that, then other cryptographic POW systems would gain instant credibility and the anonymous e-currency business would be off to the races!  Thanks ribuck, but a fully-encrypted hard drive, like http://www.truecrypt.org/ will solve this issue.Now, I also know that a person in the UK went to jail for "not" revealing his PGP private key password, but i suppose you can always say that you have so many passwords that you forgot.  Also, see similar case "UK teenager jailed for not disclosing password":http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/uk-teenager-jailed-for-not-disclosing-password/6372 You guys are great, but you sure do get off topic pretty quickly.  ;-)Cheers, What are the best ways today to have "safe bitcoin" like "safe sex" ?  Is the future of untraceable bitcoin going in the direction of anonymous re-mixers where you have to trust a third party bitcoin bank or are there other ways that i am missing? I realize that bitcoin is pseudonymous vs. anonymous and that precautions must be taken, but I came across two easy-to-find web pages that should serve as a harbinger of how law enforcement will utilize bitcoin data should it attain critical mass:1. http://buybitcoins.com/   Look at the Google maps from the crooks real (or proxy) servers. Now, this company lost over $2,000 in fraudulent cc transactions which is wrong, but the larger point is that a shocking amount of information is available from sloppy users.  Consider if this were political prisoners from Tibet, Wikileaks benefactors, or simply international business people wishing to keep an income stream private from confiscatory taxation authorities;2. http://theymos.ath.cx:64150/bbe/   This is the Block Explorer brilliantly assembled by 'theymos'.  I almost fell out of my chair when I imagined law enforcement each having Block Explorer running as their home page. Theymos should receive many donations (from governments, I suspect).The implications are obvious.  In the trade-off to cryptographically address the double-spend issue, Bitcoin has left a transactional trail of valuable data which can be beneficial to anyone attempting to piece together a profile.  As Bitcoin matures, more services such as mybitcoin.com, bitcoin banks, and bitcoin mixers will be routine practice because otherwise the casual (or novice) user will be unaware of the trail that could easily lead to physical and geographical identity. The privacy features of a $100 bill or a 500-euro note should be the minimum standard of financial and transactional privacy. Aside from Satoshi sinisterly building in a back door for his future King Croesus-like wealth, the primary existing design flaw is what to do after 21 million is reached.  Even at a generous 1:1 BTC:USD exchange rate, a small-time chump-change millionaire could buy up the world's supply of bitcoin and dictate prices/transactions.Now, the only thing that would make this scenario unrealistic is for bitcoin value to go to 1000:1 thereby reflecting a $210 billion supply.  If bitcoin is on that track then maybe the speculators have the right idea. You don't get there right away, but the current design flaw is that successful growth of the bitcoin economy has unavoidable built-in deflation. A solution to the post-21 million bitcoin world would address those concerns now.  Weeee...........this speculating stuff is easy. Grondilu, we are in agreement, especially regarding your comment on token representation.  My point is that a pegged rate to gold will provide bitcoin with stable value representation (and put an end to the crying deflationistas and inflationistas). A floating rate to gold is what exists now but you still have to go through someone like Mt. Gox where the quoted exchange rate is dollar-based to get the expression in USD. I understand the irony here because a gold peg seemingly would overlay a centralized structure from those providing the gold-backing, but it doesn't have to be centralized if the bitcoin forks grow with the injected amount of gold.  The gold peg can be software-established in the same way that the 21 million threshold is established. This would therefore be distributed because it is a distributed system of bitcoin exchangers worldwide providing the backing at generation.I will remain open about the forked block in bitcoin being unnecessary, but I don't see how a stable bitcoin is feasible without parallel bitcoin economies having the option to provide the convertibility function. The reason that I think a fork may be required is that there are already so many bitcoin issued without a value injection (other than gen time and power). We wouldn't value paper dollars based on the amount of paper and ink utilized. Bitcoin is not "legal tender" fiat by decree.I am referring to a stable rate of x bitcoin to x grams (just like the Chinese Yuan to the USD or other dollar pegs). This would allow bitcoin valuation to take place in an expression other than USD and one would not need to go through the USD for valuation and/or two-way convertibility. A pegged link would then allow bitcoin to also take on the "unit of account" function of money in addition to the "medium of exchange" function. Agreed, the article is bollocks. The greatest threat to the current bitcoin economy is probably a parallel (or forked) bitcoin economy where large block issuers align themselves somehow to issue bitcoin which is convertible to a predetermined amount of gold from the outset. This will bridge the link to the physical world via 24/7 convertibility (using exchangers and even gold ATMs now in some places).  Additionally, it would benefit from the relative stability of gold that everyone understands.By delinking the medium of exchange function from the store of value function,this strategy would also exploit the "scarcity" token feature of bitcoin in a positive way (because, yes scarcity is different on the Internet). Prepare for parallel bitcoin economies. These guys let you get into the system with VISA and MC: http://centregold.ca/....also, their fees are even lower if you fund with Amex.....you just have to look around at the various 800+ exchangers out there.....a good starting point is the approved exchanger list at Liberty Reserve.
