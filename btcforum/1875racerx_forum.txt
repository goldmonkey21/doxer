I submitted the required paper work to the ATO for private ruling on the 06/12/13. At some stage I will want to sell some Bitcoins and wire the money to an Australian account. It will be over  AU$10k so it will be flagged/recorded, hence I need to know how it will be viewed by the ATO. Rulings are binding for 12 months, even if other general rulings are made to cover that area after the private ruling is provided. I want to know what my tax obligations are so I can calculate a sell price that leaves me with an acceptable figure.I will keep this thread updated as things progress. So I have spoken with a number of decent Australian accountancy firms and they could provide no clear guidance on the subject. I spoke with the ATO yesterday and they were very helpful, but also could not give me an answer. They said I need to submit a private ruling form and go from there.I'm going to fill the form out and see what they say. It is binding for 12 months from the ruling date. I am more interested though on how much tax I will need to pay on btc withdrawals... So... where are we with the CCCB and the ATO?I've been consulting with a well respected tax firm (who have also sought information from a variety of other sources) and at present they cannot offer me any solid answer on how the ATO think btc->fiat transactions will be viewed.  They recommend if I was to cash out any btc to hold $46% in a term deposit and wait until May the following year (deadline for accountant submitted tax returns) and hope that the ATO has a decision before then... if they go down he CGT route then only pay 23%.Anyone else got anything more solid? Get on IRC, #mtgox on freenode and make some noise... that will get things moving for you. Rattus: thx for pasting the transcript... saved me doing it.Eurotrash: I don't get the pic even though I'm quoted above it! Can you please explain it for me I also wanted to add that I discovered there was another line to my support chat transcript before Nancy disconnected  that I didn't se but was included in the ticket update later. Seems the session dropped... Nancy 12:51:Sorry for that. Right now we would not be able to provide ETANancy 12:51:Are you there?Nancy has left the room yup, I didnt even factor in new fees at another exchange. will be around $1k for me too. That is is I can get them on support again to release my funds. Totally outrageous. Going to cost me ~US$450 in commission to keep converting this stuff around to try and exit. Wait another 2 weeks?... FFS! Got thru to chat.... then she left without any warning...Nancy has joined the roomNancyWelcome to Mt.Gox Live Chat SupportracerxAccount txfrracerxHi NancyNancyHello racerxNancyHow could i assist you today?racerxI would like to discuss #****** with you a bit further please.racerxI have been involved in a number of community discussions and have grave concerns about my "confirmed" transactionsNancyCould you please wait till I check on thisracerxas it seems I am one of many many individuals who cannt get a firm update on the status of withdrawalsNancyThe withdrawals are in queue to be processedracerxOk, it has been 20 days in the queue now. When I first spoke with you it was indicated that I should wait a week to see the transaction processed.racerxThen after a week you indicated that I would need to wait 2 weeks...NancyThe increased volumes of withdrawals has made it difficult for our bank to process the transactions smoothly and within a timely manner, which has created unnecessary delays for our global customers.NancyOur team is working hard to increase transaction speeds, but there is approximately a two-week back-log we need to overcome.racerxyou blamed the hiatus on USD transactions as causing this delay, though the Official statement from MtGox says that ONLY USD transactions were affected, and other currencies were processed as usual.racerxNow it has been 20 days...NancyIt will take a few weeks to get back to normalracerxA few weeks more than the few more it has already been? Can you see my cause for concern?racerxTHere are wide reports that many users have been waiting months already! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=179586.320racerxHow quickly can you return the funds to my mtgox account so I can convert to btc and leave?NancyConfirm us to cancel the withdrawals so intantly the funds will be in your mt gox accountracerxI had them in USD, paid a commission to convert to BTC then to AUD to work around the hiatus... now I have to pay you again to convert back to BTCracerxThis is an unworkable situation... can you pleas supply me with an accurate time estimate for the withdrawalNancySorry for that. Right now we would not be able to provide ETANancy has left the room So I have been waiting 20 days now for 3 separate international wire withdrawals to be processed. I have a ticket open with support and at first told a week to process (AUD), then after a week told 2 weeks and now the ticket is not being responded to at all. I'm really getting concerned here waiting for my $$ to land :/ Am I ever going to see real money back? Anyone getting any $ out of MtGox recently? thx. couldn't find those from the main page... /me smacks head.Mods plz delete thread.

Im really getting concerned here waiting for my $$ to land :/Anyone else have any withdrawals pending or issues with support? 840 isnt too bad really.I was getting ~320000 with any -f from 1->30 but cpu was spiraling out of control. I changed it to -f40 and now load is a steady .4 with a hash rate of ~318000. Things seem much more stable like this.I also watched gpu temp and fan speed closely for a while. GPU temp was flucuating from 89c->92c with a fan speed of 40%->55%. I ended up setting it to 65% and GPU temps have leveled at 75C->76.5c.. with a 1c rise in 1 hour. Not sure what the best speed it going to be, but 90c is a little to hot for my liking. Hi!Just hooked up my new HD6970 to the pool  Code:racerx@fry:~/Downloads/poclbm$ ./poclbm.py -u xxx --pass=xxx -o mining.bitcoin.cz -p8332 -f2 -w256 -v -d016/02/2011 16:25:52, b7402f1a, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:25:56, 38b477ca, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:26:03, d518754b, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:26:15, bee6b69d, invalid or stale             16/02/2011 16:26:22, 4df8f54a, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:26:32, dc3e84ae, accepted                     309385 khash/sWith a bit of O/C ing Im up at 320,000khash/s nowWhat are the splits for pooled mining? Will I get exactly my share of each payout based on my CPU/GPU contribution?  (minus the donation of course)?Just wondering If I'm better going it alone for the time being.. or is it going to be identical?  Take it the unofficial over-clocking stuff enabled you to go higher than 840mhz?Im getting ~320000khash/s now at 840Mhz, but cant push it any higher than that.  Have you generated coins in linux with this card? I have an HD6950 with extra shaders unlocked.odgc shows a max peak range of 840.. is there any way to push this up more?Code:root@fry:~# aticonfig --odgcDefault Adapter - AMD Radeon HD 6900 Series                             Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    810           1250             Current Peak :    810           1250  Configurable Peak Range : [500-840]     [1250-1325]                 GPU load :    99%I set it to 840Code:root@fry:~# aticonfig --odsc=840,1250Default Adapter - AMD Radeon HD 6900 Series                   New Core Peak   : 840                  New Memory Peak : 1250root@fry:~# aticonfig --odccClocks persisted for the Default Adapter - AMD Radeon HD 6900 Series and get an extra 10,000khash/s but I'm curious how to push it outside this range. Seems possible in windows.Also, does anyone know how to set fanspeed back to auto?Code:aticonfig --pplib-cmd "set fanspeed 0 auto"seems to just turn the fan off.. Ok, after a bit of a struggle I have my 6950 up and running.Used grinders mod procedure to unlock the xtra shaders. Worked great thank you I tried to follow the steps detailed here but using the ppa drivers just didn't work. aticonfig/catalyst couldn't detect the card and I couldn't move on. I tried the stock ubuntu fglrx modules as well and nothing would work on a clean 10.10 installI then  followed these steps to install the drivers direct from amd, and after a reboot the card was detected properly.I then jumped back to the first link again, but substituted stream 2.3 for 2.1. I couldnt get 2.1 to work with poclbm. Diablo said here not to use the ati download drivers, and that I would need stream 2.3... so I dont know what the right answer is really.pyopencl compiled nicely, and I've been running polcbm connected to slush's pool all afternoon.. ended up with a small room heater next to my feet now ~310000khash/s-w of 64 128 and 256 don't make any noticeable change -v jumped it from ~260000khashs/s to ~310000khashs/s-f2 is what Im using as the PC is a spare server and not needed for a gui.Im going to start bumping the clock speed as per this thread here and will report back.Anyone else running 6950's with input? Im not sure if I'm using the correct driver versions (stream 2.3 & catalyst 11.2) but I guess if its stable and generating enough hashs's then its probably ok.. What are other 6950's getting?Im new to the pool mining too, Im seeing this, but no coins yet... all normal?Code:racerx@fry:~/Downloads/poclbm$ ./poclbm.py -u xxx --pass=xxx -o mining.bitcoin.cz -p8332 -f2 -w256 -v -d016/02/2011 16:25:52, b7402f1a, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:25:56, 38b477ca, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:26:03, d518754b, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:26:15, bee6b69d, invalid or stale             16/02/2011 16:26:22, 4df8f54a, accepted                     16/02/2011 16:26:32, dc3e84ae, accepted                     309385 khash/s Yes, I missed the username THanks for clearing that all up. You do realise that my link links to the download you posted... and the link you posted links back to my link?Its the same download pack, and the php mod firmware is the same as the one in the batch file! Just read thru this thread and am still a little confuse on versions required.1. What version of stream is required? 2.1 only?  2. Does stream need to be V2.1 for linux too?3. 10.11 catalyst driver needed for windows?4. What ati drivers are needed for linux?Im finding it hard to find a clear walkthru or setup options for this miner... can anyone help?Thanks!  This link may also be helpful for some more info:http://www.techpowerup.com/articles/overclocking/vidcard/159I have a 6950 on route today. Will report back here.So what client are you running / what OS and what drivers versions etc?Cheers!
