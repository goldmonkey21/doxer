There is a guy on uk ebay trying to perpetrate fraud as a KNC reseller. One of his ebay id's is jonow101 (he has at least two, this is the only one I can find) and knc resellerid=330. Lying about having made pre-orders, lying about the cost, offering paypal bribes to people placing orders through his reseller link, pretending he can guarantee delivery dates in September for orders that have not been places yet, claims to have close links with KNC and people should ring KNC to confirm his "authenticity". This guy is parasitic vermin. This is all I'm going to say. Follow it up at your leisure KNC - if you want to.  Price?
