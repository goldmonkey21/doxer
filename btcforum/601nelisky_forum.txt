Well, the day arrived, but I'm going to postpone a bit since there was almost no action on DR. For those that are unable to access funds due to the lack of a public ripple client you may want to take a look at https://github.com/jatchili/minimalist-ripple-client which is not visually polished and you really need to know what you are doing but does allow for a simple method of sending your funds to DR for redeeming.In a couple of days we'll take the patient off life support, so let us know if you are having trouble. Unfortunately part of the backend decided to quit early, a hardware failure that we can't fix immediately. In all probability there'll be a week long delay because of this, so please don't redeem your funds until we have this covered.If you already did it's not really a problem, it'll just be picked up once the system is operational again, of course.I'll update everyone as soon as there's more information. I'll step away. The price is very close to the refurbished price, and would still make sense given the fact they are mint or close but only with the paper trail. I bow out and let others take it, but thanks for the quick reply! I'll take the lot if you can provide the phones in advance (or we can meet), delivery to the UK (where I assume the phones are), if you can provide me with a copy of the original invoice your company was issued. It has not been an easy decision, but complete lack of interest in DR added to running costs in both time and money forced us to pull the plug on it.There are still client funds lodged with us, so we're giving another 4 weeks of uptime to allow everyone to withdraw, after which the service will have to come down. Assuming funds are still left behind there will be another period of 2 more months (so, September 5) where any eventual funds will be held and we'll return them to those that prove to be the rightful owners, and finally if any funds are still with us we'll take ownership of them.We'd like to thank everyone for the support they've given along the way, and perhaps soon we'll come up with a better version of this service and give it another go, time permitting!Let us know of any issues or questions and we'll do our best to address them. DividendRippler now supports the new Stellar core, and you can read all about upgrading your old stellar account registered with us here.Also, since there are no transfer fees on Stellar any more, we've removed transfer fees from Ripple too, meaning that bar mandatory fees on the crypto currencies, we are completely frictionless. This will change soon as we implement a fee schedule that works with both Stellar and Ripple, but for now we're as close to free as possible Let us know of any problem you may have. I've been trying out CLAM and while keeping the client always open (on OSX) with an expected reward time of 17~22 hours, I got 3 CLAMs since the 21st, so 7 days ago. The thing is, I got the 3 within 12 hours and haven't got any since. I know variation is expected, but how much of it is normal? Thanks! So not black and white, as the supreme administrative court proposed that the swedish court should reply vat exempt, it didn't rule that it is vat exempt. It doesn't prevent any EU state to locally overrule that proposal but it does provide some guidance when local tax agencies start procrastinating to avoid making a decision, so that's great. Care to point me to where you got that information from? I would really appreciate it! Can you point me to an exchange with any significant volume? Or a forum thread that shows any activity? I searched for a while and failed (though I'm always doing 10 things at once, so take it with a grain of salt). Original DividendRippler announcement here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=180717.0Right now DividendRippler supports BTC / LTC / NMC / DASH / TRC / XRP / STR, serving as gateway for Ripple and Stellar. Of course Alts come and go, but there's a reason for each of these, except Terracoin. This was added because, well, it was one of those "why not?" moments, to be honest, and right now TRC is all but dead so we want to remove it from the supported Alt list, which means getting people to redeem all TRC credits they have within a time frame.This post is the initial request for comments, so if you feel strongly one way or another, please let us know. Shameless plug here; if you need a ripple gateway for cryptocurrencies then https://dividendrippler.com might be what you are looking for  It has undergone a healthy number of updates and rule changes across the years, and, time permitting, I'm always available to make it better. The thing is there's a real effort in keeping this thing working, and if it get abandoned by users it is just wasted time. When it first started there was quite a bit of volume to it, of course, but then came competition, lots and lots and lots of it and even if I think I did it better than others, these others are *much* better than me at PR and publicity (I suck there), so as new users came and gone, taabl was all but forgotten.I may try to put some effort in once more, we'll see  What exactly do you mean "a sort of jackpot website"? Talk about a necrobump It did go down for real, back in 2011, but came back with a slightly different set of rules. Now, many updates later, it has become all but abandoned, despite my poor attempts at getting people interested again.As such this historic service, the first ever automated bitcoin lottery, will likely go down soon. But it had a good run  It's going up, 0.30 BTC now There's almost 0.25 BTC up for grabs in BTC's Pick4 at TAABL right now! And... it's gone. Congrats to the winner! There's still very little volume around TAABL but slowly and surely someone's getting the higher hand (and it isn't me, honest  ). Almost 0.15 BTC on the Pick 4...  Tsquared: Yes, something was wrong. The web frontend and the processing system are separate for security and the backend side experienced a bunch of network outages from late last night to this morning (UTC).But all bets were processed and handled and the web UI is once again linked to the processing side of things. I have now seeded all BTC games again.Good luck!
We are back!And not a moment too soon, this little software bug fix turned into a full blown hardware update due to some unexpected failures... But we're back and better than before underneath the hood.All running games have been matched against all blocks that passed since we went down, and of course all of them ended. I'm pleased to say I didn't win everything Thanks for everyone's patience, and let the betting begin... again!Best of luck to all. We are back!It was a tale of pain and suffering, pretty much everything that could fail has done so, and Murphy would be oh, so proud. But things should now be almost completely back to normal. Almost because I'm leaving the payments in manual mode while I do a few more checks, but assuming nothing bad happens we will be back to full auto by tomorrow.Thanks for all the patience, people, we really appreciate your support of DR! Oh where to start... We're really close but we've had a few mishaps, including failed hardware in the process. This has been the most ridiculous database resync I've ever experienced, ever!So close now... Ok, so certainly everyone noticed we're not up yet... We're still here, and we're still waiting. I don't dare do any more predictions as to how long this will take but we're optimised the code as far as we could and and now I/O limited. We're fixing that too all the while the rebuild is in progress.A little more patience is still required, sorry for he major inconvenience. Everything is still in full lock down mode, apologies to everyone. The time scale involved forced me into hardware and system upgrades, and damn, the bitcoin blockchain is huge!Hopefully this resync will complete tomorrow, but since my estimates have failed miserably thus far I'll just have to ask for a bit more patience. The problem is that the further we go into the blockchain, the more transactions there are to process which basically means my time estimation was biased towards smaller blocks of data. And we are supporting 5 different blockchains...I will let everyone know once we return to normality, and again sorry for this mishap. Never worry! It will be processed as if nothing had happened, only a bit later. Good luck! Unfortunately I just found a bug in our chain processing code (not the DR code, but the one that stores all the blockchain data for use in our multiple services).Nothing really major but still needs to be fixed asap, and given the volume of information it is going to take a few hours to do. All transactions will be processed once that's done.Sorry about that, but it really must be done now. Unfortunately I just found a bug in our chain processing code (not the game code, but the one that stores all the blockchain data for use in our multiple services).Nothing really major but still needs to be fixed asap, and given the volume of information it is going to take a few hours to do. All bets will be processed once that's done.Sorry about that, but it really must be done now. Well, first off I'd like to thank everyone for the kind words. But I feel there's some disclosure lacking; this is one of the first bitcoin games created, and granted the original rules were different but still it hardly is a novelty. The problem is our skill lay on the technical development, not on the UI or advertisement, so the game lost all visibility when others began creating copies of copies of copies of games.We also run a dice site, one that suffers from the same issues as TAABL, as in UI is less than perfect and we don't do any organised advertisement. On the other hand it is not a copy of any other dice game and has the needed edge to make it separate from everyone else (and yes, it is also several years old). We're finishing an upgrade on that one and you'll hear about it soon  It looks like it was just me and Tsquared again, but lo and behold... I did not win this time around!Congrats to the winner of almost 1 BTC (though if that's really Tsquared most of it came from you anyway  ), and lets get this ball running again, shall we? I honestly thought the rules were simple enough, so sorry if it seems complicated.Choose your game, you'll probably be looking at the Pick 4 in BTC since that's the one having a large pot. The address for the game is right next to the game name: 1Amn26jeimKzM22F66MHxYG3Q8hjE8XTCCEach bet costs 0.001 (on Pick 4 specifically) so just send that or a multiple thereof to the address.It really is that simple...If there is something you don't understand it would help me if you could state exactly what you don't understand so I can fix that on the OP.What do you mean "the site looks rough"? (honest question) Is is the plain looks or is the organisation of the information misleading?Besides the OP here, there's also the How To Play page that has a very indepth explanation of the site's workings. That is confusing if you don't know what you are looking at, granted, so any help in making a simpler explanation is greatly appreciated... Should I put Tsquared rules in the OP? Would that help? Yeah, the simplified rules sound correct, Tsquared.As for me being lucky, I must say there's a first for everything... I usually lose my shirt on luck based games, to be honest, but maybe it's because I'm playing as the House, not as myself I'll send the promised 100 bets now to Pick 4. Pick 2 ended with me winning again, I have sent the resulting 0.638 to the Pick 4.I'll wait for others to bet before I do any personal betting of my own, to avoid winning before people had a fair chance of placing their bets. Well, they say we should respect everyone's opinion... But I'm curious, why do you say this lottery is really hard to win? Are you basing that on math (where any bet on the Pick 2 has 1 in 256 chances of winning) or just saying what you heard others say without really paying attention?Lotteries are incredibly hard to win... state lotteries, that is. The odds are just crazy small, and the only reason prizes are anything to look at is because lots and lots of people bet on them. Of course, the only reason people bet on them is because the prizes are huge... full circle But not our lottery, the odds are fair and the prizes are relatively low, but that shouldn't make it lose interest, it is a fun way to gamble. This is starting to get interesting, that much is granted...We should, however, probably move to the Pick 3 or even Pick 4, since I'm placing over 30% of the bet space for the Pick 2 with the accumulated seed and that'll likely match as soon as someone places a second bet (or in this case I'm the second bet).With a Pick 3 there is a total bet space of 4096, and the 0.445 that I'm placing as bet will represent a little over 10% of the possible bets, slightly better. On top of that bets are cheaper.A Pick 4 has a total bet space of 65536, so 0.445 will represent less than 1% AND there are 100 bets I already placed there previously (as a personal bet, no reseeds if I win from those  ).Since Tsquared is responsible for almost all the extra seed I'm betting back I'll delegate to him to decide if we should move to another game (assuming I win again, otherwise it's moot).EDIT:Nope, I had forgotten I already won the Pick 4 and reseeded with 10 bets. Ok, if we move to either Pick 3 or Pick 4 and that won't raise objections I'll add 100 personal bets on either, but if I win I'll keep the profits  Full disclosure on the seed transactions so everyone always knows if the house wins. It is true, I won once more. Bets on the way, good luck! All you need to do is click refresh every once in a while  We don't have auto updates to the pages (yet) and you will not receive a feedback transaction if you lose, since you placed less than the minimum bets for feedback on that particular game (4).Also, if you lose, don't be discouraged as we'll keep betting all proceeds from this initial seeding we did until someone else takes the cake!EDIT: And, of course, good luck! Almost 0.37 BTC up for grabs at TAABL! It was very popular when it first appeared, and kept being popular for a long time.Part of the problem was that we never advertised outside the basic forum thread, and when we started we were alone, or almost. It was a novel idea and that has a pull.But then the dice game fever came, TAABL kept on being popular but most people prefer the rapid feedback games. We also did our own dice game, but since we don't like to clone, we prefer to try new things, we did an automated strategy dice site, which is currently being updated and upgraded. But again we never advertised outside the forum threads.So, if I had to guess, the problem is not the game itself but the fact 100 new games come out every week, clones of clones of clones, with shiny logos and add campaigns... wonder if we'll have to do the same thing?Anyway, great to see you haven't given up on getting your bets back . I didn't bet the full bankroll on the last Pick2 by mistake, still have 11 bets to push, so I'll do that now. This time around you should get a transaction if winning (of course  ) or losing, the latter of 5502 satoshis. After thinking a bit about the feedback on bet lost issue, and even though that's going to take a large stab at the potential profit the house makes, I do think it is something that is needed otherwise people will just forget about the picks they've placed bets on.I've made the following change to the payout system; If more than X bets are placed from the same address (same transaction always counts as 1 address, but multiple transactions using coin control and the same base address will also work) a feedback amount will be sent so signal a lost bet to that address.The amount will depend on the currency, for BTC it is 5500 satoshis plus the number of digits matched in the particular pick, so 5502 for Pick 2.I have only enabled this for Pick 2 in BTC, and the minimum bets is 4. This number makes sure we don't end up paying more than it was collected on the Pick.All the other Picks will be updated to include feedback payments and you'll know that is enabled by the new column in the main page Pick list, left to the Complete column.
Yeah, dust is no longer possible, most servers will refuse transactions below 0.00005460 BTC (specific to bitcoin). To pay above that value for signalling losses plus the tx fee would mean we'd lose more than what we were getting with the house fee, not a sustainable business model  For those distracted, I won the BTC Pick 2 again, all proceeds are back as bets. Hehe, the real win would be to get people betting on the site, but you being the only one simply means you'll end up in profit, no matter what  And by popular request, DividendRippler now supports XRP.dr on Stellar and STR.dr on Ripple!Given our account-less approach to the gateway, using this feature may get a little complicated, though we'll try our best to explain and we are open to ideas on simplifying things, of course.To deposit XRP.dr on your stellar account you need to send XRP from your Ripple client to the Ripple DR account, rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX, using the destination tag of your Stellar account.To redeem XRP to your ripple account you need to send XRP.dr from your Stellar client to the Stellar DR account, gGpaZHzrhF4aX7Kz7BWeR7fSY7zCP7Vwoy, using the destination tag of you Ripple account.For example:Ripple account: rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwptRipple destination tag: 100000102Stellar account: g9R9BQomihMVt1mhthhqoMZWvNX6FqgtJ4Stellar destination tag: 100061109Issuing XRP to the stellar account: From Ripple client send XRP to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=100061109, XRP.dr will be received at g9R9BQomihMVt1mhthhqoMZWvNX6FqgtJ4.Redeeming XRP.dr from the stellar account: From Stellar client send XRP.dr to gGpaZHzrhF4aX7Kz7BWeR7fSY7zCP7Vwoy?dt=100000102, XRP will be received at rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt.Issuing STR to the ripple account: From Stellar client send STR to gGpaZHzrhF4aX7Kz7BWeR7fSY7zCP7Vwoy?dt=100000102, STR.dr will be received at rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt.Redeeming STR.dr from the ripple account: From Ripple client send STR.dr to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=100061109, STR will be received at g9R9BQomihMVt1mhthhqoMZWvNX6FqgtJ4.Lets go build these markets! And as always, let us know of any issues. Another Pick 2 that was won by yours truly, another reseed.Good luck! That was fast. I won the Pick 3 and placed the 10 seed bets again. Also placing a new personal 100 bets, but this time on Pick 4, which should take a little longer to match, although the Pick 3 was only 2.7% filled and still matched way faster than expected. While we're at it I'm going to place a personal bet on Pick 3 of 0.1 BTC. Since this is the 2nd transaction on that Pick the game will start following blocks and a match will close the game, so this is everyone's chance of getting in the action for as low as 0.001 BTC! Heh, yes, if it keeps being just you betting you are sure to win eventually. Right now you'll have an almost 50% chance, so good luck! While it is still TAABL vs Tsquared, we won again and all the proceeds were once again placed as bets on the new lottery. We'll keep this betting scheme going until someone else wins, of course  Another bump for awareness, there are many bets just waiting to be won If we keep winning the Pick games, we keep betting on them with the funds won, so it is just a matter of time until someone takes the cake! More transparency on DividendRippler, a sum up of all the available funds is now shown at the new Funds page.Addresses are provided for the hot, cold, ripple and stellar wallets so you can verify the veracity of the shown values at any time. User addresses are not disclosed (though they are available if you do the leg work) but values scattered there are regularly consolidated into the hot and  cold wallets.Remember this is a snapshot balance and may not be exactly matching the current wallets, but it is updated hourly and should provide a bit more confidence in DR's handling of funds if more confidence is needed.Cold wallet funds are moved in a completely manual fashion so now you can also see if your redeem will be immediate or will have to wait for funds to be thawed.As always, let us know of any requests or complains and thank you for your business! Damn3d just sent me another account which I verified is working. Hopefully this one will last a little longer  but at any rate he did come through to help so that's that, no more complains from me. DividendRippler is once again fully automated!Stellar support is also out of 'beta' mode and fully functional.As always please let us know of any issues.PS: Off-topic, but we'd like to state that The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery is up and running and any eventual profits we get from it are used to help further the development and maintenance of DR, so if you like to gamble on the crypto currencies do have a go there, and good luck! I bought one such account a little over a month ago, worked fine at first, didn't use it for a week or two and when trying again I get a 'username or password error'...Tried to PM Damn3d yesterday but got no reply so I'm posting here as a mild warning to prospective buyers. Not crying wolf yet, will update as things progress. The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery, despite its name, also supports LTC and has been given a fresh update a few days ago: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=974159.0We have seeded all the games in all currencies so why not try your luck? It is the longest running game in the bitcoin ethos!Might be worth adding to your list, I think  Well, I won again.Reseeding the Pick 2, this time with 12 bets. C'mon guys and gals (and things?), place your bets!Good luck. I'm not sure I understand your question... what is happening with ripple, the service, or with XRP, the ripple currency/token system? The latter is probably just speculators overreacting over BTC price change against USD, I guess.As for the former, is there something I missed? Thank you!But regarding "ripplecoin" as you call it, have a glance at my previous post. That's not at all what DR is about, XRP and STR are subproducts and frankly or little impact to the service we're offering. Well, that's not a small task at all Ripple and Stellar are IOU issuing systems, I think it's the best description for them. They both are the brain children of Jed McCaleb, the original creator of MtGox (yes, I know that's not the best vouch for a person, but he sold it to those who made a mess), Stellar being a clone of sorts  of Ripple. Their best use? A great distributed trading platform.But keep in mind they are centralised systems, so all funds you deposit to DR are held by DR, from which you get IOUs issued to your Ripple or Stellar account that can then be transferred or traded.There are a lot of neat things about Ripple and Stellar, like the fact currencies are fungible, so if you hold USD from bitstamp and send to someone that only trusts snapswap, if there is a user holding balance and trust on both you can actually send USD.bitstamp to that user and have the USD.snapswap be delivered to your recipient, automatically.Stellar doesn't support this yet, I believe, but Ripple also allows for you to send something, say BTC to someone even if you don't have BTC, by using for example DRK and trading it automatically for BTC before sending. It has a lot of possibilities and features. Most people, when thinking about Ripple or Stellar think about their own currencies, XRP and STR, even though these are not real currencies, rather tools in the system, and there is really no point in comparing them to BTC, DRK, etc, imho.If you trade or need to transfer funds easily across currencies these systems are really worth a look, but they aren't altcoins or anything of the sort.I find it hard to try and explain what all the fuss is about, as it took me many days to have my aha moment and seeing the possibilities, but do read around and if you have any specific question I can help with let me know. <shameless plug>How do you feel about lotteries? TAABL also supports DRK now and the eventual profits are used for the continued development of DividendRippler which incidentally also supports DRK now </shameless plug>
AAAAND...I won. Tsquared second bet wasn't in yet so it got pushed to the new Pick 2 and I've proceeded to seed this new game with the same 10 bets.Now, if it keeps just being the two of us and I keep pushing all my earnings back it is pretty much certain eventually Tsquared will win. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but here's hoping others join the action These Pick 2 games are really fast, they'll easily hit multiple times a day, whereas Pick 3 are still fast, but a bit less so. Pick 4 will likely run for multiple days/weeks unless there's a lot of placed bets.  The bet determination works as follows: a) first choice is number of satoshis sent trimmed to max bet size. For Pick 2 there are 256 possible values (0x00 to 0xff, or 0 to 255) so since you sent no satoshis the default bet is 0x00 b) if (a) is taken (it was) try the the first 2 characters from the bet transaction id (as it is a pick 2), in your placed bets case that's [bd]0f60... c) if (b) is taken add 1 to it (so 0xbd would become 0xbe) d) if (c) is taken go back to (c), wrapping as needed e) if there are more than one bet in the transaction step (c) will move to the next X characters (it would be bd[0f]60... in your case, but you only sent one)This way you can always verify that the bets are real and we're not cheating, even though it sounds a bit confusing at first. As for your 0.01 bet the numbers will be calculated like this: a) 00 is taken b) [55]cef7... is free, first bet 55 b) 55[ce]f7... is free, second bet ceUnless of course another transaction get included in a block before yours (or first in the same block) and it just happens to cover one or both of your predicted bets, in which case for each one c) would add 1 to the bet until an empty slot is found.That, as well as an explanation for the bet placing algorithm is explained in the How To Play page, but I'm aware it is a little vague and needs much improvement. In theory sending .012 is the same as sending .01 plus 200000 satoshis for bet selection (which is still 00 for a Pick 2).So if you send 0.012 you get two bets and we get a 0.002 donation (Thanks!  ), but if you send it by mistake just get in touch with us and we'll get you the extra funds back.Hope that answered all your questions but if not just let me know. Oh, and good luck! Bump for awareness... There are 10 bets placed on each game on each currency, and if I do win any of these bets I'll be sure to reseed the game. I'm trying to send a Litecoin transaction using python-trezor and I'm getting the exact same error. Looking at the trezor-mcu code I find that it is sent here: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu/blob/master/firmware/signing.c#L349 but I didn't debug it to understand what is going on. Could be a byte order thing or I just didn't put the right prev_hash to start with, not sure.For reference I'm sending the only output of this tx: https://bchain.info/LTC/tx/3635c6b4ddb52a669a5db11e1a599d9149f18e803c178653c05d9e804afa4f57So I do a TxInputType(address_n=client.expand_path(path to LS7CBRe81UbZJLjMG5p7gLB3DbgV2rNZ5q), prev_hash=binascii.unhexlify('3635c6b4ddb52a669a5db11e1a599d9149f18e803c178653c05d9e804afa4f57'), prev_index=0) which I guess is what I'm supposed to provide, but in my obvious diagonal reading of both python-trezor and trezor-mcu, it looks like the comparison is being make with the txhash of the first input of that transaction (though I may be completely off-base here, I'll have to compile trezor-mcu myself to add some debugging if no help comes my way)Any clues or pointers?EDIT: I finally found the problem I was having and it goes down to a bug in python-trezor's tx_api.insight_url. Well, maybe it doesn't reflect on every OS the same way but doing Decimal(value_as_float) is very dangerous and error prone in python, so I'll be getting a pull request ready. Thanks for the heads up, we had a runaway log that nuked the server's disk space, all fixed now.As for the signature campaign, that could work but I have a hard time convincing myself to take that road. It's just too... commercial, I guess. I don't mind spending money to make money but it just feels like I'm advertising my sites the same way most scams/schemes are, just feels gooey.And if we must take down taabl we will, though it is a shame to do it since this is as much of a piece of bitcoin history as you'll ever get, and any profit that comes out of it will be to pay for other more important projects we have going, like DividendRippler. Funny you should say that We did, back in 2012 -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120239.0But again lack of publicity may have been a bad idea. There isn't lack of new stuff over you average dice site too, so innovation isn't the issue for sure  That's harsh...The games aren't played on merit alone, unfortunately. There's a lot that is publicity and we haven't done any, at all, ever, other than post in a single thread here and the odd plug here and there.This game was an experiment a long, long time ago and it did have a lot of interest back then, and then again in the second incarnation. Right now the bitcoin game scene is ridiculously filled with newcomers and copycats, but TAABL is not only original but also old. We actually had one BTC Pick 5 running for just short of a year and still paid it out, so while the past is no proof of the future, I'd say we earned some trust which is an issue with a lot of new sites.I'm sure that if we had 1000 regular bettors that would make the EV so good for the odd player that the game would be highly alluring, but it's just me at the moment, so it might simply not spur any interest, always a risk we take. Let me try to explain then. You send funds to one of the games, placing bets there.What are the exact bets you are placing? In order for us not to cheat and for the lottery to be completely provable we can't just assign you random bets, so there is a confusing algorithm that takes place but lets assume for now you don't care what the bets are, just how many.Every time a new block is found the hash of that block is used to see if there are winners. So if the block hash is "00000000000001d164de39e85839b49d68d55604415b264820de242cb3863f0e" the last X digits will be the winning bet.Say you are playing a Pick 3 and have placed a bet for "f0e", you'd win that round assuming the bet was placed at or before block 200002.If you have any specific doubts let me know and I'll try harder. All running TAABL games seeded with 10 bets each! The BTC bets took a long time as the transaction failed to be included in a lot of blocks (but then again it had no fee attached).No Pick will find a winner as long as there is a single transaction placing bets, regardless of the number of bets, so the seeding by itself will not be matched until new bets come in.And of course, good luck! Thank you! I'll keep that in mind until I'm using a newer release. Can someone enlighten me? I'm sending a few DRK from the qt wallet and while the wallet says it is online and sync'd and I didn't select InstantX when sending I get "Status: 0/offline (InstantX verification failed), has not been successfully broadcast yet". It's been some 15 minutes now and it might very well be something that resolves itself, but care to shed some light on what is happening?<shameless plug>I'm sending a few seed bets for TAABL, the original Bitcoin lottery which from today supports DRK too!https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=974159.0</shameless plug>EDIT:I'm still curious as to why it took so long, but it propagated and is already in a block now... The original Bitcoin lottery is back!And though it didn't go away in the first place, there was no actual public interest shown during 2014 and we didn't push for it as there were a bunch of backend changes that we wanted to get done, but now that much is complete and we're back in business.For those of you that played in the previous version of the lottery, the changes are subtle; no more paying dust values to the bets that didn't win and the crypto currencies supported have changed.For everyone else;The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery (TAABL for short) was the first automated bitcoin lottery, one of the first bitcoin games and almost certainly the longest running game in bitcoin history.The rules are simple: - Choose your game amongst the available crypto currencies, currently supported are BTC, LTC, NMC and DRK. From here there are multiple Pick sizes, and these differ in the number of characters that need to match on a block hash to become the winning bid. - Place your bids by sending funds to the address advertised for the game. Make sure you send from a wallet you control all addresses for, as the winning bid address is taken from the sent transaction address. - Wait for a block to match a bet on that Pick, hopefully it will be one of yours  All the details about the game can be read at How To Play. We have seeded all BTC games and will proceed to seed all the other currencies too, to make things a little more interesting. Still on the subject of the order book at DR, we've just added a button to flip the order book pair. Glad to, given I'm one of the people running it DR is very simply a gateway between a few chain based currencies (BTC, LTC, NMC, TRC and now DRK) and both Ripple and Stellar. Basically you can deposit any of the chain based currencies and have an IOU issued to you on either Ripple or Stellar, where you can send to others or use the ledger trading facilities.When you hold DR IOUs you can also redeem them, thus receiving the chain based currency.The name is a bit confusing as the original business model for DR was quite different, to be able to pay dividends using ripple with chain currencies (kind of stock profit distribution on steroids) but that never picked up, and the main business was just using it as a gateway, which is the only thing it is now.The usage is described in https://www.dividendrippler.com/howto and fees in https://www.dividendrippler.com/fees.If you have any specific question you can PM me or post it in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=180717.0 so as to not derail this thread. No one's interested in trading DRK on ripple / stellar using DividendRippler? That's disappointing...I did place a few bids for buying DRK with BTC, but while they where close to market then DRK has been going up. I would really like to buy some DRK there if anyone's game, and it helps keeping DR development up and running too  We've changed the view of the the order book on DividendRippler's home page, you now select the left side of the pair from the various DR issued currencies and get all the monitored counterparts thereof. The last selection you make is remembered.Let us know if you have any issues with it. DividendRippler now supports Darkcoin!Don't forget to add DRK trust lines on ripple if you want to redeem. Oh, and by the way, we now support Darkcoin!Don't forget to add DRK trust lines on ripple if you want to redeem. We are adding a new rule to DividendRippler that defines all failed transaction older than 180 days as abandoned, as explained in the How To Use page. Some of these are transactions from double spends that never made it into blocks, some are early tests and have no funds but some still are simple lacks of trust lines on ripple or redeems to chains for which there was no address set, and in the latter two cases we will collect these funds as fees of sorts.If you need help with a failed transaction please let us know and we'll do our best to sort things out! What about fees? Are zero fee transactions still gladly accepted or is there a fee schedule to follow? Also related to this, is there any dust transaction protection in place?
So Darkcoin, for the purposes of integrating it on Dividend Rippler behaves just like any other chain based currency, there are transactions that get put in blocks.But then there is InstantX, will this require any special processing on my part or is it just a layer above all else to say "you can trust this 0 conf transaction" yet still propagares de 0 conf tx via the common paths?Darksend I assume operates parallel to all this and is completely irrelevant for my purposes of processing ins and outs unless my own darkcoin daemon gets that feature turned on, right? I only need the 1 to run my tests, but once integrated I like to keep a non trivial amount of all currencies we trade in as a kind of "insurance" in the event something goes wrong and it is my fault Right now I'll be afk for a bit but as soon as I return I'll provide the address and we can discuss a larger amount to trade, ok? Can you tell me how many drk you'd have to sell, quote me a price you'd keep for an hour or so in whichever coins you'd like to trade in?Thanks! I only need fractions to test but it all depends on the rate, poloinex shows last price of btc 0.00106207, how many drk can I get at or below that price? Also, what coin would you take for your drk? That would also make a difference on how many drk I'd like to get.But all in all, I just need 1 DRK to start with. Hey guys, I'm integrating Darkcoin into Dividend Rippler and I need funds to do actual testing, and since I'd rather not have to register to some exchange I'm unfamiliar with I ask thee; who has some drk at a good rate to sell me for btc, ltc or nmc? Thanks for the feedback, and yes we are considering adding darkcoin support. It is I, Leclerc... Ok, PM sent. Your post says the spotify accounts are legal, can you also state that the method you are using to buy them is legit? "I have my methods" doesn't quite equate to "I'm not doing anything illegal to obtain these"  Hmm, so for $1 in BTC one time payment you will pay for one (two?) spotify premium account, for ever? That's not a sustainable business model, assuming you do pay the $9.99 p/m is it?I really want to take you on this offer but I really wanted to understand how you can do this without using a stolen CC first  Sorry about that, there was a glitch on our side. Please confirm it is all correct now and let us know if there's anything missing still. And 3 weeks shy of 2 years running, we have a winner for the BTC Pick 5 game! Congratulations to the owner of 1NLGxRunq5MYR5YWQycRJKConHcpaBrUvk  who made 2.277 BTC out of the 0.1 bet made 16 months ago... I really hope the wallet still exists!There was a little trouble getting this one paid out as I haven't made any updates to TAABL or DiceOnCrack in quite a while and TAABL particularly was trying to send "signal" transactions to all betting addresses, in values of 1 to 5 satoshis each, which is now called dust and can't be propagated. This means that no signals are going out anymore, of course. It also means that I'll be doing some much needed updating to these sites if there is any interest in using them which, by the looks of it, there isn't If you enjoyed playing these games before or want to try them now, let us know!For those that haven't been around for that long, TAABL was one of the first bitcoin games to come to live and certainly the first automated bitcoin lottery. Of course many things have changed along the way and are bound to change more still, but it is a bit of bitcoin history nonetheless... DividendRippler now supports Stellar. Please be aware that Stellar support is still being tested and while we have done everything to make this as safe as possible there are still potential bugs. Also for the moment all DR transactions (not just those for involving Stellar) are being manually processed, so delays are to be expected. If all the above didn't scare you off  please do test the platform and let us know of any problem you might encounter! The recipient of the double send has stepped forward. Thanks! While I was pondering about removing the manual tx step, making it automated again, a screw up happened;It looks like for a reason I can't yet understand a double payment of 5 BTC.dr was sent to the ripple account rBRXcf7BYs2CN7GfAAXjLQPEh7d46BP9RE. Some links;https://www.dividendrippler.com/cd?_=548f0a0ab4688a549bbf18cfFirst send -> https://rippletrade.com/#/tx?id=4815FD9558BDE02C97CAF71327041DF5FD1182432FB678A02517A378ADA2B474Second send -> https://rippletrade.com/#/tx?id=33F11E7056C74AB4908F926AD96667ABBFDEB23AA1178B7ABB138759C93528B0It's our fault, though I'm still investigating why this happened, but even though 5 BTC is not a fortune it is almost the sum total of fees we've collected since the site started, so it would be great it the recipient could return that to us Sorry for the continued delays in releasing the transactions, and thanks for everyone's business! Not really. We will act as a gateway for each of them, which is obviously not the same thing. We might change this in the future but the approach we've taken is the simplest we could come up with, allowing users to register stellar addresses just like it is already done for ripple. Ripple's resource usage has decreased significantly with the continued development. Disk IO is still the largest bottleneck but that's just the nature of it. Stellar right now is like ripple was back in the day, huge, heavy and slow moving. I've been told by Jed they are doing a complete rewrite of the core to address all these shortcomings, we'll see what comes of it.Our target is to support both ripple and stellar. As it has been pretty obvious, DividendRippler has been lagging behind for the past 3 or 4 days. Our rippled instance has been struggling to keep up with the network for unknown reasons.What is not common knowledge is that we have been preparing a major update to DR behind the scenes for a few months and while it still lacks some testing we were waiting on the Stellar network to get stable (yes, Stellar support is part of the update) before finishing up and going live.Unfortunately the version of DR that is lagging behind (lets call it old version) depends on a not up to date version of rippled and does signing of transactions using RPC, so we can't really use external rippled servers securely, which is another part that got updated on the new DR version, so a decision had to be made; at the rate currently sustained it will take DR another 4 days just to retrieve the ledger history and there's no guarantee that history will not become corrupt like it has in the past, forcing us to start from scratch.The alternative is to get the beta quality new DR version live, and manually process transactions until we're sure it is safe. We wanted to make a full announcement with a timeline and all, but since DR isn't really working that's all moot, I'm just finishing up some QA and I'll get the new version live in a bit, after which I'll process all pending operations and hopefully things will return to normal.Once that's all taken care of we'll have a new post describing the visible changes that were made (though a lot of work has been put in stability and security, which you will not see). Our apologies for all the waiting for those of you with pending operations. For those of you on the higher notches of the "healthy paranoia" dial, we have changed the IP address for https://dividendrippler.com. It might take a day or two to propagate but most will be already seeing the new server @ 178.62.229.242 All gambling is based on luck, all gambling sites have odds in their favour thus you need more luck. I run diceoncrack.com which offers automated martingale strategies and I can't say the house always wins even though odds are slightly biased towards the house, but I can say the average is always positive for the house, as it has to be or there would be no house.There's this saying in poker that it's not about knowing when to bet, it's knowing when to fold. That is true, I believe, for all gambling and it is most certainly true here. You might walk out with a hefty profit but it is hard to not fall for the psychological trap where after a winning streak you believe that since you've been winning you'll continue to win... and that's where martingale is particularly unforgiving  There will be a scheduled downtime of DividendRippler Monday, November 3rd, at 20:00 UTC for 2 hours.
What exactly is not looking good, molecular? The site does go into offline mode every now and then but always comes back and catches up. http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238103Now we plummet? Should be all good now. It seems to be DONE now. Just to explain, PENDING is when it is still being processed, or it has been processed and the system is waiting for confirmation from the ripple network or coin chain. ERROR may or may not be fatal, meaning something went wrong. Some errors are automatically retried (such as when there's a high load on the server and ripple refuses to process transactions because it is too busy), while others need manual intervention.Thank you for your business! You'll need to start the client with -txindex=1 so it keeps an index of all transactions (and not just the ones involving your wallet). It will take some time to build the index first time you run it, and you'll also need to pass -reindex=1 that first time. You missed the oldest bitcoin lottery (are you including lottery sites?) at taabl.net, and while on the dice subject also diceoncrack.com, both being half abandoned by players but still fully operational.[edit] - I didn't mean to be stealthy or misleading, I am the coder behind both these sites so I'm not vouching for them as a neutral party, just calling attention to them. Might not be exactly what you are after but you can use Dividend Rippler to get LTC into ripple and trade for XRP (amongst any other currency others are willing to trade). DR isn't handling any of the exchange parts, though, it is a simple gateway. Sorry about the hiccup. Your transaction was sent to the ripple daemon, which is why the tx hash was present in the details page but then it was never confirmed (nor denied), which left it in a limbo state. I have resent it and I'll work on trying to prevent this from happening again.Thank you for your business and patience! Thank you A little trivia; I developed the first lottery site for bitcoins (waaaay back) called The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery, or TAABL for short, something that caught the eye of TTBit who requested a few changes to it, and we have been working together ever since. He eventually came up with the idea of DICEonCRACK and it did have a good success at the time.It's still ticking and I have plans to improve it, but the amount of attention it gets makes it a low priority since time isn't abundant. Both sites and an anonymous ripple bridge TTBit and myself run are linked in my signature. Hi,Did you send a wager that didn't get processed, or was it showing the 'wager processing for BTC is offline' message? To everyone suffering from the extended delays, we're really sorry about it. The system has a few safeguards that lock it when anything unexpected happens, and can only be unlocked manually after we review things. Add that to a complete lack of time I've had today and you have the reason for this last delay.Usually it is just losing sync with the ripple network, the resync process can take a few hours. Sorry for the delays. Everything should be processed now, it just takes a good while to resync sometimes. I'm assuming you didn't read my last reply... "this list" was an idea that never saw the light of day, really. Just offer your services in the Forum, I guess, and people will tell you what verification they deem needed, but be prepared to offer some real life data for any non-trivial amount. Nice necro-bump This idea of mine never picked up so this is likely a bad place to seek such service. I'm afraid I can't offer much advice either, but the Forum is full of escrow offers, just make sure you are careful and do a little investigation of your own on the chosen member history before sending anything! DividendRippler does not allow for trading, it is a gateway. In order to use it you need to have a funded account, thus you'll need some XRP to boot. If you want to buy XRP with BTC from DR you can only do this after your account gets the initial funding, I'm afraid.There are many giveaways on https://ripple.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=17 and help for newbies is offered extensively at https://ripple.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=5. Particularly https://ripple.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2034 might be a good place to get your initial XRP if you are ready to pay back the offer to someone else once you get funded.

So... I'm usually news agnostic as it makes very little difference to me in the short run (I'm in it for the long run), and thus I don't keep myself up to date or attentive at all but this seems too obvious to be a coincidence;- China says "bitcoin probably alright", price jumps ten fold- China decides they're through buying USD (read it somewhere, might have read it wrong)- China says "bitcoin is somewhat illegal, you have a short timespan to get out", everyone sells, price dropsNow, if it was me I would say 'China says' is a great market direction trigger, and if I were China (govmnt) I would buy as it drops (sure, it's illegal... for the common people) and then by CNY say "good news, bitcoin's probably alright again", thus re-inflating all the coins bought cheap.Is it not just a tad bit too obvious? Yeah, I'm probably just confusing things. I could just write a simple python library wrapping the NXT api and use my own client for the sending and receiving. Can you share the exchange API, the methods not included in the default client? Would this be a good alternative to anyone needing to interface with NXT as a service? Or is this just an exchange interface (no simple 'send from this account to that account')?
Ok, fair enough. But the reason I made this confusion was:So, is this weight a 'how much the network should trust tis node'? I just assumed 'part of the balance will be used' was pointing towards mining. Ok... Can you spare a few more words to explain what it is then? I feel like it is something terribly obvious given the lack of verbose explanations, but I honestly don't have a clue. Just to see if I understand hallmark, if I set it on a server that server will be "mining" on behalf of the hallmarked account without needing to unlock the account? How does one safely detect orphans?If I have the block at tip it will not have a 'nextblock', so checking 'nextblock' on that block's 'previousblock' will detect if it got orphaned, but what if the last two blocks get orphaned, i.e. a blockchain reorg? Is that even possible to happen in NXT?If all orphaned blocks get stripped of 'nextblock' then I can safely walk back until I find one that has that property, but with 2 orphans in a row will the older one still point to the next? Is there already a way to retrieve the last block without knowing its id? Every time I receive a transaction my client shows only the latest transaction value as balance. If I lock/unlock it shows 0. The 'time till you get a block' changes appropriately to the shown balance, as opposed to following what I actually have in that account.Is the actual block finding following the client's shown balance or is it still 'mining' as expected for the real balance in the account?I'll nuke the blocks file and restart to see if that fixes the balance, as it has in the past.[edit] restarting the server without any file changes did the trick to find the missing balance, but the 'time to block' is still 54 days where it was ~7 hours before the last tx was received. It is probably due to more people finding blocks, I guess (last one had a 196% base target, which I believe means more than half the coins where unlocked and finding blocks) API method request:- create unsigned transaction, to be signed elsewhere (similar to sendmoney without passphrase and returning the raw unsigned transaction?)- sign transaction, accepting a raw unsigned transaction, returning a raw signed transaction- broadcast transactions, accepting a raw signed transaction API method request: a way to get a list of transactions pending inclusion in blocks (a la bitcoind getmemorypool). chained transactions only prevent part of the problem. The real issue comes from showing bet results too early, allowing the losing bets to be double spent and only the winning ones going through untouched. The effort in BTC terms to orphan an already propagated block are high enough to accept a single confirmation on low value transactions. I'm just trying to get a feel on what would the equivalent be in NXT terms.So what does that mean for fees? Is the rule atm a flat  1 NXT per tx?What I was aiming for is as much independence from the client as possible, effectively implementing the code elsewhere. Thus creating the transaction using sendMoney would be great *if* I can get an unsigned raw tx, sign it in my code without using the ref client and then ask the client to propagate it. In other words, I need to ask the client for an unsigned transaction and I need to be told how signing is implemented so I can reproduce in my own code. Is any of this already available?I really need a description of the process, not an API. This is yet another thing I must have done without depending on the ref client. Is there any explanation of the algorithm used? I'm considering supporting NXT on dividendrippler.com, but I'm still wrapping my head around the protocol and implementation. If you could enlighten me, I'd like to know;- What's a safe number of confirmations for a transaction to be trusted. I would assume that there being one block per minute, and keeping with bitcoin's 1 hour rule that would be 60 for fair trust level, but for rapid transaction processing (such as in a gambling site) what would be the minimum number of transactions?- How are fees calculated? There's a 1NXT minimum fee per tx, if I read things correctly, but are there transaction size issues to be worried about? Block size?- I don't see in the API a way to get the equivalent to the memory pool, a list of transactions waiting inclusion. Can I get that somehow?- Can I work with raw transactions? I would particularly need to be able to sign transactions "offline".- Can I create accounts offline? I assume that we're talking about a simple double sha256 of the passphrase so what I'd need to do is create random passphrases and derive the account number from those? Will the network accept sending to any account address or is there any kind of "registration" message that needs to be propagated first?Thanks in advance! This is not the same sha advertised on the OP Unfortunately there's still a good deal about the ripple network and software that we're still learning to deal with, and the fact it is in rapid development doesn't help our case a bit. That said, the DR system was coded to default to manual intervention whenever there's any ambiguity in what the proper action is, and that's what happened to you (and others).But fear not, it was just waiting on us to be double safe. Let us know if there's any additional trouble. Having worked abroad (outside EU) for short periods of time I have experienced this, where even owning a house isn't enough to open a simple bank account. But since the EU has specific laws regarding their "common borders" I keep wondering what it would take. I could, in theory, move to any country within the EU and work there, regardless of living there or not. There should be no need to apply for full citizenship to accomplish this, but you may be completely right there, I could end up being taxed in my country of citizenship according to its laws regardless of where the income came from.Which, for this particular case, sucks. I know banks aren't forced to open accounts for non residents within the EU, even though EU citizens can move freely.I also read that in Germany if you hold on to your coins for at least one year, the profit from selling them is tax exempt.So I wonder... can a EU citizen that is not resident in Germany open a bank account in Germany, sell and deposit in said bank account taking advantage of the tax scenario described? When moving the money back to the residency country the EU double taxation prevention laws should prevent the local government from getting an extra cut, right?Maybe even move to Germany for a while, but what would constitute "moving"? Renting a house there? Getting a job?I've googled as much as I could but can't really understand how viable this course of action would be. Anyone out there has any insight on this matter? Yes, CCs are pretty awesome, but did you ever wondered why the CC companies agree to lose money to give you this protection? Oh, wait, you are paying for this protection... actually every CC card user is paying a premium for this protection which basically amounts to 'worst case scenario how much we'll lose to fraud divided by all suck^H^H^H^Hclients'Bitcoins can certainly operate the same way. Hell, CC companies can pay and receive in bitcoins if they choose to do so, but having the option of doing your own due diligence and paying (almost) no fee or using the CC company and pay their ridiculous fees, which will you do? With fiat that's not an option, particularly not for online purchases.All in all this is very much moot, because once bitcoins as a value storage medium gets accepted globally (and I'm assuming it does, obviously) you'll get all those icings on the cake done by 3rd parties. The caveat being right now you can't simply send money abroad instantly without a bunch of services in the middle for which you have no control and which charge fees in which you have no say and also require your name, address and underwear color of choice along the way (because the terrorists...). With bitcoins and other coins alike you can still use a 3rd party if you choose to, but you don't have to  The wallet does in fact store a few addresses (100) that you don't see, which are created ahead of time so they get included in backups of the wallet.dat file. These addresses are then used when you get change for your sends or when you request a new receiving address but, visible or not, they are active in the wallet, which means that once a block includes a transaction that touches those addresses your wallet balance and history will reflect them. Change is special as it the history will not show that address receiving funds (or at all) but balance will account for this. You still have full control over that change address, can dump the priv key, it is included in backups.As for importing private keys, I don't get your question... If you are asking if you must load them into another client to see the balance, no, not at all. Your QT client balance will be correct *after all the necessary blocks have been loaded*Transactions are stored in the wallet, blocks are not. So you will see all unconfirmed transactions from your wallet if you are downloading the blockchain from scratch, and the balance will be 0. As blocks come in that include the transactions in your wallet, these will appear confirmed and the balance is updated... you just have to wait.A week or two sounds extreme, but I haven't started from scratch in a long, long time so maybe that's just what you'll have to wait. You can trust the official torrent bootstrap files though, as the client itself has checkpoints to prevent you from importing a bad one, but do your due diligence and, if you don't find a bootstrap file you are sure to trust, well, just wait  I just skimmed your post, but I believe you are confusing things a bit; the 5.12 is the change from the 1.3 you sent, and the destination address of that part is likely just a change address in your wallet.As for Bitcoin-QT on the mac, I do use it and while it used to die on me and lock up, the last couple of versions have been really stable, what version were you running?If you feel you had your machine compromised you should start afresh, but remember to backup your wallet.dat first! It's in your user home (/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallet.dat)In fact, first do a couple of backups and only then do anything else Oh, and don't forget to backupIf it was just confusion, fire up your client and let it run until fully sync'd before anything else, chances are you'll find everything is in place as expected. But do update your client if not running an up to date version, and backup first! I don't advise anyone to put their coins in online wallets. Having said that, I do run one if you are into ripple: https://dividendrippler.comYou can also trade the coins you store there directly in the ripple network. Ok, you seem to be thinking about getting 2/3 of the price in new, which is more than fair. Problem is your base price is likely to be the price you paid some time ago and is much higher than the store price at the moment. Heck, the discounted price is much higher than the price in new.If you take 2/3 of the best price I can find online (on real stores) I'll take the 2 256G and the New In Box Kingston 120GB, assuming escrow or you send first and I will pay for the actual shipping costs. I received their newsletter a few days ago and they state they are now (manually) accepting bitcoins for the stuff in their webshop: http://shopusa.chickenwingscomics.com/I already have most their comic books but I'll certainly get some stuff there, and for those that don't know them make sure you have a look at their webcomic: http://www.chickenwingscomics.com/I am in no way related to them, and haven't even told them I would be advertising here. Hopefully they'll not get mad about it From the newsletter:
Since you don't say where you are from, I'm going to assume you are from the US And since I'm not, will you ship international? Wanna hint us on your price expectance? I will ask TTBit to close this thread today... it's kinda saddening that so many accounts are used solely for taking advantage of others. Oh well. You might want to tell people in what exchange you ripple USD is at. Ripple USD means nothing more than a balance somewhere else, and it is in everyone's best interest to make sure people don't try to push self issued currencies which are backed by nothing.Are yours BTC.bitstamp or something else? Did it break down to require service by apple? Regardless, if you say it's in good condition (and that includes a battery life within 90% of the original) then I'll take it, email me the address (and gpg sign, please). I assume you still have my address, but if not it's in my profile. Factory unlocked?  Wow, such (late) turnover The lottery has gone through plenty of activity, some down time and a face lift, now at http://taabl.net. This particular offer from TTBit is obviously not active anymore but as time permits there will be an update on the lottery and some incentives... but there's no such thing as a free lunch, and those wanting to gamble should know that while giveaways and such might increase your profit if you win, you will lose your bet if you lose... so this is hardly a "here, have some bitcoins" kind of event.Be safe out there... Will that price make it cross the pond? No trouble at all, it's just that ripple takes a long time to resync when it is off for any significant period of time. That has been improved, I believe, in the newer release candidates but unfortunately those aren't quite production ready yet. Yes, sorry about that. I have received a notification from the server some time ago but only now had time to deal with it.Should be back momentarily! Point taken, I was just tickled by the idea of helping out with the trust issue, but I really rather not spend more than I would off the BTC world, that's all. Your price is fine and as you say similar if not better than others around the forum. Understood, but they charge me £30 for 10oz, so it only applies if I were to buy a single small coin from them. Lets put this in another way, if I buy the set of coins you have available from them it will cost me 587.25 (with 2x1/20 pandas instead of 1x1/10, as they don't have those atm) plus 23.95 for a total of 611.20, or BTC 4.2036 at current bitstamp bid (of 145.4010). Would you sell your coins for that? Give me a better deal than what I get at coininvestdirect.com and I'll take any one (or all) of the coins advertised. I'm sure you'll find I'm trustworthy enough for you to send first but I'll also be willing to ask Graet or John to escrow. And where, dare I ask, are you shipping from? If you'd make it "2010 ~ 2013" it would be extra cool (for me)  Any chances of that? Yes, the site is up and fully functional, if a little disregarded by the community. We are actively working towards making it better, so not dead at all.As for TRC, did it die and we missed it? I know it's an altchain, I know the exchange value is low but it is a great test coin for me. We have considered removing support for TRC if it becomes a burden, but that hasn't happened yet. Well, the whole tone of his post sounded fishy, but he does mention at the very end of the OP that he made an example of the issue in practice and explains it. I honestly don't have the brain power today to parse through this but my TL/DR makes me think the issue as described is not a protocol issue but rather a missing check in the implementation. That being the case I can't understand the 'post-mortem' tag (unless, of course, someone wants to buy cheaper). Have you guys noticed this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=310954.0 already? Although I have free (but not next day) delivery on most items from amazon uk (I'm not in the uk), I really need things to be bought from my account (tax reasons) thus the proxy service as offered isn't exactly what I need. What about gift vouchers, would you buy these for me, and if so up to what value?Also, regarding the rate, the mtgox avg is for GBP (low volume) or USD converted to GBP? Did I mention TAABL and DoC?  Assuming you weren't plain lazy, I guess the forum search sucks more than I expected: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=162713.msg1219048;topicseen#new
Hmmm, that's slightly more expensive than my usual supplier (that doesn't take bitcoins, granted). Will you give quantity discounts? What quantities do you have available for the 1oz and 2oz horses? The nano, storage size and colour? How much extra to ship to Europe, so I can bid all inclusive? Sorry about that. Sometimes ledgers are incompletely processed and I have to manually apply them. Rest assured that everything gets applied, but sometimes it takes a little while. I'm working on understanding why this is, but I was to date unable to trigger this behaviour on demand and it doesn't happen often enough to allow me to properly debug.If it happens again just post here or PM me and I'll get things rolling right away, but even without any heads up I check for these cases very regularly. Don't forget DICEonCRACK and The Amazing Bitcoin Lottery which, while experiencing very low volume as of late are still very much alive.The forum threads that explain all about it:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120239.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=121920.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120602.0 Oh well, count me out then. Where are you located? Well, you should read up on how DoC works. It doesn't place a single bet, but works a strategy for you, so each bet is 99.x% changes of winning, but it places a lot of them. You need to understand the math to properly have a feel for it.For example, the last lost bet for BTC has 99.678% winning odds per bet, but it places up to 1000 bets and will pay 24.646x if the player wins. You can't compare the odds directly to what other dice games advertise.Incidentally this last I mentioned was a minefield game, in which 1000 bets are placed from your initial wager and all need to stay below a certain number (65325 in the example) on a random draw between 0 and 65535. The reason everything is "red" right now is that the last bettors tried for the high payouts, which will statistically fail often but pay very well on success.It should be all explained on the thread pointed to in my previous message, but let me know if you have any doubt. A good opportunity to play DICEonCRACK? Yes, I know, shameless plug... Thanks to the work of snailbrain and crew, DividendRippler now supports NMC DividendRippler now supports NMC!Everyone that has registered will have a new NMC issue address and can set their NMC redeem address. Don't forget to trust DR for NMC before you try to issue!The redeem fees are fixed at 0.005 NMC which will used as tx fees for the outgoing transaction.Thanks to snailbrain and his crew for improving namecoind enough to be usable by DR.As always, let us know of any problems. Yeah, I don't think I'll come even close to your asking price, so chances are you will either sell due to my bump  or reuse them. Still, just thinking out loud here:The B&Ws I can get locally for ~£500, and I see 2 ebay.co.uk auctions with bids, one for £52 currently (6d to go, but there's a dent) and one for £255 (3d to go, but stands are included). In the UK they seem to go for under £400 on the stores.As for the Sonos amp, locally it goes for ~£425 and the cheapest I see it on ebay is £285 (3d to go, full warranty new in the box), cheapest buy now is £390, but that's a store selling brand new. I can get it on Amazon uk too, for £395 less VAT, so ~£330.With all that, it would cost me £925 to buy in my corner shop, likely less than £750 in the UK. So my offer is £450 in BTC, shipped. If you can assert there is still some warranty left and I can verify I'll be able to use it here I may increase that value, but otherwise that's the very best offer I can make, considering the risks. I'm in Europe, yes. How old are these, do they still have warranty? 75% is way too high unless they are like new and have 1 year+ warranty left that I can exercise internationally. Not sure, too tired to look. He was proposed to me by a fellow bitcoiner with whom I made a trade, and he's very well known for his mining pool, ozco.inOther than having held quite a few BTC on my behalf, he's a very friendly person and I most certainly trust him. Now, you need to do your own due diligence before you take my word for it, of course. Graet and John are my go-to people when in need of escrow. I'm not in the UK so I'll need things shipped. Also I'm mostly interested in the Sonos, although for the right price I'll certainly take both. Any idea on how much you are looking for? Necro bump, do you still have these? I missed this at the time it was posted, but Daniel Cawrey wrote a piece at coindesk that mentions TAABL (and DICEonCRACK), both services I developed and, well, the criticism as presented makes me think of the current economical situation of the world and how people look at their governments for a fix instead of trying to do something themselves. Much like an unprotected child seeks the comfort of the mother's skirt, I guess:So, all non reported bitcoin transactions (where the outsider doesn't know the source or destination) are suspicious? Also, when you play the state lottery, do you know where the money comes from? Sure you do, from the people that play, just like on TAABL. The difference is that on TAABL you can be sure all the bets are accounted for without the need of an external entity and the cut the service takes is minimal, not covering the costs of developing and running it to be honest (all in the name of making money, of course).The original TAABL was born as an experiment to interface with the bitcoin daemon, and had its moment of fame. The current version of it is quite different but keeps the same spirit. Now, no one ever asked me or the other people involved about the problems of running this "operation", and as such I offered no diversion to deflect anything. I love how it sounds like the guy tried to contact us and we avoided any reply... oh well. Half baked, silly journalism seems to be the common press style around bitcoins anyway.All this would be fine, but he is calling bitcoin a "silly currency" and putting what might very well be the longest running bitcoin service (ok, not true, it did stop and was restarted as something a little different) in the same page as scams, schemes, money laundering, blackmail and drug deals. Color me impressed...  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you are trying to scam people, I have no reason to believe that. What I said is that it is awkward you demand people trust you to do business with you and you refuse to trust others based on your very own metrics. I have dealt with a LOT more bitcoins than you, have had plenty of opportunity to steal truck loads of coins but have not. That means nothing for future events and that's why we use an escrow service we both can trust on most deals done here. I mean, how long have you been around? I could point you to a number of long time members that were the archetype of honesty and one day disappeared, taking other people's bitcoins in the process, it is just the way it is.Still, best of luck selling the RPI, it is a fairly good deal with the bundle you propose, though not good enough to justify taking risks (*) even for a small amount of coins.(*) - and if it was a good enough deal to take the risk it would likely fall in the category of "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is". That's fine, thanks anyway. I don't mind trusting others, really, but when someone says "trust me, others can vouch for me" and then says "I trust noone, no matter how trusted they are in the community" it really says a lot about the risks involved. So you understand why I won't send first either, as you can assert that if you can't trust me then I definitely can't trust you Back to escrow then, will you accept it? Buying through ebay and paying fees is a no-go, you'd have to lower your price, otherwise it is just as expensive to buy though the distributor and then I have warranty and can write off the expense.
isn't £15 a little steep for EU delivery? How much does the whole package weight?Anyway, I'm buying one this week, might be yours otherwise I'll just order from Farnell. Give me a better shipping price (I'll pay for the actual postage cost, I'm sure it's a third of what you are asking) and either accept escrow or you send first (if I can trust you, I'm sure you can trust me more) and we have a deal.Let me know if it interests you. Wild guess: A guy that has no need to prove anything  I'm almost sure he could drive a Prius and still be cool! Again, I'll take them all if you agree to using escrow. I will take pictures and post here once the items arrive. I am willing to buy all the available erupters in the shop (currently 19) if I can pay on receipt / escrow. As a trusted member I'll post on receiving the items.Alternatively I can pay with a reversible method, like credit card, if that option is available. I trust Graet and John K. http://diceoncrack.com/We do BTC, LTC and TRC currently. I'll try to dig for some better resolution images tomorrow (kinda late now). I'll post if I find them and you can send the prize to m4sterch3fed for the effort. ENDED.FUEPA wins the unit for 105 BTC. Auction will end in ~15 minutes if no other bid comes in, FUEPA leads with 105 BTC I have received a bid by email from a newbie that can't post yet, he'll come in and confirm the bid once he has all the needed conditions met to get out of newbie jail.FUEPA - 105 BTC Bump for 30 minutes to go From this point forth, any bid will extend the auction to the bid time + 60 minutes.Highest (and single) bid is 102 btc for lunchen7 Less than 2 hours... 4:30 hours to go... lunchen7 leads the race, 6:30 hours to go. I appreciate all that, and it is up to the bidders to assert how valuable the unit is for them.The unit in hand will always be worth less than the unit in avalon's hands, one less hop so always faster regardless of what happens. You see, unpredictable issues are unpredictable...Anyway, I thank you for your offer, I do have a few friends that could help me out but I'm certainly not interested in hosting the unit with someone I don't know. Since I already started the auction and there is one bid I'll follow through with it, though. It's what I prefer anyway, rather than have to setup and manage the unit remotely. Less than 16 hours, no bid yet? Ok, lets make this perfectly clear for everyone then; I can not control Avalon and I cannot accept your bid given all the constraints you present. Specifically, I don't control when they ship it, all I can say is that they have shipped it to me already and have agreed to forward it to someone else. The unit was returned to the shipper over a week ago so I assume they have it already but can't promise as it is not something I can control.Also, they send they unit out with a proforma invoice, which was not enough for my needs. But this is the same they did for everyone else and as such I assume that will be enough for almost everyone, if you need something more specific you'll have to take that up with them, I have zero weight on this.You'll be paying them for the shipping, it was sent to my by DHL on a Monday and it arrived on my country on the following Wednesday, but I can't promise anything here either.It was sent to me from Japan.Everyone, the object of this auction is the order (ready to ship, as it was shipped already) from Avalon. That's what I'm selling here, if you need anything more either don't bid or take that up with Avalon directly.I am not taking your bid in consideration as most of your requirements are not met. Sorry, but no. The item is shipped directly from Avalon, and if you get in trouble with your local customs that's on you. Since dogie failed to follow through with the deal, a second attempt to auction the unit is being held at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=256082.0 This is my second attempt at auctioning my Avalon batch #2 unit, initial attempt was https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=249691.0 and the winner passed the unit to another member that in turn failed to get the coins and ultimately the winner gave up on buying this. Most of the original post still applies and is reproduced below, but I'm going to try slightly different terms this time:I'm auctioning my Avalon Batch #2 order. It has been shipped to me but stupid customs refused to let it into my country due to lack of proof of payment... I tried to explain as good as I could, with no positive result.So, it is now being returned to the shipper by DHL and Avalon has agreed to let me forward it to another person, which is where this auction comes in...I paid 102 BTC for this order in another auction, so that's my starting point.Escrow is welcomed, I would recommend Graet or John K but am open to others, but I expect full value to be released to me once the winner's address is acknowledged by Avalon as the new recipient of this order. You will also have to pay shipping separately, and I'm waiting on details for how much this shipping will be.The auction starts now and bids will be accepted until tomorrow, Monday 15th, 16:00 UTC.If there are bids after Monday, 15:00 UTC  and before 16:00 UTC they will extend the auction to 1 hour after the bid time.If we reach a bid of at least 138 BTC (the winner bid last time around) the 1 hour rule will start immediately, potentially making the auction shorter. So if you bid 138 BTC now the auction will end one hour from now if there are no other bids.In a nutshell:- Minimum initial bid of 102 BTC- Auction runs until Monday at 16:00 UTC unless bids reach 138 BTC or there is a bid within one hour of auction end- Each bid guarantees one hour of auction run time after it- Escrow gladly accepted, you arrange and pay for it- Shipping will need to be paid separately, directly to Avalon- Payment or escrow is expected before I send your details to Avalon- Escrow is to be released when Avalon changes the order to your account/address (not on receiving the unit)Please only bid if you intend to follow through, wasting time is a waste of time... I am unsure about the quantity you are selling. Is this a single unit or a pair?Also, pictures always go a long way to help selling things around here. What's the packaged weight so I can estimate postage?
dogie was the winner with his amazingly timed bid of 138 BTC. If you require escrow (I'm sure you do) please set it up. Remember you'll have to pay shipping to Avalon on top of the bid.Once the winning bid amount is in escrow or on my wallet I will begin the process of moving the order to you. 1 hour to go. All is explained in the OP. The escrowed funds are to be released once the order is changed to the winner, NOT when the unit is received.This can happen in two different ways; either avalon allows me to move the order to the winner's avalon store account or they change the address in my account and I give my account to the winner. Please don't bid if you don't agree with the terms.If for some reason I can't prove the address has been changed then I'll wait for the tracking information before requesting the release of funds. 27 hours to go, largest bid still at 110. Largest bid currently:- patr: 110 BTC Instantly? No, nothing is instant with Avalon. I do have an "open communication channel" with them, so I get replies usually in less than 24 hours, and they did agree on the address change already. For everyone asking if I still have some to sell, I've had many more offers than boards left.In the mean time an Avalon I had coming my way is going back to the shipper because customs here are over-zealous to the point of stupidity. Hence I'm auctioning it off: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=249691.0 3 modules. I can't give you a specific GH/s figure as I didn't run the miner, it's 60GHs or better as per Avalon's description, though usually they reach 70+. Thank you! Gladly! All you need to do is win the auction first  Portugal Did you read my previous post at all?There is no Buy It Now, I don't think it makes sense. Still, make me an offer I can't refuse and I'll not refuse it. I have received a request for a buy it now price... I don't think, given the duration of the auction and the fact you will not get the order changed to the winner before early next week (Avalon needs to receive the returned shipment first) that buy it now makes any sense here, but I'll be open to offers that are much higher than current bid, if you feel so inclined. I'm auctioning my Avalon Batch #2 order. It has been shipped to me but stupid customs refused to let it into my country due to lack of proof of payment... I tried to explain as good as I could, with no positive result.So, it is now being returned to the shipper by DHL and Avalon has agreed to let me forward it to another person, which is where this auction comes in...I paid 102 BTC for this order in another auction, so that's my starting point. The auction will run through Sunday, the 7th at 14:00 UTC.Escrow is welcomed, I would recommend Graet or John K but am open to others, but I expect full value to be released to me once the winner's address is acknowledged by Avalon as the new recipient of this order. You will also have to pay shipping separately, and I'm waiting on details for how much this shipping will be.So, that's it, bid away. "not yet redeemed" means just that; the funds are on that address and haven't been moved.What do you mean it takes you to Blockchain? If you look in "previous games" on the main page you'll get the link I posted.

I apologize for this, there was a somewhat serious issue with the internet connection of the processing machine. Everything should be back on track now. Maybe, I've had a few requests on PMs and will honor them by order of arrival, but only after everyone that responded in time on the thread has had sufficient time to reply. Ok, so with a fresh wallet and importaddress it fails still, but with importprivkey it works fine.
I'm not sure if you mean the bug I'm reporting or just generic testing, but if the former you'll not be able to test using the GUI as there's no means to controlling the change address there. All addresses in this wallet are without privkey (from importaddress), so maybe that's one problem.On the other hand, even using only imported addresses without priv keys this works perfectly if I send from one address to two others (i.e. no address reuse). I will try with a fresh wallet and importaddress, and if that still fails I'll try a fresh wallet and importprivkey.

I just realized I forgot to make any mentions to warranties: during the first 15 days after you receive the boards, if you find any that is faulty send it back to me. After I check the board and if I find it faulty and don't see any obvious misuse (you'd be surprised) I will either send another board back if I have one or return the board's price.The order according to my sorting is:--pm--: 3 @ 1.5 (no reply)tmackay: 20 @ 0.81 (escrow, paid) RECEIVEDwoodrake: 80 @ 0.8 (escrow. paid) RECEIVED--pm--: 50 @ 0.8 (escrow) RECEIVEDpoochone: 10 @ 0.8 (no reply)ZoladkowaGorzka: 3 @ 0.8 (paid) RECEIVEDaz12: 3 @ 0.8 (cancelled)--pm--: 3 @ 0.8 (dup, actually az12 above) Well, it is and it isn't. I may still grab any offers made after the end date, obviously, but I'll work that out after the other ones are done with. I have updated the second post with all offers on the table. Give me a few hours to regroup here and I'll contact everyone to get these deals done. Huh? The problem only exists when reusing the address. My workflow depends on that, and changing the workflow is a lot of work. At any rate, this issue is a bug and should be fixed. Because reusing addresses hurts everyone's privacy... it's true to some extent, but it is always a problem when human behavior is the thing being hacked on instead of code. Just a quick bump, ~28 hours to go. Bounty #2:Based on snailbrain's latest namecoin-qt I have the following problem:- manually create and submit a tx to send full balance of addr1  -> part to addr2  -> part back to addr1 (think change back to sending address)- The transaction is sent correctly but the wallet is updated only for the debit of addr1 and credit of addr2. For some reason the credit of addr1 is ignored, even when the the tx is included in a block- restarting namecoind with -rescan gets that balance backI need the above to work as in bitcoin, i.e. when sending to the address the output belongs to, both debit and credit to that address get processed by the wallet.I have 1 BTC up for grabs for that fix, and I'll also try to fix it myself time permitting.Yesterday I asked for pointers on #bitcoin-dev and instead of tech advice I got a "you shouldn't do that"... oh well. Oh well, it wasn't just a heads up, I was actually hoping you would also ship to EU...  Is that shipping included worldwide? I'm still not 100% sure there's nothing broken, but all the commands implemented work as advertised and I couldn't find any obvious "hidden code". This is no guarantee however, and before I get this into a production environment I'll do a full code review for my own benefit. Bounty paid, tx c9dd9f1074b40c049ebc53c804377e1200201792dd6473a002a0059712eff98d Been testing snailbrain version with all the RPC commands added. So far everything is working pretty well, there's just one small issue which I'm not sure relates to snailbrain's updates or not, but is kind of problematic for me.Regardless, I'm calling the 1000 NMC bounty I offered as fulfilled. Can you provide an address for sending it, snailbrain?Now, the problem I'm having is (using addresses imported without private key, not sure if that's relevant) when sending a transaction that has the same address in inputs and outputs, for example returning change to the sending address. When I do that the sending address is empty as far as the daemon is concerned even though the transaction is properly formed. The only way to see the unspent output again is by rescanning.Addr1 10 NMC -> Addr2 9 NMC -> Addr1 1 NMCAddr2 has 9 NMC, Addr1 is empty until I restart with -rescanAddr1 10 NMC -> Addr2 9 NMC -> Addr3 1 NMC Addr1 is empty, Addr2 has 9 NMC, Addr3 has 1 NMC as expected. All, at the current offer level I come to the conclusion that I'm better off keeping the boards, and when they become unprofitable sell them for the FPGAs.I'll also not be around Tuesday/Wednesday so I won't be able to ship things as urgently as I wanted.As such I will make one final call for offers, with a slightly different set of rules:- Minimum offer of 0.8 BTC per card- Offers will be sorted by price descending follow by quantity descending, in other words the higher price wins, and for the same price the larger quantity. All being the same, the order of offer (for thread offers, PMs go down on the priority list).- Cables for direct connection to PSUs and metal spacers are offered on batches of 30+- You pay shipping (after I ship, so we know exactly how much that was)- This offer ends Wednesday June 12 @ 13:00 GMT. I will keep any boards not sold at that point.- I will ship everything no later than Monday 17 assuming prompt payment (to escrow). I don't have photos of the specific boards, and won't be able to take any for a few days. I do have some which I sold separately at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=160693.msg1710727#msg1710727, but this particular offer is only for the boards, no 120mm fans, cables or spacers.I might be convinced to send the cables and spacers for bulk orders if the price justifies it.Each board takes ~11W @ 12V I understand the urgency and appreciate the new offer. I am setting a flexible deadline on myself to decide on this, Monday, so unless I get an offer I can't refuse I'll stick to that. I fully understand you may wish to cancel your offer but since nothing will be shipped before Tuesday regardless of how quickly we close a deal, it will not make a difference in the end. Well, Kate, that's not an easy thing for me to calculate, hence the open offer. I know all about the expected profitability I have, and while my cristal ball has been out of order for a while I have my personal sentiments as to what the BTC economy will do in the near future.I asked for offers in BTC because that's what the boards mine (disregarding the alt coins). I would also entertain offers in cash but that makes little sense as the ROI will be in BTC anyway. The broken cards are probably best fit for someone wanting to grab the FPGAs without shelling out 180 a piece, of course, but for using the boards for mining I expect them to make me more than 0.5 BTC in the next 4 months (electricity included).Granted, if diff keeps jumping like this last time I may be completely off, its a bet I guess. I may sell the boards for the offers already standing, don't get me wrong, I just meant I'm not closing the deal in a rush for that offer. It's still a completely valid offer. What about normal transfer fees (not name related), what's the schedule there? I'm feeling too lazy to go through the code, unforgivable I know, but it is Friday...
@woodrake: Yes, each board does 208~232 MH/sec, and I have 170+ of them. I appreciate and acknowledge your offer, though it is not one I'll rush to accept, I'm sure you'll understand.I am always willing and in fact would push for everyone dealing in BTC to use escrow. Most often I deal with Graet or John K, though I'll certainly accept any other reputable party. Unfortunately I had to do a reinstall of the machine that handles the payouts, and I'm still waiting on the multiple blockchain downloads. As soon as this is over I'll process the payout. New set of offers:- From the thread:20 @ 0.81 (tmackay)3 @ 0.8 (ZoladkowaGorzka)60 @ 0.8 (woodrake)- From PMs3 @ 1.53 @ 0.850 @ 0.8- Late offers from the thread:3 @ 0.8 (az12)20 @ 0.8 (woodrake)10 @ 0.8 (poochone)Remember I'll give preference to thread offers if price is the same, so if you want to get a place in line respond to this thread instead of PM'ing. I assume those offering in PMs don't want their names here.[edit] The old offers below:So far I've got offers for:15 @ 0.75 BTC20 @ 0.50 BTC170 @ 0.50 BTC20 @ 0.50 BTC15 @ 0.80 BTC2 @ 0.55 BTC60 @ 0.70 BTC1 @ 0.6025 @ 0.553 @ 0.5I'll keep this list updated as offers come in. I have received an offer in US$ so I think I should have added: Offers in BTC only, please  I have a bunch of ztex 1.15x clones hashing away (http://www.ztex.de/usb-fpga-1/usb-fpga-1.15x.e.html) that were assembled under license.THESE ARE NOT ORIGINAL ZTEX BOARDS, BUT CLONES THEREOF. Meaning, they are exactly the same, only using -2 grade FPGAs but not built and sold by ztex, they have no responsibility over them.The boards are all hashing away at between 208 and 232 MHs. I'm considering selling them all at this point, and will entertain small batch and full stock offers. No guarantee I will sell them, or that I will sell them to the highest bidder, this is not an auction. But make me a fair offer and I will likely close the deal.I'm in Europe, and shipping outside EU can be troublesome, particularly for larger quantities. If you understand this and still want to take your chances I'll gladly ship anywhere, just realize it may take a long time to arrive.The boards will be sent with a good bunch of dust on them (no extra charge  ) and a low profile heatsink. Some will have a fan attached that may or may not work. I am pushing air externally through them, which is what I found works best.I also have a few non functional boards. Some mine individually but not when put in the farm, some give bad hashes, some are not detected at all. I am positive almost all, if not all of the FPGAs is fine, probably just assembling issues. I was going to extract and reball the FPGAs and mount them again, but I don't think it is worth my effort at this time. I have extra PCBs so if someone wants to buy the broken boards and requests PCBs I'll be glad to provide them. I can not, however, provide you with the BOM or pick&place data, you will have to request that from ztex directly.What I have;~170 (a little more, haven't properly counted them) boards working10~30 non functional (I'll check and update if there is interest)There you go. Any interest?[edit] Changes to the offer, read them at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=227905.msg2420433#msg2420433 O rippln parece MUITO um esquema de pirâmide, mas francamente eu fujo de quase tudo o que é HYIP. Tens alguns "detalhes" aqui: http://www.moneymakergroup.com/Rippln-Startmyrippleco-t442736.htmlNão sei mais, mas quero distância  Bom, a questão de base é perceber o que significa ter BTC/bitinstant ou BTC/dividendrippler. Ambos são apenas notas de divida, ou seja, se tens BTC/dr isso significa que o dividendrippler te deve esses tantos BTC. Para poderes trocar por XRP é preciso que alguem tenha XRP e queira trocar por BTC/dr. Isso é tudo gerido pelo ripple, e o dividendrippler não é mais que uma gateway entre BTC/LTC/TRC e o ripple.Podes depositar BTC/LTC/TRC no DR, e recebes IOUs nesse valôr. Isso significa que o DR guarda por ti esse valôr. Se comprares XRP por BTC/dr, quem te vende o XRP fica com esse tanto de BTC *no DR*.A qualquer momento podes sacar os BTC enviando para o teu endereço no DR (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=XXXXX visivel em 'To redeem') e o DR envia os BTC para o teu endereço de redeem configurado lá.Portanto, podes depositar BTC e receber BTC/dr, e podes retirar os BTC/dr em BTC. O que fazes enquanto tens BTC/dr não é controlado pelo DR, é tudo gerido pelo order book do ripple.Uma coisa fabulosa que o ripple permite é enviar, por exemplo, BTC/dr para alguem e pagar noutra coisa, por exemplo XRP. O que acontece é que o order book é verificado e a melhor oferta utilizada. Podes tambem enviar para ti próprio para fazeres uma ordem a valores de mercado. Se tentares enviar 100 XRP para ti e alguem estiver a comprar BTC/dr por XRP, aparece a opção de enviar x BTC/dr como pagamento para os 100 XRP.É confuso e eu não sou grande coisa a explicar (se fores aos threads sobre o assunto existem muito melhores explicações), mas se tiveres alguma duvida especifica posso tentar elaborar. Can you share what you have for sale that is Cuba related? I'm a little ashamed to say I think I jumped the gun with this change... I thought I was changing the address version and I now, on closer inspection, see I changed the private key prefix... oops.There is no reason not to use bitcoin's version (128) instead for the private key, but I had some problem that prompt me to fix is like this, and now I can't remember what that was.Feel  free to revert that but do try to do a newaddress -> dumpprivkey | new wallet | -> importprivkey to make sure it is working as expected. Did you put the SSD back in and closed the back cover properly? Is the power supply included? I'm assuming you are in EU from the escrow note, is that correct?Can you share the exact model for the MB?Assuming you have the power supply, will you be able to give it a full charge (to make sure the battery works, you can see the charge leds on the right side where there is a small button) and also boot the computer and tell us if the fans spin up?It would be kinda perfect if you could do a quick video (with sound) of the laptop connected to power, and you pressing the power button. Thank you for trying the service out. I don't understand why you had to pay XRP for sending LTC to DR though, can you elaborate on that?Redeeming costs only the fees to the appropriate chain, these are described in https://dividendrippler.com/feesAs for the back-end it is a completely custom service that interfaces with our own local rippled, bitcoind, litecoind and terracoind servers. There was a weird issue with TRC handling that was preventing the wager monitor to function properly, thanks for pointing this out! That warning does not mean the hot wallets are empty, but rather that the wager monitor process didn't update that particular chain in a couple of minutes. This is sometimes normal for a few seconds, when a lot of transactions are being parsed and that takes long, but if it appears and stays for any particular chain, it's either been disabled for maintenance or there's a problem, such as it was in this case.It is always safe to place bets, since they are registered in the blockchain and can be processed at any time. There is no PHP in DoC or anything else I do. I'm just saying it is something most people chose.There is certainly a need for DBs, otherwise we wouldn't have a way to store the games or the results. You could, however, do without it with a little effort, but I would certainly not advise you to. PHP is a very common choice, one that I personally hate for no good reason There's a lot of python behind DICEonCRACK, and pretty much everything I do these days that isn't performance critical, and it is certainly not a waste of your time learning it if you are serious about coding in general. Of course the same thing can be said for any language, like theymos hinted, I just have a personal bias towards python as the barrier of entry is quite low and the possibilities really high. I have no idea why github decided that it shouldn't show me namecoin-qt remote as an option for a pull request, so here's the fix for the above problem:https://github.com/nelisky/bitcoin/commit/95ca4f8dc800a203f65613afe5c9c79894d6c6a7 I compiled it in linux (the Makefile has the boost suffix for mingw unconditionally but other than that it compiled fine). I only had time to do a simple newaddress, tx to it, dumpprivkey, new wallet, importprivkey and this last step succeeds but doesn't import the key, at least not the right one.I couldn't debug it further but if I had to guess I'd say it probably imports using the wrong address version. Yeah, now that I actually searched for it instead of just looking at spot prices, the cheapest I can find one of these in EU is ~BTC 19.5. He enviado un PM No adelanto los portes, pero con escrow no hay como retractarse. Estoy un poquito lejos de Madrid, ~750km, por lo que en mano no es possible.en cuanto ficaria con envio incluso? Puedes enviarlo a Portugal? aceptas escrow?Fotos serían muy útiles 
Pois... um dia vou ter tempo para fazer a parte técnica e documentar, mas quando tenho de escolher um... De qualquer forma, qualquer dúvida pergunta aqui ou no thread apropriado. E pela referência à trilogia de cinco, podes ficar com eles Agora a sério, em vez de devolveres, e visto que estás a brincar com o ripple, faz antes uso do dividendrippler.com como gateway. Eu sou o technical lead desse projecto e quantos mais a usar, melhor (e não só porque o lucro sobe  ) Só porque tens o Marvin como avatar, manda o teu endereço que eu 'desenguiço'... "oh, but what's the use?..." Graet (of ozcoin pool fame) is also a great choice for escrow.Where are you shipping from? I can't seem to load you site to check for myself. I would also take one for 15BTC, maybe 2. Most certainly! I'll, of course, need proper source code so I can diff and compile myself, but if you can put this together (at least) my part of the bounty is yours. Sure thing. Martingale [EXIT] places 0.001 wagers when playing with BTC, so starting with your deposit of 0.00700425 it will try to place a bet to reach 0.00800425. Now, the special thing about EXIT compared to the other Martingales is that it quits early, as soon as your balance isn't enough to reach the next prize step. Each step adds 0.001 to the target outcome.With the wager settings (425 satoshis, 1.019 multiplier, exit 2x wager, which is actually the default), in order to go from 0.00700425 to 0.00800425 you need to win 0.001. Since the win multiplier is 1.019 you'll need to bet ~0.0526, which, if you win, will give you 0.0526x1.019 ~= 0.0536, or 0.001 more than you have bet.But you don't have 0.0526 to bet, only 0.007, so the EXIT is triggered. It's a refund because no wager was ever placed.Hope that clears things a bit  Yep, you struck a nerve, the wasting time is a waste one  And you keep poking it!You never did answer my question, though; why would I post the code? It isn't mine to post, you can access it in the exact same way I did and what would it prevent you from saying "yes, but how do we know that is the real code" unless you got it from the real guys?See, "and your mother!" again. But yes, now that you know where I stand I am unfortunately reminded where you stand and that my expectation (hope) that you were really trying to understand, not just slander and troll, are not met and this was all a waste of time. Oh well, live and learn.Oh, and by the way, my investment in ripple was only one of time, that for me is more valuable than most currency. At least with ripple there's a chance it pays off. You, not so much, but thank you for reminding me that forum saying about trolls and food. The burden of proof of what exactly? I'm not in a quest for a higher good. You must have misunderstood me, I don't give a crap what others think, never did, I just try to help where I can, and that is what I have been trying to do here. I did not make any claims (feel free to prove me wrong if I did, it was never my intention).Why should I post it? And why should I trust you to be able to review it if you can't even shoot the ripple dudes an email requesting access before crying scam?I know ripple will be open sourced, it will not survive otherwise. I am also telling the truth, I really don't care if you troll, speak truth, eat with your feet or even worst, use windows as your primary OS. Really, I don't think less of you for that.What bugs me a bit is that you are not processing the information passed on to you, instead just replying "oh yeah? and your mother!" which is not the best line of argument I've seen from you, to be honest.Let me make this as clear as possible... I'm not trying to change your opinion, I have nothing to gain from that and I might even have something to lose as I need all flaws and issues of Ripple (and Bitcoin for that matter) to be as public as possible lest my investments on both are in peril. I was just offering some insight but you mistaken me for a Ripple zealot. I am not, and I'd love to be shown you are not an anti-Ripple zealot, but you are doing a great job proving otherwise.This is becoming personal, not really the type of argument I enjoy the most unfortunately. You know, I was only explained the kool-aid reference a few months ago Now, as the one saying 'devs seem knowledgeable' I feel the need to disclose I have the source, am running a node and am a coder myself by trade, thus I don't think 'devs seem knowledgeable', I know they are. And refusing to accept the opinion of others while at the same time refusing to pursue proof of your own opinion seems to fit pretty well with your kool-aid drinking theory. I have insider information, you hold the cool beverage can :pBut seriously, you are becoming a bit radical when you put everyone that doesn't share your view in the same basket. I do value your opinions and I love a good argument, but your are simply trolling now. I have to agree that it is not cool to lie in that way. Funny how I never read things in that exact way, I always thought it was going to be Open Sourced, eventually. Obviously I've been directed to where they blatantly state it already is, point taken.Decentralized I still think it is. Decentralized as in no central point of failure. As in consensus based transaction processing where OpenCoin by itself will not be able to change the outcome of a ledger. As in a decentralized processing system. Now, if decentralized is supposed to refer to the coding decisions and effort, then I guess you are right, at least for the moment.But does all that mean it is less of a system, and will have less of an impact or usefulness? Not for me, it won't. Ripple and Bitcoin are two completely different beasts, complimentary if I understand things correctly, and I intend to see this thing through. If it fails, we all get scammed or robbed, well, no lesson is too expensive if you learn it. I'm not saying you have to, but many of the claims floating around this thread are based on the absence of source code. The code isn't open source yet, there's no misunderstanding there, but it is available to many outside OpenCoin, and the network is currently supported at least partially by the gateway and indie devs, so OpenCoin does not really have the option of changing the rules and have that go unnoticed.If looking at the source code would satisfy some of people's doubts then I'd say that's a small price to pay, requesting access to it, instead of bitching about how it is completely opaque. Now, the claims of it not being open source are obviously plenty substantiated and that will need to change eventually, but still I find it most people are complaining just for the sake of complaining when there isn't any movement towards getting things straighten out.My personal bias is that OpenCoin has the right to keep it closed for as long as they wish and only open it selectively until they feel it is ready. Everyone has the option of not using Ripple at all, and even to complain about it as much as they feel needed, but the sum total of these cries isn't going to amount to much technically. Socially, sure, it might scare people off, but it also provides plenty of visibility to Ripple and the right minded people will do their own due diligence before deciding who's right. One thing I can tell you, there has been an enormous effort put into developing ripple and it really feels like the people behind it are amazing and capable, but that's my personal experience, not something I took from what people say around here. Have you requested access to the source? So what would happen to price if OpenCoin decided to dump a mere million? It seems to me looking at going price without looking at volume and depth is just another way to run a smear campaign. IP address warnings are not trivial to implement given the current architecture of the system, but certainly something I'll try to push for.There already is a single edit per 5 minute period limit, so you don't have someone change the addresses behind your back before you have a chance to ack the change. What? Where did you take that those would be the most important *for my needs*? So, in a nutshell no, that will not be enough, not even close to it, for my needs. I will, however, be glad to tip anyone that pushes those 4 rpc calls into namecoin. And again, FUD. Yes, what is said is absolutely true, but put that in context:With Bitstamp, 1 BTC is 1 BTC-BitstampWith MtGox, 1 BTC is 1 BTC-MtgoxWith any online wallet...With any exchange...With coins you lend your friend...This is in no way a ripple thing, even though it is also true with ripple. I didn't think the merged mining issue through, you are correct. I was going for "no need to allow mining" but obviously full merged POW is needed to verify blocks, so that's moot.So the only viable option is improve on the current 0.3.50 codebase, I guess. I would still think it possible to hook into the latest bitcoind to support NMC, but that's likely much less trivial than I assumed from the start.How's this for a plan? I need the following RPC calls added:- importprivkey- dumpprivkey- importaddress (from codeshark's PR, I can dig the number if needed)- listunspent- createrawtransaction- decoderawtransaction- getrawtransaction- sendrawtransaction- signrawtransaction- signmessage- verifymessage- listaddressgroupings (I can live without this one, but it is useful)I also need all the tx to be available for querying, not just those for wallet addresses (I think that's already the way it is). My part of the "unofficial bounty" is completely unrelated to the work you are doing, unfortunately. I'll be glad to spice it up a bit more if someone can commit to do what I need done soon, otherwise I'll end up doing it myself as soon as I can find the time.Reiterating my needs once more: I need namecoind (command line daemon, don't care for GUI) to be rebased on top of a current bitcoind source code so I have access to the newer RPC calls and to allow easy tracking of bitcoin development to leverage the amazing work being done there constantly. All else is sugar, although said sugar is certainly important to increase adoption that is not my current priority.Also, I will accept paying the bounty for a working namecoind as described above even if it doesn't have the merged mining stuff in, as that is something well served afaik with the outdated client.If instead of a bounty there's someone willing to take this task for a set price I'll be happy to chip in with NMC, BTC, XRP, LTC and/or TRC. Just state your price and expected time to delivery and we can try and fund that (but ultimately only paid after delivery, though I'll be glad to put the 'prize' in escrow) That's new, being hinted as a troll. Look, I'm sure you mean well and everyone will know that you just meant you compiled the latest from namecoin git but that's not what I read on your post, I read it as "I altered the code, improved it somehow, here's a shiny binary and no reference to the source code".Now that you explained I know that was not the case, you didn't change anything, just compiled. Fine, but a set of instructions on how to build it would be much better received.I can quickly cook a namecoin version for windows/mac with a small easter egg added and you have no way of verifying, and you know the type of easter eggs that are common around here, right?Be cool, and stay safe. Distributing binaries is a major no-no in most cases, and advocating it even if your intentions and code are the best will teach users to trust binaries referenced from threads, and that usually ends in "help, my wallet has been stolen and I don't know why" kind of posts. The way redeeming works has changed, where we used to charge whatever fee the network would require for a transaction we are now only charging a fixed fee, which for now will be the minimum fee required:BTC - 0.0005LTC - 0.1000TRC - 0.0000We will cover any extra fees for sending transactions. The up to date fees are available at https://dividendrippler.com/fees
Well, bad wording on our part. Payments are made using DR IOUs, but the payer is the asset account, not DR, which will be true for all assets. Can you share the source code? Pushing binaries around is dangerous (for users) at best. See, that's something I can not agree with. Lying to get the public to come in and throw money at you, sure. But stating they'll be open just not right now to drive adoption? I'm really happy they decided to do the open beta phase and not just play alone until the opening of the source! Ripple is a hard concept to grasp and the "SCAM you can make your our currency" claims explain just how hard the concept is.Just like Bitcoin, though in a more social and less technical way, Ripple is pushing the responsibility of using the system to the people using the system, i.e. be careful of who you trust, thing about what you are transacting, etc. Sure, it can be abused, it will be abused, has probably been abused already. But just saying "don't use it because OpenCoin (the devs, the early adopters) will profit more" is like saying the early bitcoin adopters or heavy investors are scamming the ones that use bitcoin as currency... really? Heh, that was not my point at all, sorry if that's what it sounded like. I just meant that I knew my reply could trigger a troll-like discussion, not that you were trolling. I understand that, but you can easily not use the system until they open it properly. I don't see what all the fuss is about honestly. I usually steer clear of such discussions but as I usually enjoy ShadowOfHarbringer's comments quite a bit, I'll just go ahead and risk "feeding the trolls (tm)";Did you request access to the source? They are not open as advertised, granted, but they are also not closed as people seem to assume. I heard of ripple, thought it was cool, had my aha moment, planned a service. Now, to do this properly I had to get the source, so I asked... and now I do have access to the source. I mean, c'mon, you don't have to like it, you don't have to use it, but just asking sometimes takes you a long way.I know that is no replacement for the 'open source' approach, but given the speed at which problems have been ironed out instead of exploited, and knowing the complexity of the system I have to agree that until a stable base is achieved it is easier to keep this behind a gated wall... even though the gate isn't really locked Now to your point; scammers don't lie, scammers scam. Liars are the ones lying, and while scammers are certainly liars, they are so much more that that. I'm sure you have lied more than once in your life. Heck, I'm almost certain you have lied more than once in the past hour, but that doesn't make you a scammer, does it? No alternative payment is attempted at this point. You might trust DR for BTC and not LTC but the best order in the market might be below your expectation.What happens is simple, the payment stays failed until you retry it, and will fail again if you retry it without granting proper trust. Also, there is one global retry per day, so just add the trust line and within 24hrs at most the payment will be sent. Yeah, we most certainly need to get a better workflow there. All ideas are welcome at this stage, of course, and the only thing we really want to avoid is forcing users to register with passwords and personal data although we might end up allowing that option in addition to the system in place.The one change I haven't introduced yet but is in the make is getting away with the 1 XRP fixed value and instead using a random value for registration/change. This makes it slightly better but doesn't resolve the problem, of course. There is a very, very thin market as this is a really new and not really well understood offer, but you should find most of your questions answered at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=190193.0If you have any further questions just post on either thread. I can try to talk a bit more on expected profit and such, just not at this time. Just clarifying, if I understood our PM exchange properly, you are taking the 0.3.50 NMC client and giving it a QT GUI, right? You are not updating the base client to match the newer bitcoin source? There is no need to do full units, you can buy 0.9 or any part thereof. But just in case you must have 1.0 you can always find more offers on TRC and LTC markets. I appreciate your quest to warn people about what you consider a scam, that's what makes this community safer, but I have to ask: wtf?Do you just post on every ripple related thread or is there anything particular to the subject of this one that you feel people should know about? Ripple is not a scam in my opinion, obviously if you look at XRP as currency it is, but that is completely unrelated to the usage of ripple. Sure, you can issue yourself any kind and amount on ripple, but what makes ripple tick is trust, and I most certainly don't trust your self issued BTC anymore than I would trust your self printed bank notes.Is there something specific to TAABL or DividendRippler that you feel needs being said? I assume yours is the transaction that was marked 'retained'. Can you send me a link or a hash that allows me to verify?There is one transaction that has been wrongly marked retained and I'm investigating why that happened. The 'currently offline' we are trying to resolve so it doesn't happen so often, but while annoying it shouldn't have any relation to these issues.Thank you for you patience and help! So... you either never gambled with cash or you've always won, right? Or did you exit the EUR already?Seriously, it saddens me how many people think BTC is just someway to make free cash... Na verdade recebe no minimo 1 satoshi, mas é uma percentagem da aposta. No meu site tenho tentado várias alternativas, a ultima é não enviar esse satoshi quando perde, não envia nada. Mas se quiser receber um aviso que perdeu (para os bots) basta acrescentar 5000 satoshis na aposta que esses 5000 são devolvidos. Sem problema, e quanto ao site, não estava tentando "passar a publicidade"  O jogo não é, na minha opinião, um "investimento", por isso há que jogar apenas o que se pode perder! Na verdade não podem. O hash (depois de alterado pelo segredo) é usado como base para o 'dado'. 4 dígitos hexadecimais são usados para valores entre 0 e 65535 (65536 hipoteses). Assumindo uma distribuição aleatórea (acho que podemos concordar nesse ponto) um jogo de 50% é um jogo de maior que 32767. Se eles retirarem 1% para a casa pagam 2x (50% de hipóteses) num jogo de maior que 33423 (49% de hipóteses de ganhar). É totalmente transparente. Pois, é um bocado confuso. Se conheceres estratégias de apostas como o Martingale ajuda, o 3 card poker é simples se conheces jogos de cartas, o simple é como pegar em 1 BTC e fazer 1000 apostas de 0.001 no SatoshiDice. Clica em 'VERIFICATION' no site que está tudo explicado. Básicamente o resultado de cada aposta é decidido com base on hash da transação (que não tem como alterar uma vez enviado) e um segredo. O segredo é aberto no dia seguinte e qualquer um pode verificar que as apostas tiveram o resultado correcto.Eu faço parte da equipa de um site concorrente em que em vez de uma aposta singular, quando jogas o sistema coloca uma série de apostas com base numa estratégia, e todos os resultados são verificaveis da mesma maneira.Já tivemos momentos em que parecia que eu tinha feito asneira no código, pois parecia que toda gente ganhava, a carteira ficou bem mais leve. Mas depois tem momentos em que ninguem ganha, e se for ver os dados históricos o lucro que temos é quase exactamente o esperado pelas probabilidades. O jogo não pode estar viciado, pois cada aposta é verificavel. O número que sai no "dado" é o hash da transação que envias (alterado de forma previsivel com uma chave diária que eles mostram depois de já não estar a ser usada).Agora, sorte ou azar, isso do saco com nove bolas pretas e uma vermelha é como atirar a moeda ao ar... digamos que atiras a moeda ao ar 10 vezes e sai sempre cara, qual a probabilidade de sair cara novamente na 11ª vez? Assumindo que a moeda está perfeitamente balanceada e que atiramos de forma aleatória, é claro, a probabilidade é, um pouco contra a lógica empirica, 50%. É sempre 50%, independentemente dos resultados passados.Da mesma forma, tirar uma bola do saco tem sempre 10% de sair vermelha, não importa quantas vezes saiu vermelha antes.Para garantir que a percentagem de probabilidade está correcta é preciso uma amostra grande. Não basta jogar 10 vezes e ver que a casa ganhou 7, é preciso jogar 1000, 10000, por aí. Mas aí é quase garantido que ficaste com menos do que jogaste, ainda que tenhas ganho ~91% das vezes. I just don't see how that helps getting the namecoin server easier to maintain and use. So you need users to either trust a central hub for all their transactions or build and run their own namecoind...
I could certainly live with a version that initially didn't support merged mining. I mean, miners can use (and are using) the old version anyway, we need a client to be able to use the coins and create services to support the chain. My pledge will be paid even if without merged mining. The GUI should be easy to achieve once the namecoin support is patched on top of the latest bitcoind, but that does mean some hacking still.I really think it is best to have this work split in two:1) patching latest bitcoind to support namecoin2) tweaking the GUI to support namecoin specific functionsI have pledged 1000 NMC to 1)lunarboy (100) and marcus_of_augustus (1000) pledged 1100 NMC to 2)the GUI can be achieved without 1), but I am certainly not interested in that as what I need is the server support.Is there anyone willing to take this task? Any more pledges? Someone (trusted) to take the funds pledged and deliver to bounty taker after completion? I must have worded myself wrong. My pledge is for a working bitcoind, I don't really care for the GUI part at this point. And also rebasing is most simply not possible as the code bases have diverged a lot. Like I have mentioned before I can provide a diff for the namecoin specific changes over the bitcoin source as it was. heh, I actually meant reusing this thread, no need to pollute the forum with yet another one. But hey, whatever works... 2 things you need to do to prevent that; consistently up to date original post (so I can quickly see a FAQ with the denkmalschutz status) including auction terms, date and time of end and current highest bid. That and bump your thread with bid acceptance and daily time to end warnings. Reiterating my vouch for 1000 NMC to whomever get a working namecoind version (source code, obviously) that matches the functionalities of the current bitcoind and allows for keeping track of the developments of bitcoind going forward. I don't care about the UI, though that would certainly help further adoption, but that's best taken as a separate project or it might become a little daunting to do it all in a short time period.My bounty can be extended if someone shows interested and provides a timeline. On the practical side, you can keep the wallet there, run from USB, copy to disk and back (kinda hard to keep doing if you are using the wallet constantly, but good for long term storage), you can also use a brain wallet, a deterministic one like electrum supports, etc.BUT BE CAREFUL! USB drives die, they die much more often than you would expect particularly but not limited to the cheap ones. Keeping a single copy of your wallet in any medium is a bad idea anyway. Shares are bought and priced in whatever the seller decides to accept, really. The initial offering has asks on BTC.dr, LTC.dr and TRC.dr. Following TTBit's example above, if you want to see the order book for TRC you just select that to be the counter and the issuer to be dividendrippler (rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX). See, that's where things get hard to do. You are doing an auction in BTC, an irreversible, pseudo-anonymous crypto-currency that is not officially accepted anywhere state sponsored and are trying to get the whole protection and guarantees of government debt-money. The two are not interchangeable, you have either/or.If you want to be sure you have a guaranteed exchange rate and that you don't have to do your own research on who is trustworthy and you don't want to take responsibility over your actions if you make the wrong decision, then you should only work with fiat.The reason people here are so jumpy about scammers is because the buyer is the one holding most of the risk up to the very end. Sure, bitcoins can plummet, but are you willing to give back the difference if bitcoins rise in value while under escrow?Yes, John might run away with your 25k EUR BTC equivalent, but I can bet you he has right now and at any point in time much, much more than that being held for others. That is why we trust him, and sure he can disappear, but so can you. He has a great track record, you we don't (yet) know.As for all other questions about payment processors you'll have to do your own investigation (which goes full circle on this response). If I were to tell you "sure, don't worry, fully insured and such" would you just believe me? I'm not sure at all what the answer is, btw, I don't trust insured companies anyway, as we all know what happens when it is time for insurance to pay up...But hang in there! We are certainly progressing and even if you end up not selling your house for BTC, this will help any upcoming seller. Just adding to the 'thread hijacking' a little bit, it is normal for buyers to request/require escrow, as that provides a huge safety net to any deal.It is not, however, normal to refuse escrow (not saying you did, not saying you didn't). The only two reasons I can think of for someone refusing escrow are:- You don't trust anyone, which is fair but then why are you trying to have people trust you? (*)- You are trying to pull up a scam. A scammer will never admit to want to scam, and they always have great theories on why escrow isn't needed.(*) - I know there are other mechanisms to secure the deal, as you described. That is all fine except the moment bitcoins are transfered there is nothing that can bring them back, not a court order, not the police, not the best lawyer in the world. If you succeed in making things look legit, receive the coins and then disappear... well... you know. On the other hand, if you are legit and the buyer doesn't pay, you have a physical good that you can prove is still yours, you can have the police arrest the scamming buyer. Hell, you can go there personally and kick the shit out of the guy that tricked you, so you see that while it seems that dealing with bitcoins is the same as any other currency it really isn't.Now, as another potentially interested party I have to ask again, as I didn't see an answer and I'm following this thread eagerly: Will you accept dealing with a bitcoin escrow? I know you said you didn't say you wouldn't, but what I'm asking is if I can bid knowing you will accept a mutually trusted party to hold the coins until the deal is concluded?As for your 'what if btc price plummets', are you going to use a payment processor or are you going to take BTC? It is the same thing for the buyer, but does present an added risk, so as someone (goat?) proposed earlier, would you accept the escrow to hold the funds already converted to your currency of choice instead? That is exactly where a BTC escrow comes in. If you write a cheque you know the money is with you, and the buyer knows they have something to get to the money.With BTC I can give you my private key but there's no knowing when you move the coins using that key and there is nothing I can do about it. Also, you might close the deal and then I move the coins myself (we both have the private key) and there's nothing you can do about it. With escrow none of us holds the private key, and we both have some recourse if something goes wrong (granted, it depends on how much one can trust the escrow). In the end, escrow service is the cheque in normal currency. This particular deal would likely require you to submit some BTC to escrow, enough to justify the buyer to fly in and look at the property and paperwork. Something like;You send 20 BTC to John, the buyer sends whatever the auction ends up costing to John.Buyer flies to DE, meets you, sees property, signs papers, John sends you auction + 20BTC. If buyer flies in and things are not as described or it turns out to be a scam somehow, the 20 BTC get sent to buyer.Your opinion is that escrow is not needed, but would you be willing to accept it regardless? Want kind of municipal taxes does one have to pay on the house (not sure that is the correct name for the taxes). In other words, if I were to buy it what would I be expected to pay yearly to just keep the house legal? Escrow is an entity that will hold the coins until the deal is finished.You agree with the buyer about value and terms, the buyer sends coins to escrow (John is very well trusted, as is Graet, my two go-to people for these deals).You deliver the goods, the buyer tells the escrow it is ok to release the funds, you receive you coins.This way if any of the parties tries to pull some trick the entity serving as escrow has the opportunity to verify which of the sides is not behaving, and send the coins to the other party.Where in Spain are you located? I would very much like to see the car in person, and would likely be interested in buying it myself. Just a quick note to let everyone know the payment processing change described above has been applied.Good luck! True. It was never, to the best of my knowledge, a part of the design that people would trust each other for currency. That's a concept that for the most part works poorly 'in real life' too. But the system does allow for it and there are use cases where it might make sense (see the DYM case from TTBit or the FAV heated discussion).All in all I think you shouldn't (ripple) trust anyone or anything that your don't (really) trust, it's that simple. ripple itself has no responsibility in enforcing any trust relationship. You are the one trusting, make sure you have reasons to trust.Do you use any exchange currently? How can you be sure they will credit your account with the amounts you send in, and when you request for it, that they will send your funds back?This is not specific to ripple, though. We extend banks our trust, probably under the assumption the government will have our backs if the banks misbehave, thus shifting part of our trust to them. In the end it's all down to who we trust, how how much we trust them for (just ask some of the people in Cyprus about that).As a ripple gateway operator I want to say you can trust me, and so on, but in the end I am only as trusted as your perception of it, and that's an individual decision. Usually we're forced into these trust relationships (wanna get your wagers? Open a bank account.) but with ripple you can actually decide that for yourself. Also, the previous change to group payouts in blocks of 5 minutes will be removed. We will still group the payments per address, so only one transaction will be sent for all payments outstanding on a particular address, but we will remove the wait, payments will be sent immediately after bet processing. Could you kindly elaborate on this? What is it exactly that makes this sound like a scam?You need to trust DividendRippler.com for an amount greater... that's the way ripple works, you must trust the sender for at least what gets sent. You are receiving a promise that DR holds that much coins on your behalf, so you must trust DR for at least that.You'll need to flag the server (..) by sending an XRP... We are not getting rich off of you one XRP at a time, and TTBit has mentioned the errors are all retried once per day. You just need to send the XRP to tell the server that "the owner of this address has changed the trust lines and wants an immediate retry".I know many things in the bitcoin realm look good and end up being scams, but providing a comment such as yours adds nothing but uncertainty to the discussion. If you feel we are trying to scam you please provide a reasoning for that. You mean a destination tag? As seen in https://ripple.com/wiki/Require_a_destination_tag_for_inbound_payments that's something you add to the address you are sending to in the form ?dt=<destination tag>DividendRippler.com supports 3 types of destination tags, two static and one dynamic: - ?dt=0 is a 'wishing well', anything you send there is considered a donation. We use this for testing stuff, don't send anything there unless you want to give it to us - ?dt=1 is the 'trigger', used to signal you own an address and approve of pending changes or wish to retry a deposit after fixing the trust lines - ?dt=1xxxxxxxx is the redeem destination tag, there's a different one for each registered ripple address on the site. You send IOUs to your specific dtag and the appropriate funds are sent to the chain addresses you have registered for BTC, LTC or TRC.
I am not being able to find time to do this, and I could really use it.Anybody wants to join in a bounty? I would say that bounty could be collected for an updated namecoin client based on the latest bitcoin code.I pledge 1000 NMC to that, if it can be done within the next 2 weeks (should be a "simple" job, and I can provide a diff from namecoin to the bitcoin version it is based upon, as per vinced's repository) Estão ocupados a receber o pagamento pelos serviços prestados aos bancos? As my German is, well, not I'll post in English.Will you ship outside Germany (but inside EU)? You say the device is packaged original, I'm not sure what that means, but can you share where you bought it (was it an apple store?)  and the date when you did? Will you provide a copy of your invoice for warranty purposes? So because I was (post button) trigger happy the bid increment is suddenly 5 btc? sheesh, it's no fun like this! I give up. We don't have anything of the sort currently in place, and we have been thinking hard about how far we can take the platform. Dividends is "easy", the distribution is handled by ripple, we just have to check who owns what when splitting deposits.With physical items it is slightly harder, as we would need to enforce somehow the delivery of the items. You can have an asset where one unit of participation entitled you to one physical coin, like TTBit's DYM, and DividendRippler can go as far as reporting you sent back 1 DYM to the asset account so TTBit owes you a physical DYM, but that's as far as we can go in an automated way. If people expect DR to enforce delivery we'll need a completely different operation, one I'm not very interested on  That's weird. First of all, the order partially filled was for LTC, not BTC, so did you also put a bid on LTC?There is no single unit here, you can trade a small part of a TBL just like with any ripple supported currency. DividendRippler issues the units but all trading happens on ripple.Do you have an order still open for TBL? Did you not put any bids up for TBL? I have the partial order filled 2 days ago for LTC. We will soon explain why the asks are actually low-ball, and are only so for the sake of testing. Hehe, I actually meant to type 32 and clicked post too quickly, but I'll stand by my bid! You don't need to post to put on watch list! You mean the 'new replies to your posts list' and just for that35 BTC Well, I can't pass on the possibility of getting 30 BTC coins for the BTC value alone AND with free shipping (I'm in EU, btw, are the shipping terms the same?)!Of course that will never fly but it does bootstrap the auction bids 30 BTC Glad it worked out. Now you'll need to wait for TTBit to give you some funds, but you are certainly correctly set up. Your transaction is correct, and was sent to dt=1. The ripple client doesn't show the destination tag on the confirm page, but if it had taken it away the send would not work at all, just try once to send without adding the dt= and you'll see it is not allowed.Anyway, lets retrace your steps and after you have completed the registration we'll be glad to refund you your lost XRP. In steps:- Search for your address in https://dividendrippler.com- Enter what addresses you want to use for redeeming, just BTC is fine, you can even not use any at all- Press register- You'll see the notice to send 1 XRP to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=1 within 5 minutes- Send 1 XRP to rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX?dt=1 before the 5 minutes have expired (I'm assuming this was the problem last time, and I'll check to make sure we don't have a bug in the registration process)- Search for your address again in a few seconds and it should now show you your issue and redeem addresses, and the deposit request warning should be goneLet us know how it goes! Regarding your XRP fate, it depends on where you sent it. can you provide the transaction hash for that (click on the entry in the ripple client history)?The redemption addresses you can put just bitcoin, or even not put any at all, but you can only redeem (receive the coins you have as DR IOUs) if you have an address set. You do realize this is not a XRP giveaway, right? There is currently a BTC/LTC/TRC giveaway (in DividendRippler IOUs) going on to have the community help on beta testing, but you need to be able to get yourself a ripple account and fund it with XRP on your own The Destination Tag: We have a gateway address to which you can send ripple stuff, like when you want to redeem IOUs you already hold. For us to know which account you want to withdraw to we require you add that information using the destination tag, which is a ?dt=xxx after the gateway address (xxx is a number).There is one special case, ?dt=1 which is used to trigger actions on DR, like confirming you really want to register your ripple address with us.How far are you in the process? Do you have any specific problem we can help with (other than lack of XRP)? You sent to destination tag 0 (?dt=0) and the site clearly states ?dt=1, does it not? Don't just send again, please, you'll have to do the registration again and send within 5 minutes of initial registration. All you need to do is search for your ripple address in the site (search box at top right) and all the account details on DR will be shown. We will be introducing another change to the payout system soon: There will be no 1 satoshi feedback sent on losing bets by default anymore, so if you lose you must check the web site to verify that.If you are using a betting script and need the feedback you can add 5000 satoshis to your bet and those 5000 satoshis will be returned if you lose. Note that the full bet amount will include the 5000 satoshis, so that's not a fee, just a signal.Please raise your voice if this presents a problem to you. I am really sorry about that haitispaceagency, I'm sure you were going to win too. But it could have taken a few years at the rate we were going  Ok, I'm going to cancel all 3 DoC pipes for the iTunes cards, as there was almost no interest in them and it seems silly to keep trying to update the target price to match the exchange rate. One day I'll automate that and it will be fine, but for now a little house cleaning is in order.If I don't get some discordant voices in less than 24 hours, the pipes will be closed.
This raffle was cancelled and bets refunded. I have started doing it, but haven't been able to dedicate enough time. Basically need to debug why I get no responses from the seed nodes at this point. Is there anyone that can provide me with a quick tl;dr of the differences between bitcoin and namecoin in terms of communication protocol between peers and wallet format? What would rebasing namecoin daemon onto the latest bitcoin encompass? I could really use some of the updated RPC calls, and it feels like it would be very beneficial for everyone to be able to follow bitcoin development closely.I tried a simple half baked hackish thing with getting the ports changed, the genesis block and the address version to what namecoin has over bitcoin's git head, but I can't get responses from peers (yes, I added namecoin ones using addnode) so I'm assuming there are more changes to the communication protocol.And would it be possible to do this in two steps? First without dealing with namecoin specific features but only wallet and communications, and adding the NS stuff later on?Finally... time for a bounty? Well, no movement at all. I will be canceling this raffle soon and bets will be refunded. Speak up if you have bets placed and prefer that I place all remaining bets. The latter approach will almost certainly make you lose your bets but there is a chance you'll get the FPGAs, whereas the former one will give you back your bet but you can't win anything.I'm giving this at least 8 hours before I pull the plug. Quando comecei nisto dos bitcoins eles eram vendidos a $0.06, e um CPU maneirinho encontrava varios blocos por dia. Quando atingiu $1 foi um momento muito excitante, dificil de acreditar até.Em 2011, quando tocou nos $30 e depois caiu para $2 o fim foi anunciado vezes sem conta mas a verdade é que, independentemente do preço, os BTC não tem concorrência, não há, neste momento, outra coisa igual e isso só por si faz com que eu esteja aqui para ficar.Claro que me "arrependo" de ter comprado coisas com BTCs, afinal se tivesse guardado tinha agora uma reforma multimilionaria, em vez de ter de continuar a trabalhar para pagar as minhas contas. Mas a verdade é que acredito que se os BTC tivessem ficado nos "bolsos" daqueles que como eu já tiveram dezenas de milhares isto nunca tinha dado em nada. É preciso usar, comprar, vender, trocar, pois só assim tem utilidade.E que utilidade, né?  Well, it can't stay where it is and expect value to rise. I'm not sure miners are forcing the fee schedule or it's just the default clients, but if the latter it should be very simple to do. As in, all the bets so far are yours? Well, best of luck and thank you for indulging us with your wagers! Minimum number of bets to unlock the raffle lowered to half of what it was, now 50.If at least half of that isn't covered at this week's end I'll either cancel the raffle and return the bets or, if the number of bets is above 12, place all needed bets myself to unlock the raffle to give bettors a fair chance of winning still. Bump for "not a single bet yet?"Is the deal not attractive enough? Is shipping still 0.5? I know you gave me a discount last time but given the current exchange rate, I feel the need to ask for another one EDIT: I see you say 0.3 in the OP, but then say 0.5. Anyway, how low can you go? What's the price on the eagles? Also TAABL.net has raffles that are provably fair and handle reserve price nicely. Drop me a PM if interested. Morning bump. Yeah, that was likely a side effect of miners failing to see the notice about the mandatory upgrade before block 10k... I know I missed it and while not mining all my TRC services got stuck.I need to pay more attention! And now also for LTC, at 0.5 per bet, all other rules as above! Received my order today. Thumbs up! I'm invested in silver now, it feels good...I'm also raffling it out (at least in part, we'll see how it goes): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=167060.0 Announcing another TAABL.net BitPick raffle; this time for one 1oz 2013 Silver Maples.Particulars to this BitPick;- This is a Pick 4 game- Bet amount is BTC 0.01- No minimum number of bets to unlock the raffle!- Shipping to non-exotic places included, but if the post office frowns upon your country as destination or asks for a huge premium, you'll have to pay extra. If in doubt, ask first.- Shipping is from Europe, tracking is provided but not insurance. If it gets lost, it gets lost. If you want insurance I'll be happy to comply, so as long as you cover the cost.and... good luck!---Maples bought from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=151800.0 (thanks rpietila!)Don't forget to check the other TAABL BitPick raffles It is certainly going to take a long time if noone jumps in I'm not selling it, I'm raffling it, and the main reason is to draw some attention to TAABL, which is my site, and more specifically to the raffle games.Where did you get the $600 figure? Even with BTC price sky high it's about half of that.  This game is not getting the love I expected it to get But here's another bump, anyway. As long as mining is profitable there will always be someone willing to sell quicker for less... it's called free market, I think 
But... but... but... you told me a week ago you wouldn't... I... hmmm... can I cancel my order and place it again? Seriously though, I greatly appreciate you keeping buyer's best interests in check and will be sure to order again (and again). No takers? Any issues or complaints?  You are most welcome. Also, easter bump  Why not? 1 LTC Bought some for TRC, I sent first. Trading immediately acknowledged and sent the XRP, he's now on top of my go-to list when I'm buying again  There is some information at http://taabl.net/howtoplay but the exact Pipe game details are lacking, sorry. In a nutshell you need to send from an address you can receive also, and once the raffle has a winner everyone receives 1 satoshi except for the winner that receives 2.You can also see which transaction had the winning bid when the raffle is done, and from that assert which address belongs to the winner. Weekend bump #1  Bernd33-1 and myself have agreed on this deal, will be asking Graet to escrow. I sent you a PM with my location. Give me a total with shipping included so I can decide, please. Thanks. So it's the v1 version, as per your link, right?How much for the unit sent abroad? And is there anything not wot working perfectly, or any damage I should be aware of? My German is... not  But with the helping hands of google I understand you are selling the NAS with 2 1.5TB drives, right? Will you ship abroad (but still Europe)? bump for raffle start! The BitPick is now live: http://taabl.net/pick?_=51557baa4d8b2039be6546e7 Lets try something different, shall we?The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery will be holding a new Pick Pipe style raffle, as an experiment. The prizes will be stacks of 5 FPGA miner boards, each doing 208~228 MHs and taking ~11W @ 12V, for a total of over 1GHs per stack.These boards are clones of Ztex 1.15x, assembled under license. Ztex did not build these boards no they have any responsibility here. Shipping costs are included to most countries, but if you live in some exotic place known to be hard to ship to please contact us prior to entering the game so we can make sude we can ship at all.There is guarantee other than the boards are working flawless when they reach you!What you get if you win:- The stack with 5 boards, having low profile heatsinks applied without fans- The 120mm fan- The power splitter that connects to a computer PSU molex connector to provide power to the 5 boards.How the game works:It's a simple TAABL Pick 4 game, with individual bets priced at 0.1 BTC. The game becomes active once 100 50 bets are placed and from that point on every time a block is found the block hash is compared to the placed bets. To identify yourself as the winner you'll need to have control over the address from which you sent the coins, so shared web wallets are not going to work.Some pictures:   Will you also pay BTC?  That is quite the opportunity then  I would love to get into this bid war, but Avalon tells me they do not allow changing the recipient address of any order. Are you sure you'll be able to do so? Oh, I did not know this, sorry about it. Ok, in that case I'm just waiting on the reply to my email And, of course, thank you for your continued patience... Thanks for the reply!My note about the fees was triggered by the non-trivial amount by which bitpay reduced them to merchants, to 0.99%. If I understand your reply correctly you have reduced your fees ahead of time and will not sync them with what bitpay is currently charging until you recovered the overhead you have paid? the 1% less in fees really makes a difference to me and if you are going to eventually lower the fees to match bitpay I'll likely wait (and my btc may be worth more by then  ) but if you don't have plans to do so soon I'll just go ahead and buy now (because my BTC may be worth less later  )Anyway, waiting eagerly for your response on the years! That is not a deal breaker though, I'm not a collector wanting those years specifically (it's more of a keepsake thing), so if finding those specific years takes multiple days just let me know, I'll likely order as soon as I have your position on the fees. Looks like you are much faster replying in this thread than through email Can I order a gold eagle round but request that, if at all available, I get coins from a specific set of years with the coins being eagles, maples or krugs, in that order of preference? I know the eagles are the most expensive but I'll gladly pay the eagle premium for a krug if I can get the years I'm searching for.Also, are you going to lower the BitPay processing fee for BTC?And finally, if you need help getting BTC prices in your site I'll be glad to oblige. My time is short to non-existant but as a prospective client this is something I'd like to see and am willing to help you get it going 
I'm not sure you guys are doing it right, but I may be misunderstanding your goal.If you want to move around BitStamp IOUs, other don't need to (I would go as far as saying shouldn't) trust you, they need to trust the issuer.This is very important otherwise the IOUs being moved may not be redeemable on BitStamp, and even if the trust line down to BitStamp is kept it may become expensive to move the IOUs around.The proper way is;- Everyone trusts BitStamp for however much they trust BitStamp- IOUs for BitStamp can be moved around (but each time they move hands the sender pays 0.2% fee) Looking at USPS site I can't find anything significantly cheaper, except for First Class that I can't tell if it is registered or not.If it were the other way around I could send for much, much (did I mention much?) cheaper, but US->EU I wouldn't even know where to start looking outside USPS. Hmmm, I was going to do it now, but I really don't want my name and address on the forum. Can I PM you the rate so I lock it and make the tx, but give the name and address by email instead? It isn't too high at all. As I mentioned I was thinking about much smaller quantities when I first asked about it, and your offer would be great for that. I have changed my mind and am just waiting for confirmation that the 0.3 BTC is applicable today and for the specified quantities.  @rpietila: Thanks! I only saw your post now, is the offer valid for today and for quantities 10~25?@molecular: well, I'm always torn about this. I want to hold on to my BTC, I want to put my BTC to use, I want metals for myself, I want metals for TAABL.net. I guess I'm a little schizophrenic, but aren't we all?  Anyway, I was thinking of getting a couple to test the waters, but now I'm thinking of 10 to 25 rounds. How often I would buy again depends deeply on how well the lotteries are received. Do you have those many that you want to part with? I'll reach some sort of decision soon as I wanted to place an order today.Also, do you have any gold for sale? You go to the Advanced tab and cick on trade. Remove the currency pair from the drop down (you have to select the text box and manually delete the text there) and enter DYM/XRP. You should see TTBit's address or whatever alias you put in your contact in the DYM issuer next to the currency pair dropdown. If not, click on change issuer and select TTBit.Click on Order Book below and in a few secs you should get the order book. Hello,Is there any slower and cheaper shipping alternative to Europe for something like 5x 1/10oz gold rounds? I'm considering getting some silver and gold games going on at taabl.net but your shipping price makes it hard for smaller quantities. Hello rpietila,I'm considering getting some silver and gold games going on at taabl.net. We've had a few private coin lotteries but I wanted to try and keep a steady stream of games as part of the site.Your price is great, of course, but for smaller quantities which, with the uncertainty of bitcoin rates is the only thing I'm brave enough to do, shipping kind of kills it. Is there any cheaper shipping alternative? I don't mind slower and will even go as far as say uninsured (but tracked) is fine for a handful if the shipping price difference justifies it. In reaction to the current value of Bitcoins, we have changed the bet amounts on BTC BitPicks to one tenth of what they were before, so single bets are now:BitPick 2 - BTC 0.05BitPick 3 - BTC 0.01BitPick 4 - BTC 0.01BitPick 5 - will be BTC 0.01 too, but since there is are bets already placed in the running game the change will happen after a winner is foundThe same 1/10 rule will be applied to LTC BitPicks, but only BitPick 2 was changed so far to LTC 5.0 per bet, others will be altered as the active games come to completion.TRC BitPicks remain unaltered.Good luck! Hey DBG, thanks for the kind words. Yes, I have been around for a long time and I'm not going anywhere. These sites are much more fun than profit (in fact, if I summed up the hours I put it I'd be seriously negative) and are ways for learning new tricks to use in more complex projects.But let me just state that DICEonCRACK is not an SD clone at all. It was born out of the frustration of TTBit while playing SD, and it is based on the SD format for sure but the games themselves are significantly different.Anyway, we certainly appreciate all feedback! Yeah, it sure is refreshing knowing some people are even more paranoid than I am... it almost makes me feel normal... almost.Heh, seriously though, given your mention of the Italian community I was hoping the DC was somewhere in Europe and I was going to ask if I could do the deal in person to mitigate the escrow issue, but that side of the pond is no good for me. Where is this datacenter? Well, thanks anyway. Nothing personal, but I'm not sending $600 (or any other amount) in BTC to a new member, particularly one that doesn't even consider escrow. Good luck, though! Will you send outside of Germany (but still in Europe) and will you accept escrow (or trust me  )? Took me a lot longer than expected to revisit this, sorry!Code:computer-2:MacOS cn$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../Dependencies/QtCore.framework/Versions/Current:../Dependencies/QtGui.framework/Versions/Current:../Dependencies:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH bin/python armorybuild/ArmoryQt.pyc Illegal instructioncomputer-2:MacOS cn$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../Dependencies/QtCore.framework/Versions/Current:../Dependencies/QtGui.framework/Versions/Current:../Dependencies:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH bin/pythonIllegal instructionAnd I stand corrected, cause although I have a fairly recent i5 MBP, its kernel seem to be running 32bit modeCode:Darwin sc2.lan 10.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.8.0: Tue Jun  7 16:33:36 PDT 2011; root:xnu-1504.15.3~1/RELEASE_I386 i386Hope it helps you help me... Yes, there was a network issue and my slightly paranoid wager processor locked itself up waiting for human interaction. It's fixed now, all bets placed are being processed and paid.Sorry about that, I'm trying to find less paranoid ways that are still as secure as the ones we have in place now. Estou novamente precisando de comprar BTC por R$... Por volta de BTC 600.Vejo o povo todo comprando BTC, alguem está vendendo? http://diceoncrack.comhttp://taabl.net Go play at diceoncrack.com sorry, couldn't resist, I'm sure mskwik will make good at the end, people get increasingly busy sometimes and TRC was just 'vapor' in terms of value not all that long ago, so not high on most people's priority list. That's the thing with the open market, where there is no reason for a miner to divert hashing from profit making BTC to 300 diff, almost valueless TRC other than to have fun, and even there, since the diff cycles are much smaller the effect would not last (unlike what happened to NMC in the past). It would mean that they could 51% the network but since there is so little tx bandwidth they would profit pretty much nothing.Now the situation changes and TRC become valuable enough to justify an attack (not yet really, but still)... guess what? Diff is no longer 300 and more people jump on board making the network more secure and harder to corrupt as a side effect.So while there are windows of opportunity for an attack, they close really fast!
Advantage list (in random order):- Tone116 mined a bunch of them while diff was very lowthat's all I have for now Disclaimer: I'm just being sarcastic, I have nothing against TRC and try hard to support it as much as I can, as I do with all altchains where people most strongly behind them aren't complete dicks. Even better! So the people that in theory are the ones losing out from all this have the power to do something about it!A new kind of poll is born, a client that does filtered relaying where the user can opt as to what kind of filtering to apply gives that user a vote. Then it is not just he said, she said, it's actually measuring user opinion.But having clients decide on their own relay rules opens a whole new can of worms, of course, and will ultimately open a new angle of attack against bitcoin stability. It does present an interesting case, perhaps worth discussing further. Banning is such a strong word, though. If a majority of miners would in fact refuse such transactions other smaller miners would start getting a lot of orphans and would be forced to either reduce their blocksize drastically or starts filtering out what goes in to their mined blocks. But that's only if the majority of miners sees that as a good thing for the network and their bottom line, no?I mean, one of the most beautiful things about bitcoins, and one of the most criticized features of it at the same time is the lack of an appointed central authority, but majority still rules the chain. Of course, I knew that from my first read of the documentation... thank you for pointing out just how spread I am  @JoelKatz with the db fix mentioned in the issue I opened everything works great, thank you!To infinity and beyond!Now, a small doubt on workflow; I submit a payment for which no trust line exists, I assume this transaction never gets submitted to a ledger, right? At least I could not find my test one. The issue I'm having is one of atomicity, where I submit a tx and note the request ID to match the response, but say between send and response my ws dies, and don't get this response at all.Can I poll for it afterwards? Or is the assumption that if I don't see it in a ledger for a set period of time I can just resubmit the request? The latter feels dangerous if the network is busy and lags a bit. I love how you are sure of that, it's kinda sweet Ok, all jokes aside, I'll have a proper look at it today and will provide you with details other that "I clicked and it did not work". Nope, sorry about that  It is 64bit. I just got here, so I may need to go back and do some reading, but the app does absolutely nothing for me. Double clicking it does nothing, running ~/Downloads/Armory.app/Contents/MacOS/Armory in terminal simply returns... do I need to install something?I can perfectly understand if not all dependencies could be bundled, but a little error would help me greatly  OSX 10.6.8 here. Touché... nothing like having good arguments to assert a point. Tried on a new, much better system, same difference. Opened an issue with the command outputs and config file. I am not defending nor attacking SD, and as I'm running a competitor (which is obviously a drop of water in the ocean, or a 1 satoshi tx in a large block compared to SD).And the point that SD's stressing of the network is a great future proofing test has been made as many times as the SD is evil one. I don't understand why SD hasn't change its behaviour towards the problem but then again that hasn't reduced the amount of users they get, and thus the market has spoken. I would most certainly like to see a better fee equalization algorithm implemented, and would be glad to help achieve it, but it feels to me that most everyone chooses a side and points the finger, spending way too much time repeating "'coz I said so". send me your TRC address if I win  I believe SD sends dustcoins WITH proper tx fees. SD is paying the vast majority of fees now included in blocks, and has been for a while. I usually steer clear of these particular trains of thought, but you do understand SD wasn't responsible, right? A bug in the BDB code caused this, and yes, SD did trigger the bug but while it was a nuisance to be very mild (I lost almost 4 hours of what was otherwise already too little sleep for this), it does mean some big enterprise (read government) that happens to find this bug can't create havoc and properly abuse this situation with properly prepared double spends and the like.Honestly, I strongly believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion, mine isn't better than yours outside my own system of values but this community should keep together a little better and your constant calling wolf isn't helping, in my opinion... it is just my opinion! I don't really care too much what other people think anyway, unless I perceive a chance of learning from them. 1000 TRC... Doc has confirmed, but something wasn't working and he is fixing it, I believe. So it is 0.7 but is currently down. And I just made another thread on this...Anyway: [02:19am] Luke-Jr: nelisky: EclipseMC and Eligius are unaffected; slush, BTCGuild, and Ozcoin are "working on it"And bitminter mined an orphan on the 0.7 chain too, but there's no official word on it yet. from IRCCode:[02:19am] Luke-Jr: nelisky: EclipseMC and Eligius are unaffected; slush, BTCGuild, and Ozcoin are "working on it"Bitminter appears to be safe too as it mined an orphan on the 0.7 chain, but no official word yet.If you know of others please speak up.LOCKING: go here instead -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152048.0 If the coins you sent were old enough (not from a block mined during the fork) you will be just fine. Even if the receiving PC is on the wrong chain in a few hours the good chain will pick up and have your transaction. I was building on my previous post stating "if they have more than 11 confirmations as of block 225446". But you are right that it was misleading, just trying to write as fast as one can.
Coins are safe because your transactions will exist in the 0.7 blockchain too. Only issue is double spending and that's why you should not buy any coins from anyone right now. PLEASE don't trade with anyone offering good deals right now  There is a very good chance they are trying to take advantage of the chain fork.IF YOU ARE NOT MINING just go do something else for a while! Anything with more than 11 confirmations (at block 225446) is safe, anything with less may or may not be but all transactions will be retried so bar intended harm there should be no issue for users. Just don't trust coins with less than 11 confirmations at this point, better yet, don't use your client for the next few hours at all and everything will come back to normality. Oh, but it does, at least if you do "account_tx account ledger" for a specific ledger id (as opposed to a range).Still haven't had a chance to try this over a better machine but I'll report on that once I get it done. Yes, I did. Had I not done it there would be an error 'No such ledger'. It also dawned on me I'm using a very low end 32bit machine for this, not all that much ram also. I will try to run this on a separate system that has proper server specs. I removed the whole db directory, so I'm sure that's not it. I have now built from a clean checkout, started without any database, ledger_history is 65536 and... it still happensIf I issue the same account_tx to s1.ripple.com it returns the correct data, but against my local ripple it gives me nothing (for the source address, it is correct for the destination address). I have a small debug log that I will provide you, but it gives you little to nothing from what I could read.Can you tell me the exact revision that is running on s1.ripple.com? Are there other public servers I can try the account_tx command against? Same difference, ./rippled account_tx rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX 339675 339675Connecting to: 127.0.0.1:5005{   "result" : {      "account" : "rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX",      "status" : "success"   }}Oh, well, gona build from a fresh checkout now I have nuked the db and changed ledger_history to 65536, now waiting for rippled to catch up with the ledger in question.What was happening was: I had the ledger (339675), a 'rippled ledger 339675' would show it (in full default with 'full'), and then:./rippled account_tx rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt 339675 339675would show the transaction./rippled account_tx rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX 339675 339675would not (but not with a 'ledger not found' error, should wouldn't show any tx detail)../rippled account_tx rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX 339675./rippled account_tx rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt 339675Both the above commands would also not show errors nor anything about the tx.Running any of these commands against s1.ripple.com does work as expected, so it is something local to me. "complete_ledgers" : "339007-341774"source @f3b837eea654deec3572a89a000f2b6e13156f6a, same issue. I'll nuke and start afresh, probably something went sideways with my deploy. Sure, I'm kind of, sort of aware of that (I didn't know to look for complete_ledgers) but since I get one half of it, the received payment tx, I should have the ledger, right?This does present a separate issue, though; how much is enough? If I start the server with history to 256, does that mean it prunes history to last 256 while running, or just that on startup it requests only the past 256 ledgers (if they aren't already local).I guess my question is how to properly handle long periods between polling the server for new tx. @JoelKatz it appears this only happens agains my local rippled, so something must have gone wrong with it. I'm recompiling to the latest, but if it keeps happening is there something you'd want me do before I nuke everything out and start from scratch? Nope, I'm asking for 2 tx only. I'll send you the exact query tomorrow (work computer already off for today). For my current use case I need a polling approach to following up transactions (as opposed to subscribing to events). This is all fine for payments received but I can't see any reference to payments sent from the source account. I can in fact see the transaction received on the destination.Is this by design? Shouldn't payments sent also appear in account_tx? Changes to the payout system are effective now. Let us now of any concerns or issues you might have and...Good luck! Last bump regarding the upcoming changes posted above in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120239.msg1598128#msg1598128Next post on the subject will be to say the changes have been applied  Chances to win 1 DYM at TAABL.net!Currently 1 DYM goes for ~$2 or roughly 0.045 BTC, so I have started a BitPick for 1 DYM (there will be two in total, one after the other) with bets priced at 0.005 BTC.NOTE: This is a Pick 2, meaning it will win when the first 2 hex chars of a block hash match your bet, so it will likely be awarded quickly and with a very small bet count! You need to act fast if you want it Common BitPick rules apply, the winner must be able to sign a message with the sending bitcoin address private key. I don't know the specifics of the contracts between nodes, if there are any, but while ripple is fundamentally different from bitcoin it does have one thing in common, the network is distributed which means that as long as there are 2 nodes, the network is alive between them (though disconnected from the rest, if there is a rest, and reconnection may invalidate things that diverged, just like in bitcoin).So, when you said ripple dying I assumed no nodes communicating. Since I can run a node myself I have a copy of the ledger locally. Keep in mind ripple is still closed beta to some extent so there are not enough nodes in the wild to support the network on such fails, which is a good thing at the moment as the rules and code are still being tweaked and the ripple team has some control over which versions are available and thus prevents network partitioning.As for you question to TTBit, let me try to explain. The person who took delivery gave back the IOUs to TTBit, which means TTBit doesn't owe that person the 10 dimes anymore... this is the real kicker, we usually see money as something of substance (even though that is more often than not untrue) but in this case there is no misunderstanding, having a DYM is not having a dime, in fact TTBit has no DYMs at all, there's no such thing for him as the issuer. What there is is a balance of dimes TTBit states he has and owes you. When he sends the coins and receives the DYMs he is in reality destroying the DYMs, because he owes them no more.This means that if a bunch of people wanted delivery, that bunch of people would hold IOUs they would be redeeming and TTBit's "DYM contract" states he holds the physical dimes for every DYM issued, thus he would most simply send out the dimes and the IOUs would be extinguished.Now, if demand would rise and he wanted to put more DYM into the market, keeping with the rules he put forward initially, he would have to acquire the dimes through whatever means he chose and hold them physically before issuing more IOUs, but that's just because he chose to do business like that.You can choose to say you'll sell DYMs without holding dimes, but you can't sell TTBit DYMs without him holding the dimes, and for you to sell your own DYMs others need to trust you for them. Also, beware of extending trust to individuals (as opposed to issuers). TTBit is DYM's issuer, so that is fine, but trusting him for BTC at this moment may give you some grief, not because he is not to be trusted but because Ripple isn't yet handling that as well as it should (but that is being fixed).As for the "two week old" part, consider this; If you hold silver and you store it in a bank's safe (not saying you do, just go along with it) you hold the silver, it is yours, not pegged to the dollar and all but... you have to trust the bank to not steal your silver. That's what is happening here, you are trusting TTBit to hold the silver for you. Ripple is just a ledger, and a public one for that matter, meaning that if tomorrow ripple just dies, never to be seen again, I'll  still have access to that ledger and, even if I didn't, you trust TTBit to give you the silver as per the DYM you held so as long as you can convince him you actually held that much.Ripple facilitates all this and is an amazing tool for that, but we are used to dealing with 3rd party insurance, banks are audited, we have protection so we don't need to do due diligence to assert we are dealing with small or no risk. With bitcoins and ripple there's a dramatic change there, we are solely responsible for whom we trust and (with ripple) for how much we trust them. Ripple facilitates, keeps books, processes transfers, but it is your responsibility to know there is no recourse, trust only those that you actually trust and for how much you trust them. It doesn't need to be an option, you can manually type it in. I am "completely neutral" about DICEonCRACK  and we are trying to prevent getting into the same spam issue as SD by grouping payouts as best as we can: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120239.msg1598128#msg1598128 and by providing a wallet proxy (for now only on IRC) that does not signal losses with dust transactions https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=147722.0I honestly believe that a proper solution needs to be found for the transaction spam issue for bitcoin as a whole, not targeting any specific service as this is severely needed to ensure bitcoin will survive globalization. Also, each miner has the freedom to choose which transactions to include in the found blocks, period. I wouldn't join a pool that filters anything because I believe the prioritization currently in existence is good enough. I'm invested in bitcoins for many reasons, not the least of which being the lack of central authority. We can boycott but we can't ban, simple as that, only a majority vote can steer the network one way or another, not an institution or a core group of developers.This post started as a simple shameless plug "look at me, I'm trying neat solutions here" but ended up with my personal view of the problem... I need to learn to stay on topic!
Only 2000 TTBit/DYM exist, and they are all backed up by real dimes (you have to trust TTBit to be honest, of course). So when you buy with XRP you are buying one of those 2000 DYMs and thus one that is fully backed by real dimes.To trade on DYMs (and have them appear in the balance sheet and currency dropdown) you just need to trust TTBit's address for however many DYMs you trust him for. You can only receive as many as you trust. Enter his address in the trust add, write DYM in the currency and state how many to trust and you are good to go. Bump for previous post, the payout transactions will be changing soon! We have a new feature creeping in, which is an attempt to mitigate the issue with blockchain bloating, at least to some extend.We're calling it the Bet Groups; wager payouts are going to be grouped by return address, and an attempt is made to join as many payouts as possible in a single transaction. This is the current plan:Only transactions paying to the same address are grouped. This is to prevent issues with double spent transactions screwing everyone's payouts amongst other things.The connection between wager input transaction and payment is kept, so there will be one output for each input in order to make it easy to assert no cheating is being done. Note that there might be an extra input when payout is larger than received amount, and an extra output for collecting change and these may shift the inputs and outputs such that input 0 connects to output 1, etc.  there is one exception, which is when using IRC proxy wallets the losing wagers don't pay anything as there's feedback in the IRC chat window, reducing the 'dust'. This means the input for these losing wagers is not present in the payout.Wagers are grouped for at most 5 minutes, meaning any payout in queue for an address will be immediately paid once the oldest queue entry is over 4 minutes old.When an address queue has 5 or more payouts, they are sent regardless of queue entry age.Many of the bets we get on the site come from what I believe are betting bots, and these might be processing the payout transactions for feedback. If that's the case they'll probably be confused with this new system so we are only turning it on for IRC proxy wallets for now, but will make it global in a couple of days if there are no major concerns with this from players.The IRC version of DICEonCRACK is explained in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=147722.0As always, good luck! Looking at account_tx now, trying the full range of ledger indexes (0 to 323284 currently) I get 6 results back, all of them failed attempts at sending (the tecPARTIAL_PATH I've reported). There are 4 events in the account history (receiving XRP, receiving BTC and sending a custom currency) that aren't referenced at all in account_tx. Is this expected?I assumed account_tx would be a filtered version of tx_history, but I may be confusing the command semantics. Would you be interested in discussing the system with DICEonCRACK for eventually creating a new strategy there based on it or is it a "trade secret"? I have been somewhat skeptical of ripple as it was taking me a long time to grasp what its basic usefulness was in the first place.I must say that playing with it with TTBit for a while I've had a proper AHA moment and while it is a great way of dealing with exchanges, and that is a fine thing to do, I believe the real feature behind it is the fact that having trust lines and public ledgers allows for applying the concept of credit outside the reality of simple currencies. While there are still some kinks to iron off we already have a bunch of ideas to leverage what appears to be an amazing system to operate services well outside the simple exchange reality. Took a lot of time, sure, but while developing these new ways of using ripple implies a deep understanding of the going-ons, using services based upon it should not.I am in no way affiliated to ripple but since yesterday I really wish I was  Yes, issuer, still getting used to the semantics here. The cases that are failing for me (including the one I pasted the RPC call for) are all V shaped. Both ends trust one 3rd party issuer, none trust the other, so I am trying to move Bitstamp IOUs from walletA to walletB, where none of the wallets has extended credit to the other, but both have for Bitstamp.If walletB had extended credit to walletA, the transfer would succeed but instead of sending the Bitstamp IOUs walletA would issue its own IOUs to walletB. This is all fine, except that having done that I was then not capable redeeming walletA's IOU from walletB to Bitstamp.I am always working under the assumption that both the V shaped transfer and the latter paragraph example (full circle?) are legal and are only failing due to something wrong with the found paths. The specific error 'Path could not send full amount.' (tecPATH_PARTIAL) appears to say that there aren't enough IOUs in the path to move the full amount transfered, which could be easily solved by taking the shortest path of no hops other than the wallets involved + the issuer, but I haven't looked at the actual code, so this is just a wild guess. So rKLw2zHgA31nRZN3erfZkfR8uhAkQ8s95P wants to send to rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt. rKLw returns the IOUs it holds from Bitstamp and Bitstamp issues a new set of IOUs to rhR5j5LXsujSuwG2bcn1P39utdTA79ceaW. This in turn issues own IOUs to rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3E which issues own IOUs to rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt.Why the extra hops if rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt trusts Bitstamp? And these IOUs from rGwUWgN5BEg3QGNY3RX2HfYowjUTZdid3E, are they still Bitstamp IOUs as far as the recipient is concerned?It might just be late here, but I fail to understand why this "complicated" path would ever need to take place, unless there's already an outstanding balance between the multiple nodes that would get settled with this transaction. In 1) will order books ever be used automatically, i.e. if I send USD but only have BTC, or is that limited to when dealing directly with orders?As for 2) that is pretty smart, I must say. It does not apply to the case where both sides of a trade trust a common exchange but not one another, right? So the 3 paths I see are actually 2 paths and are alternative ways of proceeding with the transfer? Could you take the first one and convert it to an english sentence?

Can you help me understand what I'm looking at above (a pointer to the documentation is fine)?FYI this is one case where I would assume the transfer should be possible but it fails with the partial path error. Thank you, Joel. It works, so please note that the wiki is wrong here No on to parsing the result... In trying to jump in to find out why I'm having issues and which paths are being involved, I tried calling the ripple_path_find RPC command, according to the instructions on the wiki https://ripple.com/wiki/RPC_API#ripple_path_find but it is failing complaining about invalid arguments:Request:{"destination_amount": "0.05", "source_currencies": [{"currency": "BTC"}], "command": "ripple_path_find", "source_account": "rKLw2zHgA31nRZN3erfZkfR8uhAkQ8s95P", "destination_account": "rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt"}Response:{u'status': u'error', u'error_code': 23, u'error_message': u'Invalid parameters.', u'request': {u'destination_amount': u'0.05', u'source_currencies': [{u'currency': u'BTC'}], u'command': u'ripple_path_find', u'source_account': u'rKLw2zHgA31nRZN3erfZkfR8uhAkQ8s95P', u'destination_account': u'rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt'}, u'error': u'invalidParams', u'type': u'response'}Any clues into what I'm doing wrong? I will gladly take this offer for the right price, but I can't really say what that is... Just taking BTC as reference, how is that rate currently? Last I checked it was roughly 1BTC/100k XRP. 1 ltc was 0.004 btc so 400 lyc/100k xrp? Everything is failing just the same, I'm afraid.So the workflow that is failing is, in a nutshell:walletA trusts bitstamp for 1 BTCwalletB trusts bitstamp for 1 BTCwallet A gets a 0.1 BTC transfer from bitstampwallet A cannot send any BTC to wallet B - Paths are calculated but when sending one of partial path or fee insufficient will be thrown.Are you able to run the workflow described yourself?[edit] - above is the simplified workflow that is failing now, the original issue was slightly more complicated:walletA trusts bitstamp for 1 BTCwalletB trusts walletA for 1 BTCwalletB trusts bitstamp for 1 BTCwalletA gets a 0.1 BTC transfer from bitstampwalletA sends 0.05 BTC to walletB - it appears as walletA BTC IOUwalletB cannot send any BTC to bitstamp - Paths are calculated but when sending one of partial path or fee insufficient will be thrown. Yes, 0.1, sorry for confusing things. 0.15 was on the other use case. Still, if you look at the transfer I'm attempting you'll see I only try to move 0.019960 BTC (that's 0.02 minus the 0.2%) and that fails. I try a second transfer for 0.08 minus 0.2% and that fails in exactly the same way. I never try to move more than 0.0998.I'll try everything from the start in a bit and will let you know if the result is somehow different. I'm one of the responsible parties for TAABL.Thank you very much for reporting this, I have paused the Pipe Pick in question and will try to contact BitCoiner2012 regarding this issue. It's pretty much the exact same, I'm afraid. Full amount (0.15) complains about partial amounts, less (0.1) complains about fees.I created another wallet for holding funds for one of my services, and for playing with the RPC interface.

Am I doing something wrong or is this just another case of bad path resolve? Thank you for the pointer. Turns out this initial request I made was right in front of my face and I just failed to see it; https://ripple.com/wiki/RPC_API#account_linesI still have to filter the currencies and there's no batching which may make things hard with huge ledgers, but it is there and is real easy. Ok, so I have been hard at understanding the whole ripple concept and it has spawned some neat ideas. As a coder I tend to try and understand frameworks in as much of a hands on approach as possible, so I thought I'd ask those who are in the know how to go about this.The history and all transactions are public, so I could parse my way through said history to get to the information I need, but is there a simpler way? I want to know, for a specific currency and issuer, who is holding IOUs and how much each wallet has, say I want to know every wallet that has Bitstamp BTCs and how many of them they have.
Since I don't find any hind as to your location, I'm assuming you are in the US side of the pond? I have done both TRC and LTC betting in large quantities, but the redeem part was never part of those tests so no, I have no experience with the LTC counterpart of this. We're having issues with the processing server this morning, so that has my full attention right now, but I'll run some tests on LTC soon and will let you know. At all times TTBit held more than enough Bitstamp IOUs. Could TTBit have sent the BTC IOU if I didn't trust TTBit/BTC?I will try again today and if still failing will PM you all the details. This is actually a very fair point. However it is provable that no such tampering is happening as the choice of inputs is predictable, the older unspent transactions are used in order until the output value is satisfied, so it can't really be tampered with by the bot. The bot is actually placing bets as you would with the client. The difference is bets placed that way are always trusted and thus immediately processed / paid. If you were to try to do the same thing with your TRC client eventually the system's heuristics would start delaying the payouts until transactions were included in blocks. I will gladly send you some TRC to try that if you feel so inclined, though, PM me your address. I'm a little lost here. I've been trying to play around with someone I trust IRL (TTBit) and we managed to understand a bit more of the system's workings but got stuck in this workflow (value are bogus, but relatively equal to what we're doing, and we all trust each other and bitstamp):TTBit deposited BTC to BitstampTTBit sent BTC from Bitstamp to Ripple-- at this point TTBit has 2 BTC of green line on ripple BTC trust --TTBit sent 0.15 BTC to neliskynelisky tries to send 0.15 BTC to bitstamp, which fails with "Fees are insufficient"nelisky tries to send 0.10 BTC to bitstamp, which fails with "Path could not send partial amount"So what are we missing here? I wouldn't say they are withholding, it's probably just a propagation issue. But yes, it scales terribly right now.The hash is on the TX itself, and does not change. So yes, as soon as it is broadcasted. There is a double spending problem, sure, we even suffered some loss recently for it (but have since closed that door) but that's exactly why you can't withdraw without ALL tx being in blocks. That is Martingale for you, with the basic premise that you have a target and every time you lose you adjust the bet to meet the target. So if my skilled work is worth, I don't know, 10x minimum wages in my country I could charge 10 HRS per hour of work? Well, you know that TRC's network is very, very thin compared to BTC. Difficulty is currently ~570 where BTC is 4000000+. Why that means transactions are placed in block in such small batches I don't know, but you will just have to be patient, I guess. It is a very important detail going forward, though, thanks for reporting it. I'm trying to think of ways to prevent the problem from escalating. If you look at http://cryptocoinexplorer.com:3750/address/1AiNAHGBdB6Mu4UVDWHcukKXacNy19avUy which is the address for the wallet you'll see that the last transaction there is on block 82355 which is the last block processed so far. Take this information with caution as the block explorer tends to lag behind significantly, but until the last transaction has 4 blocks on it you will not be able to redeem.As for Win Cap, Simple pays based on the individual Bet Size, which is 0.1 for TRC, and Minefield pays based on the actual wager you place. So Win Cap is easily reached with those.The Martingale based strategies, however, work in a completely different way. Each iteration places a bet that is high enough to add 0.1 TRC to the expected outcome at that iteration, so the most you can win at any point during the game is iteration x 0.1. What threshold changes is how much each bet is, so for less than 5 the bet would be (0.1 / multiplier) x iteration. You can read about Martingale on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system) and the difference between the multiple Martingale bet strategies we offer is explained on http://diceoncrack.com/howtoplay though if this is the first you hear about it things may be a little dense and hard to understand. If that's the case I'll be glad to explain using one of your bets as an example. Indeed, although 25 BTC win cap would allow for placing a bet of up to 0.0019 BTC which is above the min bet. But Win Cap is not set in stone, it is just a product of demand and security. As the core gets more mature and interest raises we'll be glad to up the limits. You can, in fact, place bets on Poker for under the Bet Size, I kind of lead you the wrong path here. There's a minimum wager of 0.1 TRC and no bets below that will be processed, but what the Bet Size means for poker is how much each full hand costs. So when you play 0.1 you'll get the winning hand multipliers applied to that, plain and simple. If you had placed a bet of 1.5 TRC you would play 2 hands, one for 1 TRC (Bet Size) and 1 for the remainder balance, 0.5 in this case. 10 TRC would be 10 hands, etc.Less Than 1, 2 and 5 are refunded due to the site's Win Cap, currently 1000 TRC. If you bet, for example, 0.1 TRC in a less than 5 game that pays 13041.664x, a single win would render you a prize of 1304.17 TRC, more than the site will pay out for any single bet. This takes precedence to Exit point, as otherwise you would get 1300 TRC of prize but only get paid 2x your deposit, or 0.2 TRC.Thank you so much for all the testing! I'm addressing the other issue you posted about earlier now. The LTC offers are all gone for now. As for the minimum bet size, you do realize it is 0.1 TRC generally, only poker is 10 TRC per hand, right? ef381996c32df6edef9c3aabf45bc6629b707bbac516a66bf2b9d05d36a1b8fdThank you for your help. There isn't any particular feature, no, we are just making sure the processing/payout is rock solid and get some feedback on the process as we go. f5a028274b1f9448a8146cd45825e871dd2ea65b1132dd56a3cc7d98c1016187That's the last one for LTC at this time. Good luck! Thank you for playing! Poker is one of the games I most often play when testing things. You can win very large amounts, but you will more often than not lose everything. It's one of the bets 'luck' games we have in terms of expected payout, but not a good one to start with.Although from your experience I'll not expect to see you around too often, please feel free to come take advantage of the test spree handouts we'll have in the near future  TX id is 3044bc1fd233dcdb84d7cfcb2bcc47e03aec3d911957e5e83f5a2b125072cf67, good luck! Heh, yes, the house does have the advantage, although I have to say we have been in loss more than once for substantial amounts. It all averages out if you don't know when to quit Thank you for trying this, I hope you'll keep playing. After all the transactions confirm you can redeem but if you just wait it out you'll get the coins back after 8 hours passed from your last bet automatically (assuming everything has confirmed, which is more than likely with LTC).We will have more giveaways in the future for testing new features, so keep an eye open for them. Thank you for the kind words. 10 LTC have been sent to your wallet in tx 7d5f9f1f00d43bbeb0945e7d5303bdfe66ca3677c71d399fc94ff9613ba67e12 and should be available right now.As for your comment on min bet, the problem is fees, as we are paying for them. If you bet and lose we may end up paying more on fees than you wagered in the first place, which is not something we can sustain obviously.Good luck!
We can most certainly entertain that idea. Does bitbet provide any kind of API for listing open bets? I assume it would still be required to create the bets on site.  Moved the giveaway offer to it's own thread on alt currencies: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=148367.0 You can now play DICEonCRACK on IRC!https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=147722.0But we need your help things out, particularly on the LTC and TRC versions of the game. To that effect I'm offering 10 LTC to the first 3 people that post a docbot LTC wallet address and 100 TRC to 2 people that post a docbot TRC wallet address. There will probably be more giveaways as I introduce upgrades we have in the pipeline.The rules are:- You put at least as much in wagers as I have offered.- If you win anything it's yours to redeem or continue playing.- If something goes wrong you report back ASAP.- If you can find the time to share your overall experience here and help us improve the bot, that's even better though not required.This offer was originally posted on the linked thread above and has also been posted on the LTC forum, only one taker for TRC so far. EDIT: No more LTC offers at this point, but check back soon! I would have never guessed it to be so hard to give away some altcoins... Offer still valid! I assume the first bet is this: http://diceoncrack.com/tx?_=5131091c4d8b205791008e1bYou've bet 0.3 on Simple Strategy, which makes 0.001 bets, up to 15000 of them, and each one, if it is a win, will multiply that 0.001 by 2.048X. See the graph on that page for the details of your particular bet.You can read about the many strategies we offer at http://diceoncrack.com/howtoplay and on the OP for this thread. You can also ask here and we'll do our best to explain, if you have any specific doubt. Still have all 3 LTC offers available, as well as 2 TRC and will be calling it a day soon, so act soon if you want it today. Tomorrow is fine too  I'm also giving away 10 LTC to the first 3 that post a docbot LTC wallet here, same rules as above for TRC. I'm also posting this on the litecoin forum, so that's 3 from both fora combined. TradeFortress: should be good now, have fun and good luck. No, not really, all values are integers (the float there is just a representation thereof). I'll fix that issue now. Thanks for catching it! Just a heads up to warn that we will be updating the LTC strategies bet size, lowering it it 1/10 of what it was before.The reasoning is simple, the lower the bet size the more iterations you get out of your wager, but the lower the expected outcome of each is. We have started the altchains at 100x the BTC bet size, but since there is a major value difference between TRC and LTC, this change should improve the overall experience for LTC.EDIT: minimum wager will not go down as LTC fees are way too high, only bet size is lowered Sent, txid is f98e75d04a15775183644154331890449738f574ee00d49924b4390539febecf, you should see the balance immediately. I will be giving out 100 TRC to the first 3 people that post a docbot TRC wallet address and all I ask in return is that you play those 100 TRC. If you win anything it's yours to redeem or continue playing. If you can find the time to share your experience here and help us improve the bot, that's even better though not required. I'm mining with singles on 2.10.5, and it works just fine. What version are you using?PS: The "capability missing" is normal, it is just informing you. I have to apologize for the lack of information. Assuming you already went through http://taabl.net/howtoplay let me tell you that playing is much MUCH simpler than understanding the how to - Elect your game(s), from Pick 2 to Pick 5 (the number after the Pick is the number of characters that will be matched, the larger this number the less likely it is to match with the next block).- Place your bet(s) - careful not to use web wallets where you don't control the addresses and private keys, as the wins will be paid back to the address you sent from.- After two confirmations the bet is added to the Pick, you can see which is yours by looking for your payment transaction hash.- When the pick matches, a winner is found. The winner gets the pot, all others get a few satoshis (same number as the Pick) to signal the pick has ended.I'll be glad to go into detail on any part of the workflow, just let me know what your exact questions are. We have had both a Pick 2 and a Pick 3 won on the LTC games in the past couple of days. Congratulations to the winners! And we're back. Go ahead and increase the site traffic  I just noticed this, and it would be great if it was too much traffic but that is very unlikely. The hosting company has had a lot of power issues lately, I guess that if they don't get their act straight we'll need to shop around for alternatives.Will push them to get things back online asap, thanks for the heads up! I won the taabl raffle myself, as there has only been one bet in a looong time. Just to be fair I placed a few more bets to unlock the raffle and I will be be glad to return the 0.1 BTC that someone has wagered to the rightful owner.That card, along with the other 2, is now available on DICEonCRACK.com, and you can win it with your Terracoins.In a nutshell, there are 3 cards with the following target prizes:BTC -     0.30LTC -   150.00TRC - 2000.00You will be able to place bets from 0.001 BTC, 1.0 LTC and 1.0 TRC respectively, the larger the bet, the better the odds of winning. Also available for LTC now - Send your wagers to LPipeGWLJjMcKFZoE8GjDNCJT7mJEfcCpx Target prize lowered to 0.3 BTC... an easy snatch now 
rLDDq8ZGhCaVBP8MyYTifhCJzgWPQBjwpt We have just doubled the seeding on all TAABL.net LTC BitPicks. You can win a bundle for as low as 10 LTC   Everything should be up and running again.Also, although still in careful testing, we are allowing immediate processing of unconfirmed transactions again! Some will still not be processed immediately, such as when the fees are lower than required, in which case they will get processed when they get into a block.Good luck! If you got a bet showing as 'retained' on DoC:We've had a little issue with the hot wallet and I'll have to hand pick some transactions to pay these out, something I don't want to do while tired. You will get paid tomorrow, sorry for the inconvenience! Depends on the rate, how many LTC would you be willing to trade?Sure, and I could also buy LTC for BTC, but I have excess TRC for my testing needs and not enough LTC, so why take the extra hop (assuming I can avoid it) ? Since the market on the only exchange I found that handles TRC <> LTC is way too thin, is anybody interested in exchanging your LTC for my TRC? Most of the LTC I get will end up in TAABL.net and DICEonCRACK.com  Service disruption announcement;We've been having network connectivity issues with the hot wallet, and it's currently offline preventing any wager processing. I'm resolving this and all bets placed will be processed once that is done.I'll also work on adding some redundancy there during this week, sorry for the inconvenience. I would almost argue that lovely, flashy and round-cornered designs are indicators that a site is very profitable, which for gambling sites just starting doesn't really raise the expected outcome for players.It might just be me, and granted I'm a coder by trade, but SD's older site design was easier for me to understand, and that's the one I based diceoncrack on. There are *many* things that are wrong with our design, and some are even functional, but we can only dedicate so much time to this pet project. Until it pays off like SD and we can justify employing people to dedicate serious effort, I'd rather spend all my free time making sure the core works as solidly as possible and the UI is fully functional.Just my 2 satoshis on the matter. No love for TRC yet at taabl.net, and we have seeded all lotteries! Everyone celebrating the Chinese New Year?Also, who do I ask to get TAABL added next to DICEonCRACK on http://terracoin.org/links/ ? They are sister sites but completely independent services. Thanks! Just a small nitpick if I may, as diceoncrack.com accepts not only TRC but also LTC and taabl.net (the original bitcoin lottery mk2) also accepts LTC and TRC now.And making the most of this small thread bump, we have seeded the lotteries at taabl, and will keep doing so as time permits, so better odds of winning a nice bundle! Just letting everyone know DICEonCRACK.com and TAABL.net now support TRC and LTC  Thank you, it is really nice to be here... I just love the matching hats, you know and sure, I'll take a cigar  Well, it is our pleasure  We don't endorse any of the alt chains in particular but LTC and TRC were the ones that had the most up to date client I could find, supporting DoC's needs without much tinkering.Now, as for your not getting coins back, I'm not familiar with terrawallet.com but remember that the system pays to the address of the first input in the transaction. This means that if you are using an online wallet chances are they send coins from their pool of addresses and you lost your payment to them.This is very important and is stated on the site and on the original post for DoC: You must have control over the address(es) from which the coins are sent, because that's where your earnings will be sent to!Do get in touch with me by PM about this and we'll work something up for the wager you already placed, but don't place any other from an online wallet, that will NOT work. ! DOWNTIME AHEAD !But just a little bit  Sometime in the next few hours I'll be updating the server which will require a little downtime. All wagers will be processed and paid regardless, but may not as quickly as expected and the web site will be down at times.We will post when the update is complete. Sorry about that, we had a little glitch in the wager processing code. Everything should be correct now, but do let us know if that's not the case.Oh, and thanks for the praise, we really appreciate it! Your fangs and claws? Heh, I'm afraid I didn't know there was a reputation to uphold, sorry You are being helpful, please don't stop posting your logic particularly when you know it might be useful to others, I wish that was a more common trait. My reasoning, for the record, went like this: So I make this service which allows me to experiment with new things and hopefully improve a very good idea someone else had, there is a set back and your alternative is buy stock... If I was in this for the money then I wouldn't be putting the effort in things like lbaat, right? I though that much was obvious.So while you flatter yourself a bit when you assume I'm defending myself and not just arguing my point of view, I do appreciate you spending the time to counter argue, as that helps me understand things a bit more thoroughly. This is really beginning to feel like a meta discussion... So you mean the domain was registered after SD, I'll give you that. Was it based on SD? Sure thing. Is it "just another clone (tm)"? Not at all.It was born out of a need to extend what SD had to offer. Not a generic need, but a particular need from another member with whom I had the pleasure of working in the past. Did you notice how diceoncrack shares the design with taabl (which is a newer version of the first automated lottery based on bitcoins, for real) and lbaat (which you might notice is different from everything else out there)?What I mean to say is not that you are wrong at all, the new taabl betting system was an obvious rip off from SD, and DoC is obviously a superset of SD, but rather that you can't just point your finger and say "you are just a script kiddy copying other people's work" without at least doing your homework.Granted, I could have "wasted" my time elsewhere and/or bought stock of SD, but seriously? I'm not an investor, I'm a coder, and I'm pretty sure our offer is quite different from SD, regardless of it being inspired (ok, that's an understatement) on SD.But hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, right? I see your point now... but I did not reinvent the wheel at all, you must be confusing diceoncrack with one of the other clones  I would have some S.DICE stock... your point being? Yeah, we lost a lot more than I care to admit, but the losses were of course limited to the hot wallet, so we'll just have to endure it and move on, smarter and more aware.
Yes, I realized that almost immediately after doing the change. In fact it was a good mistake as it allowed me to capture two winning bets from the same attack before they were paid, reducing ever so slightly the loss. This particular attack we endured doesn't seem to be related to lockntime, as far as I can tell. The coins are originally sent back and forth across a few addresses a few times in small values and finally they get aggregated in one address like A (http://blockchain.info/tx-index/46601326/e586b0cfa885c5fc8960205a9bfec228dc0dfa496c04b20172c66d1f9760076d) and B (http://blockchain.info/tx-index/46646986/2076b8e5be0fcaed6e6652ea2a89a45d755462764f852e3e3b9fcda3bb035e3e).One vout from each of A and B (18 and 1 is one particular example) are then aggregated into C, which is then bet on Martingale at DoC with tx D. The long chain of tx without any fees takes a long time to get confirmed by the network and somewhere along the line C is replaced by another Tx, completing the double spend.The now rolled back transactions C and D were:Code:{"hex" : "0100000001f677169e7a5739be1e4c462e88fb1cc394a4ea061e4a1defc1f4d0e4e4aca9cf000000008b483045022100a086c038850b5f683abec9f04a43b2408b698cbd31d24e716f92737c114a9ee7022043b1f928c7f57d905260a0faf0b8f307e111f5f6566ccbc9f15961abcb8c9a4d014104e168f0402da84fafc564594cb18abf720567cbc58b118caf6698298d0f34404cfd784c30cf49dc18e0eabf58301791170e8db56ff792ca78470f15045a501bdcffffffff016a48c323000000001976a9142ddfe9616ddf358d81546a3a18034fc88b34965688ac00000000","txid" : "2b1cecb3046e1f951dfb0237b6318ce3685585e14d1541938d08b1c56e2ae6c0","version" : 1,"locktime" : 0,"vin" : [{"txid" : "cfa9ace4e4d0f4c1ef1d4a1e06eaa494c31cfb882e464c1ebe39577a9e1677f6","vout" : 0,"scriptSig" : {"asm" : "3045022100a086c038850b5f683abec9f04a43b2408b698cbd31d24e716f92737c114a9ee7022043b1f928c7f57d905260a0faf0b8f307e111f5f6566ccbc9f15961abcb8c9a4d01 04e168f0402da84fafc564594cb18abf720567cbc58b118caf6698298d0f34404cfd784c30cf49dc18e0eabf58301791170e8db56ff792ca78470f15045a501bdc","hex" : "483045022100a086c038850b5f683abec9f04a43b2408b698cbd31d24e716f92737c114a9ee7022043b1f928c7f57d905260a0faf0b8f307e111f5f6566ccbc9f15961abcb8c9a4d014104e168f0402da84fafc564594cb18abf720567cbc58b118caf6698298d0f34404cfd784c30cf49dc18e0eabf58301791170e8db56ff792ca78470f15045a501bdc"},"sequence" : 4294967295}],"vout" : [{"value" : 6.00000618,"n" : 0,"scriptPubKey" : {"asm" : "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 2ddfe9616ddf358d81546a3a18034fc88b349656 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG","hex" : "76a9142ddfe9616ddf358d81546a3a18034fc88b34965688ac","reqSigs" : 1,"type" : "pubkeyhash","addresses" : ["15BZeHbK4gX8YugqBsHwyTnUAqF5GJjgBW"]}}]}Code:{"hex" : "0100000001c0e62a6ec5b1088d9341154de1855568e38c31b63702fb1d951f6e04b3ec1c2b000000008b4830450220310e5c39ac668739c8938180a10fc304615fda593c99216a1b3691cf4887d835022100c2bd43eb443013b7e1c1543c37d2e0c491b48bae165964a34a8b9583349493e5014104696b060ed1de0bac92d72cf4afbb3ac6627464b90466eff282f3ff01c0b19a2da261f2bbad9c501332ebd87b82ad4e64b86f7248f7eaf7040b02d44fbbbc415fffffffff016a48c323000000001976a9147d3b0ada4990415ac12b968174371c8e67dc691b88ac00000000","txid" : "acaebd04202864eef6af5b9df8ca70b88875bc4cf540a6d0f8b010a87f00145c","version" : 1,"locktime" : 0,"vin" : [{"txid" : "2b1cecb3046e1f951dfb0237b6318ce3685585e14d1541938d08b1c56e2ae6c0","vout" : 0,"scriptSig" : {"asm" : "30450220310e5c39ac668739c8938180a10fc304615fda593c99216a1b3691cf4887d835022100c2bd43eb443013b7e1c1543c37d2e0c491b48bae165964a34a8b9583349493e501 04696b060ed1de0bac92d72cf4afbb3ac6627464b90466eff282f3ff01c0b19a2da261f2bbad9c501332ebd87b82ad4e64b86f7248f7eaf7040b02d44fbbbc415f","hex" : "4830450220310e5c39ac668739c8938180a10fc304615fda593c99216a1b3691cf4887d835022100c2bd43eb443013b7e1c1543c37d2e0c491b48bae165964a34a8b9583349493e5014104696b060ed1de0bac92d72cf4afbb3ac6627464b90466eff282f3ff01c0b19a2da261f2bbad9c501332ebd87b82ad4e64b86f7248f7eaf7040b02d44fbbbc415f"},"sequence" : 4294967295}],"vout" : [{"value" : 6.00000618,"n" : 0,"scriptPubKey" : {"asm" : "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 7d3b0ada4990415ac12b968174371c8e67dc691b OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG","hex" : "76a9147d3b0ada4990415ac12b968174371c8e67dc691b88ac","reqSigs" : 1,"type" : "pubkeyhash","addresses" : ["1CRACKLiwFrZbAQz1yb9w22onHCMLbiMTY"]}}]} And diceoncrack fell on to this attack, it seems... https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=138988.0I have a requirement that isn't satisfied on the 0.8 series, an effect of the leveldb implementation. I need to be able to read raw tx for non wallet transactions, and these are no longer kept, so for now I can't update. I think that there are only two things I can do at this point; don't accept 0 confirmation wagers without fee and make sure the coins used on the wager tx are already on a block. Had I these measures in place the attack would have failed.That or simply not take 0 confirmation wagers, of course.If anyone need details about this attack let me know, I can dig the transactions that got rolled back. Ok, so it was a full on double spend attack and all my prevention methods failed miserably.Until I find a new way DoC will only process bets after they have been included in a block, but we are trying to come up with a safe way to address this limitation. Yeah, if the low bet volume we have on DoC gave me a good 10 minutes of anxiety parsing transactions to make sure no foul play was involved (and I'm still not sure) I can imagine what a major block reorg would do to SD... It seems we got caught in a blockchain reorg so for the moment bets are only paid after they had 1 confirmation. More info on https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=138988.0 So I'm not sure what happened yet, but it looks like diceoncrack.com was caught in a major blockchain reorg, either due to a split or a double spend attack.I initially believed it was an attack as the rolled back transactions were almost all on the lost wagers, but a closer look made me realize the rolled back tx for winning bets not only existed, but they actually were of a total value of close to the lost wager ones. If it was an attack, it didn't go too well. We have a few protections against the double spends but there's only so much you can do when accepting 0 confirmation tx, so for now and until I get to the bottom of this bets are processed immediately but only paid out when there's at least 1 confirmation on them, sorry for the hassle. There is one which is not a copy but an extrapolation based upon the basic principles of SD. The win cap is low because it has had only limited action and the code was maturing and the operator is an old forum member. I'm not saying what it is to avoid the shameless plug... Just so we're clear, I'm still not sure this is a good idea and gmaxwell does make a great counter point, but I would argue that the moment we implemented a second hashing algo that was not yet supported by the higher end hardware there would be a huge influx of mining capacity there, by virtue of the idling hardware already in existence, particularly so if it was one that was already supported by miners, such as scrypt.Of course there would be FPGAs and ASICS for scrypt in the long run if the reward is big enough, but that would most certainly "even the score" across all grades of miners. I'm not talking about an open ended schema where user defined algos can be plugged in, of course. It has to be well thought of and probably the first network upgrade would be a huge PITA, but even if it took 6 months to 1 year for adoption it would still leave the network in a harder to subdue state, I believe.The point about short term reversals being easier I don't believe is completely valid with proper adoption paths. The initial diff for a new algo would match that of the existing one, for example, making the reward very, very small in the initial run, and having the same diff change rules that the current client enforces would allow miners to slowly switch to the better algo for their hw, thus equalizing diffs in a safe way.But, again, I'm not sure it is a good idea or even possible in the short run. While discussing alternative uses for FPGAs now that ASICS will (or so I believe) make things a little less interesting for non-ASIC miners (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=138183.0) I posted about supporting multiple hashing algos, not really thinking it thoroughly, but now that I've entertained the idea a little longer it sounds like something we could, in fact, integrate in the bitcoin protocol. It might seem a bit out there, but there are two major points in favor of this idea as far as I can see:- Makes it a lot harder for someone (read company or government) to just throw money at hardware and overtake the network- Prevents a potential flaw in sha256 or quantum computing from killing the blockchain (even if temporarily, I understand that we can always address that as needed by just changing the algo, but still)So the very simplistic view I have of this is that instead of block hashing having to be done exclusively by sha256(sha256()) there would be a flag indicating which hashing algo was being user per block, with, for example, scrypt or sha3 added. Of course the list would have to be definitive per client version and the majority of the miners would have to agree, as always.A separate difficulty would be kept per hashing algo, so with ASICS taking sha256(sha256()) by storm, GPU users could use litecoin's approach of scrypt. Difficulty per algo would be calculated prorated between the hash counts, so the algos that have the larger work force would have the higher diff.It seems to me this isn't too complex to implement, bar the fact there would have to be an agreement between miners, and those invested in ASICS would be hard to convince to allow scrypt or whatever, but in the long run this would also protect them, as it would make the network as a whole much more hardened.What do you think? Should I start sleeping more or is this something that could be done? Yeah, I'm liking this idea more and more... I'll start a discussion in the proper location.(edit) -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=138664.0 dibs on 1, 45, 91 and 100!return earnings to 1HTonKbkim22nNXYv2NrA5H1Yoe7ogY5i9 Yeah, I didn't really think this through, of course, so this might be total bs, but it is possible to change the validator so that the hashing algo is  something set on the hash, say sha256(sha256()):BLOCKHASHGOESHERE or scrypt:BLOCKHASHGOESHERE, and this way bitcoind could still validate all blocks irrespective of the hash. Surely the list of available algos needs to be fixed, though that would in theory be upgradeable by new versions of the software.Not really knowing the validator code I can't say how complex it would be to manage multiple difficulty points, one for each algo, but all in all this would further future proof the system. If sha256 gets broken we can invalidate it using the majority vote for not accepting it on new blocks... So, I don't really want to get into an 'alt-chain' discussion, but what if multiple hashing algos were available, each having a distinct difficulty attached to it, all usable on the same blockchain? This way ASICS would bring sha256(sha256()) difficulty up a lot, but GPU users could still use scrypt and FPGAs sha3. All in the same client, all in the same blockchain... Would it be too expensive to ship to Europe? O preço é em libra, pois é nessa moeda que os vouchers são comprados. Vai ter de criar uma conta na amazon se ainda não tiver (mas pode usar conta de qualquer amazon, não apenas uk).O voucher deve ser comprado aqui: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006AUF6X0/gcrnstsNeste momento 1 BTC custa £11.6, não esquecendo que com certeza vai ter custos extra no cartão de crédito. Se quiser fazer negocio eu prefiro user o IRC com utilizadores registados no bitcoin-otc. Me encontra por lá com o nick nelisky. Isto porque tem um grande risco para mim e tenho de ter a certeza que estou enviando BTCs para a pessoa certa. CC = Cartão de Crédito What's the CPU / RAM / HD on that one? How much would shipping be to somewhere in the EU (say, France, for example)? Are you willing to use escrow or send first for a well trusted member? Bem, não é um negócio constante, mas eu estou vendendo alguns BTCs em troca de vouchers da Amazon.co.uk que podem ser comprados com CC. Ponho uma percentagem em cima para recomprar as moedas (alta, mas posso baixar para aqueles em quem confio) no entanto tem sempre taxas para usar um CC em moeda estrangeira, não sei se vai sair mais barato... Well, the account will work in all amazon sites, but gift card balance I think is not usable across sites. I don't know how you obtain the vouchers, but if you are simply buying them, it should be fine. Can you verify this?
Can you also do amazon.co.uk vouchers? Sorry for the noobness, but I'm a little puzzled; the pound denominated amazon GC is for amazon.co.uk, right? Amazon does not allow gift card balance to be transfered, I won't be bitten by it, will I?Thanks Is the £ value one single gift card? Is it still available (or part thereof)? DoC Pipe target prize lowered to 0.7 BTC based on the current exchange rate, so better odds for your bets!

Fair enough, I just thought I might ask.Also, I sent something I sold on ebay to Italy and the UK. It tool 3 days to arrive in the UK and 2 weeks for Italy, so I'm guessing something is happening there specifically? I'm wanting to buy a few coins so I can offer them on diceoncrack.com and taabl.netWill you offer any discount for quantities larger than 4? Say I want 10, 25 or even 50 if the price is right, what would those quantities cost me, including shipping to Europe?

I went to a restaurant and paid with my visa card, I got food poisoning... just reported visa to the appropriate health inspection authorities!lol Time for a few stats:The Pick 2 is our fastest paced raffle, almost always hitting in less than a day, which leaves little time for people to place wagers. There were a couple of cases where a single bet would be matched, leaving the winner with a negative outcome due to the house fee, but that has since been resolved by preventing the pick to actively match a result until there have been at least 2 transactions received for wagering.Pick 2 is also the one that moved more coins to date. It is 5 times more expensive per bet to make it interesting in terms of total value despite the fact it is very quickly matched.There was a common misconception that the choice 00 was a more common winning bet than others, which while being correct is also a bit misleading. The 00 choice hit 15 times, 3 times as much as the next most common match, 2D. Why was it the most common? Simple, every time a new pick was spawned the first bet (that didn't carry any satoshi configured number preference) would always be 00, so that number was simply in every Pick.Some numbers, for games started between the 15th of November of 2012 and today, that have been concluded:Total number of completed Pick 2's: 87Sum total of pots distributed: BTC 311.850Longest run:  3 days, 6 hours and 17 minutesShortest run: 44 minutesAverage run: 16 hours, 10 minutesLargest pot:   BTC 8.415Smallest pot: BTC 0.990Average pot:  BTC 3.585All choices that had where matched more than one time:00: 152D: 57C: 2CD: 2C8: 2A2: 294: 2Good luck! I have made the GC raffle a Pick3 instead of a Pick4, to make the odds of matching much higher. I honestly don't understand what you are asking. There's a raffle going on TAABL, and I don't have any provision for limiting the maximum number of bets. Is that what you are asking? The way I read it (and I might be completely mistaken) you are asking for the raffle to have at most 3 bets for a combined pot of $3?There's also the User Pipe at DoC. The price here is configurable, I have it set at 0.8 BTC because that is close to the actual price of the GCs. The more you send as a wager the better the odds of winning are, so if you send 0.4 btc you'll have roughly 1 in 2 chances of winning, but you can send as little as 0.01.Understand that this is an experiment on ways to raffle and gamble items as opposed to selling or auctioning them, so the interest here is not to get rid of the item asap. If you are looking to buy a discounted GC I'm sure you'll find options that occasionally pop up here in the forum. These games are intended for those who are looking to gamble for them. Oh, the level of ignorance from the press never ceases to amaze me. When I think they are starting to understand things... All the user games under http://diceoncrack.com/pipes should be active. At the very least we didn't receive any notification they weren't but if in doubt follow the links on the Notes column and contact the appropriate users. I can personally confirm that pipes under the name nelisky and TTBit are up to date. I know what is going on, no pictures right?OP edited to include pictures and target prize for the DoC Pipe reduced to 0.8 BTC from 1.0, making it 20% easier to win  Not a single wager on either TAABL or DoC, so I have to ask; is there another kind of item you'd rather see in these tests? Would an Amazon (uk or us) be more desirable? Something else? Zealot much? Is incest (assuming consented by all involved) really at par with rape and child porn? They also speak of freedom, BURN THE MFs! I was all pumped up reading up their selection process at http://mars-one.com/en/faq-en/21-faq-selection/251-do-i-qualify-to-apply; "I persevere, sure" and "my spirit is indomitable, just try and... wait, what is this here?"- You understand the purpose of actions may not be clear in the moment, but there is good reasonyou trust those who guide you.Really? It kind of killed the moment and I gave up on it. Consider getting yourself a Crack Pipe?You can get a fixed target prize (people bet what they want, odds change based on that, your prize is always roughly the same if someone wins) now. You can also raffle it on TAABL.

Wait... girls pay guys to watch them? I've been doing this all wrong! Tempting, but I'll pass. I usually don't run away from a dare but last time I jumped from the bridge I kinda died... a bummer if you ask me. But you keep on trolling, I don't want to prevent you from sticking to your path, I'll just step aside  I might be completely off here, but smoothie, your reply above gave me the impression I'm not the only one that gets deeply misunderstood when trying for funny sarcasm. That or I see a good joke everywhere, which I guess is a bit more positive  Now also available as a DoC pipe game! The original post has all details. We're having a great run with the Pick5 pot over 55 BTC now and a slightly more modest yet still great Pick4 pot of over 16BTC now! Don't miss your chance.Also there's a Pipe Pick running for $10 iTunes gift cards that received no love up to this point -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=135209.0Good luck! Bump. Not a single bet yet  (the one bet on the site was mine to make sure it was working).You can get a $10 iTunes gift card for as little as 0.1BTC! I have 3 unopened iTunes gift cards, each for $10. To match the buyer with the bid we will require that the winner signs the hash id for the winning bid transaction with the key for the first input address of that same transaction and send that through PM here on the forum along with the name and address for shipping the prize (if shipping is required).For the message signing to be possible you will need to use an address for which you control the private key, so online wallets are probably not going to work.I will send the redeem code for the gift card through PM or email, GPG encrypted if the winner so desires. I can also mail the physical card, but the cost of shipping must be separately covered by the winner first.Place your bets by sending 0.001BTC or more to 1PipEaL8yRS8n93mUS16wT5SNDiMrMutv5.If you rather gamble your LTCs you can use the DICEonCRACK pipe address LPipeGWLJjMcKFZoE8GjDNCJT7mJEfcCpx with 1.0LTC or more.Also available for TRCs, use the DICEonCRACK pipe address 1PipEaL8yRS8n93mUS16wT5SNDiMrMutv5 with 1.0TRC or more.The larger the wager, the better chances of winning.[edit]Since there has been no interest in the raffle and I want to test a new feature for DoC, only one card will be raffled on TAABL, with the other two up for grabs at http://diceoncrack.com/address?_=1PipEaL8yRS8n93mUS16wT5SNDiMrMutv5 instead. This is a crack pipe on DoC that plays the Minefield strategy with the threshold (and thus the odds) derived from the wager amount. In other words, the prize will be roughly 1BTC 0.8BTC, but the game will change depending on the amount you send to 1PipEaL8yRS8n93mUS16wT5SNDiMrMutv5.Example: If you send 0.01 then the multiplier needs to be 100x which makes it a game of less than 65233.You can read the original Crack Pipe announcement here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120239.msg1312797#msg1312797[edit 2][edit 3]added LTC bet information above.[edit 4]Removed TAABL raffle details, added DoC pipe for TRC and fixed pipe addresses that were all messed up. Oi galera,Estou precisando converter uns BRL em BTC. Compro cerca de 200 a 300 BTC de preferência a um vendedor só. Interessados? All working again, so feel free to gamble your xmas coins now  Indeed that's just a side effect of the strategy having had an address change in the past. The old address is still valid and that's what you were seeing, I've fixed it now.It will still show the same behaviour is you search for the old address: http://diceoncrack.com/address?_=1LQXotaEjfmerkwrGB3dHnheujo7sng6vA only  the other way around. Good eye. So you want to learn about Elliptic curve cryptography is very simple terms? I'm afraid my understanding of the subject lacks a bit to achieve that.What I can try to explain is the high level process here;We created a list of secrets that will be disclosed for the next two hundred something years, one per hour. With these secrets and a little EC magic we can create a new public key from your public key and from there calculate a bitcoin address. With a little more EC magic we can calculate the private key to that bitcoin address by using the same secrets and the private key for the public key you provided.This means that without disclosing a future secret (we call these timepoint secrets) we can calculate a bitcoin address from a public key you provide, but you can't calculate the private key needed to redeem the funds. We are also not able to calculate the private key, so the funds there are 'locked'. No one can access them.When the timepoint secret is revealed you can, using the lbaat static calculator or some 3rd party tool (Armory allows for this, for example), calculate the future address private key using said secret and the private key for the public key you provided initially.It's late and I'm not sure I made much sense, but you can read all the details at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128581.0 including a pretty graph. If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask, we'll do our best to explain.This particular thread gives away a bunch of addresses that were created using the above process, and also discloses the private key to be used calculating the addresses' keys. You should not, obviously, disclose yours to anyone unless you intend them to redeem the coins when the time comes. Yes, all times for DiceOnCrack, TAABL and LBAAT are UTC, including the secrets. The secret used is the one from when the bet is processed, not from when it is parsed, and there is a chance that a bet processed at 00:00 UTC will still use the previous day's secret. TTBit proposed a slightly different approach to the problem raised on my last post; from now on Picks will not find winners until there are at least two transactions and that is now denoted in the 'how to play' page.Of course if the same person sends two transactions and wins, that person will still end up with 1% loss from the house fee. It has happened a few times, and just now once more, that the Pick 2 hits a match with a single bet on it, which is fine when that bet is from TAABL's own seeding but otherwise means a bet will pay 99% of itself.My immediate plan to avoid this is to set a minimum number of bets before the Pick becomes active. How does 5 bets minimum sound? And is there any reason for me not to do this on all Picks? Ok, so I 'left it hanging'  nice... still keeping it civil, I see.I don't think this is ztex specific, but I humbly appreciate the invitation. I gave 2.9.10 a quick try yesterday on OpenWRT (MIPSBE) and when mining with ztex fpgas on deepbit the hashrate drops to 1/5 of what it should be. On bitminter I would dare say it is faster than it was on 2.9.7.Going back to 2.9.7 on deepbit works fine. It might be another endianess issue, I have not debugged this yet, but just thought I'd report in case someone gets a 'doh!' moment and immediately knows what's wrong  Mi español es muy malo, así que voy a escribir en Inglés;I've just had that same issue and it turned out my hard drive was failing. I didn't review the code but I assume that message is triggered when there are errors while downloading new blocks, so the bitcoin client believes there's an incompatibility at the API level (hence the "your client or one of the nodes"). Do a hard drive test, what OS are you using? If it happens again, feel free to PM me which will send an email.As for LBAAT, it is not a game as I stated although TTBit did advertise a game using the service.What you can do with it is create a bitcoin address that you'll only be able to get coins from in the future. Say you want to send coins to your brother for his next anniversary, and lets pretend that's next November. You can send the coins to him right now by using a private/public key pair that you know and a timepoint in November.- Using the timepoint and the public key you create a bitcoin address on lbaat.net, and fund that address with as many coins as you wish to give you brother.- You give the address, the timepoint and your private key to your brother. He can see the address but can't yet get to the coins.- Come November your brother uses the private key and the timepoint secret (which is only disclosed after timepoint is reached) to calculate the address private key and get the coins.The game TTBit created here lets you have the private key and timepoint for a bunch of future addresses, first one to get the timepoint secret and calculate the private key can redeem the coins. What are you getting? It was down before, but it has been working fine for me since I started things properly, and it is most certainly working for me now. This (LBAAT) is not a game, rather a service. As for TAABL (and DiceOnCrack, and LBAAT) being down, I woke to find it not running due to improper startup after the server got rebooted. I'm finding out why the server got rebooted and also why the services didn't all come up correctly after the system was back up, but for now all is running again!
I can, and I would but this is always a question of code complexity vs security&performance. It is much easier to introduce an exploitable bug when we start catering for special cases in public APIs, but you know that for sure.Of course this is a simple example, but I try to keep that as a rule of thumb for all machine interfaces. Humans tend to guess and be inventive, machines just do what they're told to do. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_feesmost of the time you'll get away with 0.0005 BTC fee, though that depends on a number of things. You can also patch your bitcoin daemon to not enforce fees, but then your transactions may take a long time to be included in blocks, if they ever are (depends on miners accepting them). Not using enough inputs for the output, using spent inputs or (more likely) need to add fees for transaction to be accepted. Which means the message is not of importance to you  But in case you are planning on making use of the JSON API all I meant was someone has a script that grabs secrets as they become available, using a call like https://lbaat.net/getSecret.json?timepoint=20121206:9 and if you try that you'll see the response does not have any real data. To get the data from that timepoint you need to prepend a zero to the hour part (digits after colon) to make it 2 digit long, so https://lbaat.net/getSecret.json?timepoint=20121206:09 will work as expected. There is a bot grabbing secrets every hour, on the hour. We feel proud someone took the time to actually do it Now, just a small detail about how the timepoints are created; the hour part needs to have 2 digits, so have a 0 (zero) prepended if < 10. Meaning '20121206:9' needs to become '20121206:09'. Added some text to "how to use" to make it clear. It would work assuming other time keeping services existed, sure. Assuming the encryption step itself was done offline to keep things safe, that  would be a good solution although there's an extra step that happens behind the scenes at lbaat, and that is timestamping and checksumming (sort of) the plain message before encrypting, to prevent attacks where someone provides garbled text stating it is an lbaat encrypted message, or simply provide the wrong timestamp for decryption. With your multiple services approach that part is lost, though it might not be important for whatever use case you are considering, of course. It is quite different for private keys and for messages. The former is just a contract in the form of lbaat holding a secret (that it knows ahead of time) but not disclosing it before the agreed time. Knowing the secret gives no advantage to lbaat, and the only "attack" possible would be not disclosing the secret at all, making the address unusable and any coins sent there lost. This particular issue will be addressed shortly.The latter usage with the messages is trickier, because the message is disclosed plainly to lbaat at encryption time. One option would be to provide the user with tools to do asymmetric encryption with a public key, the result of which would then be encrypted by lbaat. Once decrypted when the secret is revealed the user would then use his private key to retrieve the plain message, but this presents a usability challenge; making this easy to do for unskilled users is a problem, and making sure said users keep the private key safe is another.Maybe the ability to use some password to encrypt the text prior to sending it to lbaat? It could be a simple, not all that safe password, but it would add a layer that would make it harder for lbaat to misbehave and read the secret messages. If you are thinking about turning this ability of yours into a BTC business, how about you providing carrier service for items sold here and in bitcoin auctions between the two sides of the pond? How much weight can you carry?I mean, many times have I given up on a deal because it would be expensive to ship (heavy or bulky) and I'd have VAT on my side too (21%). If you would charge 5~10% over the sale price that would be much cheaper for me and a good deal for you.There's obviously the issue of trust and once on the EU side you'd have to ship the item so I could receive it, so not straight forward. Just an idea really... (I would love it if you could carry a rack mountable server for me  ). We have added detailed/resumed views to the Pick pages, you can find the toggle below the numbers table. Whatever you choose will be used thereafter, assuming you have cookies enabled. Do let us know if it improves your experience.Thanks for the feedback! Following up on this issue, the problem lays in endianess. I will submit a pull request for this to cgminer, it is working fine for both default work fetching and GBT, haven't tested on stratum yet. And we are adding a Pick 5 to the games available!This means there's 1 in a million chances of hitting for each new block, more precisely one in 1.048.575.Each bet costs 0.1 BTC and you can send your wager to 15TaABLmhxiRQ9DTX6ZcZ9S9RknVZmP5jX.Good luck! No accepted shares on either cgminer or website, and yes, I'm sure the credentials are correct (unchanged). I'll email you the username. I can't say for sure how long it has been, but from a day or two ago I have 0 accepted (and 0 rejected) shares? Wtf? cgminer reports the speed accurately (2.4.1 on openwrt) but that's that, basically. We have a winner! Sent from the address '19ZzbTTqNouSpNND5anz5QvaZX98Pxvzdf' came the winning bet.If this address is yours (you will have received 2 satoshis when the raffle ended) please prepare a message with your name and shipping address and sign it using the winning address, then send both to me by PM.If you need help in doing this post a message here or PM me and we'll walk you through the process.Congratulations! It had to match immediately after I mentioned it hadn't yet...Congrats to the big winner! Pick 4 matched a little under an hour now:http://taabl.net/pick?_=50a012da8127a82bacd87326 It looks like we're picking up speed; the last Pick 3s were record breakers at BTC 8.613 and BTC 8.217 pots and the running Pick 4 has a whooping BTC 28.809 pot at this moment.Good luck! And the raffle hasn't found a winner yet! There's still time to place your bets, folks.This is the longest running Pick 4 game we've had to date (but we have been running for very little time still  ). Vou só deixar isto aqui https://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2012/08/16300/0462404630.pdf Hi Jan,Are you planning on open sourcing or at least providing the server to selected individuals so that redundancy can be achieved by community effort? It seems the bitcoin client used for processing payments is refusing to sign the payout transaction, which is quite awkward as it should only happen if the transaction or the block was rolled back, which isn't the case.I'll keep trying to fix this, but in the mean time I'll send you a manual payment. If I do fix this there's a good chance you'll get a double payment, which I'm sure will greatly upset you 
We're moving the Pick 2 bet value from 1.0 BTC to 0.5 BTC, as requested by BitCoiner2012 in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122329.msg1331755#msg1331755. To make the change seamless a new address will be used for the new BitPick, so send 0.5 or multiples thereof to 12tAabLFLxvUzC5KuX7VKMM8bYRncbQ84E to play.Once the current BTC 1.0  Pick 2 ends it will not spawn a new one. Let us know what you think about this, and good luck! Well, since we're talking bitcoin time, every 25k blocks (roughly 6 months)? Or using round numbers every 32256 blocks (that's 16 times 2016)?  I am not sure I understand your question. We usually take the '00' bet, unless someone else places the first bet. But that certainly gives us no edge on winning. Any number can be the winner and the only reason that 00 appears to be the usual winner is just because it is always a bet, so while 1e might be more often the end of the block hash (for example) it is not always an active bet. Every time 00 comes up, no matter how seldom that is, it is sure to be a match on the Pick 2. If we had more betting volume this fact would not be noticeable at all.But I may have given the wrong impression that we have some sort of auto seeder, we don't. We try to manually seed the Picks once per day or every time they match, but it always depends on us having the time to do it, so anyone can get the 00. Since this appears to be an issue, we're going to start seeding with a set bet, thus avoiding taking the 00 by default.Just remember that if we always take the bet for 1e, that will appear to be the one that is always coming as winner just because it is always a bet, unless there's enough bet coverage to prevent it  No number is more common than any other for block hashes, as far as I know. That would be an obvious attack vector on the bitcoin network itself.We can certainly entertain the idea of lowering the Pick 2 bet value, although that also means the expected pot, everything else being equal, will lower accordingly and the odds of pick completion with just a handful of bets are still as high as always. In fact we were already considering it given the low volume of betting.We have to date won almost every Pick 2, but we also were often playing almost alone, with you being the exception I guess. The same cannot be said for Pick 3 and 4, where we have a little more dispersed volume and have not won all that many games.In the spirit of full disclosure, we do not keep any of the pots won as house profit, everything is spread across the open Picks. Any chance of shipping to Europe? What premium would I pay for a couple of 3TB? Yes, there is a good reason... lack of bets. Since we keep seeding the BitPicks so no one gets caught winning a single bet which would net loosing the 1% house fee, and because we don't choose any particular numbers the 00 bet is always present along with usually one or two other random bets. We've been playing pick 2 mostly alone, which is unfortunate as that is the one game I thought would be most popular to start with, as you can expect it to hit multiple times per day with moderate betting volume. Well, in theory it's expected. The current bids are covering only 0.1% of the available space, which means there's roughly 1 in 1000 chances of hitting per block, so with 144 blocks per day we should expect ~7 days. Of course since block hash slices can repeat themselves we may very well have to wait a lot more.The most surprising thing is that much lower coverage bitpicks have always managed to find a match in a very short timespan compared to this one. But past events bear no weight on the outcome of future ones... Just a quick bump to let everyone know that there's still no winning number. We've been running for 8 days now and almost certainly very close to completion, but there's still time for anyone that wants to join in on the fun! Some action last week on TAABL, with 8x Pick 2, 2x Pick 3 and 2x Pick 4, for a combined Pot of 36.135 BTC. I'll refrain from posting all the Pick links here, people know where to find it now, right?The FPGA Raffle is still running, so don't lose the chance of taking home the miner yourself. Quickest deal ever with AnonX, I sent first, two thumbs up. What comment was that? I'm not sure I understand what you mean.You don't need to start a new wallet, you need to have a proper wallet. It's the same as for Satoshi Dice and the like, where the prizes are sent to the same address that was used to send the funds in the first place. If you are using an online wallet you have no control over the sending address, and thus will not receive the feedback tx (or the prize if playing a proper bitpick) and, more importantly, don't have the privkey to sign a message proving you are the one that made the bet.Please let us know how we can improve the description, as it looks like we did a bad job of it.But back to my original intent, I was proposing that you have your own raffle pick for the video card, like the one we have open for the FPGA Miner. We currently take 1% of all bets on as fees. A 3.96 btc pot was collected on the Pick 2, and a rather humble 1.386 btc pot on the Pick 3.http://taabl.net/pick?_=5097d3458127a850f4b1cb01http://taabl.net/pick?_=509920ed8127a850f4b1cb5bThe FPGA Miner raffle is having a bit less interest than we anticipated, but it is still up for grabs folks!Roughly 2 weeks have passed since the service was launched. Comments? Complaints? Any feedback? Hey underminer,This would be a good match for the pick raffles we're testing now at taabl.net (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122329.0)We're currently doing some tests for having a minimum number of tickets before a match can be found, auction style minimum price. The two things that might be somewhat tricky are the US only constraint, although if that is perfectly clear to anyone visiting the site it might work fine, and the fact that we do not offer an escrow service of any kind. As soon as there's a winner the coins are sent the seller's (you) way.Just a thought, if you would like to talk more about this let us now. Thank you!And another Pick 3 pot was collected -> http://taabl.net/pick?_=50982a9c8127a850f4b1cb17Don't forget that the FPGA Miner raffle is still active, so it's not too late to join   @Mushroomized: There's good news and bad news... I'll break the bad ones firstYou didn't winOn a brighter side, the good news is you didn't lose either. The raffle still hasn't found a winner To clarify things, and you can also read all the details at http://taabl.net/howtoplay here's how it works: you buy a ticket which has a number. Every time a block is found we extract the potential winner ticket from that hash, but if no ticket has been bought matching that potential winner number then we wait for the next block's hash, and so on.This raffle is a Pick 4, so 4 hex digits are matched, which means there are 65536 possible combinations. If you look at "Previous Games" on the site you'll see how long Pick 4's have taken in the past, though the number of tickets sold and plain randomness will obviously make this nothing more than a guideline of sorts.I might hit while I'm typing or it might take a couple of weeks, both being unlikely.

Hey,Care to add diceoncrack.com and taabl.net to your list?Thanks! Well, the past few days were exciting, 5 Picks were completed for a total of ~18 BTC.http://taabl.net/pick?_=509475918127a85894293c36http://taabl.net/pick?_=5094c6eb8127a85894293c52http://taabl.net/pick?_=509518bc8127a85894293c8chttp://taabl.net/pick?_=50965b168127a85894293cdahttp://taabl.net/pick?_=509507938127a85894293c5dAnd don't forget, we're testing raffle style picks, with the first one giving out  an FPGA miner! Read all about it in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122329.0 A slightly different pipe, specifically thought as an auction alternative being tested. Read all about it here. And we're off!Visit TAABL, place your bets by sending 0.1 or multiples thereof to 1PipetJAiECJYfCi812cWuV8znDKVqMzq4 and good luck.Once there's a match all sending addresses will receive 1 satoshi to advertise the raffle is over, and the winning bet will get 2 satoshis back. If that is you, let us know here and we'll send you the prize.General playing rules are the same as for other BitPicks.Let us know about any doubts or ideas you might have regarding this game.
Building upon CrackPipe, we're going to be giving away one FPGA miner board on a raffle of sorts;It is actually a Pick 4 game with tickets priced at BTC 0.10, but instead of receiving the Pot the winner will get an FPGA miner capable of doing >204 MH/s. If all goes well we might introduce this service for others, as an alternative to selling on auctions.Full details on the prize;- this is a Spartan 6 LX150 FPGA Board exactly equal to ZTEX' 1.15x module, built under license.  - This is not a board sold by ZTEX!- the board has been used.- the only guarantee given is that the board will reach the winner fully working.- again, no warranty is given on this device.- shipping is included in the prize.While this initial test is provided by TAABL, please keep in mind that the once the Pick finds the winner ticket the prize will be immediately sent to the Pipe recipient (the seller) and it is the buyer and seller responsibility to arrange for the proper completion of the deal. To match the buyer with the bid we will require that the winner signs the hash id for the winning bid transaction with the key for the first input address of that same transaction and send that through PM here on the forum along with the name and address for shipping the prize.For the message signing to be possible you will need to use an address for which you control the private key, so online wallets are probably not going to work.We're doing some final checks and will post again once the raffle begins!edit: We have a winner! 19ZzbTTqNouSpNND5anz5QvaZX98Pxvzdf is the winning address, and we're waiting to hear from you. Pick 2, Pick 3 and Pick 4 all completed! Wow...Four and a half days for the Pick 4 to give out 7.326.http://taabl.net/pick?_=5093e92a8127a85894293bedhttp://taabl.net/pick?_=509301e38127a833731709bdhttp://taabl.net/pick?_=508ef30f8127a8514a6c02b1 Why ruin a perfectly fine pattern? Pick 2 collected in just just of a day, 4.95 BTC pot.http://taabl.net/pick?_=5092af8a8127a87ee3226ef7 Everyone will just have to bet faster on the Pick 3  Pot of 1.386 BTC just claimed.http://taabl.net/pick?_=5092d1628127a84fa434c06e Today is a very dynamic day.1.98 BTC was the pot for the Pick 3 that took a little over 7 hours to complete. http://taabl.net/pick?_=5092693d8127a87ee3226ed1 Crazy! Again almost one exact day, again 5 tickets. Congrats to the winner.http://taabl.net/pick?_=50916a568127a87ee3226eb3 So you are using the same wallet.dat file from .bitcoin/ before delete, or are you using an old backup of your wallet.dat?If the latter, and depending on how often you make payments, you might have a too old wallet that doesn't have the addresses where you have most of your btc. By default the bitcoin client keeps 100 addresses in a pool and uses these as needed, so if you made a backup, made more than 100 payments and then recovered that wallet you might be out of luck.Rule of thumb: don't delete ANYTHING until you are sure there's nothing more to do. If you need to clean up .bitcoin/, just move it somewhere else and create a new directory. Hey,When you say it doesn't work, what do you mean exactly? The new client doesn't work? It works but doesn't show your balance?If you removed everything from .bitcoin/, placed the backup wallet.dat in it and started from that, it should show all addresses and history from the backup wallet, does it show any transactions? Did all the blocks download?Did you backup the wallet.dat that was in .bitcoin/ *before* removing everything in it?Good luck ! This time it was the Pick 3 pot that got collected. 32 tickets, for a total pot of 3.168 BTC, took a little less than 2 days to match. http://taabl.net/pick?_=509001ec8127a87c9a98dd8c Congratulations to the person that took the 4.95 BTC Pick 2 pot. Only 5 tickets and it took a day, lets see how many we can fit next time.http://taabl.net/pick?_=509008f58127a87c9a98dd92 Well, the OP clearly asked for methods to make betting more efficient and likely to result in profit for the bettor. I don't think I'm ready to disclose that, and as such am a bit off topic But thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it! I've been holding myself down not to post a shameless plug here, but on diceoncrack you can play multiple variations of the Martingale system (along with other goodies). We've had a bunch of down runs where the house was running negative, and you can severely offset the odds in your favor by placing the right bet with the right exit point, but there are two things to consider, no matter the strategy you use:- The odds are slightly skewed in the house's favor, so in the long run the house always wins (or so I hope  ). How long is the long run? That depends a lot, and some players will be able to take profit, although invariably others will suffer a loss (the house is a player on every bet, too).- There are no fool-proof systems for winning, unless we coded things wrong. You might get lucky, or you might play the 'almost sure to win' games, but potential gains are much lower then.Right now we seem to be fluctuating across break even all the time, but if you consider the house edge is really low, that is far from unexpected. Most online games are individual? I'm involved with diceoncrack and taabl, and I can certainly throw all the coins at either and then recover them (well, ttbit might not be too happy with that, but in theory). Sure, I'm playing "for free" but I'm not displacing anybody else's chance of winning.Or are there other PvP games out there that I'm not aware of? Yep, that trend. But I'm done with it, let all the Dicks ask for loans, see if I care... So, is your name really Richard? Starting to see a trend... But, seriously, are all these broke people called Richard? I hadn't notices, though I must say I don't follow those threads at all. On 2.7.5 now, I'm putting 2GH/s+ in (10x ZTEX singles) and it all looks good on the miner side (apart from a few rejected with high-hash, which is new to me). On EMC, however, the hash rate reported fluctuates between 1~1.4GH/s, avg diff is 1.088. I expected it to fluctuate a bit higher, obviously.Code:(5s):2275.3 (avg):2042.6 Mh/s | Q:275  A:1573  R:214  HW:0  E:572%  U:16.6/m I have an older cgminer (2.4.1) running on OpenWRT that was working great with EMC until last weekend (which I assume was when the var diff got turned on). Since then I get roughly 50% of my hashing power reported on the workers page.I tried upgrading to the latest git version which rendered the exact same result (and random segfaults) so I moved back to my trusted version.What am I missing here? var diff should work fine even with 2.4.1 if I understand it correctly, so what am I missing? Hey,Just got myself 10 mins to try this out, seems to be working fine except I don't see much of a difference in actual share count per period when compared to same voltage/cooling and ztex firmware.Still, there is one small issue with the pool URL parser that I'd like to note (has probably been mentioned before as it is obvious, but I couldn't find anything), and that's the usage of @ in the username (deepbit at least does this), so "http://username@mail.com:password@pit.deepbit.com:8332" will not be a valid pool url (at least on tml-1.5) because it parses "mail.com:password@pit..." as server address. Hey Inaba,I see 0 shares on the account page although I have shares in the worker page, I hope this is just display and all shares are still accounted for.The funny thing is that, as I went on to the tx history page to double check what I was last paid and verify if what I have in the account page is roughly correct there's a 2600+ btc manual withdrawal... Now, I obviously didn't have that much (I wish) but I also didn't instruct the manual pay out (I never do, just let the auto pay do its thing) so I have to ask; did this bug have anything to do with security?Hope things get smoother now!
heh, yeah, I was was in over my head due to lack of time, as I have posted multiple time. I'm still completely swamped and it seems like a new thing appears every day. Oh well, can't complain from excess work.Anyways, I will return the board as requested by hashking, I am just trying to convince national customs service to refund the VAT I paid so I can return the board to the sender. If someone in EU will pick this up and refund my VAT I'll gladly send the board their way too.Regardless, it doesn't take 2 months, I had already done ztex and a simple git push (I was working off a very dirty branch which is why I didn't, and anyone that can actually code will know what I mean with "I'll just do this one cleanup and then push") would have prevented me loosing all that code. Honestly, the x6500 code I had developed is the least of my problems with that dead harddrive...It's a pitty, I wanted to help but I have no stakes in this particular fight. Next please... cross-posting my bad news: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40058.msg1008453#msg1008453I had made quite a bit of progress, but now I'm just pissed with myself. Well, guys, I don't know how to put this... I've lost all my work on the x6500 support on cgminer... I was waiting for a partial working version to push to my git repo and... the hard drive died. I've had other drives die on me in the same manner (it doesn't spin up, just clicks), and I always got them to spin up one more time to get a backup done, only it has taken multiple days until I managed that. I'm trying...But I really don't feel like starting all over right this minute, so if someone else wants to take a stab at it I'll be glad to send the board over. I did pay taxes on getting it into EU and I would really like to get that much reimbursed by whoever gets the board. Failing that I can try to return the board to fizzisist and try to get the taxes reimbursed, though I'm not sure I can.Or once the frustration wears down I can get to it again, but honestly I've put a lot of time in this and this was the most amateurish error I could have done.But rest assured I did not grab the board and ran, I'm fully invested in ztex boards and am only doing this x6500 thing to help out, as most of you probably know.I'll let everyone know if I do get to recover my work but don't hold your breath.It sucks!!! Still trucking along. I've had very little time to spare unfortunately, but I'm by no means stopped. There's a lot of boiler plate code that I'm still doing and I guess that'll take me a couple of solid days, and all I have been able to put is the odd hour here and there.I'm always hoping to have a test version for everyone during the weekend and then get lots of stuff to do that just takes precedence, it sucks deeply.But again, I'm working as hard as I can and as soon as I get somewhere usable I'll push it. Thanks. Just reverted that one and it is working fine at first glance. With the latest master, on OpenWRT (TP-Link MR3220) I can't use ztex boards anymore. Haven't got time to properly debug this now so I thought I'd just leave this here in case it is obvious to anyone:Code: [2012-06-14 14:41:10] Popping work to stage thread                     [2012-06-14 14:41:13] ZTEX 0000000001-1: Share found N0E0                     [2012-06-14 14:41:13]  Proof: 000000008f655a7694a8933c6eb9b38330a8be710c299dd2a2785220d2832b30Target: 00000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffTrgVal?

You can place only the bitstream folder but you'll have to run cgminer with the current directory being the parent of bitstreams.Once you do give it a try let me know if you have any issues. I might try it out with a plain vanilla OpenWRT one of these days too, but can't really promise I'll beat you to it. No, I don't. I'm using my own build of OpenWRT so my steps are not directly useful if you are using anything else. Still, I can help anyone who is willing to write said tutorial, and get that into the cgminer distribution readmes.All in all it should be very trivial to get that up and going once the correct libs and modules are in place. For usb storage I'm using a usb key with 2 partitions, one with ext4 and one with swap (just because, not really needed). Look at http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage for guidelines and ask if you have any doubts.As for cgminer, you'll need both the cgminer binary and the bitstreams directory, both living side by side in the same directory. Well, you should be able to fit the one bitstream you are actually using without problems, but if you want the full bitstream directory or you have multiple ztex boards with different versions running at the same time, you'll need to set up usb storage. That is what I do. Thank you. I thought it could be something server side but was really hoping it was just the client not requesting all it needed... client side is always faster to resolve, if only because the test cases are much more limited.I'll wait it up, it's not something I need just something I decided to try out. Not really sure if this has been addresses but forum search didn't find anything (as it is usual) and I didn't read through all the posts. My preempted apologies if I'm dupping here.Using p2pool I tried using a spinner address for the miner, which obviously works fine just like with any other valid address except BitcoinSpinner doesn't see the mined funds at all. First I thought it was the 120 block confirmation but now I it has been long confirmed and is still missing from the device. The funds are there, importing the address to a fat client sees the funds just fine.Bug, RFE?Thanks I have sold the 2 XSPC blocks, one naked 5970 and its original heatsink (detached, no screws) to piit79, and he has sent payment. Will ship tomorrow. Well, I grabbed openwrt sources and compiled it with the needed kernel modules (so I didn't have to load them afterwards which could fail due to lack of space). I then cross compiled cgminer and presto.Ok, I skipped the step of getting ztex worker going on the cross compiled environment, but that has already been done and does not need to be done again. Well, there are no other offers and if none appears till tomorrow I'll close it then. TP-Link MR3220 (also tried the MR3420 which is basically the same thing only with better wifi range, so I'm using that one as originally designed  ) It works just fine in my experience. I have the router dedicated to cgminer, mining to p2pool and it has no difference that I can perceive from the same setup with a full linux desktop. Changing this (and only this) makes the p2pool node reject lower difficulty work submissions, but cgminer on the other side still submits all diff=1 solutions found. Shouldn't the p2pool node be requesting higher diff shares, or is that being ignored by cgminer? I'm using ztex in OpenWRT, in fact I did much of the development with that as target (as it is the hardest to debug, might as well make it work there to start with). Can't speak of DD-WRT. Vwlopez3 offer has been accepted, waiting on payment and shipping address.
QIVX has retracted his offer That's the first I see that error. It's a usb read pipe error, so maybe a permissions problem? I've never tested this on an atom so I don't know if there are other pitfalls to worry about. It means there was a timeout trying to send the 'set fpga' command to your quad. It should not matter if it is an isolated incident, are you seeing more of those? I'm going to close a) b) and c) tomorrow. If any of the buyers wishes to retract their offer now is the time to act. Also, I assume you'll be paying first, so if anyone needs escrow get in touch so we can arrange for it.I might only be able to hit the post office on Monday so there is a little time still to discuss details, but if no new offer is done in, say, 12 hours, I'll be committing to the offers placed.I'll let e) and f) open for a little while longer but will close it this weekend unless there's some bidding action going on. We are not, but it's close enough  Thanks for the offer, it is the best one for these items even with shipping included. Care to share where this would be sent to? Just the region is fine. Well, I replied to hashking by PM but for everyone's benefit, I am not as advanced as I hoped to be by now, a mix of bad initial decisions and lack of work day time to dedicate to this. I do have some communication with the board already implemented and it just needs time/work. I'll try very hard to push this into something I can share this weekend. Well, it seems the offers are not exactly pouring, so lets give this 24h and close the already existing offers if nothing new comes along?I was half hoping someone would make a fair offer for the whole thing but I like all the individual offers made so far. Regarding payment, you can either trust me and send first or we can agree on a member everyone trusts to hold the coins until good reception of the goods, just let me know (this goes for everyone, of course). I wonder where I got the y from... oh well. In that case, the capability missing was actually a good sign, so unless you try again and provide the logs I have no clue to why it hangs. I've had a few offers by PM, and I just wanted to ask everyone to place offers here. If you want to do a blind offer so as to prevent being outbid that is fine, but do please state what you are interested on here so:- Other's know what is being negotiated- (more important) the thread gets bumped up - (most important) other members have a chance of seeing who we are and warn me and you if either of us is a known scammer or at least if we should be double safe.Thanks![EDIT] - Current offers:a) tccd - 16 btc (EU) [received]b) -c) Vwlopez3 - 18 btc (US) [sent]d) -e) piit79 - 25 btc (with f) (UK) [sent]f) piit79 [sent]g) - Capability 0 7 is multi fpga, and that is normal if you also have any 1.15x connected. I never had a cgminer freeze with fpgas, but I also never had an 1.15y to play with so I'll need more details to be able to add anything useful to this issue. Can you start in text mode and debug (-T -D) and send me the full output until the freeze? OS needs libusb-1.0 and no extra flag is required (no -S). What does 'built version' mean? If you are building from source don't forget --enable-ztex. Thanks, got all the missing payments. Ok, so I checked the transactions and there was one which I actually won -> a96a3cc6284df89c4d670722e6c2705b7d3709673be8e7207c53e02f35220d45Thing is, the pay out address, it is not mine. I'm using the bitcoin-qt client at version 0.6.2.2, so I'm pretty sure that's not the problem. Where did satoshidice come up with the address? It is not mentioned in the bet tx at all. So, all in all, I placed 7 bets and received 4 payouts for losing, so I'm missing 2 loosing payouts and one win.What should I do? Stop betting?  Some images:a) http://imgur.com/a/Nn5m1#0b) http://imgur.com/a/0bcDd#0c) http://imgur.com/a/qa11K#0d) http://imgur.com/a/9Ju8j#0e) http://imgur.com/a/Ar7Sa#0f) http://imgur.com/a/BqQ1S#0g) http://imgur.com/8PgNna) and b) are EK blocks complete with screws and spacersc) is EK too, with backplate, with screws and spacers (for mounting with backplate, the screws do no allow mounting with the original BP I believe).d) is the same as c), except I lost the EK backplate screws. I do have the normal BP screws as seen in some of the pictures, but I only have 2 of the 13 spacers.e) and f) are XSPC blocks, complete with screws and washers.g) is most of what I have in terms of fittings and such. There is more but I couldn't find it promptly and gave up.Shipping from Europe, open to all offers (but I reserve the right to not sell if it is just not worth it) and I only take BTC. Will do escrow if needed, obviously.Side note: I also have 3 2x 5970 bare naked (no heatsink) that were used with some of the above blocks, and I have the original heatsinks for them but not the screws to join the two  I will also take offers for those but what I'd really appreciate was if someone with broken 5970s would sell me the screws so I could properly test the cards before selling. Sorry if my not reading the last 11 pages means I'm repeating questions  but I made 7 bets yesterday and receive only 4 transactions back (all 4 lost bets). I assumed that I had one the others and that it would just take a little more time to process winnings (hey, one can hope).But now, 10 hours after the fact, I still see no payment tx. Is this normal? Awwww, that's so disappointing (that she's not a race horse, not the race result). If I keep my shares (and maybe buy some more  ) will they count towards a new horse you buy? Is that in the plans? Hey,I'm mining on the 3220 (but developed originally on the 3420) with openwrt with great success. I did, however, build the OS from scratch so I could have all dependencies built in.If you are using the plain vanilla openwrt you will need to install a few things, though I found I didn't have enough space for everything unless I either built one from scratch or used usb storage for the installed modules. I don't have a clear memory of what I needed but I'll be happy to share my kernel .config with you, send me your email on a PM. I can also send you the full firmware file, if you want. That one will most certainly run the cgminer binary compiled for that platform (which I can also share) but has a few odd customizations.You don't need any specific Cypress drivers, just the normal usb-ohci driver. Have you heard from shakaru in the last two weeks? Do you need copies of my PMs to keep tabs on the event log?I'm in no hurry at all and deep down I still hope that shakaru sends me a tracking number, but I'm not seeing how that might happen given his track record so far. I really hoped it wouldn't get to this, as I didn't even need the switch and was trying to do a good thing here, but:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=66660.msg773884#msg773884So, can I get my 10 btc back?
Ok, so I've been very quiet and patient, trusting to the extreme... but after way too many messages saying "sorry, something happened, this week for sure" I'm starting to feel my scam free life has now come to an abrupt stop.Who is managing the top address to which I sent the 10 btc and what is the process to get these back?shakaru: I'll still accept the switch but I'll need a tracking number today, otherwise I'm going to accept that my honest person meter is just broken. Well, I saw this as a perfect opportunity to get some more stock at a discount from all the disappointed investors, only to find there are none. C'mon guys, last place! Just dump those no good assets, or should I dare call them liabilities? I would be very interested in both the libraries and the recipe to build them myself. Given my ztex boards are running off a tp-link router, I would really like to avoid spinning out my windows or linux VM to update firmwares, and getting java in said router is not something I'm looking forward to do. Bitstreams are stored alongside the cgminer binary (directory 'bitstreams'). The path is hard coded but the bitstream selection is defined in each board firmware.Bitstreams are uploaded at startup, yes. That's pretty amazing. Here's hoping you pull it off  Wouldn't you rather learn how to correctly compile? Let me know how it is failing for you or give me ssh access to the machine and we can fix that for you. Thank you A Pull Request has been issued to the main cgminer repository so I'm sure it will get included soon. It's funny, I never had to deal with access rights. But I guess that's a byproduct of the distributions I've been using.As for flashing to the cluster mode, you do have to upload the firmware first using BTCMiner, but there's no 'cluster mode' per se, that's just a mode of operation for the mining software. The firmware is the same in either standalone or cluster mode. I do plan to add the ability to flash the firmware eventually, but since that's a one off operation (well, sort of, once per version upgrade from ztex) it is not something I plan to tackle just yet.My implementation is seriously lacking in documentation, that much is certainly true, but with my limited environment testing I hope someone that has to deal with the installation from scratch will step up and do that (hint, hint). Yep, I have this one in my todo already. But since it is really a minor annoyance I've been focusing on the more urgent stuff. I'll try to fix that one with the next push. Do you have the right branch checked out? Try 'git branch'.BTCMiner uses libusb-0.1, cgminer uses libusb-1.0I've written about it before, although I now see I did that in the BFGMiner thread:  Sure thing. I'll have that in soon. Working? yes. Thoroughly tested? well...Let me go through the code to check for any obvious blooper and I'll do the PR afterwards. I have a test branch with support for ZTEX 1.15y quad boards. Anyone willing to give it a try please grab the source at https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztex-120417If you are unable to compile it yourself I might be able to provide binaries on some platforms. I have a test branch with cgminer support for ZTEX 1.15y quad boards. Anyone willing to give it a try please grab the source at https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztex-120417If you are unable to compile it yourself I might be able to provide binaries on some platforms. I'm trying to wrap my head around the 1.15y mining to add support for it on cgminer, but the multi-fpga approach is not completely clear for me, and not having one such device to experiment with I wanted to ask a little help in clarifying things prior to me asking for others to test things. As I read the source, it appears to me that each FPGA on the 1.15y is assigned a separate miner thread, but I see no locking being done in the USB communication, and it appears to me that the same device handle is used for all threads.As far as I can understand it, a BTCMiner is spawned for each FPGA but only the root miner gets attached to the poll loop, which will then iterate all child miners in sequence to prevent selectFpga() and command interleaving between the miner threads of the device. Is this correct?Thanks! Look at the thermal conductivity and resistance numbers for whatever you are using. Using pads and grease is completely not useful unless you need to operate on a very much non flat surface and even there just grease will probably do a better job.You see, good grease like MX-4 is rated at 8.5W/mK (higher is better), most greases I find in computer stores are at 1~3W/mK and most pads will fall at around 1W/mK. I have tried some high end thermal pads rated at around 6W/mK and some very good phobya ones at 7W/mK, but because the heatsink with the pushpins doesn't apply enough down force to compress the pads as designed, the result is that even 3W/mK grease works better than the best of pads.I could use thicker pads but then thermal resistance comes into play and offsets any gain the pads could have on the grease. The pads (at least the very good ones) still have a place in testing scenarios as it is so much easier to snap on heatsink out and another in without having to clean up the grease mess left behind So, in a nutshell, if you use grease+pad (+grease?) you will have the thermal conductivity of the worst link and the combined thermal resistance... not very useful. It isn't supported yet, no. But I am going to take you up on that offer soon  Chances are I'll be able to provide you with a version to test, and with a little patience from you I won't need remote access at all, but I'll let you know when the time comes. Ok, so visit http://libusb.org/wiki/windows_backend and grab yourself the zadig utility (just fing zadig on that page).Using Zadig, find the ztex device (it's either 221A:0100 or "ZTEX Module") on the drop down (You may need to use the "List All Devices" menu option) and install the WinUSB driver. That should be enough to make it work.If you need to later upgrade firmware or use BTCMiner again you'll need to, using Zadig again, install the libusb-win32 driver on your device and you should be set.If the device appears as 221A:0100 you must edit the name to "ZTEX Module".Let me know how that goes. More details needed; what OS, did you build it yourself?On windows there are a few extra steps that I haven't found the time yet to document, but you'll need to remove the libusb-0.1 driver used on BTCMiner and install the libusb-1.0 (WinUSB) driver instead. I'll try to come up with some draft of the instructions if that is the case. Not that it matters much in the event of an arms race, of course, but I just wanted to state publicly that while I have a lot of respect for luke-jr's work and I *love* the name (which was kano's idea, I believe), my money is on cgminer for now.Reasoning is:- No one knows the core better- As ztex worker maintainer I prefer a high entrance price development style, i.e. one where all my commits are verified- I cannot possibly work on two code bases at once- I have committed myself to supporting other devices on cgminerI do think that ckolivas lack of interest on FPGAs is a negative point, but honestly so as long as he keeps doing the great job he has done so far (and I'm sure luke-jr will still help cgminer development as he's building on top of it) it just doesn't matter.I do however understand luke-jr and others frustration, I just don't share it 
Feeling much better about it now  thanks! Will you be merging / cherry-picking from ckolivas' cgminer or will I need to support ztex on the two code bases separately? You can also just use the previous BTCMiner (120221) and flash the 15d3 firmware which will allow you to use cgminer as released right now. There is no speed gain in 15d4 that I can see. There is nothing new on the conf file for ztex, you just need to have them running with a compatible firmware (use BTCMiner or FWLoader from ztex to load it up), which means 15d1 to 15d3 for ckolivas release and if you want 15d4 you'll have to build from source found in https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztex-120417The boards are detected at cgminer start. Let me know if that doesn't work for you. Fighting about what others should do for you is stupid, but be careful with your assumptions. Plugin support is not trivial and cgminer is already very modular. You can pretty much compile it to your exact needs.And I must agree that ckolivas writes great software, it has been a pleasure for me to work on top of it but again, careful with the assumptions. The day ckolivas decided to open source it the baby, while still his, began being parented by many other great tutors. I may not always agree with luke-jr or kano (or ckolivas for that matter  ) but luke-jr did a great job improving the modularization of cgminer and creating what became the base for FPGA workers there and kano is making the API better, greater and more useful and everyone combined is finding and fixing bugs that would otherwise be much harder to track if this were a one man show.ckolivas owns the thing, he knows the code better than anyone else and if it weren't for his great effort we would most likely not have this great piece of software. Major kudos to him!... but don't make the mistake believing that without everyone else (coders and general community) the code would be the same. Thanks for the kind words. It is always great to see the community getting together towards building something that is good and useful for... you You don't understand open source, that's ok. You do state a lot of good points but then just overdo it and go on to plain and obvious trolling. But I'll bite:You already have opencl kernels being "pushed" to the GPUs, that's the closest equivalent to the FPGA bitstreams. The firmware is needed because the FPGA interface to its microcontroller isn't standards and changes with bitstreams, sometimes.Household alarm monitor... yes, proper FPGA handling is too much and unneeded for mining. Why don't we remove LongPoll from cgminer? You can mine without it... not optimal, but hey.I'm not looking at BFL easyminer for anything, this is a different (and much better imho) product.Oh, and as for cooking eggs, you can already do that, just crack them on top of your GPUs, cgminer even shows you the optimal cooking temperature!Reading through your comments I come to the conclusion you don't care about what other people may need from a mining software, so why not ask ckolivas to remove support for every GPU you don't use? That would simplify the code a lot! Also, what's with the "piggybacking" and the puny donations comments? Are you serious? Really? Yes. There are a few things missing still:- support for quad boards (1.15y)- suspend- high speed bitstream upload- hotplug- firmware upload (to support hot upgrade and the new bogus firmware feature)- Support for the latest firmware (120417, bitstream 15d4) - This is already done but waiting on inclusion on the main repositoryAll of the above will be addressed as time permits. You can use the latest firmware if you compile cgminer yourself, grab it here -> https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztex-120417There is a lot more I want to do but I've been mining with ztex 1.15x boards on cgminer for roughly one month now and it works great  So how does dd-wrt relate to openwrt (which I'm currently using on a tp-link router)? Minority or not, I like cgminer so much I'm supporting ztex there myself. There has been some extra work for ckolivas as I adapt to cgminer's coding style but it is more or less easy to keep most changes separate fromt he main cgminer code. I do think ckolivas' time is best spent making cgminer even better and more stable rather than implementing fpgas there, seeing he is very good in the gpu support, as it is in his personal interest anyway I think cgminer as a gpu + fpga miner is unbeatable, and I'll do all I can to keep it that way. We can always fork it, but I think as FPGAs become more mainstream it is good for the community as a whole if it stays in the same place. 1.15y support will come soon, but since I don't have one such board it will initially be based on reverse engineering and voluntary external testing. This approach is bound to take some time but we'll get there.If someone wants to handle donations towards a board to send me that would likely speed things up (and Stefan will most likely give some discount based on his OS program) but it is not really needed, just helps a bit. Nem por isso. Originais a esse preço, concerteza Mas boa sorte. Está vendendo réplicas, certo? Com esse preço acho meio dificil serem originais. Regarding miner support, I should have that on cgminer soon, but since I don't own any 1.15y I'll depend on external testing to assert it does, in fact, work. I'm doing ztex support on cgminer, and I can certainly do x6500 too if there is still a need for this. "Are you talkin' to me?"Yes, I've already asked for details on what changes in the API, and will have a look at BTCMiner sources as soon as I can get my hands on them. While I don't plan to own these quads soon, I do want cgminer to have the best possible ztex hardware support. Ztex does something very close to A (there's no interrupt to state a share was found, but it will be reported on poll which we do constantly) and aborts work as per C. ztex is supported on my branch https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztex but:- hotplug support, while working is based on a "hack" to cgminer and will not yet be pushed to the main cgminer, if ever.- you can use my code right now, but it has not been verified by ckolivas. I am in the process of splitting ztex support / hotplug support so I can make a pull request for the former, which will happen very soon. I actually have one of those backplates, they do come with screws but these screws are not the standard ones. What I want to do is return these cards to their factory setup so unfortunately that will not help.Still, thank you for the tip! Do you have one or more Radeon 5970 cards that are fried, broken or otherwise ready to be filed in the shiny bin by the sink? I need to get myself 3 full sets of screws and X plates that I somehow lost to disassemble a water cooled rig, so maybe we can work something out? I'm not explaining myself too well. I disabled (i.e. commented out) the call to that function and everything works great. The block gerenation detection is only there for logging purposes and doesn't prevent normal functioning.
Because xiangfu tested and found no issues I'm pretty sure nothing's wrong with the code itself. It's probably my toolchain or something with the device, I just mentioned the code because without calling that function my openwrt cgminer has been running for 2 days now and as soon as it gets called, segfault. Thanks. I know about MAX_DEVICES and I don't yet have enough cards to make it worth changing But doing  some more debug I realized the function that triggers the segfault (in an unrelated place, so I'm guessing memory mismanage) is cgminer.c:regeneatehash(work). This is only called if doing verbose output and since you are passing -q to your cgminer you do net follow this code path. Could you give it a try without the -q, just to make sure it's not some weird thing with my setup? It segfaults as soon as a nonce is submitted to the pool.Also, did you have to do anything to handle the device's endianess? It's weird, because I had to swab32 the data I receive which is consistent with BIG_ENDIAN, but defining __BIG_ENDIAN__ breaks everything hard. Could be an effect of the bi-endianess of mips, dunno. That's what I get for not reading through properly. I read "I got a Mt. Gox Free Yubikey" and skipped the rest... I already got one for free from MtGox so I'll just retract myself from further bidding. 2 btc shipped to Europe. I've been trying to get cgminer working on another TP-LINK device (TL-MR3420) but every time it submits a proof of work to the pool it segfaults. I haven't been able to properly debug it but it seems the json_rpc_call() is returning an empty string, so I'm pointing my quicker finger at libcurl. Can you give me a quick overview of your build env and process? Not really. It hasn't been up that long, but I guess it is easy for it to get "harvested" into a botnet list of usable IPs, I guess. That's CRAZY!!!That IP is mine, I have a bitcoind running there but not only are the generation addresses not mine but also I have never found a block there that I can remember.So... what's going on? I've hacked hotplug support into my ztex cgminer fork, but when I say 'hacked' I'm not joking, it's just a proof of concept.There are a few things that I'd need to get this cleaned up: - A hotplug managing thread. I'm spawning the first ztex thread on startup as the hotplug manager which in turn will handle (re)connects, but this should be a proper top level thread. - Proper support for adding threads on the fly; I added a MAX_THREADS def and alloc memory for all of them on startup in thr_info[], because otherwise the other threads (long polling, watchdog, etc) would become interleaved with the mining threads and break all the "for i in len(mining_threads)" that expect 0 based and sequencial miner_threads. A simple solution to prevent the need to pre-alloc would be to move all non mining threads to the top of the array instead. - A little more dynamic variables handling the curses output, specifically being able to add lines to the device statuses. - When unplugging I'm setting deven to DEV_DISABLED, but there should really be a DEV_DISCONNECTED state too. I didn't need it because I search for devices being disabled and ztex, reusing those entries and threads as needed (because the only time ztex devices are disabled is when they are disconnected or malfunctioning) but if cgminer ever supports hotplugging for multiple device types we really need to know exactly which devices[] entries we can reuse.There's more, but if you just look at my changes to cgminer.c you'll see what I mean.What I've done works for me but I don't feel it is even close to clean to make a pull request out of it (without even going into the fact I changed a lot of tab indentations to double space  ) but I would really love to work with the core developer(s) in order to come up with a plan that stands a chance of being accepted in the mainline.Update code at the usual place: https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztex (cross posting from the cgminer thread)A small status update: the cgminer support for ztex boards now compiles and runs on linux, osx and windows. There are still features missing and the hash rate reporting is pretty broken but the boards hash at their expected speed. Check it out: https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztexLet me know of any problems / suggestions. A small status update: the cgminer support for ztex boards now compiles and runs on linux, osx and windows. There are still features missing and the hash rate reporting is pretty broken but the boards hash at their expected speed. Check it out: https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztexLet me know of any problems / suggestions. I've started to get ztex boards supported on cgminer. The current implementation uses libusb-1.0, compiles cleanly on linux (ubuntu, but all others should be fine) and osx (snow leopard here). I'll try to make it work for windows soon; https://github.com/nelisky/cgminer/tree/ztexThis is not feature complete, not all that tested so be careful. I have been mining with it for a while and the biggest caveat is that the hash rate measurement is completely broken. It seems cgminer doesn't like when I do a full nonce scan that can take 12~15 secs and only report the calc'd nonces at the end of that. Limiting the nonce space does make it report correctly and of course the actual speed is the ~200MHs expected from the board regardless of what cgminer reports But what I'd really like to put in, and I'm not sure if this will be well supported in cgminer, is hotplug support. Will I be able to dynamically add / remove workers? Should I use a main worker thread and then spawn child threads, one per board? I would also like to use multiple boards per thread and just split the nonce space, as there is enough time between polls to handle that.Opinions? Pointers? All well appreciated  I need a good excuse to look at the source code, so I might take a stab at that if I get a little off time. I love that electrum can be used as a simple text only client (something I need) without needing to have a long running process there. The one thing I couldn't immediately do (though I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to fix if not yet supported) is being able to import public addresses to monitor, without having to also store their priv keys.Did I just miss the way to do this? JMS74: Tal como já foi dito, as exchanges funcionam bem se não tiveres muita pressa, com a vantagem de comprares a 'spot price'.Se usares irc, podes tambem perguntar em #bitcoin-otc-eu no freenode, ele há gente de toda a europa por lá (e não só).Eu pessoalmente costumava usar o mtgox, mas estou mais no intersango desde que o mtgox ficou sem SEPA e, francamente, recomendo muito o intersango. Mas o -otc é sem duvida o melhor sítio para combinar transações "em pessoa". Watching closely... Me wants... Backup servers are fine, and they do solve the most common use case but my biggest pain is not pool downtime, rather network issues and no backup pool will help with those.So just not sending new work to the board for 5 minutes will trigger low power sounds like a great feature, and if I want to force the FPGA to hold still I can issue a resetFpga() though that means I need to reconfigure it afterwards, correct? You may want to read my code instead, as python is much more readable than java and you have everything I needed on mpbm in one single source.https://github.com/nelisky/Modular-Python-Bitcoin-Miner/blob/ztex/worker/fpgamining/ztexdev.pyI will try to find you on irc once I get some work things out of the way. Every time you poll ztex board you get 2 x nonce and 2 x goldennonce. The latter is when there's a diff=1 share found and the former is just the last calculated nonce (twice because ztex uses 2 hashers in parallel, I believe).I don't know why as it's been a while since I had to tinker with the sha256 algo, but hash(nonce)[28:32] == H7+0x5be0cd19 if the hasher is doing its thing. Ztex can set me straight if I'm full of it right now But regardless, in a nutshell you get nonces to verify at every read, but the board verifies and stores the golden nonces itself. I am assuming that going the interrupt transfer route you would only be interested in getting transfers in the event of a golden nonce, making the error rate resolution much smaller and potentially harmful to the board.If, on the other hand, you would get interrupt transfers for every nonce calculated... well, nothing gained from current approach, right?I might have gotten this all wrong, so feel free to call bs. I had read it, but apparently misunderstood it. Sorry.So basically 9x650 + 1x13000 == 10x650 if you have diff set at 650, got it.
9*650 + 1x130000 = 1885018850 / 650 = 2929 * 0.002 = 0.058Why does Person A get 0.02? How would that be different from connecting as 1abcsomething, saying "I'm mining at difficulty 1" and then submitting the diff=650 and diff=1000 shares? Doesn't p2pool take the actual share difficulty into account when calculating payouts? While that is true, and I guess it would be simple enough to add an interrupt transfer to signal the existence of a golden nonce to process, you would stop fetching the error rate data which, I believe, isn't something you could easily handle on the uC. And since we ztex boards allow for user controlled frequency scaling, this data is VERY important. Is there a way to stop the FPGA from mining without forcing a reconfigure to get it going again? The use case being many boards loosing network connectivity which will make them go round and round on the same data while waiting for new work, which is wasted electricity. I have updated https://github.com/nelisky/Modular-Python-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/ztex with high speed FPGA configuration (which appears to be just as slow from my tests) and multi device hotplug support, though I only tested with my single board. Anyone having multiple ztex boards and wanting to experiment with MPBM, please give this a try and let me know.

Anyone having multiple ztex boards and wanting to experiment with MPBM, please give this a try and let me know.I also created a pull request to get this into TheSeven's repo: https://github.com/TheSeven/Modular-Python-Bitcoin-Miner/pull/5 I didn't mean finish in weeks... C'mon, a little credit here, I code for a living. Can not tell if you are serious, but I can help both in testing and in developing if you are. I see there are already some donations done towards that bounty and I really don't want to step in anybody's toes. If I do.decide to jump into this I'll try to be as public about it as possible and I hope anybody else tackling the same problem does the same.Ztex already proposed sending a board for free for this purpose, which I will not be requesting so I ask again: anyone thinking of taking the challenge in the next couple of weeks? Is anyone already doing ztex boards support for cgminer? I'm not sure about timeframes but I'm considering taking a stab at it seeing as I have the protocol "fresh" in my mind from the initial implementation for MPBM, but I'd hate to start it just to find out someone else is almost done with it  https://github.com/nelisky/Modular-Python-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/ztexThis is a very crude first attempt, many things are still missing, the devices need to be preflashed and the bitstreams must match the firmware. Only one device is supported (it does filter by serial, but then uses only the first device found) and the freq change algorithm from the error rate is much, much simpler than ztex's, and I only implemented the low speed FPGA config so far.Next step would be multiple device suport but as I only have one currently I'm not going to blindly implement that. I might add to the code base to support more of ztex's original java source goodies ported to python, like the high speed config, but I'll be happy to pass that anyone else wanting to lend a hand.Have fun (I'm mining on p2pool with my single ztex using this code right now). Thanks for spotting these, I have been lazy and copied much of the code from Ztex Java and then adapted in place, leaving some cruft behind. My branch has been updated with those removed.But I'm confused, did you get it working at all? I don't yet do python 3 (too much critical code that breaks so it will not be an easy migration) but I might start using it for this  https://github.com/nelisky/Modular-Python-Bitcoin-Miner/tree/ztexThis is a very crude first attempt, many things are still missing, the devices need to be preflashed and the bitstreams must match the firmware.

That is why I considered using MPBM. I already control my single ztex board using python, but lack firmware config atm. There are a lot of safety checks and code handling libusb oddities in ztex's sources that I'm completely ignoring, but need to go in to make this feature complete. I am going to port ztex board support to python for my own egocentric needs but I will give supporting the MPBM a stab. This is, of course, something I do with my spare time, and that mythical creature "parco tempus" has been making itself almost extinct as of late... So if someone else has started on this I'll be glad to help with what I already have, but I'm not yet making my code public as it would probably take me more time explaining than fixing and cleaning.I anyone is doing this too let me know and I'll help in any way I can. Heh, even knowing exactly 74% of the statistics are made up on the spot, I still apologize for not making up a more accurate one  I'm willing to bet it's the fact you are trying to sell an iphone. About, I don't know, 100% of the iphone deals proposed here ended up being scams... I would be willing to try and buy it just so we could get a single iphone / ipad actually traded on the forum!But I'm abroad and that's verizon locked, right? I guess I'll let someone else be the guinea pig. Still, a word of advice if you seriously want to sell this here; escrow! Will you accept escrow? I can do that for no fee, and I'm sure many others will volunteer too. Thank you! now I feel much better about it. shakaru informed me that it will be $17+ to ship, and 10 btc is currently under $50. While it doesn't make sense to outbid myself it is still a bargain and for a good cause, so 14 btc is my bid. I also don't *need* a switch but one cannot have too many of those, right? 10 coins shipped to Europe, to open up the bidding.
watching Yeah, when I bother to actually do the math, it becomes clear that you are right. I can take 400MHs out of each of my 5970 cores @ 840MHz, give or take. The full board, with 2 cores, sucks ~250W (RAM downclocked) and I'm sure a lot could be shaved off by removing everything but the bare essencial to mine. That 'not essencial' category will fit a lot of the GPU components, and thus the power draw has a good margin to be reduced, but to 80W from 250W is probably just impossible. What are the chances of this being some ATI GPU or other stripped of everything else, just doing opencl? Kind of makes sense from both a price and performance standpoint  watching So you got 3 rings going on in one LX150, right?Any idea what's the smallest (cheapest?) device one could fit a single ring? And 2? Maybe with your approach we can get a better bang for the buck somewhere else, or at least easier sourcing of FPGAs  watching I'm a single forum type of person, but I will try to keep that one in sight too.Also, I can get you a VPS as a donation, send me an email (my address is in my profile) with what you need and we'll see what I can manage. python or windows binaries? do you mean *on* windows? Anyway, no, no windows for me, I'm using ubuntu server. NMC on p2pool is not pooled, so you are merge mining, but soloing too.I did find one NMC block using p2pool, so it certainly works  That reminds me that old internet slang word: "modem" Right, the FROM MINER came before the SHARE, so my human grep capabilities have been proven to be lacking:Code:2012-02-09 17:27:28.021783 GOT BLOCK FROM MINER!

There's nothing magic about it, except being able to calculate them without making the system slower in return.When you mine somewhere the pool could not handle the bandwidth of a miner that would submit ALL hashes, and frankly I doubt anyone has a fast enough link to submit them in the first place. So miners only submit shares that actually have hashes lower than target, and target may be different across pools (some just use diff==1, some don't). Then it becomes a statistical problem (with these many shares in the last X seconds, how fast is the miner, probably?)You can calculate effective hashing speed easily, just check how fast the miner goes through the nonce space. Well, I have kind of made up my mind not to sell, so we're in sync This rig is the most efficient I've had, runs flawless for long stretches of time and as such it is a simple power on and forget 2GHs thing. All I need to do pay pay electricity...I'm closing this offer. Ok, I give I've been really noisy lately, sorry about that. Yeah, but that hash is certainly larger than the largest target... some zeros on the right side would be there. But that's ok, it does submit valid hashes too, was just curious. I'm experimenting with p2pool, and BTCMiner works fine there, except for these entries on p2pool log:Code:2012-02-07 12:16:15.898617 Worker z submitted share with hash > target:2012-02-07 12:16:15.898790     Hash:   4134f7d69c50c4e3e374867219fb2c1c5b7d079942c6a3dd197fbe3b2012-02-07 12:16:15.898912     Target: 3cd86727e50fbc00000000000000000000000The miner still mines, shares are found, etc. So my assumption is that when the full nonce space has been calculated by the FPGA, the last value is returned, regardless of it being a match or not. Is this the case (meaning I can just ignore these) or is there something else going on? I've closed a deal with 3phase, so no need to make more offers atm. 3phase: Are you willing to send first or use escrow? Also, I just wanted to make sure about two things: has this card ever been overvolted or had the bios reflashed?thanks! While the price is a bit steep it is still on the fair side for a good as new 5870. Problem is it is more than I had my mind set to spend for a non mining gpu. I could haggle a bit but frankly you might be able to get that price from someone else around here...
Are you shipping from Europe? That's kind of important. Hey,So I have a desktop computer that is not used for mining... I know it sound unreasonable to most folks here, but there, I have admitted it Anyway, that desktop computer (using for light CAD and gaming) had a nVidia GX somthing or other that died a horrible death, and I want to replace it. I need framerate, but I'm not going to waste a 5970 on it so my very favorite balance between price/performance/consumption is the 5770, though I might also go for a 5750 or 5850.Anyone from Europe has one of these laying around that wants to get rid of? I can find them used on Amazon and ebay just fine, but thought I would give it a try here first. As I said, it has to be from Europe ('coz customs suck) and it must work flawless on arrival (I will do a heavy benchmark).Offers? I've just started trying p2pool, and I was constantly getting hash > target errors, along with pretty much 100% rejects on cgminer. I was also pointing my single ztex fpga at it.Then it downed on me, maybe I should try and see which of the miners was misbehaving... I tried BTCMiner alone, no problem. The I tried cgminer alone, no problem either.I then fired both I was back at the hash > target land... Am I correct to assume a single p2pool instance can only be used by one single miner? Luck seems to have improved dramatically.Who cares it is only USD? PayPal sucks in all languages and currencies I use cgminer just fine there, what is the problem? AniceInovation: thanks for the offer! this thread has been a lot more quiet than I expected.Oh, and I still haven't found the screws... I wonder... That would be a pretty good deal, though my very amateurish needs are completely satisfied with my current 550d... I would, however, be interested in the flash. Will you sell it separate? How much would you consider fair, shipped to Europe? That's rph's FPGA prototype. Look it up, it's in english  I'm a bit confused here... so is the DE0 working well and pumping the 75MHs or is that the expected hash rate?Also the DE4 dev board at 3k US$ seems to be (much) cheaper than the individual chip, from what I can tell. What's up with that?  Perfectly understood. I would probably not want to pay for the shipment anyway  How much does it weight? I'm very interested but I'm in Europe. Yeah, that's what I though. It did run for 4+ hours each way, and the values reported by BTCMiner certainly fell within or above the expected. The problem was that it started consistently submitting a lot less shares, without exception, for a multi hour stretch of time (though the MHs rates staid where they should).As I said, probably just coincidence, I just feel it is awkward this coincidence only happened with d2 and always happened to d2... but hey, that's why it is called 'coincidence', I guess  Can you do IRC? I'm trying out a bot to help me mediate just that service (ukash and paysafecard).on freenode do "/privmsg neliskybot help" to get a sense of what that is. If you don't do IRC send me a PM with what you need and I'll send you a quote manually. Although it might not be more than a coincidence, I can tell you that mining with d2 (on EclipseMC) has a weird behaviour; it starts fine, mines away at the expected rate but eventually starts to submit less nonces. I mean, not in a random way, consistently less, with all the rates reported in BTCMiner staying stable (even though the submits are correctly reported in the low ball area). It simply does not happen when mining with d1.Doing a little debug it seems to me that it happens when there are multiple new blocks reported in a short amount of time. Could be a problem with long pooling, but why would only d2 be affected by this? My board runs at 198MHz with d2, 0% error rate, frequency is stable, so that's not it.I'm sticking with d1 for now but let me know if you need more info or want me to test anything. Given the complete lack of interest I'm getting here, I may very well take you up on your offer, but first I'll need to find the missing screws  I'll let you know soon. Yes, they work great under OSX, or anything that understands USB keyboards. Programing them isn't as widely supported but still available on Windows/OSX/Linux. Some photos It's all plain vanilla from ubuntu-server-10.04:Code:Linux charts 2.6.32-24-generic-pae #39-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 28 07:39:26 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux It is certainly much, much faster to configure.

This thread is for a *potential* sale. This is not an auction, I'm still not sure I want to sell these, and until a deal is closed I reserve the right to just bail out of the whole thing and keep the hardware.edit: an extra disclaimer... I'm in Europe, so shipping to the US is probably expensive and will take a fair amount of time.edit2: I have no problems in receiving offers by PM, but I would much rather have them here. It just saves everyone's time by not having people offering below what already has been offered. Also, I don't have a set price or even a solid decision to sell, so PMs asking how much I want for these are very simply time consuming. I will reply, but only to ask you to make an offer.Disclaimers aside, I have one miner running 3x5970 water cooled with XSPC EK water blocks, one of them nickel with backplate, pump is Phobya DC12-400 & EK-Reservoir Combo DCP 4.0 Bundle, rad is Phobya Xtreme NOVA 1080 with 9xXilence Red Wing Fan 12cm, all pressure fittings, quick disconnects to/from the radiator, a spagheti of cables to get all the fans to run from a single molex connector.This is all running fine:Code:Adapter 0 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 46.00 CAdapter 1 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 40.50 CAdapter 2 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 39.50 CAdapter 3 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 39.50 CAdapter 4 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 35.50 CAdapter 5 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series            Sensor 0: Temperature - 36.00 CAdapter 0 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    840           300             Current Peak :    840           300  Configurable Peak Range : [550-1000]     [300-1500]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 1 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    840           300             Current Peak :    840           300  Configurable Peak Range : [550-1000]     [300-1500]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 2 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    840           300             Current Peak :    840           300  Configurable Peak Range : [550-1000]     [300-1500]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 3 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    810           300             Current Peak :    810           300  Configurable Peak Range : [550-1000]     [300-1500]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 4 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    725           150             Current Peak :    725           150  Configurable Peak Range : [550-1000]     [150-1500]                 GPU load :    99%Adapter 5 - ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series                            Core (MHz)    Memory (MHz)           Current Clocks :    820           300             Current Peak :    820           300  Configurable Peak Range : [550-1000]     [150-1500]                 GPU load :    99%Bios has been tweaked on all cards to allow lower mem, can't really say what brand the cards are, most probably Saphire, could be Asus. I also have the original stock fans but may not have the screws for them.The speeds you see above are what I found to be stable. Everytime I had a core lock I'd drop speed by 10Mhz on that core. There's a very good change cards can behave even better.Now, this is all on a ASUS M4A79T Deluxe with some Sempron thingy on it, inside a coolermaster HAF 922 case with a coolermaster silent pro gold 1200w PSU, but I really don't think I want to sell these at the moment. You are free to try and change my mind though I'll post pictures later today... 
This being present on the GUI is of absolutely no importance to me... I had noticed this in HEAD, but I never checked if the official release has this through RPC or not.But is it in to stay Gavin? I may finally move my web help libs to use a non patched client  I know nothing of triangles as they are applied to predictions and such, but the "calm" we're experiencing is a bit unsettling.If I had to point my finger while looking at the shiny crystal ball, I would say that the fact mtgox's verification process is becoming a bigger burden, the fact they still don't allow SEPA withdrawals along with intersango's being unable to withdraw to UK banks is leaving many people without the "cash out" option, which is the main driving force for the quick dumps imho. I know I do it every month to pay electricity, and the fact I can trade coins but can't then easily collect euros is a major issue. Ok, that does explain it. I have mounted the heat sink with the thermal grease (I didn't even notice the pad, to be honest) and, while reading back this thread, decided to take it off, clean it up and apply some of the better thermal grease I use for GPUs. Same difference. It is very stable at 192Mhz, error rate is 0%, and nothing of relevance appears on the logs.Looking at the pool hash rate calculation I see it spiking to 220MHs but more often than note stay below 180MHs. I guess that's just variance at its best, I very satisfied with the ease of use, stability and power dissipation of this little thing. Great job!Now I just need to get more boards asap  Ok, so a single card runs fine as an auto-detected configuration. Is it possible that one of the cards is misbehaving? Can you try each card individually?That could very well be it, the somewhere else part. Did you try to move the VGA/DVI connector to another card, or to another port within the card? It could be that the autodetect is using the card that has the monitor on it, but then with =all it is using some other as main screen in a broken multi-screen config. I got my first ztex board today (yiipee!!!) and got it mining in no time, quite a different experience from the GPU realm Now, I'm using release 111214 but as soon as it tries 200MHz the error rate goes from 0 to ~4.5%, making it fall back to 192MHz where I'm getting less than 180MHs average. Is there anything I can do to improve this or was I just unlucky with the board I received?FYI, I tried both a separate 12v 2A power supply from an external hard drive and have it now connected to the computer PSU. I do get some complains from the usb subsystem but I'm assuming they are normal:Code:[64741.636023] usb 1-2: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3[64742.148040] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2[64742.492020] usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 2[64742.651107] usb 3-2: not running at top speed; connect to a high speed hub[64742.663179] usb 3-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice[64749.446973] usb 3-2: USB disconnect, address 2[64764.648024] usb 1-2: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4[64764.740034] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2[64765.008021] usb 1-2: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 5[64765.520045] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2[64765.864027] usb 3-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 3[64766.023105] usb 3-2: not running at top speed; connect to a high speed hub[64766.035181] usb 3-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice[67311.250255] usb 3-2: USB disconnect, address 3[67350.024024] usb 1-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6[67350.696082] hub 1-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 1[67351.040024] usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 4[67351.199100] usb 3-1: not running at top speed; connect to a high speed hub[67351.211176] usb 3-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice[67356.567730] usb 3-1: USB disconnect, address 4[67367.368022] usb 1-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 7[67367.501362] usb 1-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice Looking at your dmesg output didn't really give any clues. Can you see the text console? (try ctrl+alt+F1~5). I've had much grief trying to get Catalyst to behave in a multi-monitor setup, but then again I moved to a situation where my miners are running text only, headless and are dedicated to mining. No more config pain. You would probably guess wrong. I always have these when using GPUs that also have HDMI audio, and my guess is that it is just probing and finding things that are, well, not video.Still, the point remains I have these too and my setups work fine. Sorry about the accumulated dust  Everything is in very good shape and I'm sure you will mine many a good coin with it!Received. So bar you having any issue with the hardware, this trade is concluded.Thanks! can you post a paste link for the output of you dmesg? The 2 GPUs where shipped to AniceInovation, tracking number provided privately. The X shaped things? I'll have to count the ones I have off the WC'd cards. If I find any left overs I'll send them your way. Aha, I thought your offer was being made with the knowledge I was probably going to sell the GPUs separately, as I indicated in a previous post.As for the exchange rates, google says 1 == $1.2922, which means 640 == $827 which is, in fact, 13% more than $720. I'm sorry, clamps? Can you share an image or something that can help me understand what it is that you need? Sorry if I'm being dense, but I really don't know what you mean... Hmmm, let me try and fine the screws and spacers for it then. I will not be needing the backplate, though, don't think it'll have much of a resell value by itself. Cards sold to AniceInovation! I have been paid already and will be shipping them tomorrow. Thank you! @ummas: That obvious, right? Yeah, great party!@dmcurser: Thanks for the good word, I really appreciate it.@AniceInovation: Your's is by far the best offer. I'm giving the rest of the folk a little while to make new offers, just to be fair (and because it's good for me  ).Everyone else, is there any interest in the other stuff? The water blocks, pump and radiator? malevolent and AniceInovation are tied on the race to buy just the GPUs, and baby_ghost is winning by a nose. ummas has the best bundle offer, and I am favoring his offer. I will be mostly offline till tomorrow, so I'll make a decision then so I can post the stuff on Monday. Feel free to make more offers if you feel so inclined, I will try and respond to them asap, though probably only tomorrow. put me down for 5, assuming the trusted member steps fw  I will need shipping to EU. @malevolent: That is pretty much exactly the same AniceInovation is offering... just saying  Anyway, where are you located? Which side of the pond? Will you pay shipping on top of that?@everyone else: I'm deciding between 2 offers now, AniceInovation (2x5970s for ~$780) and ummas (2x5970s+2xWB+RAD for $910).Does anybody have interest on the rest of the stuff, i.e. all but the cards? Options:- Trust me; you send the BTC, I send the stuff. I've been around for a long time, have done a few deals on the Forum and on #bitcoin-otc. Of course, if you are new around these parts you'll have no reason to trust my word so the other option is- Use an escrow; I don't trust any of the existing escrow services (this is not to say I have reasons to be suspicious of them, just that I don't have enough trust to use them without second thoughts) so I'd rather ask someone else to serve as middle man here from the forum. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37805.0 for some pointers, davout has agreed to do this in the past. This works by you sending the coins to the escrow, the escrow confirms receipt, I send the stuff, you acknowledge good reception and only then escrow releases funds to me. Both of us need to trust the person holding the coins.
I'm looking for BTC. PayPal is totally out of the question, dwolla is US only I believe and EU wire is possible but only if buyer really can't do BTC for some reason.Let me know if you can go first or prefer escrow, and who we should ask to escrow if the latter. That helps in my decision. @ummas: no, this is not an auction. This is one an 'open for offers' where I decide who I want to sell to @baby_ghost: Your offer is the best for just the cards, but I do have a very good offer for almost everything on one go which I'd favor. If you do not wish to wait for everyone to place their offers and me deciding, feel free to retract, no harm done. Otherwise, just give me a little more time. Ok. I see you are not registered on bitcoin-otc. Do you have pointers to deals you have already done with other members of this forum that vouch for your honesty? Right, just called the post office and it seems it only costs 6 to insure the package... Feels low, but that's good I guess!Want to make an offer? interesting... Withdrawals are available anytime with the 48h wait? In the event of a "bank run" how long would you take to recoup the invested 25% of the total?Also, are you equipped to handle 100 btc total or per lender? Tracking, yes, but I wouldn't trust the tracking to do much other than state it left my country and eventually you received it, from experience. As for insurance, there's an automatic insurance but the value is really low (~50eur + 5eur per kilo). I can try and find out if there's a separate insurance I can buy.You can also use any of the shipping companies and request a quote for them picking up at my place and delivering to yours, but my experience it that they always charge more. Not decent, no... just the 5970s ~80 EUR, everything would be ~140 EUR... ouch! Funny story, I carried a skateboard (just the board) on my backpack, clearly visible of course, from Orlando to Newark, and from there to Lisbon. No sweat, not even worth notice... Trying to catch a connection flight in Lisbon I was informed I could not carry the board in the cabin, because it is considered a dangerous item! My laptop is both heavier and has sharper corners, but did they care?On the bright side, I didn't have to take off my shoes. You have the best offer so far (someone bid more for the 5970s privately, but I much rather sell as bundle). Shipping is a bit more expensive because the whole think is very heavy. Expect 50~60 eur. I just realized I might not have made it clear, but I'll only take BTC, obviously. Bids in $ or  are fine though. So your offer is $910 + shipping, totally ~$975. How would you want to do this? Trust me or escrow? Look at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37805.0 for inspiration if the latter, davout has agreed to do this in the past.EDIT: I assume you understand you'll need thermal conductive paste and pads to mount the waterblocks. Everything is working fine, the only caveat is the lack of screws on the one waterblock.I am from pt. I've received a few offers by PM. I would rather get them here open to everyone, it is better and safer for everyone.A few notes for everyones benefit: shipping for the 2 cards to the US will cost 70~80 USD. I'll have to weigh the rest of the stuff to get shipping quotes.I'm open to sending first for people I trust (only a small set, to be honest). Everyone else will either send first (I'm well trusted, I guess) or I'll accept escrow from another member which is  trusted by both parties. I will *not* do any "I'll send part now, the rest on receipt" kind of deals. I was hoping for offers The speed is with stock cooling, but that doesn't mean the cards can't do more, 820 is just my magic number which has worked really stable across many cards, so I don't even try any other speed. Hello all,Following up my plan to take over the world and enslave all of mankind (or is it peoplekind these days?) I need to grab some funds, and as such here's some stuff I'll be selling for bitcoins, open to offers. Stuff is shipped from Europe and I'd rather keep it in Europe. Last time I sent stuff to the other side of the pond it took 3 weeks to arrive as it got stopped at customs, but I'm open to anything so as long as the buyer takes that in consideration.The stuff:2x 5970 used, working perfectly, have the BIOS tweaked to allow lowering the mem clock, but stock otherwise. I've been mining at 820/300, pushing 375MHs per core. Asus branded. No warranty other than it is working perfectly for me, I'll accept it back if you receive it and it doesn't work as advertised, but does have a few months of months of continuous mining on it.EDIT: these were sold to AniceInovation2x water blocks for 5970s, brand XSPC.1x water block for 5970, brand EK, with backplate. Beware though that I have lost the spacers and screws that go with this. You may want to contact EK to see if they sell replacements before bidding on this. I will update the post if I find the damn things 1x water pump, 12V DC Magicool Deep Quiet Pump Station 700, has some cracks on the bottom but doesn't leak, was working perfect when decommissioned.1x 9x120mm radiator, Phobya Xtreme Nova 1080, including the two feet to keep it straight.Some pictures: Which is a fair point given the amount of cries and tantrums posted on the forum and irc yesterday after the crash... Heh, yes, they are awesome, granted. But you are wrong about them not being usable anywhere else... you can reprogram them to use OTP, static pass, OATH, etc. You will not be able to use them in mtgox anymore, but I have one for that purpose already  More serious than barely dressed beautiful women? I gotta tell you, make wife makes the most serious faces when I'm looking (ahem, staring) at those, so I'd say that's pretty serious... no one has a mtgox yubikey they ordered but then never used? bump! 1270901 so, 127, as in the private class A? os is it 1.27.09.01? 12.70.90.1? This is very cool, and the show was much more 'to the point' than I ever expected. But if all the inquiries being done on amazon are linked to this forum and the amazon person in charge of investigating bitcoins starts at the obvious points, i.e. this forum, how does that look? I seriously hope that many people are doing that as a result of watching the show, but if not...Anyway, if nothing else, there'll be a huge surge of indian people interested in bitcoins, all of them call center employees  Hey Thiago,I sometimes buy stuff at amazon.co.uk and have been known to buy gift cards for it from members of the forum. I am going to do one buy of ~150 gbp, and you can buy a gift voucher from their site and sell it to me for bitcoins.You will need to be careful though, buying stuff with CC on currencies other than the one the CC is in incurs in extra charges. Let me know if you want to discuss this further.
Status update: sent this morning, tracking code provided to fulepp... now we wait  That's ok, their sold anyway  @fulepp: received. As I had told you I'll send today and will provide tracking number.@everyone else: Communication along the PCI express is hardly the bottleneck with current generation GPUs (when mining). I have ran 4 x 5970 (that's 8 GPU cores) on another board (an ASUS, can't remember the model) using 2 full length PCIe (at 8x) and 2 1x ports, without any performance degradation, though that was an LGA775 board. I have an agreement with fulepp to sell him:- 3x 5870, one XFX, 2 Saphire (one of the latter has issues with the fan at low RPM, but has been working fine at 90%)- 1x MSI 790GX-GD70- 1x AMD Sempron 140 with stock coolerAll the hardware is working great except for the fan thing mentioned. All cards have the BIOS tweaked to allow lower memory clocks (150Mhz) and all are doing at least 940MHz stable. There's plenty of dust on the cards, but I'm not charging extra for that Price agreed is 100btc, shipping included. fulepp will pay me 70btc first, and the other 30btc will follow in at most 30 days. Once I receive the first payment I'll ship with tracking.Payment can be done to address: 1PE3R2ADah8EJ16fp5e41BR86me27sNPFKPS: The 'magic ram speed', as best as I could find, is 190MHz. I would argue that this kind of functionality is *exactly* what the default client should do, and less of the UI handling which is better left for the UIs But I'll have a look at stratum, thanks for the pointer! I hope this wasn't covered before, couldn't find any references (but didn't look too hard)...BitcoinSpinner is a great mobile client, but the real magic happens underneath, in the BCCAPI server that has the blockchain and the pub keys, but no priv keys. It can then prepare transactions but the client, holding the priv key, needs to sign and resubmit to the server so it can then push the signed transaction to the network.This has many advantages for web services, such as removing the need to either have a separate bitcoind with a full blockchain for each service or share a daemon/blockchain but also the risk of holding all coins together. Also makes upgrading the server much easier, and allows the private key security to be handled by the web app coder instead of the sysadmin holding the bitcoind instance(s). I *really* like this, but I don't like running alternative bitcoin daemons for web services, especially when I can't easily review the critical code or trust that a lot of other people has done so already.What would it take to allow for this workflow on top of the bitcoind RPC mechanism? All the getbalance is there, we'd need afaict:- add public keys / addresses- request a transaction blob- document (create examples in whatever languages) how to properly verify the transaction blob actually matches what the client requested from the server- document (as above) how to properly sign the transaction- submit signed transaction back to serverWith this not only would open bitcoin servers be possible for alternate clients (even the standard one?) thus removing a lot of the initial pain for new users (less bloat, much lower initial bootstrap time) but more importantly would make the web service designer life much, much simpler.Can it be done? Has it been done while I wasn't looking?  I'm buying yubikeys, so if you have a mtgox yubikey you don't use or a generic one, I'll give you BTC 1.5 for each, shipped to Portugal. I would be interested in this, assuming what I read about the iPads not being carrier locked (unlike what you describe). If you could try a diferent carrier SIM card just to make double sure that would be super.I'm willing to give you 100btc shipped internationally (to Portugal), but I will not give anything up front. I'll gladly use an escrow, we can ask a forum member that is well trusted (see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37805.msg464209#msg464209 for some options, davout has agreed to escrow in the past) or, if you trust me, I can pay on receiving the iPad.I do prefer to keep the negotiating on the thread instead of PMs, if that's ok with you. I have 4 5870s, but I do want to keep one for gaming. I know 2 of them are XFX, can't remember the rest. One of them (non XFX) has the fan misbehaving, so I might keep that one and sell the others. I will let you know the exact makes soon, but what price range are you considering before I start tearing my miners apart? Why not the lowest daily weighted average for the period? Should be approx the same as the lowest value, after odd spikes are averaged out. And when you say non-binding does that mean either of the parties can just decide to not go through with the deal at maturation? As someone else pointed out to me, why not use http://nothingsteamed.com/beta/ ? Which is on sale for the next 5 hours: http://store.steampowered.com/app/31170/Anyone wants to sell me a gift? Will pay in BTC. I still feel that import should be a feature embedded in the main client, even if only when compiled with special switches and/or limited to the RPC. This is something I see as very important for my business ideas, but only as part of a server infrastructure.When it comes to the client side, the GUI, then I most certainly think that import could be completely avoided by the use of sweeping. I would even argue 'KISS' and no auto resweeping should be implemented... if you know more funds are going that key way, just resweep it yourself. Since the block chain is already in the client and we can know what balance exists in that key, we could completely skip the importing and thus display of any transaction log related to the swept key, which would make things very clear to users, even the "lower grade" ones.+1 for getting sweep in asap, it will make things easier for everyone. The only thing missing then is the (very dangerous) ability to export a private key without keeping it in wallet on the UI, so users can generate an address to send someone (like bitaddress.org does using JS), print QR code, email, whatever and then simply send funds to that address.We can already do that last part using external tools, but these are prone to a number of attacks, scams and the like. If 'regular joe' is able to send dad some funds using a private key he generated, we'll start seeing a much, much easier way of giving away bitcoins *before* educating people about it... perception of value:- Hey, why don't you go to this website, read about this new uber crypto pseudo-anonymous currency, browse the forum where many, many users are talking about scams, crypto algorithms, FPGAs, scams, politics and scams, then install the software, wait 2 days for the block chain to download, generate an address for me which by the way will keep changing in the UI and I can try to explain why but without knowing the basic concept behind this it will all sound very complicated and THEN I'll send you 10 btc to get you started... versus ..- Hey, here's a voucher for 10 bitcoins. You already have the "cash", now you just need to <insert hoops to jump here>.So while the effort is exactly the same, the latter gives you the value immediately and you are much more likely to jump the hoops  This might be a bit off, as I'm not sure about the implications, but what about a 'not known' timestamp, always displayed on top by first come order? It could be shown as current timestamp (read, changes as seconds pass) which would be cool and confusing, but most simply not showing any timestamp until transactions are assigned to a block and using the block time from then on?Outbound transactions, the ones we send, could benefit from keeping the actual transaction creation timestamp, but even then I'd be plenty satisfied if I knew the timestamp of the block in which they got included. Yes I can. It's just hard to do so without giving away too much of a potential project idea, but better support trumps business secrecy any day in my book so; I have a storage of priv keys, generated offline, and I need to hot include these on a running server. Now mind you I own these keys, I generated them myself, but they do not exist in a wallet, that would be VERY impractical.I could take the server down, use pywallet, start with -rescan. But I don't want to HAVE to batch imports, meaning a rescan for each key. Because I know at which time point the key was first used (and most times it will not have been used at all, thus no -rescan is needed), and that is very easy to find when unknown if the blockchain is properly indexed, so I can request a rescan from block nr X.This is the one case I have where sweep would simply not fit, but for every other case I've come across and use a custom patched client for, sweep would be just fine. Though sweep with an option to keep the key in the wallet but *not* resweep would work just as well. Agreed, except those doing web services that might depend on this feature are left with either non-official clients or patching the official ones, which gets complicated to maintain in a stable, well tested way. A product with both 'foolproof' and 'powerful' is possible in theory. Let those that are capable of compiling switch the 'advanced' mode on, though of course there will be someone sending ready built 'advanced' versions to foolish users.Make it a configuration that you have to edit by hand, and make the first run of the client show a bit red flashing 1999-web-page-like dialog stating they WILL screw up eventually, so be careful.Not giving the option by default is a smart move, maybe even only give using RPC to start with and see how inventive users get. But not giving the option at all because it might be dangerous... I gave a user an address for him to send me 70 coins for some stuff I sold... but I gave one of my *sending* addresses instead of *receiving*. I was stupid, but what allowed this to happen? Was it the copy to clipboard feature? The address book? Should we get rid of both? Nope, they have no way of knowing, they said. The service expected time is "up to 7 work days" like I told you, but that is all I have. I have send the package a little over an hour ago and have provided dmcursor with a tracking code. Hint: avoid going to the post office close to xmas  davout: which key did you use to sign that message? Your support@bitcoin-central.net doesn't match if I'm doing things correctly here.
dmcursor, would you rather I send the funds to davout for safekeeping? I would like to stress (for everyone) that (ab)using trusted forum members is very inexpensive and can save a lot of confusion and grief when the buyer doesn't fully trust the seller. Of course this is not foolproof, but certainly adds to the whole security.So my offer still holds; I will send the funds to davout and will pay his fee if that makes you more comfortable. I did recover the funds, am holding them currently, so that part is done. I will only be able to visit the post office in the afternoon but I will ship it today and provide a tracking number. Yes, well, it's my fault, you did your part so regardless of the outcome you get the cards shipped tomorrow. That's for me to learn to either sleep more or slow down. I found the owner of the address and have emailed the person... I'm very sure he'll return the coins as soon as he verifies things. *cleans forehead* Don't know if Tech Support is the place for this, but I couldn't find a better match.Did anyone receive 70.55 btc earlier today? I gave the wrong address to a buyer ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=54018.msg649444#msg649444 ) and he ended up sending the coins there, but that is not one of my receiving addresses, rather one of the addresses I sent to in the past.Specifically, I sent 20 coins there on May 16, but can't put my finger on what that was all about. I'll keep on digging to see if I can find out, but if you recognize the address or received the value and want to do a good deed  ... let me knowTHANKS!-- edit: I believe I found the recipient and have contacted the person already... locking the thread for now, feel free to call out my stupidity on the other thread  Too late to send today, and I wasn't seeing anything on my wallet. I looked up block explorer and there it was, along with a bunch of transactions that looked foreign to me...So I SCREWED UP and gave you one of my sending addresses! Stupid me, now I need to find out who or what that address belongs to, maybe I can still salvage this!Anyway, my loss, I'll honor the deal and send the cards, but I can only do so tomorrow since the post office closes at 6pm (GMT).oh how stupid of me, that was really a horrible mistake... You mean at the time of payment? We can, sure, so as long as you know it can go both ways Anyway, I'm about to run out of time to send today, so if I'm to do it you'll have to send the coins to me directly. You can do that to 1DysvPKw61XbRRRFqQNCbCEHXSstVFRHwa or we can wait for davout to appear, which he will eventually (but then I'll have to ship tomorrow, in fact I'm not sure I can still ship today, but I can try).Current avg is 3.19, so $225 is 70.53 btc. A little off topic, but when did the transaction dates stop being shown from the block timestamp and started being the timestamp at which the block was received? This bugs me because I do mental averages of generation, and only start the client every now and then, which then proceeds to download the blockchain pinning all new transactions under more or less the same date and time, i.e. now.This still happens with 0.5.1, don't know if a bug or feature, it started somewhere on the 0.4 series and I always forget to report...Other than that, looks very stable to me, but I've only done 'normal' usage, no real hard core testing. Do you have power consumption figures to go with that? I have asked davout to post a payment address here. When he does send I expect dmcursor to send the coins there after which I'll proceed to sending the package.To make everything perfectly clear:- davout will escrow the deal, I pay davout- I'm shipping 2x 5970 that only mine with one core, one dead 5970 (board only), one original 5970 cooler (no screws) and one twisted faceplate.- dmcursor is paying me $225 for the package, shipping included.- current 24hr weighted average according to bitcoincharts is $3.18/BTC, meaning dmcursor will send BTC 70.75 to davout I will not be home for 5~6 hours still, and I want to have it all packed up and ready to go before you pay. There's always the possibility I can't ship today, though I'll do my very best, but I don't want you to pay until I'm positive I'll head out to the post office immediately after. davout has agreed to serve as escrow for this deal. Once I have everything packed up I'll ask him to post a payment address here so dmcursor can send the coins. The 24h weighted average according to bitcoincharts is $3.18/BTC, so 70.75 BTC is the current price. The 2x crippled 5970s plus the dead one are sold to dmcurser for $225. We'll keep posting here as things progress, as dmcurser requested. No one else. One last detail, dmcursor; are you willing to take the dead 5970 with the cooler detached, no screws and no front plate? I have the screws somewhere but I seem to have misplaced them, along with the ones from a bunch of other cards I took apart for watercooling. I'm sure I can find them but I don't really have the time to search right now. The front plate I have bent to allow using it on the the last slot of a case, when watercooling, and while you can try to bend it back (I have also done a few cuts to allow for easier bending) I'm not really about to try that.I can obviously send the bent front plate if you want it. How much added to ship to Europe? And do you really have no more RAM left? BTW, is this the board? -> http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_1155/P8P67_WS_Revolution/#specifications Well, around here I don't really see used 5870s going for under 150, roughly $200. I'll be obviously willing to let them go for a bit less than that, but your offer, using the same calculations I did in a previous post, rendered me around $118 per card, or less than 87.All: I'm about to put the hammer down on the 5970s, anyone else wants to bid on them? That is still very low for the 5870s. Are you still interested in getting the 3x5970s for $225? I can't quite understand your answer above. I didn't say I'd ship first thing on Monday, I said I wouldn't do it over the weekend for sure.I will not sell you the 5870s for the price you offered, so lets take that out of the equation. Your current offer is $225 for the 2x5970s plus the dead one, shipped, correct? The headset is gone too.So I still have both XOs, prices from last post still accepted.I also have the iRiver, make me an offer.Finally the RAM, both SODIMMs for 8 BTC to Euro, 9 to the US Location sent as PM. Weight, each card is just over 1.2Kg, plus around 600g of original box (which I can do without when shipping multiple cards, pack them light, but the risk of damage in transit will be higher). Expect 1.8~1.9Kg per shipped card.The 5870s are around 300g lighter. 1Kg ~ 2.205 pounds
Besides just the one what?I would also like to see a better price, and I have a few alternatives for shipping to Europe. But US bound it seems that I can't really find anything cheaper for the weight. Also, it really doesn't matter where in the US I'm shipping to, it's always the same for me.If you can find a better deal, maybe you can request a collection at my house from some delivery company? I know that is possible for companies with accounts with DHL and UPS, but I 'm not all too sure that's possible for private individuals. Well, I'm pretty sure I can get a much better deal on the 5870s.As for the shipping, remember this is being sent from Europe, not the US. I might be able to get a cheaper price, as the ones I'm quoting are from the local mail agency, but for these weights it gets really expensive to send to another continent. That's one of the reasons I was trying to push this to someone in Europe, as with the same price I can get a fairly larger profit, with less going onto shipping. 5970s: I'll pay ~$105 for shipping, which leaves $120. That's $60 per card and you get the dead one as bonus. Just stating this here in case someone else wants to make an offer and wants to know the item price minus shipping.for all cards: so I'd be paying an extra $50 for the 5870s to be shipped along with the 5970s, which means that 475 - 225 - 50 = 200, or $67 per card. That is not all that interesting to me, to be honest. For reference, I take 1300MHs+ from these cards. You don't have to, but I would surely appreciate it But the original sell offer for the 4 (plus the dead one) is no longer in effect, so I guess the short answer is; yes.Probably tomorrow I'll make my mind regarding the 5870's, just in case you are interested on these as well. Ok, I'm really sorry but I'll have to change my offer. I have:- 2x 5970 with a single core working (each pumping ~370MHs @ 820/300, fan 80% keeps temps at ~55ºC)- 1x 5970 dead. It passes POST and is detected by the driver, but then the driver crashes at the first --odgc. I have it as just the board, the cooler is now detached (I wanted to do another visual inspection). Can be shipped fairly cheap like this, as most of the weight comes from the cooler, but I can also send the cooler (though detached, not wasting any more thermal paste on this one). As an added note, I used the screws from this one on another board, as I seem to have lost my big'ol bag'o'screws. I will find it, but I may not have time to search for it for some time.The other 2x 5970 that were supposed to be cripple have found a new breath of life. I opened them to re-apply thermal paste in preparation for the buyer and when I tested them they were working again. I thought it would be a passing thing but they both endured a good 10 hours mining @ 820 without any incidents. They might still be crippled, I'm certainly not confident on their health, but they are working well atm. If anyone wants to make an offer on these I'll consider it, but 5970s are the most power efficient GPUs I have tested, so these are the ones I want to keep.If I do end up keeping the 5970s, I might have 3x 5870 working perfectly (*) for sale instead... I need to juggle the power requirements as explained before, so the less efficient must go.(*) - 1xSaphire, 1xATI, 1xXFX - the ATI has a wonky fan, it makes an awful sound at low RPM and seems to stop and start regularly, but when at 80% is works great, which is where I keep it anyway. I have one potentially dead XFX that could donate the cooler after I do a good check on it.PS: Of course there's a chance that either or both of the recovered 5970s go south again, in which case I'll just go back to the original offer. Since I will not be shipping anything before Monday anyway, I thought I'd just come forward with this new information and I'll update the thread as needed if things change. There is no obvious damage to the cards, that much I know. I assume that, unless there's a very obvious component to replace I'll be better off just selling the cards to someone that will make good use of the working core, but since you guys obviously know better if there is something else I should look for, some component I can pop off and test somehow, I'd be happy to try. I'm (obviously) no electronics engineer, but from the way the cards behaved, especially when I could still use them with 2D but not 3D I would say the VRMs are almost certainly to blame. Of course, I don't really have a good way of asserting that.Is that something I can fix "at home"? I have access to top of the line soldering stations, all the test equipment I can handle, and all the other gizmos at a friend's factory, but I don't want to waste their time unless there's a chance it can actually work, and I surely can't use any of it without proper guidance. Well, I did learn it and I've been told no lesson is too expensive, provided you learn it None of the two verbs presented make sense to me... sorry. Reflowing make me think about wave flow soldering, which is NOT something I'll try, and reballing makes me think of basketball which, hmmm, there's an idea!  Indeed that's true and I have since learned my lesson, proof being I have a handful of 5970s and 5870s that work flawlessly and have done so for almost a year now. But these have been mining on the good core without issues.They will not work for gaming because the primary core is the damaged one. Most will not even give any image, and while one of them (at least) does give image, using any 3D will immediately lock or reboot. That is one great question. They didn't all die simultaneously, mind you, but I've been mining for over a year now and I have had my share of overheating cards, so I'm guessing that's the thing.Nowadays I do either WC or open frame with pci-e extenders, but there was a time when I ran 2 or 3 5970 on a smallish case with improper air flow, meaning they would run at 80~90ºC for weeks in a row. So I'm guessing that did it, but they didn't just fail, the cores would start locking randomly (always the same core) and I would eventually take out the card, take the cooler off, apply better thermal paste and replace pads as needed, it would run both cores for a while again and then the failing core would start failing again until eventually the failing core would die and neve operate again.There's at least one of the cards where the failing core is still operational, in the sense you can mine off it for a while before it locks. I have also completely killed some 5970s along the way, and I have one such paperweight if anyone is after the cooler or believes they can fix it. The card does POST and gets detected by the X driver, but one call to aticonfig --odgc takes a minute or so to respond, after which the driver locks. My experience is with XP and about an year ago. I tried mining on Windows and what is appeared to me is that the two cores were usable individually, but windows kept the cores linked internally, thus there was always some processing going on in either core, which is something you most certainly don't want with these cards.So, yeah, I wouldn't buy these if you are stuck with windows, but it might work, I don't know. No problem, it is just important we keep things as clear as possible, for everyones benefit.So $300 for all 4, shipped... I'll pay around $140 for shipping these, which leaves me with $160 for the pack, or $40 a piece. I'll have to do some calculations to see if it is worth the trouble or not, but for now... any higher bidders? Maybe someone in Europe so the shipping doesn't take such a high cut? I have obviously tried my best to grab this deal before someone else would take it from me by offering a fair price  BTW, thanks for that, Littleshop!We couldn't come to an agreement, and while I haven't had a reply to my last PM to the seller, the reason I'm backing off is really simple; scarletwolf doesn't mind me sending the btc after receiving the phone, or at least put it under escrow after he shows me the shipping slip, but he wants the shipping value ahead of time so he "doesn't loose money if I decide to change my mind after he sends".As I have stated before, I will put the whole value, shipping included, in the hands of a commonly agreed to escrow before he ships, but I will not send him any coins before I receive the phone. This, it seems, is not something he can agree with.I asked him to state this here so others know he is open to offers again but remember; "if it seems to good to be true...".Good luck to whoever gets to buy this, it seems to be an amazing deal. Ok, I'm not familiar with the unit of measurement of value you state... is that us$, btc, something else?They are as good as a 5870, but with lower clock ranges and much better cooling. So better than a 5850, not more or less a 5830.And the country? I'm biased to believe you are American, given you decided to assume I know where you are.There is no 'rest of the rig'. If you read my posts carefully you'll see only the cards are offered, the full rig would be something I'd cook up if I was to decide giving away the cards to relatives. I'm willing to sell for what they are deemed to be worth by the community. I didn't put up any price on purpose, though I will give this away to a family member, as a full working mining machine, if the price offered is just not worth my trouble of packaging and sending. Come to think of it, that's one amazing xmas gift Anyway, make me a full offer, how many cards, full price in btc or us$ you are willing to pay for them shipped and also tell me where I'll be shipping to, and I will most certainly consider it. Hey,So I've tried to push some of these before, but ended up not doing it. I have 4 x 5970 that all exhibit the same crippled symptoms; one of the cores can't be used, it locks at 99% usage if you use it and eventually the whole card stops responding.They all work (and are working) if you limit yourself to the other core. I can get ~360MH/s out of each with 820Mhz (using 300Mhz ram clock). I'm no longer sure what brand these are as I've mixed and matched the fans, with AC coolers and watercooling in the midst. They are all reference design, some will be Saphire, some ATI and some Asus. The BIOS has been tweaked in all of them to allow using lower ram clocks, down to 300Mhz, but that's it, stock voltages and other values for everything else.I can only mine with these during the night time, as my household power usage during the day prevents me from sucking all that power without tripping the breaker, thus I'm starting to "clean up the house". These are the first I will try to sell, but I'll also have some WC material to follow. No photos yet, but you know what a 5970 looks like, right? NO GUARANTEE!!! The fact one core gave up means the other may give up too, obviously. I can assure you the other works, and has worked consistently for months after the first one gave up (if only at night time as described), so if you get a card from me and it simply does not work, I'll take it back and refund. But if it works and then quits, you are on your own, I will not take any refunds after a couple of days from you receiving the card.Also, don't even consider using this on windows unless you can make sure the bad core isn't touched at all. These cards don't give out any image (probably because the bad core is the one responsible for the DVI output) so they are worthless outside mining.Finally, these will be shipped from Europe, and they are heavy. Expect $45 shipping in Europe and $65 to the US, though I might be able to cut that down a little if I shop around. Of course, combining shipments is possible and less expensive than individual ones, but ask for quote first.Any takers? Not a problem. Because I'll be travelling to that side of the pond very soon I'll try to work out someone to receive the phone for me in the States. Failing that I'll need you to ship to Europe, I'll PM you the country + zip code.Not that it matters but how many GB does the iphone have? And what IOS version do you have it in? Right, I should have assumed Canada when you mentioned Rogers... Heh, I'm going way down south, so no meet'n'greet in person for sure. Still, let me know if you think we can come to an agreement on the deal process. Perfect I don't think IDs and such are of much help, and I don't want to assume you are a scammer obviously. I wasn't proposing using an escrow site, but rather asking one of the older, trusted members of this forum to mediate the transaction. If we can't find one that we both trust and you don't trust me either then I'm afraid we can't work this out. Have a look at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37805.0 for a list of potential candidates. I have been around for almost 1.5 years and if you search the forum you'll see that there's little risk in dealing directly with me, but since I could have been just waiting for this opportunity to grab your iphone and run (*wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*) I will perfectly understand if you require a third party. Where are you located, btw, as I'll be visiting the US soon and, who knows, maybe I'll be close by. I could be interested but:- Is it simlocked? If it is then I'm not interested as I'll be using it in Europe and I want to keep the regular apple updates.- I will not pay anything upfront, period. I can use a trusted member as escrow, and will gladly pay for his/hers/its service, but since you have zero trust here, and a quick check will show you I'm well trusted, I feel that this shouldn't be a show stopper for you.Pictures? Date of purchase? Any extra info regarding the device, like scratches and bumps as well as battery life would be really helpful.Thanks!
Yep, fully agree with you. I used to make what I believed were witty and smart, though markably sarcastic remarks all the time. It never failed, I was always misunderstood, the point I was making as irony was taken literally and overall I didn't make many new friends... so yeah, better to just stay clear of zealots and die-hard educators. But there are still many that parse the "fun" posts and actually use them to the benefit of everyone, and S3052 is one such person, so not all is lost yet. And your irony detection is apparently as good as your tripping point prediction  Todos aqueles que venderam ao preço corrente na altura e agora estão a recomprar ao preço presente  wow, right, I read October for some reason... Well, was it sold? Still available? Price shipped to EU? Ok, nevermind then. I don't think shipping the whole thing to Europe would be easy or economical, and I really only need the OS. Thanks anyway. How much for windows (do you have the full box?) with physical media and license, shipped to EU? Is that shipped to EU? Is the windows 7 OEM or retail? If the latter I'd be interested... Hmmm, yes and no. I have no quarrel with the automated interface, my issue is with the lack of obvious connection to you. It's your service, not yourself, although the difference is only important because you aren't mentioned anywhere on the service's pages that I could find. It might be moot, and I'll be happy to add you to the list (which I'm not sure has served anyone to date), sometimes I'm dense this way. Hey. That's great, the more the better. This particular thread is for individuals willing to escrow, but I certainly appreciate the information. Neither. I've had nothing but really polite and helpful replies to all my queries and, yes, complaints on the services I use.You mention a single email thread from a single company, if I understand correctly. That being the case then in fact you have fully understood what the real moto of bitcoin talks around here are: be quick to complain and criticize, generalize as much as possible and hide all helpful specifics. It's a shame, but that's the trend with people pasting full articles without mentioning where they come from, speaking of 'that individual' or 'that company' as if everyone that would match that description were to blame for everything.Anyway, just restating my point, the bitcoin commercial community has shown nothing but great skill at professionally handling all the requests I've put forward thus far, sorry you didn't have the same experience. Good!And that's where the feet shooting begins. By limiting the system to the fanatic and well educated (on the system) few, without coming up with a better alternative to the already broken system that got the masses to be going through huge ordeals, what this does in the end is show a viable alternative, a light at the end of the tunnel if you will, to the people that are forced to use a system they don't trust or want.Microsoft was all about 'embrace and extend' which is actually the only way I see bitcoin be at danger right now. By simply dismissing it or trying to show all that is wrong with it will simply make the system stronger and more reliable... for when the time is right  This is just plain wrong, in the karmic sense of the word! Bitcoins are about freedom, why would you use then to help you tie the knot?Wrong, wrong, wrong... now I have to take a long shower and scrub myself clean. My common running joke here on these posts is: "You are American, right?".But what I really want to say is where are you shipping from and will you ship to Europe? If Inaba isn't willing or not trusted by both sides, have a look at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37805.0 where some old time forum members, most of them very trustworthy stepped forward and will help you with the escrow part (some for a fee). Pictures? Shipping to Europe would be how much more, if possible?I assume you take bitcoins? So when can we expect to be able to order this ? :p Do you have the actual physical media to match? I'm assuming you are selling keys from boxed products, not OEM versions bundled with PCs (you did say legal, right?) Ok, do you want to open a separate thread, so others have the opportunity to outbid me? Assuming the phone is in very good condition, not locked to a carrier and I can allow for Apple's automatic upgrades without locking the phone, I'll bid $300, shipped to Europe, in BTC. I will want to see pictures first, though  And I would have bought it here, but I want one that is free from cell provider locks (not just soft unlocked). Is yours locked too?
Oh, I see it in the topic now, Tmobile. I guess the $400 price tag threw me off, as I can get it factory unlocked for ~280, which is roughly $400. Come to think of it, your price is not as good as I thought initially, especially as shipping will add a premium to it.Sorry for the time wasting... It's not bound to any network, is it? Would you ship it to Europe? Are your prices for real? I mean http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nico-BLIND-MELON/dp/B000002U4E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1319667889&sr=8-1 c'mon... So, you are American, right? I say this because you mention "I send from here to Russia" but never say where "here" is, which is very... american Don't take it personally, I make this joke every chance I get, and I get a lot of chances around here. But jokes aside, you are correct that it can be tagged as money laundering, because that's the 'catch all' that governments use to justify the control measures in place. Imagine that you live in the States and have a 2nd degree cousin in Russia, with which you have a very close relationship. Now, you have a friend in Russia, completely unrelated to your cousin who is having some issues paying for something or another. You mention this to your cousin, ask him to give the guy some cash and promisse to pay him a fancy dinner next time you're together.Money laundering? No money moved across borders, and for all we know, this is the exact same thing that happens with our service, unless fiat money is in fact moved across borders. Now the real catch is bitcoins and the fact we get fiat money for them. If we where able to operate properly balanced agent nodes, where only bitcoins where ever moved and never converted to cash then it would be no different from the case presented, but even then governments could call it money laundering and shut it down. Only if we can make this legal and taxable will the governments leave it be, because it is in their interest and, to be legal, we would need to get rid of the pseudo anonymous nature of bitcoins and collect all the same data about clients that WU and the like do... not my perfect scenario.But I digress, I just wanted to make the joke!  What about a reversed pawn shop approach? Don't know if there is any legal case to be made or I'm just doing some mental gimmicks but a pawn shop takes your stuff and pays you for it. It didn't *buy* you stuff (disclaimer; I never used a pawn shop, so I just assume this is the way it works). Thus you agree to let me hold your VCR, I agree you hold my $10. No transaction was performed per se.Now, you come back and say you want the VCR back, I say "well, give me back my $10, plus $1 for my trouble". Lets ignore the +$1 for now, as this is profit and marks the whole thing as a business deal.But say you can't come to the shop for some reason, so you give your girlfriend the paper slip I gave you to prove you are in fact the owner of the VCR (I mean, I can't remember everyone's face, right?), so your GF hands me the slip and the $10, I give her the VCR.You see where I'm going... what if we could pawn fiat money? Maybe that is not legal, as legal tender is never owned by any person, we are just allowed to use it, so pawning something you don't own is a no-no for sure. But if we reverse the chain of events and you give me $100 back for the 'good idea (tm)' you will be pawning later in the day at some other location, and the some other person, holding the "receipt slip" goes in to some other branch and pawns the 'good idea (tm)' for $100, net profit is $0, and maybe we could get away with it? Wonder how Linden Labs goes about the Linden Dollars... I mean, it's in game, there's a central body, but in the end, is it a token as in some kind of good or is it money services? Do they have to comply with anything special? I'm positive that will not work, at least not legally. The bearer bonds you speak of are a great idea, although getting a company going somewhere bearer bonds are still allowed will be expensive. The thing is when a client gives you $100 and you give them the code you are selling them the code, unless we try to make this a "transport" service, where the client pays us to grab the $100 bill and move it to the recipient.Thing is, every time fiat money gets moved as a service you are acting as a money service. That's a bank's job, plain and simple. The alternatives are selling things (and rebuying on the other side) or work in some other place more relaxed in the money tracking and taxes.I do love the bearer bonds principle, though. My point was between agents, the client side is covered as you point out. What I meant is if the mtgox voucher is created by agent A, when agent B gets the redeem code agent A gave to the client and needs the attached mtgox voucher code, he either needs to contact agent A or have some DB managing that. Just putting the mtgox vouchers on an open (to agents) pool and expect everyone to behave and only use the codes they actually are entitled to use is, at best, over optimistic.Yes, or the exchange rate used can be slightly higher than the interbank, just like exchange bureaus do (but no need to charge 10% plus or minus like these do). I'm not sure I get it... you mean the shelf would be connected to the POS and have a scanner there so you would flash your QR codes, grab the goods and flee? This is the middle man being the teller...It is actually a great idea, but one more closely related to the bitcoin vending machine thread (that I'm too lazy to search and link), whereas this is about using bitcoin as 'just another payment system' on existing stores. I'm not sure we would be making many friends if we told people "And your employer can now sack you, because they have bitcoins!". That is not necessarily true. Right now bitcoin is a marginal thing, but were it mainstream the blockchain would have the payment recorded and you would be holding the priv key to the address, so you could prove you paid 'someone'. If the recipient could be linked to the store on which you are buying (I know a script kiddie would just change the receiving address on the teller at mcdonalds, given the chance, but that's why merchants may need a blackbox approach to POS) and it would be left to the store to prove they sent the change.Remember we are talking (or at least I am) normal stores, receipt at the end of purchase (maybe even stating the address they sent to so they are protected against people complaining they stole the coins) and good reasons to keep the customer satisfied (i.e., not go out of business). I'm not trying to push this as the ultimate solution for merchants, but rather one we can work on right now and is very much no-nonsense. I assume this is not bound to any particular network? Oh, and just to stress this point a bit more, the reason you can (could, to be honest, most places don't do it anymore) do offline transactions with credit cards is because the credit card company holds both sides of the deal in a tight grip; if the client didn't have enough credit, they'll not only allow the charge but also add fees and taxes to the client for going over the limit, and if the merchant did something bad, they keep the transactions hostage for a couple of weeks anyway, so they'll collect to repay the client without any extra cost to them.That and they charge huge fees to both sides too, so they have plenty of leverage. I think my original idea is much simpler than what is being depicted. You know how mtgox allows you to enter a privkey and they import that key and transfer whatever bitcoins are there into your account? Same thing, except mtgox becomes starbucks.Yes, the merchant will need internet and bitcoin, but it can be as blackboxed or open as required, that's not the point. The real point is me, the client, don't need to have internet or a bitcoin client on my phone to make payments in bitcoin, and I also don't need to use or trust 3rd parties to hold my wallet, and frankly no change to the protocol and almost no change to the bitcoin client is needed.This is very 'low tech', we're not sharing transactions, just bitcoin keys, and in a controlled way, so if I'm paying 17.85 and I share the priv keys to 18 btc with the merchant, that's the extent of what they can steal, even if I have 1000 btc in priv keys on my phone. The time to market on such a solution is very small and although it is not by any means perfect, still leaving the door open for a number of attacks, it is something anyone with a smartphone and a computer can use without any technical knowledge of what's going on behind the scenes. Hell, my father would be able to use this, if he had a smartphone that is As for the merchant side, if you can convince one major merchant to use bitcoins and they understand what these are, 80% of the hard work is already done. I could easily tweak the standard bitcoin client to operate on both the client and the merchant side as described. Why didn't I do it? Sheer lack of time, but if enough people agree with the idea and noone else takes the lead I'll be glad to take a stab at it, just find me a physical brick and mortar store willing to try it out Or I may be full of hot air, it is Friday... I'm well aware of that, and that is not the case I'm trying to address at all. Ignore the educational videos, think about starbucks, a restaurant or a bookstore. Or any big chain that you already "trust". Well, this kind of defeats the purpose of the thin phone app, which is to have very little logic and no connectivity requirements at the store. The use case I have is pretty simple, I travel a lot and don't have wifi / 3G available everywhere. On the other hand merchants are mostly static and have connectivity, so...Yep, the merchant certainly has the tools to be able to have a good level of confidence on the collected funds. And if you take out the outrageous fees credit card companies charge them, as well as all the chargebacks, I'm sure merchants would be happy to suck up the fees to have faster block inclusions. This could very well be the leverage needed to increase the fee per block to a place where it becomes interesting for miners.Yep, that is a great idea, I'd say that is pretty much mandatory.With the backup and encryption, we could go as far as having the phone part be completely dumb. The thick client generates 10k addresses, encrypts the priv keys and provides encryptedpriv+addr+balance to the phone. The phone limits its action to managing the payments. No network on the go needed, ever, to handle these wallets. The only caveat, which already existed with my original approach, is that is I double spend (human error, software bug, malice, whatever) the merchant will collect 18 priv keys and realize one is empty, thus requests another one from me. At this point I refuse to pay (or I don't have any more btc available) and go home... both myself and the merchant hold the priv keys, and this opens a trust problem.Proving the address had balance and it was in fact the merchant that stole is pretty easy, just look at the blockchain timestamps, but with no central authority I screwed nonetheless. Though I'm sure the merchant would not get any more business from me or any of my peers, which might be enough security right there. I was walking around a Mall and thought this up, probably based on ideas stolen here and there on these fora.An android (or whatever you smartphone flavor is) app that is capable of generating bitcoin keys, and knows a little bit about encryption. The idea depends on thick clients both at home and in store, but the 'wallet' becomes much simpler to handle:I have 100 btc on my osx bitcoin client, and I'm going out on a shopping spree. I'm not taking everything with me, I guess 20 btc is enough for what I'm doing anyway, so I pair my phone and my computer and press 'load 20 btc into phone wallet'. There is a static 'change' address associated with the phone wallet.Getting to the store, I buy some porn^H^H^H^H educational dvds and head to the teller, where they say my total is 17.85 BTC. I punch that value into my wallet app, enter my pin and a QR code appear. The store scans it and I get my receipt.At home I see I have .15 in my change address, and linking the phone to the computer I click 'empty wallet' (that name is really scary) and 2 BTC are moved to the computer wallet.---So what happened behind the scene? - Loading BTC into the phone wallet: The phone generated 20 addresses, stored the priv keys pin encrypted and gave the adresses to the thick client, which transfered 1 BTC to each of these, thus putting a total of 20 BTC in. The 'change' address is set if not already so.- Paying on the store: When we punch in 17.85, and having 1 BTC on each address, the app provides 18 priv keys in the QR code (or codes, probably need more than one) along with the change address. The store scans, imports addresses and transfers to their own key. Maybe wait a few confirms, maybe not, depending on the value of the tx? Because they received 18 BTC they then send the change to the set address.- At home, the list of pub keys is sent to the thick client, it checks the balance on each address and cross references with what the phone app says happened. It identifies the two addresses that still have a balance and requests the priv keys for these, transfering to the change address.So the addresses generated by the phone are really 'use and throw away', and all the phone needs to do is manage what addresses have balance available. Not good for full offline use, but you don't need to have a bitcoin client on the phone, and frankly you don't even need the phone, but it does provide some security as the priv keys are always kept encrypted and you can even use multiple amounts per address, just like paper bills, and have a different pin for each value (say 50x1BTC + 3x10BTC + 1x20BTC, that would be 3 pins).Just an idea, didn't quite think this through, but this could easily be implemented that much I'm sure of. So there are two barriers that I can think of to just go ahead with that solution:- Trust... We are keeping the vouchers inside the network, so A gets a voucher from mtgox and issues a redeem code to the client. How does agent B get that voucher without the intervention of agent A? A central DB needs to be developed to allow getting vouchers from redeem codes. It's simple, though, I can cook something up relatively quickly.- Exchange rates... we are dealing with currencies other than USD, and maybe even receiving one currency and delivering another. These rates don't usually fluctuate as wildly as bitcoin, but they do fluctuate, so care needs to be taken when dealing with other currencies (other than USD, that is). so... no way to buy these using BTC? Hmmm, at the risk of repeating what has already been said, and pretending it was my own idea;A simple option using, for example, mtgox (though we could leverage risk by using multiple exchange sites) would be to just buy the exact amount of fiat currency with bitcoins and then transfer that amount to the account of the other agent, or a central hub account. That cash would then be converted back to bitcoins at the date of the client withdrawal which, using the sites internal transfer, would mean no cash was actually flowing in and out, we would always and only get bitcoins moved:- Client visits agent A and gives $100 to transfer- A buys $100 worth of coins using his personal stash (on mtgox for this example)- A gives bittransfer code to client- Other client visits agent B and provides bittransfer code- B asks A for 'the dough' giving him the code- A sends mtgox voucher for $100 to B- B converts to bitcoins at his leisure- B gives $100 to Other clientA central hub could remove the dependency of original agent being awake and online. In fact, each exchange could easily behave as a central exchange using a feature like mtgox vouchers. I mean, we could use it *right now* by simply creating vouchers and giving them to the clients, while at the same time 'cashing in' vouchers for clients receiving money.I would love to be able to 'brand' this, though, just to make sure the cash ins and cash outs stay in the agent network. For that to happen we'd need to ask exchanges to have a special voucher creation with a static prefix that only a specific group of people was allowed to both create and redeem. Heh, Cali as in California, US, I assume. It is very common for US citizens to assume everyone else is located in the US, but you may also mean Cali in Columbia, so just making sure.I'm in Europe and I'll bid 200 BTC for both 5870s plus the HP tablet, including shipping.
how many 5870s do you have and where are you located? The HTC phone is no longer available.I'll let the OLPC B2 go for 20 BTC shipped to Europe, 25 BTC to US. Only for the remainder of this week  If we can assume agents are honest, we can at least assure a zero liability system;- Agent A (sender) tells Agent B (receiver) to lock $100- Agent B sells $100 of btc from market and tells A how many coins that took (X)- Agent A receives $100 from client and sends X coins to Agent B- Agent B gives $100 to other clientSo now Agent A is +$100 and -X BTC, Agent B is -$100 and +X BTC. Say coins increase in price, Agent A can request X coins back from B at $100 and net will be 0 (except for the transfer of the $100, which may be factored as a fee)Why do this? Why wouldn't B just sell the coins instead? Because this is not a "make money fast" scheme, this is a value transfer service. And you that because you know it works both ways. There should be an expiration on this agreement, of course, so if within 30 days A doesn't decide to exercise the buy option, that's that. I believe a simple solution is to have an "agreement process", a hand shake on the transfers. So you have a client wanting to send 100 to my geographic region, we agree to do this (regardless of exchange, you say you'll receive the 100, I say I'll pay the 100 which I must already have) and that's that.You ask me for a redeem code (which in fact closes the deal) and I give you the code + the bitcoin amount to be paid, based on bitcoincharts weighted averages (24h? USD because it has the most volume?) which you'll then proceed to send to me.What I do with the coins is then my own responsibility, and if the market is going down I'll sell my own coins before you send yours, or if the other way around I'll set a stop order for the rate we agree upon, whatever.The only caveat is I can be completely wrong and make a bad move, loosing most of my coins / cash. A rogue agent could decide to cut the losses and not deliver the transaction, disappearing from the act. So we need a 'warranty fund' to protect the sending agent and the client, which would be the initial deposit you spoke of, I assume.Could work... Yes, that is unfortunately very true, although I see two major things having impact that may very well change that; the publicity deriving from an EU wide ruling stating Bitcoins are Currency, and the need to change the very definition of Currency on their own rule book and, from that, the attention an 'alternative currency not managed by any central government' would attract to all the struggling or embargoed countries.There is good potential either way, though I'd personally prefer bitcoins to stay in the "shadow" for a bit longer. Well, this could be a real downturn for the open exchanges, but could just as well come to assert one of bitcoin's advertised strength, the non centralized, pseudo-anonymous nature of it. So exchanges could no longer easily exist, it would be much more expensive and complicated, but actual person to person transactions could still exist as they do now, and things like #bitcoin-otc could very well become the central point for unofficial exchanging the btc.It would certainly put a (temporary?) brake on the bot driven speculation. I go through pretty much the same thought process recurrently, but I don't think that's the itch we are trying to scratch here. You mention buying bitcoins with cash, whereas in this system proposal bitcoins are an inner and undisclosed part of the system, at least to the client / user. This is a means of using bitcoins as a transport, not as a product.Though a well trusted network would go a long way if also accepting to sell coins for cash... just sayin  Maybe S3052 could help manage the initial deposit fund and even guide the agents on to the most profitable route to handle the coins received... I'm sure we could get to some kind of arrangement. Well, I could do the VAT exempt thing too, but unfortunately you can't run a company without a real accounting expert around here, and that costs money  Still, I'm sure there are many options, you are right.No reason for it to only work with well balanced nodes, as you can always buy through the existing methods (transfer, WU, PP, etc) if you need to move cash into coins. There would be very little risk, assuming the nodes trust each other.Speculating with the coins used on the transfer is a great recipe for disaster imho. Not all of us are good traders, most of us are simple emotional persons which, without proper training and a definitive plan will only feed the sharks, as I'm sure many noticed recently :pAnyway, how would you and I go about starting this? We'd just agree to buy and sell coins from each other with the promise to delivering the the proceeds of the selling to some person, physically? I'm game for a little experiment, but I'd like to have the actual network shielded from the forum. Basically a network of peers is needed, and we should keep these only known amongst themselves, then when someone needs to send cash they'd post/email/pm one of us (and I mean you  ) who'd forward to the closest person geographically?I would love to see the old and trusted members of this forum to step forward to build the agent network! Again, I'm game. Will you send to Europe? I'm travelling to the US soon and could use a local phone to prevent roaming charges. I could just buy a prepaid SIM while there, I'm sure, but this could work too  If you think about it from a business standpoint, at least based on how it goes around my geographic area, you'll have to charge VAT to your clients because you are selling them "goods" (code in piece of paper). And you pay taxes over the profit you make, so in order to "keep it real" you have to get invoices from those that sell you the codes, and these will be in whatever currency the deal is completed in (BTC isn't officially exchanged, so are we talking barter?). It's easy to see how this can become over-complicated if your business is not to be known as transferring the value, be it in fiat or codes. If you are reselling you have to buy them, and all needs to have proper paperwork.But forgetting about the legalities of this, and believe me that while I'm playing devil's advocate I am *really* interested in this, here's something that could help in balancing the books across agents; future options. I have a client that wants to send 100 to the US, I ask you how many coins that'll be and  you say 100.0. While this price may or may not be realistic, I send you the coins knowing that:1) you will send the 100 to the recipient2) you agree to buy me the same amount at the same rate, so I can ask someone on your physical surroundings to just send the 100 back to me if all you do is get bitcoins at very low prices from me  Ok, you really think that sending money from the US to Iran is the same as mcd selling burgers in both US and Iran? Well, I wish you the best of luck with that Seriously, though, you can operate legally on *each* country, I'm sure. If all you do are internal transfers you are home free, bar whatever prohibitive taxes and regulations your country might have, but sending money abroad is not the same thing at all, I'm sure you'll agree. So I'd be an agent, someone would give me 100 to transfer to the US. I would log into the 'exchange network' where every peer is known and trusted and would find an agent that was close to the transfer destination. I would already have both bitcoins and cash balance on that exchange somehow (like a closed mtgox) and would ask to sell 100 worth of bitcoins to that agent.The other agent would receive 100 worth of bitcoins and would then proceed to deliver the 100 he already has to the recipient.Each agent would have to have some cash and some bitcoins to start with, register in the 'exchange network' and agree to buy and sell coins at whatever exchange rate is set there. This exchange rate could very well be 0.0001 or 1000.0, so as long as everyone agrees to use it, but obviously to prevent greed taking over people it should closely follow the external exchange rates.Now, what's in for the client? No nonsense transfers, very low fees, quick as can be.And for the agent, there should be a simple fee structure, this is not something I can just make up without giving a little thought, and might be a deal breaker if a structure that is both cheap for the client and interesting for the agent can't be found.The exchange is the "central" point of this whole endeavor, and we might actually be better off with something more distributed, but I can't see how, bar trusting everyone, we can do without some central handling of the fiat part.And keeping it legal or not is, at best, a matter of opinion. If you mean 'US' legal or 'EUR' legal, that might be possible. Both legal at the same time, slightly more complicated. Worldwide legal? No way that is even remotely possible!  I was trying to find an excuse to give the glbse a try. Thank you for coming up with a completely "out of the box" way!I'm holding a handful of those 'stocks' now, so I'll just wait until my conscience kick in, I've always thought of horse racing as animal brutality. But anything to make the bitcoin ecosystem thrive  The device interests me, the price does not. If buying in the US I can get a new one with an invoice I can write off on my business accounting and 1 year warranty for ~100btc (refurbished by apple, new elsewhere). But I'm in Europe so this isn't all that interesting to me. I am on the market for one such thing but the price has to make it worth my while.I understand yours is pristine and has extras, I'm not saying it is not worth what you ask, but in the case where you don't find interested parties and are in a hurry to sell, I'll bid 80btc, shipped to Europe (that's roughly $400 atm). Yeah, I'll gladly sell you both (2x2GB), shipped to US for 5 coins (less than $25), to make it a round number  You can probably buy memory not certified for Mac for much cheaper though. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=42330.msg515448#msg515448 I'm not paying for link displays, but I'm willing to pay for someone to buy one of these for me and ship it to Europe  Any takers? Will pay in bitcoins. Maybe... I'm not bidding any more until I know what the end time is  Wait, what time is it there? I assume you got no bids on your chosen timespan...
1.1 btc Haven't sold a single item from this thread. Next step is list it in local auctions and buy btc with the proceeds Just thought I'm bump the thread up first, asserting any new interest. Scary, really scary... What was the name of that  religion you are preaching again? How much power would the 6 boards + backplane take? Expecting 900MHs out of it, and if you sell these plug & mine, I'll almost certainly be in for on full backplane for testing! Yes, the bare boards would be fine. If you want to throw in the AC coolers at little or no extra cost, sure, otherwise I'll save myself a few dead DVIs by not using those  I would gladly buy just the 5970's without WC blocks (or stock coolers for that matter, to keep weight/shipping price low). Sorry for the English posting, but although I can read French just fine I'm not really comfortable writing How much for the 2,3,5 and 8, all shipped to 'elsewhere in Europe'?Thanks! Hmm, that's a bit steep, tbh. Thanks anyway. How many coins for both card, shipped to Europe, no need for the stock coolers at all? How old are these cards, what kind of usage have they had (overclocking/volting, etc), and what about some pretty pictures?Thanks! That's perfectly acceptable. I thought the rpc server was being removed for whatever reason, but if it's just the cli client for the GUI then it makes perfect sense.That's more than fair  I am not a die hard wxwidgets coder, nor a GUI coder tbh. I actually have "I suck at designing user interfaces" in my CV, though not in those exact words! I was just curious about some shortcoming of wx that I was unaware of. All good  Is there a reason for this or is it just "the way it got coded"? It helps me somewhat to be able to have rpc to the running GUI bitcoin client. Either that or the priv key import/export *hint* Also, this may not be the right place to ask, but why the move from wx to qt? I know a better GUI was long due, but I happen to know and like wx (have no quarrel with qt, mind you) and I don't think there's much if anything that you can do with one and not with the other... Sounds good to me :p It was turned off. Lack of time to fix some bugs, lack of time to secure it properly so I would sleep easy if someone would transfer serious bitcoins into the system and general lack of user interest.It had its prime, was a lot of fun, I have plans to bring it back... My pleasure. You are somewhat new around here, and this place is very crowded now, but rest assured there are plenty of members concerned with the community, and a LOT of honest and friendly peers just around the corner, but as with most things we only feel the urge to come out and tell others when things go bad, thus it may look a lot worst than it actually is.If people are careful and stop sending coins first to sellers who don't pass the "open to negotiate" test about, these scammers will eventually loose interest as income dries up, and hopefully leave altogether  Just leaving this here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37805.0PS: unknown seller (post count means very little by itself) that "has been scammed by escrow" or "is in a hurry so no escrow" is, invariably, a scammer tell sign. Not saying escrow is always needed, but anyone not willing to negotiate terms or insisting in getting some sent first that doesn't have a perfect track record (or one at all) is a no go for me. Quantas bitcoins pretendes comprar? E já agora, onde estás a ir buscar o preço base? I can't really write Italian (but I can more or less read it) so here goes in english: I'm interested in all 5970+5870, but I can't understand if you are taking BTC for them. Will you ship abroad (but still in Europe?). How much are you looking to get for these?I assume these have been used for mining and as such have gotten a fair amount of their lifespan sucked out of them, but feel free to tell me otherwise  Hey. I might be interested on the DELL but you failed to specify where you are shipping from so I can have an idea of what the retail price is. Will you ship it to Europe (assuming you are in the US)? Yep, that's my suspicion too. Easy to cry wolf these days, everyone is already biased one way or another...Anyone got a confirmation from DiabloD3 that he was indeed the one to post this? Who are you to tell me how I will feel!!!!OOOPS....*runs to safe, dark corner*
It is official, then. I am a troll.As an attempt at getting cured I will now step away from my keyboard and not touch any of the keys for a couple of hours. I'll come back to some random thread and tell everyone how that felt  No harm done, and I guess the fact I just took this thread and steered it into something completely unrelated might actually prove you right. You certainly deserved the cookie! Heh, yeah, right. Forgot the context:This was your reply to my question on why do the panic sale threads always ignore that these high volume sales have to have a high volume buy counterpart. I assumed from the reply that you were being ironic, sarcastic or simply an ass. If none of these options is correct and you were really thanking me for the crash course then, hmmm, you have bigger issues than I do.On the other hand if it was actually any of the 3 options described, then I can safely say that your quoted reply can be read asCode:you are a stupid moronic knowitallWouldn't you agree? On second thought you probably won't, because that's your thing... I respect that, we have to be consistent with our internet selfs. As an example, if you follow my post history you'll find that some 50% of my post are attempts at comic irony, all ending in disastrous misunderstandings. People here take other people too seriously but again as long as we keep it consistent... Ooohhh, dramatic are we? I said no such thing, not to myself nor to you. What I said is: I asked a question, you answered "you are a stupid moronic knowitall" which is a valid point, but makes no attempt to answer the question asked in the first place.And how do you know I talk to myself? *looks around for the hidden cams* I am not all that sure why you are calling me a troll, but I hope the cookie was good  Ahm, I was role playing there, just making my point  But thanks for the concern, though, glad to see a positive advice coming from that instead of the more usual immediate bashing and public humiliation approach we see on the forum these days. Cookie points to you  I agree with molecular, but that's not the whole picture; I have a two month billing cycle, so I mine now and pay up to 60 days from now. Lots of time to convert to cash at the best rates (when the market isn't plummeting) and even do a little speculation of my own. No new 'out of pocket' money unless I'm mining at really large loss, bitcoins pay for it all, all the time.Of course if I'm mining at a loss then the 60 day buffer with get me and I'll end up with 60 days of used electricity I don't have the bitcoins to pay, because I used the ones produced in the last cycle to pay the previous one...  Do I sense a little irony there? I didn't mean to give you an 101 introduction to anything, I'm a coder not a trader and I just don't understand why the buying side of the trades keep getting ignored on these panic stricken posts all over the place. I HONESTLY need someone to explain that to me, and you're not the one with your reply, I'm afraid.Keep sending postcards, though, you may win someday! I do want them, but only if they are double ribbon and you are willing to send first or we use an escrow. When can you check the double ribbon thing and do you have any objection to these terms?Thanks! I keep repeating myself, I know, but I still didn't get an answer that "computes"...People sell, panic abounds, prices are going down, people sell even more, price goes even further down, all of that is fine but... who is buying? Are we really that convinced that hitting almost 1M$ in volume on mtgox alone, it's just people SELLING? c'mon, if it was a panic driven bank run, all the buyers of have removed their bids, and that is far far away from the truth.Bid walls go back, but that sounds more like "I can use the panic sales momentum and increase my profit" than "bitcoins are worthless! let me do the intelligent thing and, huh, buy 10k$ of them at $4 instead of $5"I mean, c'mon, for every bitcoin sold there's a bitcoin bought, and I'm sure a bunch of them are from speculators that do swing trading, but again, to do swing trading you don't just buy bitcoins, you need to sell them, someone else has to buy them  Those are 3 PCIE extenders, right? And I assume they have double ribbon cables too? Can't really tell from the picture.If the 'shipping included' gets them to Europe, I'm interested. I assume your price per is including shipping to continental US only, but all 3 should only need one shipping charge to you, so that might offset it... So you decided to hop into the old thread to pressure me into taking the first step? Real mature... Just kidding, can you tell me which  continent you are in and I'll make you an offer, all inclusive? Added some laptop memory to the original post... Hmmm, 50000 btc?Seriously, though, I don't have a set price as I mention in the original post. Make me an offer that does more than cover shipping and I'll most certainly consider it. Indeed. Most of these things I've had for sale here in the forum before, but here they are again, neatly stashed in a single thread XO Laptops ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3020.0 ):I still have one C1 and one B2 iRiver H340 ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3036.0 ):  HTC Touch Pro ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3969.0 ):  HTC BH S100 Stereo Bluetooth Headset:http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/headset/htc-bh-s100/It's a cool device, I used it to beam music from my cell to the car stereo (thus connected to the car stereo) and also computer to living room stereo. You can use it as either a stereo headphone device, with good sound quality or a mono headset, making it a hands free cellphone thingy.No real target price expected, make me an offer. I'm in Europe and so offers will be compared with shipping to your country in mind. Don't forget to at least state the continent Also, only bitcoins!EDIT: Also have 2x2GB PC3-8500 SO-DIMM memory modules originally from a macbook pro They just used a hack to get more money one too many times... the disasters always follow that!(how many of you played the original simcity?  ) With how thin the market is right now, I could bet on the same side as you, sell the coins, collect the bet and buy back on the panic that follows... double gain! So you are selling all your coins but want to make sure the price doesn't drop too fast?...Heh, just trolling  It's fun to see the panic movements, though I must say it has been worst in the past, people seem to be a bit less edgy now. It always puzzled me that when the price goes down and people dump their coins for whatever they can get for them the other side, the ones buying the coins, seems to go unnoticed.I mean, for every coin you sell someone needs to buy it... And while selling coins can be done in a whim, buying them is probably a bit more of a psychological bend, as you are spending *money*, not bitcoins for which you don't yet have a multi generation inner bond with. Someone is in for big profit, I'd say. +1 back to DeepImpact, he sent first.
Anyone that has read the forum in the past few months? I mean, I remember a year ago, this was a peaceful and trusted land. We didn't need cops or guidelines, we were a small and happy community...Then bitcoins got valued, attracting interest from every kind of person... EVERY kind of person  Exacto, quando eu disse que não vendo por esse preço era só isso. Descrevi o porquê, mas não era com segundas intenções, se o Fabio conseguir comprar por esse preço, maravilha!O que eu propus tambem é apenas o que mencionei; compro a bom preço, dinheiro na mão. Pensei para mim que se ele está realmente a comprar a esse preço talvez queira vender por + 25% Enfim... Portal 2? Understood, but not fair. You could have at least given me a heads up.But whatever, it's your stuff, you are free to sell it to whomever you choose. I'll still take the other 3, but only if you are actually intending to sell them to me.Full disclosure to everyone on the thread: I offered to buy and accepted the ask price, requested escrow. Got back some issues with international shipping (perfectly understandable) and request for potential escrows. Sent pointer to potential escrows and was waiting on a response when this post was made. My scam prevention scheme:me - "I will not send first!"seller - "ok, how about half on sending the package?"me -"I will not send a single bitcoin first, but I will accept sending to trusted escrow"seller - "great, I trust (insert seller alter-ego here)!"me - "How about (insert list of people with more than a year on the forum, and still active)"Three things may happen here, in order of probability, top is higher:- Silence... soon after I see people crying scam on this seller's threads- "I know none of those people!", followed by what's described above- "Ok, I'll just send first, I guess I can trust you, please don't scam me"I have this down to a science  A pergunta não era académica. Quantas tens para vender, por quanto vendes? Se estás a comprar a 3 (abaixo do mínimo dos ultimos meses, metade do valôr presente de mercado) eu assumo que tenhas uma boa oferta para venda.Eu compro e vendo com regularidade, obviamente que não me interessa a esse preço, mas talvez queira comprar... E vendes por quanto? sunny day and I have an agreement for the sale of the 4 HDDs, but we haven't yet agreed on the terms of the payment. That is actually a fair bid. I have someone locally wanting to buy it from me for a bit more (in cash). I prefer selling for bitcoins, but will take the best bid still.Remember that I'm shipping from Europe. Sure The fact I say  and the fact the previous post is dated March 4 can be completely ignored... I know you are busy and can't be bored with context  While the price has changed significantly (the price of bitcoins, that is), I still have this up for sale.Any interest?  Right, I really don't need the motherboard, so let me know if decide to sell just the GPU.Thanks! I wish. But a big part of this economy is not mining. In fact the mining has no value in and on itself, the bitcoins must have purpose.I have bought many, many things with bitcoins, both paying for used stuff bought here or by converting to cash and buying directly. I would feel really depressed if I was to look back at what I sold for, and how many I sold. I could be rich!But, on the other hand, if I didn't, along with others, spend bitcoins like there was no tomorrow the economy wouldn't have reached the critical mass needed to become valued by others, so I see it as an investment, not as a stupid expense. So no, I'm not swimming in a pool of bitcoins, though I connect to them. And no, I don't have a huge mining farm... I could, with all the GPUs I bought to date, but you know what happened to some  Education, fun, new topics for elevator chat, cookie points ?I didn't try to get an extra 20-50mhs, mind you, I got a whole lot more out of these babies, but the end result is in sight. Also remember I didn't start this month, or this year to be honest. Back then not much was known and it was these sacrifices that allowed everyone to run safe now at peak speeds  I've received a couple of PMs from the American side of the pond asking about how much shipping would be, so here it is for everyone:Each card is ~1.3 kg bare, so even with boxes and such we're in the 1~2 Kg price range. Unfortunately to the US that's 40 ($57) for each or 60 ($86) for both, I really don't think this pays off to anyone on that side of the pond.Shipping inside Europe should be about half as much, btw.Also, although prices are pegged to  or $, I will only accept bitcoins  Putting a price in BTC for the shipping is a bit on the brave side right now given the exchange rate volatility, and I'm not that brave. 6.5 for shipping, plus 54.31 for tablet == 60.81 ~= $526 (@8.665 24 avg) ~= £322.amazon (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Asus-EeePad-Transformer-Tablet-Android/dp/B004TB0EMK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1314401287&sr=8-2) is £343 - 20% VAT ~= £286 ~= $468And of course I have it here in 3 days and they pay for returns if needed.This is obviously not just for you but for anyone who might be interested in selling me on to have a base line I might just use spendbitcoins and get it there is a better option doesn't come up in a few days. Thanks for that. I had already seen your site, and there are three issues I have:- Price - I can buy cheaper on amazon.co.uk (because I can get VAT refund) and that's including shipping- Warranty - If I'm buying new, I expect to be able to easily exercise it if there is an issue. Shipping to the US, both in time and cost, is kind of a bummer.- Origin - I really don't want to have this stopped at customs and pay VAT over it.But I have seriously considered buying there, if only to help the bitcoin economy dynamics. In the end price won  I know the HP Touchpad is all the rage now on the forum, but what I really want to get is an eee pad transformer. 16GB or 32GB, doesn't matter, with or without the keyboard, new or used in good shape, I'm not picky Good price is what I'm looking for, shipped to Europe. Any takers? I can read some Italian but I wouldn't even try to write it, so assuming you didn't sell it yet I'd be interested in the 5970, shipped abroad (inside EU).  Ok, so being keen on experimenting I was able to kill a bunch of hardware, including these two 5970s. By kill I don't mean they are totally useless or not fixable, so read on.On the pictures below there's an A and a B card. Don't assume the brand will match that of the cooler, as I often mixed and matched these (same goes for backplates). But all my 5970s are reference so that is not really a problem (and honestly the cooler/backplate should be correct, but I didn't do much effort to make sure of that).Also all the BIOS are stock voltage (that doesn't mean they were never over volted, I did that back in the days to try out but decided against it) and ram is low bound to 300Mhz. All BIOS have been downloaded tweaked and flashed for each card, no reusing BIOS files across cards.The A card is the deadest amongst the dead; it passes POST, the fans spin 100% and then down as they should and the OS (only use linux here) actually boots and sees the card BUT:- There is no image anywhere, none of the ports work- The card gets very, very hot, even just standing there idle- Can't mine on it, the driver crashes immediately- I have removed the cooler, verified everything, new paste, some pads changed, no good.- EDIT: actually linux doesn't boot with this card anymore... assume dead: fan up and down, no beeps, no red lights and overheats immediately.The B card is actually working, sort of; it boots and has image, and I can even mine on it:- GPU0, if used to mine, locks computer (same for any 3D accelerated rendering, but I use it for ubuntu's desktop just fine)- GPU1 I can mine with, but it gives hardware errors interleaved with actual hashes. It mines at ~360Mhs at 820Mhz according to cgminerI've since replaced these cards and don't have a place for them ATM and, being crippled or dead, it really doesn't pay off to buy all the other hardware needed for a new computer. I'm selling these as broken, the Saphire cooler is almost new (used only for a week or two, card was WC'd), the ASUS cooler I bought used (well, the whole card, not just the cooler  ) so I can't speak about it's health other than it works perfect.These are being shipped from Europe and I'll entertain any bid that covers shipping in full. Of course I may choose not to sell if the bids are not worth my time to package and ship Mandatory pictures:
Heh, I had forgotten about this... I remember when I got on of these AC things, and THEN read on the foruns about all the dead DVIs. Boy was I careful installing the thing!Oh, and btw, the little VRM cooler isn't just held by thermal paste, it gets 2 screws from the back plate if memory serves me well. He didn't almost certainly. And yes, the pads seem more of a protection than anything else, the backplate is securely screwed on to the heatsink and a little bending could do much damage without the pads.Also, for mining it's kinda moot, you'll probably do just fine with no memory thermal padding on either side. It really barely touches the ram.And at least some 5870 have it too, though I'm almost sure it's mostly protection agains bending the PCB with with increasingly heavy heatsinks screwed on the other side. I've had (and some killed) Saphire, ATI, XFX and PowerColor 5970s, all reference, all with backplate. Also, the AC depends on the stock backplate to be properly installed. I have received the cards, brand new as advertised, seller sent first. 5 stars communication, great seller.Payment sent. If the fan goes 100% and down down (but not stopped) the GPU if passing POST, so not completely dead. Are there any red lights on top? Is that including shipping? Europe, btw. disclaimer: it's quite late here and I'm almost at the end of a 2 week intense deadline, so take my words with the appropriate amount of salt I beg to differ regarding your statement that you will not eat all of the costs. In hindsight it makes a lot less sense than I though it did when I wrote it.The one extra coin you are asking is fair, I didn't say it isn't. What I said was that I was already over my budget, yours would be the most expensive 5870 I'd buy, a good part of the total cost would be just for shipping and as such I was in one of those situations where after I made my proposal I would stick by it, but regretted the commitment the moment after I clicked 'post'.You made it easy for me, asking for that extra coin. It's just one coin, it's fair, but it is nonetheless one more coin on a price I already think is too steep, so thanks, but no thanks.PS: there was a time when marking as 'gift' would work, nowadays all 'gift' marked items get verified and if they think the item has any value I either have a receipt for it (which is stupid, if it's a gift, but hey) or they charge for whatever they decide the 'fair market price' is. Complete morons!  I beg to differ  Nevermind then, I was already pushing my well defined price limits on this one. You are correct, the int'l shipping makes it too expensive and on top of that coming from outside Europe I may end up paying taxes when going through customs, not worth the trouble at that price.Good luck, though, it's a very nice mining card, already have one of those! 22 btc, you cover shipping to Europe? PM me if you want to know exactly where. I apologize if this has been answered before, I can only read back so much What is the expected final price for the 1 and 2 fpga boards when they hit the market? (I assume this will be a max price and the price will be based in $ not BTC).Also, paying the pre-order in BTC today, will that count as BTC when the final payment is due or as $50?  Unless you factor in the electricity and heat dissipation as part of the whole equation. I know both are a real burden for me as I'm at the limit of what I can use and still keep the family happy (like, they can still use the microwave oven  ), and I live in a warm climate which already killed a few cards for me.But winter will come and heat is needed and appreciated, electricity cost is offset by that...Of course, a great point to GPUs is that they have a used market value regardless of bitcoins. I don't foresee or prepare for a major bitcoin crash, but what would I do with a bunch of very expensive custom built asics? Even half broken GPUs have a market value. Sent you a PM a few days ago... So the exchange is based in Slovenia, wire transfer in SEPA zone are possible and yet it uses USD as BTC counterpart? This is a bit awkward.What are you going to use for exchange rates in EUR vs USD? I'm still in the market for itunes US gift cards. Quote me on a $20? I think that a quick glimpse at the forum threads shows how much this can never be true in this particular community If I didn't know most of us are either geek zealots or teenager skr1pt k33dz, I would almost bet we were all pregnant women on some hormonal rush! Would it still be a good deal, though? Say, for a (realistic) example, I need 120 on amazon.de, how many btc would you be charging? Will you ship to Europe? How about non US amazon sites? I'm interested in both co.uk and de  $15 or $10000, it's all the same.Then along comes joeminer who has bills to pay, and needs cash quick, so a new sell order of $14.99 goes in. But maryspeculator fears that a bank run is imminent so she puts an order of $14.95. Of course there's always johndoe who has grown tired of waiting to get rich quick out of bitcoins and decides to sell all for $14.00 and just invest in hairspray instead...You see where I'm going  The market sets the price, not the sellers. Of course speculators with funds can work both sides and effectively steer the market one way or another, but just saying "lets all not sell for less than X" is actually dangerous, what if no one is interested in buying at X? How long will everyone wait until the market slows to a halt? Or everyone panics and the joeminer story starts again?Oh, and I added maryspeculator to add some spice to the story, I have no reason to believe a single human being of the feminine gender is trading bitcoins  But, but, but...They have a flashy video, and webinars and even web 2.0! They HAVE to be legit!
Well, you stopped replying to my PMs, so I assume you are no longer interested? I have sent two messages using your contact form, did you get them at all? I understand what you are getting at, and I would gladly escrow for 0% too if a know member asked me to, but as a service you should always get something for your trouble, or else why would you sustain such service?I know, volunteer work, for the good of the community  I guess that the message to BTCrow applies to Eptiv too. Can you think of a way to run the service but have the coins transfered to one of the League members, give him some admin interface for the transaction so he could say "coins received" (although knowing the address you could sniff the blockchain too) and then when the buyer receives the goods an email gets sent to the coin holder to release the funds (stating the address to do so clearly on a page where both buyer and escrow can see it?).You could potentially have this as an optional thing when someone uses the escrow service:- use our escrow service (1% fee)- use our service with coins held by davout (1.25% fee)etc It wasn't the VisionTek, it was the Saphire (I did clearly state that, I believe), but it certainly was the 2GB version. Is there a 1GB with 6 screen support? I didn't know that.Still, my offer has been beaten and I will not go any higher, for the reasons mike678 so eloquently stated. There is one way you can ease yourself into getting paranoid people (like myself) to test your services and leverage the trust already won by members of this forum, and that is to allow people to use btcrow but have people from the list of potential league members hold the coins (for a fee, of course). I didn't think this through, it's just something that popped into my mind right now.The other thing is I need to know you are making enough profit to actually be best for you to keep the business running. That's partly why I trust mtgox, the other part is the people behind it being themselves high in my trust balance to start with. But I know it would be stupid for them to make a run for it with a lot of cash/btc, as they are not anonymous, so tracking is possible and, more importantly, they are making a lot of profit thus they have an interest in keeping the service running. Because not everyone will trust the existing services, and I don't know of one I'll trust with anything more that pocket money right now.I thought that was clear? Maybe I worded things incorrectly... Is it the digitizer or the actual LCD screen that broke? Can you share some pictures? @BTCrow: your service is exactly what I would like to have, only done by someone I already trust (*wink* davout). This does not mean I distrust you or your service in any way, and with time I'll probably use it consistently, but right now, with all the scandals and people running away with fat wallet.dat's full of other people's coins, I tend to trust only the "family".So, I'm not trying to get a justice league going, or an exclusive gentleman's club or anything. I just want a few of the older and trusted forum members to accept the escrow job temporarily, and I want everyone to know about that and who they are, so I don't get fooled by incomplete information (like regarding madhatter, I would trust him with no reserves).This *is* redundant, and will become unneeded with time. This is not a business model, rather a volunteer escrow service to fill in a need I, selfishly, need.As such, and while I understand there are many faults and potential pitfalls to this plan, I still think it is quite useful at least for now. I can hardly wait for that! That would kill "The League" for sure And thanks for stepping forward. Vou reiterar a minha proposta, válida até ao fim do dia de hoje, $200 (equivalente em BTC) enviada para a Europa  Well, all the times I interacted with him he felt very trustworthy, though truth be told it was a long time ago.Your name will be added to the list, thank you! Just a note that all is open to discussion and I'm not taking the lead on anything (I only leaded this thread because I *need* such a service myself) but my idea is to have a known fee structure and everyone just doing that. Would you be ok with the min and max fees or 0.1 and 1.0?Also, I believe we each see risk in different ways, so maybe each member of "The League" puts forward a maximum amount they are comfortable processing? I was hoping for a little more detail regarding the removals, but given your sig and the fact you are a moderator here, I'll assume it isn't just a personal thing  Thanks! I get that people want automated escrows, but those exist already. Again, either I trust the one doing it or I'll have to review the code. Even then I need to trust the ISP, server admin, etc.What I'm proposing here isn't trying to mitigate the need for a full blown, trusted, secure escrow service, but rather allow for an alternate solution while such a service gets established. And frankly, I like the idea of a community operated / scrutinized escrow, but the software layer just gets in the way right now.Of course if you do implement the service and open the code then "The League" can find among its ranks a sysadmin, grab a server and run that code  It is no longer available, but I can assure you that you wouldn't want to beat their last price, not even by a small bit  I'm totally with you, that's also what I'd like to see. But the simple truth is I don't have the time or the energy to code that, particularly not in these hacker infested days.If ClearCoin was still around I wouldn't even consider this. Oh, and thanks! what we need is nibblecoin. Four time the value of those bitcoins we all love  Potential members of the league:davoutGarrett BurgwardtbencoderdavidonpdaFreeMoneyGavin AndresenjgarzikmndrixnanotubenoagendamarketJust to name a few.

Many are still around, so here's my idea... Lets use a thread (this thread?) to state who we trust, and those that get appointed can say if they would be willing to serve as middleman in these potentially shady deals.There is nothing wrong with the existing escrow services, except I don't know/trust those behind them, so it's square one all over again.Those that would accept to act as escrow would get a fee, say 0.1%, min 0.1 max 1.0, or something of the kind.Finally a simple set of conflict resolution rules need to be set... btcs are sent to escrow, and if either seller fails to deliver or buyer says they did, a new thread is opened for proof gathering, so sellers show the proof of having shipped stuff, sellers show proof that what they got isn't what they requested. All members of this 'league' vote and majority wins, either buyer or seller take the coins, no discussions or appeals. If resolution is needed then maybe an extra fee is in order?Ok, next post I'll put forward some names of those I'd like to see in this league. If your name appears and you don't want it there, or if someone I put there has done you wrong, speak up and it goes away.Or if you think I'm full of it, I can be convinced to shut up, but this community has done some great things, and scammers are having way too much bandwidth on this forum. You are probably right, he may very well get $300 for it. Still my $200 offer stands, and I'll keep it for 24hr.
So you paid $600 and forgot about it? wow, dude, you must have amazing hobbies Anyway, last I saw that card, newegg brand new (ok, it was saphire not visiontek) it was listed at a much lower price (not putting it here so as to not bias potential buyers).I'll put an offer for $200 shipped to Europe (oh, that's $200 in BTC) just in case you decide to lower  the price in the next couple of days  Heh, I'm not sure I serve as example to anyone, but I live in GMT and I work on Pacific time... just saying. So instead of pushing to git we get binary clients? lol! Broken as in it introduces a new genesis block assertion which is needed to start a new blockchain?  That is freakish and stupid... So we need a blockchain bootstrapped to start mining on a brand new blockchain? Well, I can't start the client:Code:i0coind: main.cpp:1566: bool LoadBlockIndex(bool): Assertion `block.hashMerkleRoot == uint256("0x01f79e95511e638325c288818ed10d95cdfb30bb775c8f024f380a4c9bcd8d4e")' failed.This was from git. I want it. Just need to get some things cleared first: is it unlocked to all networks, not jailbroken, no screen scratches and comes with charger and headset? You wouldn't have any used iphone4 for a good price? Need one for facetime, basically. Seeing as people are already mining and running clients for i0coin I assume you'll change the genesis block and redistribute the client. But what about all those that *don't* update the client because they mined a huge fuckload of i0coins_v0 already? Did you manage to create 2 forks in a single throw?  Just a little nitpicking... Lisbon is not actually a country  Silk Road Productions proudly presents:"Dude, where's my bitcoin?" and the amazing sequel "Dude, where's my block chain?" Now you guys make me feel like I should get out of the basement a little more...Total time logged in: 47 days, 15 hours and 25 minutes. Last day today, if you haven't done so already go to taabl.datlatec.com and withdraw any coins you might still have there. The server is going offline first thing tomorrow. Is this current or historical (adjusted to exchange rate, I guess)?I was selling a house for bitcoins for a while, though it was sold already and unfortunately not for btc. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1617.0 Do we also get one of those in the picture to practice with? Guess that'll be extra? mtgox$300 ? Tomorrow's your last chance... Keeping to the bitcoin theme, I'll also pay mtgox$500 for the both shipped. You'll have to work out getting the money from mtgox, but there are several options, the best of them imho is selling on #bitcoin-otc. Don't be jealous just because I beat you to it Seriously, though, it is a rip off, a steal if you will, but since I'm killing my cards in the mining process (or at the very least seriously reducing their life span) I don't care for paying the same I'd pay on retail, so my base price is what I get on ebay for used cards. It is what it is, I'd be a fool not to propose this, you are more than welcome to outbid me, it is his prerogative to accept or not, just don't start calling me names   That kind of lowers my perceived value of the cards. Sure, they are brand new, but for the beating they'll be taking I can get used ones on a budget (if not in a hurry, which I'm not).Still, I'll be interested in them if the price is right, and I can do cash (maybe, I'm not in the UK but I do go there often) or bank transfer if you send first (assuming you trust me).
40 BTC for both, plus shipping. I might be able to collect them locally hence the shipping on the side. *bump* two days to go heh, two things:You are trading with actual people on bitmarket, so you don't get a "trade" event such as on mtgox, but rather an email with the buyer's email address and a note "work it out between the two of you".This is fine, I've done plenty of deals there, but your times are not going to be that consistent.The other thing is... PayPal? Really? You are dealing with random joes here (that were verified by bitmarket for whatever that's worth), it is NOT bitmarket sending you money like mtgox does.disclaimer: bitmarket is one of my favorite places to trade, and looses to all others only because they are not an exchange, they're a bulletin board and an escrow. Take this with a grain of salt, but there is one use case where ixcoins/namecoins/forkcoins or any other spin off that has an automated exchange with enough volume can fit, and that's laundering... wait, did I say laundering? I meant anonymizing But we already have that for btc, right? What was it called again? MtGox? Beware all of you trying for arbitrage opportunities that bitmarket.eu doesn't work like mtgox or tradehill, and thus the ticket data you get on bitcoincharts and the like is not readily comparable.The reason is that other exchanges hold both the fiat and the btc, you place bids and asks and those get served on the spot. For bitmarket, though, they only hold the btc as escrow, and the fiat never goes through them, meaning that bids and asks are heavily skewed in time with the actual trades, making the 'last value' that of 3~4 days before, as it gets there only when the trade is confirmed by the seller and the buyer gets the coins.On top of that bids and asks have an extra field to them, the accepted payment methods, and you will find that many times the bid is higher than the ask but that trade isn't triggered. This happens for this same reason, bidding high values with, say PayPal but lower asks only accepting SEPA transfers.I don't think you have lost much, opportunity cost wise. Sure; mine a lot, but be a real IT guy that doesn't need to babysit the machines (or be a real businessman that gets others to do that for you). With the profit, buy gold, women and puppies!I mine, and I must say I get more sunlight now than before, as I feel an urge to run out of the house every time someone passes my front door, you know, to brag tell them about bitcoins  Yeah, right. Then YOU get to mine all by yourself You know where you can stick the GreenGold, don't you? hehe So Monday is the day I advertised the lottery site is going offline. I'll probably do it on Tuesday to avoid any timezone issues. After that happens I will still be able to refund any coins there, but it will be much harder to verify user identities, so if you haven't done so already, please collect what's yours asap. Or he simply tweaked the timestamps on the miner (he was mining alone!) and made time fold back on itself, managing to generate 6k blocks spanning 3.5 months in an afternoon of watching supernanny. Maybe... but you have a tendency to become unresponsive and then say "oops, sold already". If you want to try and work out a deal (you know the conditions by now) name your price. and four days left... I'm lost and puzzled... how many ixc approx would you sell for 1 btc? 1? 10? 100? 100000000000? Yep, I managed to make an even bigger ass of myself  It was really late, in my defense...Sorry about that. Well, no, sorry. You can still get the BTC from me in time, though. Buy $110 worth of amazon UK gift code (around £66), email the code to me along with your btc address, I'll redeem and immediately send you 9.6 coins. 5... As I said I must be asleep already... what you said makes no sense to me whatsoever.Sure you can scam me if I go first... that's why I said you go first!What are you talking about? I don't mean you giving me package tracking, I'm talking about me having the actual card in my hands or having registered my name with AMEX. Also, I'd redeem the gift code before sending you coins.Your PGP means nothing, as I'm sure you know, unless I already know and trust your pub key. But let me stress this point one last time:- If you do decide to sell to me you will have to provide the goods before receiving the btc. Sorry, that's just the way it is, I'm known and trusted, you are not, scammers are always on the lookout for fools. I'm not saying you are a scammer, I'm saying I try not to be a fool.- If you don't trust me that is fine too, lets find someone we both trust and try to talk that person into holding my btc while you sell me the card / gift code.Please don't. I don't trust paypal and want nothing to do with them. If you want to give me $20 that's great, discount that from the sale price and we have a deal.But I'll reread this tomorrow, maybe I'm just being a prick. I am interested, but the price you ask is very close to the market price which has done some serious swings today, on top of which I'll certainly pay international fees for all transactions done with stores outside of the US, so I'm not sure it is a good deal for me.Also it is very, very late here and I can't really think straight so I check this thread when I get up and if you haven't sold the card yet I'll make a decision re: rate, either buy it or make you an offer at the very least.Alternatively I might ask you to buy something for me using that card, specifically an amazon uk gift card, instead of you sending the card to me. Would be be available to do that? You would most certainly have to pay first (be it send the card details or buy the gift) or we'd have to arrange for someone we both trust to serve as escrow for the btc. I will not send first under any condition. It is very simple to verify if a certain forum user is a troll or not, just do a quick follow up of the member posts. I can assure you I rarely post anything unless I have something constructive to add, except when feeding the trolls which I do as a sick sort of relax exercise.Regardless, what have I said here that debunks the existence of the card? I've lost you there. I am really interested though I have serious doubts I can legally use it without being a US citizen (I know I can fake being one, but I'd rather not). If you don't want me to follow up with my questions / concerns just say so, or if you really feel I've been trolling with stupid remarks, press 'Report to moderator' and make this a better forum for all. So, just a name then... sites like amazon require the billing address to match that of the card, don't they?AMEX gift card hotline, got an international number for that? Ok, I get it now, buying online with AMEX cards one must state not only the numbers but also the name and address. Can you verify if the card you have is in fact usable without a US address?
Ok, trying to make up for being an idiot before (in that sarcastic tone of voice we all love) why do you say If you don't mail it, how can one use it then? I assumed this was a card one can use for online shopping, thus the number and the CVV would be all that is required. But you are right assuming one MUST register the card, probably making it unusable to those like myself that don't have a US address... Am I? I guess you're right, I must be. Good thing you warned me on time in such a polite way So let me rephrase it, $9.1/btc was the bottom, $13.6 the buy now, and the last price I saw before I looked at this was ~$9.3. So, yeah, I failed the 1/11 calculation by a bit, which I guess invalidates all of my reasoning and makes me an idiot.Again, thanks  You are unknown, untrusted, selling something you can double spend (I know you shred the card via webcam, but you can write numbers in a piece of paper, no?) and to add insult to injury you say [CHEAP] but ask $11/btc, above market level (and that was just the bottom limit on your original post).If you are serious about selling this today you may want to rethink your strategy, just saying... I have been running bitcoind, in the recent past master/HEAD with patches mentioned by sipa on bitcoin's github  and more recently sipa's own showwallet branch. Other than the one bug it had with the construction of the privkey for printing on dump (a typo, already fixed) and the fact that the import of each key takes multiple minutes (it scans all blocks for transactions, so that's expected, I would like to see a batch import in the future so a single sweep could verify multiple addresses) I can tell you it is working very well.I'm using it quite heavily these days to organize offline wallets with a set amount kept on each address and then keeping the addresses and priv keys on paper in a safe.My workflow only touches dumpprivkey and importprivkey. There is a glitch with the address balance listing after importing but it's a known bug and doesn't affect the global wallet balance consistency.I would LOVE to see this pulled into bitcoin proper, and if you need any specific unittest written (there's a framework now, right?) I can try to find an hour to give it a shot soon. The slim has a dvd slot, where the fat has a lid that opens for the dvd on the top: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY7u-Imk6J4 Thank you! Though if it is a year old it is most certainly the slim. Yes, the PS3 slim is actually quite fat. Anyhow, Canadian PS3s will not play my EU bluerays, so I'm out. I don't mean to be rude, but that's like saying: "what computer is it? It's one of those you buy in a store"... pretty useless. We need model (is it a fat or slim), hard drive size, approx age and, very important, zone. If you don't know any of these things post the model number you'll find in a sticker saying something like "model nr". And the zone is probably easy to find too; where did you buy it? Country or at least region is enough. Where are you from? Out of interest for the ps3, btw, so some extra specs also appreciated. So your transfer to mtgox hasn't arrived yet either?Yeah, I'm with piramida, we need to stop this rally pronto! It's for everyone's good  6 days to go... I'd might be in for 10, but need shipping to Europe... possible? price? A guess is a guess, I guess But my prediction on a tangent of the actual question is that you'll get high guesses from those holding "expensive" coins and low guesses from people trying to get "cheap" coins... and then there are those that, like me, can only wish as I have no clue of what the market will do, it being so small and easy to manipulate by a small few.That, and I feel that your two bounds $2 and $15 are insufficient... you should add a "below" and "above" open ended option set. Less than 8 days left 9 days to go. Can't be, just look at the bidding history.And yes, can't agree more on the Android vs iOS  Another very old thread revisited I've used this some since I last advertised for sale, but my phone pretty much keeps this device on the tabletop... If anyone's interested just place a bid. This is a bit disheartening... can you tell me what your process for deciding winning bids is? If this is up for auction at least a couple hours warning for other bidders would be good.  Bumping up a really old thread I have a C1 and a B2 to sell, I decided to dump all I have now... They both work very well, the C1 looks new, the B2, well, its good but has some glue from old stickers and the like.Any interest? And I bid 46 (+ int'l shipping) Hmmm, don't take this the wrong way but the explanation you gave for the one you have sold to SHIFT seems counter to you having two such phones... but you may very well be a wholesale entity that wishes to remain anonymous, that's ok, only now my trust level is slightly lower.Why don't you start another bidding round and see where that goes? I'll start that at 20 btc BUT you'll have to send the phone first, and I'll send coins upon reception and inspection (look around, I'm well trusted) or at the very least I'll want someone to escrow the deal, and by someone I mean one of the old timers on the Forum (I'll drop him/her/it a coin for the trouble). Oh, and I'm in Europe.
I'm the 40 btc bidder, and it is a great deal I'm hoping to grab, though it is only fair others see the bids publicly (fair for SHIFT, of course  ) Congrats! I was considering bidding again but have been offline... a simple deadline (as requested in my first reply) could have netted Ninja a few extra coins  And thus I was REALLY being greedy. Sorry about that Anyway, I don't need another phone, and 20 btc for one more toy is a bit much atm so I respectfully remove myself from the bidding arena. No fair! Ok, it is fair, I don't know the retail price on the piece but I'm sure I was just being over greedy here. How long till this closes? I'll take it for 6BTC in a hearbeat  I would certainly bid on it, but I'm in Europe (meaning expensive shipping and taxes if stopped at customs), and I'm not sure I could handle the US keyboard all too well Still, look at the shipping and get back to me... Hey,Tried it, really good stuff. There are 2 points though that I would like to discuss...I have 3 cards in one computer, one of these is failing due to overheating in the past. Now, every so often it locks and that's ok, I need to restart the computer, but with cgminer it tries to restart the gpu, create a new clcontext and the whole ati driver crashes, effectively killing all other GPUS along the process. Can this behaviour be switched, i.e. "it's dead, leave it alone".I also add cards and remove cards more often than I should, and at least on card is a dual GPU where only one core still functions. So I need to disable one GPU, but to do that I need to specify all enabled GPUs instead. How about a -D (or something) switch to negate that particular GPU, instead of specifying all inclusions? Or at the very least having cgminer not die if I specify unused -d indexes (-d0 .. -d7, which is linux's limit, and then remove the ones I want to disable).Great work! tick, tock, tick, tock... Where are you, or more specifically what region are the games locked to?Oh, and Portal 2 PS3  *b b b bump* again. Ainda tenho os R$40k, se alguem tiver as bitcoins para vender Esta transação é algo complicada pois eu não estou no Brasil, mas caso tenha 500+ bitcoins para vender podemos tentar combinar alguma coisa. *bump* again. I may not be around this coming week, so next bump might be in August  *bump* Ainda não tenho a taxa exacta mas em principio levam 1% em jeito de saque.Quanto a não haver 2000 btc em todo o brasil, custa-me a crer pois concerteza algum miner dos "bons velhos tempos" as deve ter. Claro que esses não vão querer vender agora, enfim.Mas obrigado pelas palavras positivas, eu acho que seria um exemplo perfeito para o poder das bitcoins. A oferta mantem-se, mas provavelmente amanhã vou ter de tomar uma decisão. Oi galera,Estou precisando transferir cerca de R$40.000 para a Europa e, claro, o banco cobra uma taxa "daquelas" tanto no envio como ao receber.Isto me fez pensar que é uma daquelas coisas em que os bitcoins são perfeitos, se bem que a dificuldade da compra é sempre uma barreira.Portanto; tem alguem que queira tentar chegar a um acordo? O dinheiro provavelmente pode ser entregue em mão em SC (mais detalhes por PM) mas tambem pode ser transferido pelo banco.  So Kais sent me a PM with the code from the other thread, but iTunes says it is not valid. How much for a $20 card, how soon can you give me the code and how do we settle this? I could go for that, if you are willing to send the code, allow me to use it and then get the btc. I'm sure you will not have any trouble trusting me, but if you do then I'll be willing to accept any "old timer" forum member that is willing to act as escrow, if you can find a volunteer you trust. Still plenty of time, but the clock is ticking... Time for another *bump*... Really? I know English is not my first language, but I do like my title  Anyone else feels this way?Also; *bump*
Yeah, I have done that earlier, thanks. I don't think that's needed yet, but certainly for the last week it would be great. Well, I have only ever advertised here. Anyway I'll be sure to push harder when closer to the shutdown time, but for now I'll try to avoid over spamming. Oops  Yeah, I use many libraries when coding, some words just kind of stick out. Thanks for spotting that! Thanks for the bump, I'll try to do the same every day or as close as I can to that. You are somewhat new here, right? http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=1617.0It will become the biggest on the market very soon, if all goes well  Next week I should close the sale, but unfortunately not for bitcoins... I tried, I really did :p Well guys, it breaks my poor digital heart, but TAABL has been aching and moaning for some time now, from sheer lack of attention from both myself and the site users. I really have no choice but to take it down.This means I need everyone to go and grab their coins there so I can take the server out of its misery. A side effect of the Anonymous part is that I have no way of contacting the users, other than here on the Forum. There isn't all that much there, but I would hate to see the site hacked and stolen, so please do withdraw what you have.This is not the end of the lottery, no... there are plans and there are projects and there are paradigm shifts (how very web 2.0  ) but for the time being there are many more lottery sites on the bitcoin ecosystem for you to waste your hard mined bitcoins at.I'm planning of taking the server offline on August 15, so why are you still reading this? go to TAABL now  If the transaction wasn't broadcasted should it not say 0/offline? I mean, if the transaction was accepted by at least one peer the original wallet has that information in it, right?Or is there a way of aborting a transaction before it gets accepted by other peers, say when you are offline and press send? I haven't traded outside #bitcoin-otc at all for a long time now, but let me tell you I've never had *any* issues with the responsiveness of mtgox, both from Jed initially and Mark now. They always replied to my emails promptly, and the IRC channel during the crisis was also a good place to ask stuff, though obviously the repeated "are we there yet?" remarks were completely ignored.I'm not saying they have the man power needed to resolve the crisis or that they are not over their heads with requests and tickets, I don't know, but my experience is that they are very serious and honest. Just my 2 bit cents And yet one of the strongest points in this community is the generalized mindset that control is bad, censorship is bad and what we really need is a self adjusting market/community.The Forum, however, is a different beast, as it is the "face" of the community and some of the oldest/most active members are doing what they can to keep it clean(ish) without crossing the border of dictatorship. It's a fine line, I can tell you that.So everything within reason is tolerated and even encouraged, but exactly what "within reason" means is open for discussion. I don't think there's any harm in giving you or your "students" (a friend of mine was cheating on his wife... right!  ) the publicity needed here, but be prepared to be removed/blocked/censored if you cross the line of what most will consider acceptable, which in itself is a moving target as the community grows.Rule of thumb? There's nothing wrong in advertising "illegal", as that is an artificial externally imposed concept anyway, and will depend on where you live on top of that. But if you feel the it is "immoral" for as subjective as it might be you'll be better off doing that somewhere else   I'm not trying to imply anything, but all bids should be acknowledged by someone in the forum, or else how can we tell the seller isn't putting bids himself?Did I say this up loud? Ahm, nevermind that, let me just prepare a great deal based on similar rules for, ahm, I don't know, a pair of 6990's and the winner gets, hmmm, 250 btc.Seriously, though, each bidder NEEDS to come forth and say they placed the bid, or else this is just asking for FUD. I am not sure if I'm amused or insulted by the tone of your reply... I'll go with amused, it's way too late here to get insulted The 2 BTC was a half joke, of course, as that will probably only just cover the shipping, but still a base line of what you are willing to accept would be good.As for the USD price, I understand the "I bought it for..." thing, I really do, but that serves very little guidance here. You don't use it, so it's not worth the price you paid when new, it is worth only what you can get for it, assuming it's enough to get you to part with the device. For base I saw http://www.amazon.com/Sony-PRS-505-LC-Digital-Reader/dp/B000WP2RC2 where you get it new for $250 and used starts at $135. Of course these used ones have a bunch of perks attached, like amazon as an escrow, the knowledge that there is some warranty and if you don't get what you ordered you can just take it back for a refund.Which means that, in all seriousness I can see myself giving something in the order of 5 BTC, maybe a little more if the rate goes any deeper, though I've got a feeling we'll see some mild uptrend now. And the previous month (June)? When is/was the draw? Oh, and btw, I don't remember if I entered an email address when first signing up, and honestly I can't find a way to verify that, can you provide some guidance?Thanks! So the contest for July has started, but the draw happening on Aug 12 is for the June entries, right? You should state what kind of low insults you I assume you are in the US, is the changer multi-voltage?2 BTC? And that is why I'm not selling coins now... but your point is well taken. Hey,I've upgraded my MacBook Pro memory and now have 2 SODIMMs, 2GB each for sale. These are DDR3 1066MHz.Any bids? I don't have a base price and will only take bitcoins. It must be enough for the shipping (from Europe) and some change  If you're looking for a PC, sure. But if you want to run OSX (and there are many good reasons to do so) and you want to run it on top tier hardware, there's not much option.I guess as always it's a good "it depends". I'm not in the US or I'd be trying to lower that price. I know depreciation isn't as big on macs, but 20% off for a used machine? I'd put the 20% and buy a spanking new one, yet otherwise I'd certainly be interested. I have completed a deal with teesee a little while ago for 8 BTC (at a slightly better price for me  ) via amazon uk gift card and all went perfectly well. This would be my +1 on otc, if he were a member there. Being part of the "teenager" community (i.e, not a newcomer by any rate, yet not a hardcore old timer) I gotta say I resent that comment. You are putting the handful of members that requested a part on the stolen goods and then saying the community, the whole 1000s of members worth of community, should be somewhat better and you are disappointed at the whole of it?I don't know the whole story (nor do I care at this point) but that kind of reasoning seems to be in the very root of what triggered the whole drama  So, wait a minute, did I understand this correctly? AnonX and some other dudes (or dudettes) gave you -10 on -otc for stuff you did, or they thought you did to other people, thus calling you a scammer? And then you scammed them (or at least him/her/it) to get even, thus proving them right?Confused... head hurts... is that, like, reversed karma alignement? So they got bit for calling you something you became in the process of getting revenge?Gotta... sit for a bit.They did, in fact, have a premonition then? Can we get AnonX's view on how the BTC market will be next week? Should I buy or sell?In all seriousness, I'm very much opposed to bad mouthing or scamming for that matter, and this is a tale of both. It was however a good laugh and a wonderful lesson for all newcomers to this trade. Kudos to FoodSt4mP for doing this as an exercise of teaching and not just bragging! And better luck next time AnonX, you should know better (for both abusing the rating system and then getting scammed)...Oh, and I DON'T want no btc from this whole deal, way too many moral implications 
Every one is waiting to get closer to the 24hr waiting period. These types of auctions are awkward, why would you bid before the end time... And if the auction will take 43 bids to break even, any single person bidding will want to recoup the investment, thus making up to 43 bids... Some will drop early, but if 2 members end up fighting over this, it's going to be one slow, long, boring fight... 1 bid per day, 3 months to go Anyhow, I would change that to bids within 23:45 from the last bid don't change the bid end, thus giving at least some reason to bid inside that window. grease and thermal pads, sure, but coolers are the bulk of the shipping weight. I wasn't trying to get a discount for not getting the coolers, but rather keep the shipping costs as low as possible.None taken. I'm not trying to push you into selling quickly or anything, and I much rather hold on to my coins are use cash instead. You feel otherwise which makes this a perfect match. The price is still a bit steep as I am also not in a hurry. I may end up taking it, you may end up wanting cash fast and making me a better price, or just find someone that pays what you ask. All is good either way, no rush from me either  80 BTC will be much more than 820 soon... how would I be able to pay in cash? SEPA wire, maybe? I would much rather do this in bitcoins, but only for a realistic value. Also, I don't need any cooler, I have the A/C and a stock one from a saphire. Assuming your cards are reference (and the fact they have the accelero shows that) I can use that on them.How about you quote me on a BTC value for both cards, no coolers, pads or grease, shipped? If you really want to you can also quote a value in  but honestly I'm not paying 10.25 per coin  I could go for the cards alone, and I most certainly would rather get them without the accelero coolers. Nothing against them, have one on the shelve and it looks sexy, but 3 slots is just too much.I do think the price is a bit steep though. Granted, 450 is the price most 5970's will net for on ebay, but I'm in no hurry and I have got one for under 300. But I'm not here to haggle, make me a price for both cards, shipped to Europe, in bitcoins and I may very well take you up on that today. With or without A/C coolers. There was money involved, and those that had money at stake where obviously the loudest. There was an opportunity to kick competition while on the ground, those that have stakes at competing exchanges where the most negative. Then there are the trolls...My point is that many of the negative remarks on your behavior during the peak of the crisis are somewhat too biased, and when someone is happy or has no stakes on the issue that person tends to stay quiet. I forced myself to make a few positive posts because I felt like you were handling all in a very good way, if a little too silent (which is understandable, but people panic very easily).All in all I think the hardcore customers are all still there, and if we look at the volumes of trading, mtgox is still way up there in comparison. Major cookie points to all of you for surviving this and not alienating everyone in the process  Yeah, you never got back to me on the price  20% off is great, but off of what? hehAnyway, I believe I have found one locally, will know for sure tomorrow. Now I'm looking for an eee pad transformer 32GB (this one is for myself, not as picky as to cosmetic state), anyone? So the issue I posted above is a simple typo on sipa's commit. Instead of puddinpop's proposed change:You changed the code to Code:vch.insert(vch.end(), vch.begin(), vch.end());The secret "vchSecret" was never being used. I've cherry picked the two commits sipa mentions on the pull request onto bitcoin HEAD, compiling on a linux x64 machine (xubuntu 11.04) and while it compiles almost cleanly:Code:g++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -o obj/nogui/rpcdump.o rpcdump.cpprpcdump.cpp: In function void GetWalletDump(std::map<uint160, CKeyDump>&):rpcdump.cpp:116:82: warning: converting false to pointer type for argument 2 of bool ExtractPubKey(const CScript&, const CKeyStore*, std::vector<unsigned char>&)But then calling dumpprivkey on *any* address will output Code:26zVKbYFGI didn't debug the code, too tired to do that now, but maybe it's something obvious  Well, marking it __local actually hints the opencl compiler on to where you want that variable to be stored. Local memory is the fastest iirc but there's a limited amount of it and if you are already on the limit you may end up getting the wrong thing in local memory, thus making everything slower.This is obviously an oversimplification. For a little more " to the metal " kind of facts, my experimentation gives me:- The 1~2% speed increase on a 5870, which can do -w 256 but is at the performance peak at -w 128.- A fair amount of speed DECREASE on a 5970, with -w 256 which is where it performs best.- The 1~2% speed increase on the same 5970, with -w 128, although even with the speed increase it's a little slower than the -w 256.I'm using one of each 5970 and 5870 on a computer, but I don't want to use separate kernels, one for each card, so I'm stuck with the no __local version  I'm selling BTC for amazon uk gift card. My problem is you are unknown and these can be bought with a credit card (and thus reverted). Can any trusted party around here speak on your behalf?Still, PM me an offer and I'll consider it. Better yet, get yourself on freenode and #bitcoin-otc-eu  You are evil... ok, tell you what, tell me what price you'd make for the 64GB wifi shipped with tracking (so I know if it gets stopped at customs). I would need it to carry an invoice with a low, yet believable value if possible. Now you are just kicking me when I'm down  Some 95% of all I buy on the States gets stopped at customs, which means 3~4 weeks of waiting and an extra 23% (VAT) + some fees. That really sucks.I need something that gets shipped from Europe. Verizon == US? I don't need 3G, but I'd rather get a 64GB than a 16GB (32 being the sweetspot), but if it is indeed US that's a deal breaker as explained on the original post. If not US, what price would the iPads be going for, in the origin currency? Where would you be shipping from? And why a week? I was hoping for something quicker, given apple store says 1 to 2 weeks. The price sounds about right, at current $16/btc rate but given mtgox is opening soon we might want to see how that goes first...  Ouch, how did you do that using it 4 times? I guess it only needs to be dropped once Anyhow, not gift capable material, I'm afraid and even taking in account current exchange rates 50 coins is 75% of the brand new price on the store, so I guess I'll pass, sorry.I would haggle a bit if it was for me, as it is working 100%, but not to offer to someone else.Thanks anyway! Do you have pictures with enough detail to show the dent and smash you can upload somewhere and PM me the link? Also, from which country would you be shipping from? Price seems good, but I need a little more detail; age, warranty, language (can I change it?), original box and accessories included? Oh, and of course, is it 'like new'?  I can't find one locally, and it is supposed to be a gift for an oncoming birthday, but after a month of moving delivery times I'm starting to fear it will just not make it so:I'm buying an iPad 2, preferably 32GB but can be 16 or 64, preferably new and unopened but will consider 'like new', no need for 3G. The only caveat is that I want it sent from Europe, or I may just end up waiting on customs instead.Will pay with bitcoins, have no set price so make your bid.Thanks!EDIT: I think I have the iPad covered, but I want to buy an eee pad transformer 32GB for myself. Terms as above if anyone is interested in doing this for bitcoins. I just wished someone on the other side of the table would say something. This actually points to a single account getting compromised, or the wallet itself. How can there be so many crying "ahhh, but I thought I was going to get rich. I didn't know it was stolen, honest..." and no one stating the reverse side of the coin?Maybe noone noticed yet, and with the reversed transactions never will, but just imaging all your coins had been sold for $0.01 a piece... you could argue that it was mtgox fault, sure, but how would you feel about the guy that knowing something fishy was going on still bought them (I would) and then, when shit hits the fan, throws a public fit because he might have to give the stolen coins back? I know, it sucks to not be freakin' rich anymore, but just imagine your however many k's of coins got sold as a result of a security breach, the site owner had the option to revert these abusive transactions but instead throws in the towel and says "tough luck, I'm out" ? bobR, is that you?Naah, you can't be, you are much more articulate at reasoning in colorful ways, though much less amusing to be honest 
So, after putting out the fact that I'm confident Mark will do 'the right thing (tm)' and that I don't have any suspicion of foul play from mtgox's part, I must say that this whole episode will force me to say goodbye to a good friend that has accompanied me for many years now... my email address. It is on the wild, it is related to bitcoins, it is getting spammed with get rich quick emails and is probably forever tainted.Ah well, it breaks my heart but its a small price to pay for a lesson learned: use unique / disposable emails on anything that is not under your control (which is pretty much everything on the net, I guess). First of all, we? We, who? I am a mtgox user, have been for a long time (just look up my alias there on the leaked db) and while I did move substantial amounts of money and coins with it (to my own relative values, of course) all the issues I have ever encountered were taken care of with the highest level of professional attention.So 'most of us', or even 'some of us', or better yet 'me and some other guy in the forum don't give a shit' would be the better way to put it... I WANT to know what happened from all angles, and I do give a shit because:'absolute joke your little site was' is probably right on the money. It is/was a sad little joke of a site, and that is why it never got any traction, or volume. Hell, if they hadn't forced you at gun point to use it, you wouldn't even know it existed...Don't like it? Don't use it. Want assurance? That is fair, but no statement on the site ever assured anything to anyone, and with that mtgox has always honored their responsibility no matter what. I'm sure they could just run away with the current wallet and not have to work again, but instead you see a great service that suffers the most imho from not having had competition for a long time. That is changing, which is great for everyone, but I'm sticking with mtgox for as long as they keep the service standard they had so far. I appreciate your kind words. But I don't think we are disagreeing, to the extent I'm not stating a particular viewpoint as much as I'm saying there are two possible roads that lead to the same outcome, which is the ever changing deadlines for delivery;1) knowingly set a short time to market, even though it is obviously impossible to keep, to avoid a major "rebellion" which can result in a disastrous thing for your business; it's quite incredible the number of times you can get away with this, but there are studies that explain the why (read, for example, "The Paradox of Choice" and what it says about how we remember an experience).2) being over-optimistic. This is almost as bad as 1), if in a more humble way. They are really trying hard and if all goes according to plan they keep the deadline, but until you have the complete picture of what happened, how can you know what plan there is to keep?While none of the two views above is something one would want or expect of a "professional" service, I must say that I'm very pleased with the way the whole thing has been handled so far. I don't know if I lost anything, but even if I did it was 2 or 3 coins at most, as I am VERY paranoid about who keeps my stuff, and I rather keep everything myself unless I'm actively trading (which I wasn't).And I feel the need to say that all my dealing with Jed and now Mark has always been a 5 star experience. They were never the fastest to reply, granted, but always very helpful and cordial. I don't get that from my bank, unfortunately  panic control, anxiety level management, we do it all the time with our kids, governments to it all the time with their toddlers (us), it just beats telling a 6 year old you have no idea when lunch will be ready because the stove broke.I would much rather get a fuller disclosure if one is in order, but on the other hand I do that all the time too, and not because I'm bad that way, just because I honestly believe I can keep my projected deadlines... sometimes I can, but shit happens. Nope, not American at all. And yes, I would love to pay the same as donald trump for each unit of taxable income, he is much richer than I am and I pay much more per earned unit. Or was that your argument?Ah, right, you are a troll, you make no arguments, only read hatred  You see what you want to see, I read somewhere I do think that people should be paid the same for the same task, regardless of them being poor or rich. I also think that your hatred made you state the wrong idea. You mean rich people should not PAY the same as poor people, right? not GET PAID?regardless, yes, I think a thing is a thing and has a value regardless of who pays and who gets paid. It's how much you are willing to pay that makes the price, not how wealthy you are, in my personal opinion. But I'm sure you are correct, and that's why the world is as it is today. re: 100k, aha, good. So that explains why asking 5 digit fees is small, because they (we all that use it) can pay? Ok, now you sound more like a real security expert, or a lawyer, or a politician...re: hate. Come again? the example (not the only one, I understand) that I read what I wanted to read in your posts is that you read too much hate in my posts? huh?But enough hatred, I know I have an attitude problem as all that had to deal directly with me can attest to. Too much good, positive attitude and a complete lack of capability of making simple ironic remarks  I'm a long time professional at what I do, and that is not trolling nor is it security. You are obviously better than me on both accounts so if you can refrain from replying to my post here, I promise I'll behave and not make hatred filled remarks on any other altruistic comment coming from you on this thread. drooolll... seriously? good for you, maybe you can then waive the 5 digit small fee and make this a better place for all of us, you included?The latter. I do lock my house, but not my car. And the reason I lock my house is that my miner machine is inside, and you can't really trust a community like Bitcoin that has people reasoning like you... someone might take my computer and then post on the forum saying "for a small 5 digit fee I'll teach you about the best locks for you door".I need no proof at all. I believe you, I have no reason not to. Of course any random guy making over 300 million dollars yearly will sniff and spoof, and not steal to then arm wrestle a small fee... I wonder what kind of "security" you are expert on, though...Oh... so you run an exchange, one that is totally secure. Now I'm getting really puzzled... which one was it again? Tell the good developers that potentially lost a bunch of bitcoins, something that could have been prevented if you would just help competition for free. I promise noone will try to hurt you, and I'm sure noone will be capable of anyway :pYep, no doubt. And once someone hacks it you'll provide information about how you already knew and could have prevented it, if only you would get paid the (relative) peanuts you require, but you only require them as a matter of principle, you REALLY don't need them.Enough trolling, have fun with your buzzword magic. You might be a security expert (and failed to present any proof of it, but you aren't in the PR business anyway, so who cares) but I'm still not sure you are a human being. Not at all, look at all the threads!You are, however, from my own subjective analysis, the only one saying that a five digit small fee should be paid to you for saying you have spoofed mtgox accounts by eavesdropping wifi connections and not taking monetary advantage of it. So as far as I can see that's:- you sniffed open or badly closed wifi connections, which is eavesdropping and forbidden in most places- you used that information to explore issues in a bitcoin exchange, which is illegal anyway you cut it- you provide no proof of doing any of the above, but you certainly use good bragging buzzwords- you failed to provide information to the site owner to prevent the current situation (heck, you might be the one behind all this, for all you said you were capable of doing)- now you require hard money for your expert services, which amount to saying that something is hackable after it has been hackedKudos to you for making all this with a straight face... or did you? :p Got it, posted on irc, got directed here.The forum message volume is starting to make it hard to keep up and know these threads exist. Oh, and I was called Pat, not Jason  So a long time ago there was a thread about PayBox (now VirtuaPay) as a potential payment processor on the make. I joined in and have collected over 1k VP$.Now, I'm pretty sure the whole thing is a sociological scam, where you create value from nothing because people who "get on board early" get free credits like I did, so they'll do almost anything to keep these credits. I stopped having any belief in it when they created an auction site with 'test' auctions and then took it down, like "you already had a taste of how we can move this virtual currency we control and create out of thin air into something virtually real, so your faith in us is restored, back to holding control of you".But all these issues and doubts apart, today I received an email stating they'll soon force all users to have a Facebook account... now, that is just pushing it too far. I don't have, never had, and will continue to try as hard as possible to never have a facebook account, so I'm out! Anyone on the system wants my VP$? If more than one person wants them, I'm open to bribery as I make my decision of who gets them  This is for business use, so if there's no physical proof of key authenticity, it's really the same as a fake key, regardless of working or not. I'm not doubting your honesty, though, just stating that the key is not enough for me, but thanks for the offer! I could be interested, but I would need a little more information. What am I getting? A physical cd key or just the number? Will this be enough to prove the installed software is original? How can I check the key is valid and otherwise unused?Thanks! I don't think this got included yet, but you can use gnuwin on windows http://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgnuwin32.sourceforge.net%2Fpackages%2Fpatch.htm&ei=LQPgTZOtF8-xhAezjtC_Cg&usg=AFQjCNF0DgIiBVNJjTXm07I_nySTN75Kzw or, for a prettier solution I think tortoisesvn had a tool iirc. Be sure to post on the forum when that happens... I'm on GMT+1 so I'll miss it. Hey all,I have a lot of stuff taking up space, like old laptops, MBs, CPUs, ram, PCI and ISA expansion cards, IDE hard drives and what not. Thought I'd test the waters, see if there is any interest in these. I'm not out to make a buck, but I'm also not ready to waste time and money for nothing, so at least the shipping must be properly covered. Hardware is in Portugal, so shipping to Europe for most heavy things should be ~35, and the small stuff under 10.I didn't yet find the time to organize, catalog and photograph the stuff, but here's a small sampler to see if there's interest or not:Working laptop: TOSHIBA Sattellite 1800-504http://www.toshiba-europe.com/computers/products/notebooks/satellite1800_504/techspecs.htm15GB HDD256MB RAMCeleron 1GHzDanish keyboardHas a Windows ME key sticker, but no media. Hard drive will be wiped before sending. Also, I'm not sure I have the charger for it, need to look (I know it works fine because I'm using the charger from another toshiba I'll be selling too). The battery still holds some charge!Broken laptop: Targa Traveller 826T MT32http://www.targa.co.uk/index.jsp?SID=0&NAV=236&PCAT=2&PTUBE=12&PROD=248http://www.targa.co.uk/index.jsp?SID=0&NAV=236&DOC=&PAGE=1367&PCAT=2&PROD=248&PTUBE=12&PARAMS=undefined&PARAMS2=undefined&SPCAREA=undefinedThis little fellow overheated quite badly when it was in operation. Eventually it died, just like that. No battery on it, no hard drive (once I wipe it it'll go on sale too), but the hd holder and screws do go along. It has the ram (2x512MB) the wifi and bluetooth card, DVD-RW, a screen that was working just fine and should be reusable. No charger on this one.I have 3 more laptops but not here by me, so I'll probably add these later.If you want to blindly grab everything I have I'll be happy to come to some agreement with you.edit: here's some more stuff:Now this is 2 fdd, 2 cdrom, 1 laptop fdd, 3xMaxtor 40GB hdd, 1 fujitsu 10GB hdd, 1 fujitsu 3.2GB hdd, 3 pci modems, 1 ATI rage 8MB AGP GPU, 1 FX5200 128MB AGP GPU, 1 MB with PIII 667MHz and 64MB RAM.edit 2: and some more:2x PCI sound cards, 2x PCI network cards, 1x PCI USB adapter, 2x USB case extensions, 1 PCMCIA network adapter (I'm almost sure this one is broken), 2 DDR 266 (PC2100) 256MB SIMMs (one HP, one PQI), IDE and FDD cables, rs232 to siemens C35 cable.Everything was working as far as I can remember, unless otherwise stated, but I have no way of knowing if that is still true. I have more stuff, but need to gather it up. Unlike what I mentioned previously, even without LP the hang still happens. Looking a bit closer at the code it seems to me that the getWork request that WorkQueue performs when the miner is found to be idle fails silently and is not retried, so phoenix sits waiting for something to happen but with no action deferred. I'm on ubuntu and have been mining with phoenix/poclbm happily, no locks, against a local bitcoind instance. Today I decided to give a pool a go, and for 2 times in 5 hours I got the "Warning: work queue empty, miner is idle" that would just stay there until I Ctrl+C and restart that miner.The obvious difference? Long polling. I've commented out the long poll thread start() so I can make sure that is the issue, but what I really feel is missing is an option to disable it. I don't have a patch (just a #) but can cook one if that feels important to anyone else. That is all true and under the proposed config / price tag it makes little sense. But we're talking major player almost getting it, imo, so getting a 4 PCIe card with single low end CPU is not something they'd think of without 'stepping out of the box'... but the 2U case with place for 2 PSUs is there, think 2x750 which is cheaper than 1x1400.Does anyone know anyone on Asus R&D?  http://event.asus.com/server/2011/esc4000/I'm not sure about heat dissipation, but it does have 8 PCIe x16 slots and 1400W PSU with optional redundant extra PSU...
That's because you guys don't do flight simulation... I don't have the desk real estate for 3 of those, though. And I'm in Europe... You almost nailed it. I have the coding skills and I do a lot of embedded development, mostly with PICs but also H8 and the like. I never used FPGAs before and I've been waiting for an excuse for a long time now, so bitcoins might very well be it.I have a pretty simple understanding of electronics, but I do have people  So if I had to jump out of a dev board I could, and in fact would have all the expertise and industrial equipment available to me to do a full hardware implementation from scratch, but that obviously comes with an extra cost.So, yeah, I *should* already know the answer to these questions if I had done my homework, but it's hard to keep up with everything and the bitcoin community has been the most helpful I've ever met... ever! So before I decide to go fpga happy and shell out a few grand, any advice on Altera vs Xilinx vs whoever else? And what numbers / features should one look at in the specs when deciding what to get? LUT count is obvious, but what else? I can't really tell from the pictures, does it have place for 2 PSUs?Also, and more importantly, what would be the shipping cost to Portugal?  I did not look at the code but maybe you can clarify to me how this particular approach scales;Say I use one of these http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=138&No=501 instead, what kind of performance could one expect? I'm assuming you can easily put multiple fully unrolled code paths for parallel execution.How would one scale this to multiple FPGAs? Some communication between devices would be needed, or will there be a full TCPIP stack communitcation with bitcoin on each one?I guess my confusion comes from my PC coding mindset. In the GPU implementation we just create the "unit" calculator and the GPU knows nothing about communicating to and from the bitcoin protocol, it just has an algorithm and a memory space to work with. In the FPGA though, you have to implement something to comunicate with bitcoind and, if using multiple devices, communicate with each one of them, right?Sorry for the dense questions, just trying to understand this. Assuming the 'COMMON' or 0V pins are indeed connected to ground (which in my very limited knowledge of electronics I'd assume) then wouldn't the hack to make the slave PSU power on with the master one automagically solve this? We are connecting one PWRON and one COMMON pin across the PSUs. What OS did you use? In other words, would this work on linux? Where are you? Any chance of shipping to Europe, and if so at what price? You wouldn't happen to be bundling a hard case?  By using the mentioned "hack" we will be connecting one "COMMON" line along with the "PS_ON". This is ground(ed), right? Thanks for that. I actually used the green/black wire trick many times on water cooled set ups to fill the system and remove air bubbles without booting anything up. I can use that, certainly, but I don't like the idea of someday having to power down the machine remotely (has happened) and having that PSU just running and feeding a GPU, thus I search for something more permanent. I could just hack the thing up, push some clips into the connectors and all but there's enough equipment value involved to go that extra step. Ahm, so why is the 3 day waiting period different from just shipping right away? If you wait 3 days so you can cope with a market swing during that period, who's going to protect you from a market swing the minute after you ship the record?On a lighter note, how feasible / expensive would shipping to Europe be, if at all possible? Didn't get anything on running it passed the "Using GLX_SGIX_pbuffer"But to be honest I don't think the thing is honoring the sub display number or the driver is still trying for all cores. I used both "export DISPLAY=:0.0" and "fgl_glxgears -display :0.0" and both hang just the same, but if I *remove* the crippled card from the system it runs perfect. I'm guessing it is trying to access everything on bootstrapping and hangs? No error, in fact I can list the devices on a display just fine. The thing might be running, but I see no output on the monitor, and it might very well just be an issue with the xorg.conf settings. I had to move my computer to the garage (too hot now to keep it around) and I don't really have a place to put the monitor right away. I'll retry in the next few days when I get a moment. Would you also be able to provide the cable to power up 2 PSUs in tandem? Something like http://www.frozencpu.com/products/11742/cpa-167a/ModRight_CableRight_Dual_Power_Supply_Adapter_Cable.html?tl=g2c413s1220&id=qNzMZhNn A little bump... if you've bid and are still interested please restate your bid, as the exchange rates have changed quite a bit. Shipping will be ~30 for Europe (~$43). Probably close to twice that for US.I can't get fgl_glxgears to work even on the other card with 2 good cores. I'm using a simple ubuntu server with manually installed X and drivers, so maybe I'm missing something. Yep, it still is on the market  And it is still not connecting, or even trying to actually. I also tried with -connect instead, which keeps at least keeps popping those 'trying connection' entries in the log, but still doesn't connect.What port is bitcoin testnet connecting to? I'll double check I can access it. Well, it has one singleCode:trying connection  lastseen=-334791.3hrs lasttry=-362569.1hrsI'll let it run for a bit, see what happens.But I'm puzzled; so the reason this works on non testnet new wallets (that don't yet have stored node addresses) is because there's a list of seeds hardcoded, which means no such list exists for testnet? To me in Portugal. And it was pretty damn quick to arrive too  Hey,I've compiled bitcoind from gavin's git at 04a667b0767a6c3fff8d24be784ccaec9edf712b on my mac, and while everything is working great for the real bitcoin network, testnet seems to refuse to bootstrap.Looking at the logs it doesn't even try to connect to IRC, though I'm not using -connect nor -noirc (I am using -nolisten and -rpcport, as I have another bitcoin running).What am I missing? Alternatively can you share the IPs for the some testnet nodes I can connect to?
Be careful with the aftermarket version you put in the card yourself, there are many references to dead cards after installation due to over tightening the screws around the GPUs, which can bend the PCB to the point it breaks something. I'm too lazy to leave a url, but google for it and you'll find plenty an example... although on the other side it is AMAZING when it is carefully placed or bought already installed from factory. The only other thing this patch could do to make the thing complete is 'popkey', where the key is printed AND removed from wallet. I know it's kind of dangerous, maybe dump first would be required just to have some sanity check, but for bitbills it would make everything much simpler, no need for a new wallet for each bill, just address.I do have other use cases in mind, like simple backup wallet creation on paper, that I can put in a safe box (which with the current patch I can already do) without all the stop client, move wallet, start client, new address, dump key, stop client, rm wallet, move old wallet back, start client... which is in itself very, very dangerous when undercaffeinated or overalcoholized  Nope, Saphire. But the problem is, I believe, bad VRM, basically overheated to death. The card does at times operate the first core for a bit, so the GPU is certainly fine. Hello all,In the process of my mining and overclocking experimentation I've managed to cripple my 5970. Basically the first core locks as soon as it leaves the idle state, making it useless for hooking a monitor to it. I still mine on the second core, which gives me ~300MHs at default clocks and low memory, using phoenix on ubuntu. I have replaced it today with a new (to me, that is) one and don't feel like building a new rig for it So, you'll get a Saphire branded 5970 that you can mine with, provided you only use the second core. I can push it to 800Mhz without issues, except for the deafening sound of the stupid stock cooler. If you wanna you can also get the original box, the Dirt 2 voucher and the selection of connectors that came with it.I offer no warranty whatsoever but am willing to take the card back for the price paid (except for shipping) if it doesn't behave like advertised. It's some 2.5Kg total with box and all, so expect 9 btc shipping to Europe, probably 1.5~2x that to the US. Have no base price, bid away.Oh, and since I crippled it I have been mining non-stop, and that was some 2~3 months ago, so I'm pretty confident it will do good by the new owner. It does make sense now that you explain and it seems like a good deal. But how long are the contracts you are selling? If 1 month, then you are better off mining yourself. If 6 month~1year, how do we know you'll still be able to use the server room?I don't mean to nitpick, but I have a project that would require miners, and your offer seems made to fit, but I'm not yet totally convinced it is practical. I'm having trouble understanding this: So you have, say, 2 machines. They are mining. You don't have money to build more machines other than the profit from the 2 machines you mine with. You accept payment in bitcoins, you actually prefer it... How is this different from you using the bitcoins you earn mining yourself? How are you going to buy new rigs with the profit from the service, but not from the servers? Either the deal is bad for me, the renter (you get more from renting than mining, and thus I loose) or for you (could make more mining that renting).For the larger renters that charge a premium for large throughput I understand... I can spend a little more than I would mining at home and get the same expected outcome, where they get that something more I'm paying. They probably loose in the long run but are protected from a market crash, I win because I have zero work to get mining and I can scale if needed.Before I go about thinking any more seriously about this... what is your angle? Where are you based? I want the EU version of Portal 2 for PS3. I was wondering how this applaud / smile thing would work... now I get it All I can say is; great, now bobR is going to troll AND smite on everyone. Beware, though, that 'if' statements make paralel optimization harder and the opencl runtime may end up being a LOT slower with a simple conditional branch command that looks all innocent. @mintymarkI would certainly be open to any kind of deal, and the "lease to buy" thing seems pretty cool. which of them? I never posted pics of the one in Brazl because I'm a paranoid person, but I can select a few photos to put up *if* there is real interest. We are the bitcoin realestate pioneers! Though I must tell you, even though we're only two, it seems the demand is still several orders of magnitude lower than the offer. And it looks more interesting every day! So this topic was dropped a long time ago, but I still have the house for sale and what were 500k coins are now ~40k. So the question once again applies; would you buy a house for bitcoins? That's fair, although bar for the shipping costs, there is no need for correlation between bitcoins and dollars on this deal. How much is the XO worth to you... in bitcoins? But I get it, we need to think in terms of what we are used to, and that will be USD or EUR or whatever, so here's a reverse proposal:C1 - 60 coins - soldB2 - 35 coinsplus shipping: 10 coins to europe, 16 for US.Offer valid for today, first come, first served. Equipment shipped on Monday. I see Code:-k poclbm everywhere... is there an alternative, or a need to specify this when using phoenix? This is ever so slightly off topic, but did people signing the PSN EULA waived the right to sue in case of identity data theft? I'm guessing that a class action could hurt sony, even if only a bit, and I for one would put some coins down to see that happen  Didn't test yet, but I have receive a x16 cable and it looks good Thanks! you mention no core dump, can you check Code:ulimit -c before running bitcoind and on the same shell you are about to run it on?I've found this was happening to me when using ssl, in a completely unpredictable way,  but the core was dumped on exit. And I'm back. Any more offers?BitterTea, given the exchange rate I need to ask, is your offer still valid?
Nothing finalized yet, so both the B2 and the C1. That is a very valid point, and I was thinking to myself "why did this thread ever get derailed into a discussion of profit?"... then it dawned on me, you said you were the cheapest, there, blatantly. We are all nitpickers and given your price / performance ratio, it was just too damn easy to complain Best of luck with your business, it is certainly filling a niche. Good service, bad advertisement wording. What is the speed gain on bootup, anyway? from 20 to 18 secs?Yep, and you could drive 2x 5970 mildly overclocked safely with a good 850W. Dunno about 6990 though...My guess is:6990 retail: $699Dual GPU: $2698Single GPU: $2798diff = $900, which is ~28.5% above $699... so putting it clearly, 30% markup on top of retail.Just my 2 bitcents Right, I'm inclined to accept, but since I will not be able to ship it before next wednesday, I just realized, lets postpone the deal until then. Also remember I'm sending from Europe, meaning you may get customs charge you whatever fee, dunno how that goes with US imports, but I do know that here I get charged extra 9 out of 10 times. Thanks for the offer. Where are you located? I'm guessing 2 months is long enough to assume that Pegasus-Rider is no longer interested B2 up for sale again, also have a C1 up for grabs now, make your bids. HA! There's that smile in my face right there, thank you! (I'm in Europe, not Massachusetts, btw, but I guess it is funny either way) Hey,I have a private git version that is based on the public git with a few personal patches that should be fairly innocuous and everything was just fine. I have a few remote miners working with this daemon, and the big change I did is that I don't need the miner login to match the rpcuser (but still need to correct password), so I can log which miner is doing the getworks. I've also got everyone working over ssl.But since yesterday, for some reason, bitcoind keeps dying out of the blue. I grabbed a core dump and I wonder if anyone can help me here.I've since updated to the latest git (bf3a0902ef98365d803e4a03853dbf0f83511026) compiled locally, but same thing happensCode:$ gdb bitcoind core.dump.2GNU gdb (GDB) 7.1-ubuntuCopyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.  Type "show copying"and "show warranty" for details.This GDB was configured as "x86_64-linux-gnu".For bug reporting instructions, please see:<http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/>...Reading symbols from /home/cn/src/bitcoin-official/bitcoind...done.[New Thread 16830][New Thread 17125][New Thread 16662][New Thread 16663][New Thread 16670][New Thread 16665][New Thread 16667][New Thread 16668][New Thread 16669]warning: Can't read pathname for load map: Input/output error.Reading symbols from /usr/lib/libgthread-2.0.so.0...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /usr/lib/libgthread-2.0.so.0Reading symbols from /lib/libz.so.1...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libz.so.1Reading symbols from /lib/libdl.so.2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libdl.so.2Reading symbols from /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6Reading symbols from /lib/libm.so.6...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libm.so.6Reading symbols from /lib/libgcc_s.so.1...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libgcc_s.so.1Reading symbols from /lib/libc.so.6...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libc.so.6Reading symbols from /lib/libpthread.so.0...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libpthread.so.0Reading symbols from /lib/librt.so.1...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/librt.so.1Reading symbols from /lib/libglib-2.0.so.0...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libglib-2.0.so.0Reading symbols from /lib/libpcre.so.3...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libpcre.so.3Reading symbols from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2Reading symbols from /lib/libnss_files.so.2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libnss_files.so.2Reading symbols from /lib/libnss_dns.so.2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libnss_dns.so.2Reading symbols from /lib/libresolv.so.2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.Loaded symbols for /lib/libresolv.so.2Core was generated by `./bitcoind'.Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.#0  0x0000000000656bd8 in BIO_write ()(gdb) where#0  0x0000000000656bd8 in BIO_write ()#1  0x00000000004b8b02 in boost::asio::ssl::detail::openssl_operation<boost::asio::basic_stream_socket<boost::asio::ip::tcp, boost::asio::stream_socket_service<boost::asio::ip::tcp> > >::do_sync_read() ()#2  0x00000000004b3fc7 in boost::asio::ssl::detail::openssl_operation<boost::asio::basic_stream_socket<boost::asio::ip::tcp, boost::asio::stream_socket_service<boost::asio::ip::tcp> > >::start() ()#3  0x00000000004b4659 in unsigned long boost::asio::ssl::detail::openssl_stream_service::read_some<boost::asio::basic_stream_socket<boost::asio::ip::tcp, boost::asio::stream_socket_service<boost::asio::ip::tcp> >, boost::asio::mutable_buffers_1>(boost::asio::ssl::detail::openssl_stream_service::impl_struct*&, boost::asio::basic_stream_socket<boost::asio::ip::tcp, boost::asio::stream_socket_service<boost::asio::ip::tcp> >&, boost::asio::mutable_buffers_1 const&, boost::system::error_code&) ()#4  0x00000000004b8955 in boost::iostreams::detail::indirect_streambuf<SSLIOStreamDevice, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char>, boost::iostreams::bidirectional>::underflow() ()#5  0x00007fcbf8d8683e in std::basic_istream<char, std::char_traits<char> >& std::getline<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >(std::basic_istream<char, std::char_traits<char> >&, std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >&, char) () from /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6#6  0x000000000048e937 in getline<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > (stream=...)    at /usr/include/c++/4.4/bits/basic_string.h:2543#7  ReadHTTPStatus (stream=...) at rpc.cpp:1645#8  0x000000000049815a in ReadHTTP (stream=..., mapHeadersRet=..., strMessageRet=...) at rpc.cpp:1683#9  0x00000000004ed0de in thread_proxy ()#10 0x00007fcbf82cd9ca in start_thread () from /lib/libpthread.so.0#11 0x00007fcbf85ca6fd in clone () from /lib/libc.so.6#12 0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()(gdb)  Say I have a point of entry into 2 banks. Unfortunately not small local banks but rather big financial institutions, and also unfortunately my contacts on both accounts are low on the food chain, but can introduce me to the next levels in the pyramid.What would I, as a tech dude not that much knowledgeable in economics, use as ice breaker? Remember that these dudes will not care for the pseudo-anonymous side of bitcoins, and will require knowing the color of your underwear before giving you money for your bitcoins, which means they'll then report that back and make you traceable for tax purposes. Is it wise at all to consider doing this? Well, from where I stand I'd say price drives difficulty more than the other way around... if miners sell coins at high prices that doesn't that's the sum total of coins being sold, and that doesn't mean buyers will be interested... What does happen for sure is miners will only mine while it is profitable, so a lower price means less people mining which then gets the difficulty lower on the next change block which will probably get the miners back in the wagon, as they can find more coins in the same time span, even though the price is lower.I can't see the individual miner moving the market too much, though I can be wrong of course. Did you get slashd... I mean bitcoined? :p While I not only vouch for bitcoins but also dedicate a good deal of my time and money to it, the simple fact that we get ourselves a pledge of allegiance and start thinking in absolute terms will drive away all the critic thought, thus making everything vulnerable and untrustworthy... but that doesn't mean it can't still be a good business model, look at all the religions out there that prosper.* nelisky docks So money can replace begging, sweet  Yes you do! you just don't feel it anymore because you've hit the wall a bit too hard last time, and your reasoning, or lack thereof proves my point. Don't worry that you can't understand what I mean, or you feel that I'm just making fun of you... right now it's all you can achieve.Ironically, brain surgery might have got you back to normal (though I'm not sure I want to know what that means for you) but all the surgeons are busy cleaning the phones, those that survived infections, that is. fetokun (e quem mais esteja interessado), eu li num outro thread que estás procurando hosting. Caso não precise de ser mesmo no continente americano, manda PM com as caracteristicas que procuras (ram, hd, SO) que eu tento fazer um negócio bacana com uma VPS em Portugal. Nope, amazon gift cards are localized. You can, however, buy on the uk site using the VISA gift card, that would work for me just fine, but it might be hit or miss to get the correct USD amount when doing a GBP transaction, and fees will certainly be added. Piggybacking on this thread, I too am willing to buy the pre-order of Portal 2 for BTC, but I want the PS3 version, and I think the best place for me to get it is at amazon uk. So I'll be wanting a £32.91 gift card, any takers? Name your price. Ok, I don't really think this system works for me because;- I don't have a way of knowing my emails aren't getting into some guy's spam folder- I have no way of knowing if the buyer isn't just using the exchange as a hedge, only completing the trades if the market moves in the way he expects- There are no hard rules regarding communicationMy own history is that I have 2 trades done... on one it has been 6 days and 3 email, no response whatsoever. The other I got a response for very quickly, an agreement was made as to the method of payment and I've been waiting for 3 days for the transfer confirmation.Nothing fancy, no huge values, but as the market moves up I find myself frustrated because I don't get the cash to buy more bitcoins in time before prices go too high, and I don't have the bitcoins to sell for a higher price. The market just moves too slow.What I would like to see implemented, short of a full exchange, was a communication system mediated by the exchange so1) email history is kept2) the sender is the exchange, resolving the spam folder potential issueAlso a simple rule like - 48 hours of no communication gives the seller the chance to cancel the trade and get the coins back. This of course means the exchange must be sure there was an attempt and no reply. Just waiting for 10 days sucks on such a dynamic market, mostly because there is zero assurance the trade will actually be completed by the buyer, whereas the seller is locked in for however long. well, maybe he has 250k btc and needs a quarter million dollars, so he hints "there will be much selling soon, and at more than twice the current value" and bam, a lot of people start buying at whatever current market rate is so they can sell later... now all he needs is to put a dark order of 250k on 1.0 at mtgox and wait... I think the better / simpler option would be to convince the owner of the pump nearest to you to sell you gas but keep it till you need it. You could go all fancy and arrange for a 'fidelity card' approach so your friends *cough*clients*cough* could go to the pump and just use some of your pre paid fuel.It wouldn't scale too high, as it would obviously raise suspicions to the fuel provider but it would solve the issue with storage... Say you give a little extra "on the side" to the pump owner and he allows you to keep an inverted tab, and you SMS him "Today the car with such license plate will come in for x gallons".Of course the POS system they use will probably make this impossible, but maybe there's still a manually operated pump close to you?
I didn't look to see if it is already there for more than 2 seconds, so forgive my lazyness. I'm in a hurry and didn't want to let this one slip;Can we get a weighted BTC/{your 2nd favorit currency here} exchange rate too? Something like we get for 24h on http://www.taters.net/cgi-bin/btc/matrix.pl?axisinc=0.01 that unfortunately only covers mtgox trades.If we could sum all the trades done in all the "known" exchange sites for each of the pairs (although even just BTC/USD would be very helpful) and then find the average given the volume, we would have a very solid "official exchange rate" that merchants could use, one that would soften the cyclic movements of the market a bit. And why not do that for hour, day, week and month? This way getting automated BTC pricing on USD based sites could become more dynamic with some confidence. Yeah, I can beat kalyhost in both price and performance, although I'm pretty sure you will not need the power option, as you hint.  This will always be better than what I can get you dedicated, so unless you want to give the VPS a try first I'd go for it  That would work fine with the VPS, I believe. I can't give you a specific number of cores but I could give you core affinity, disallowing others from using those cores. But in the end I believe the best thing would be to just allow you to fully take advantage of the 4 core system (minus the VM penalty) when needed. This all boils down to not allowing other VPSs on the same machine to hog the system, which should be a simple case of giving your kvm process a better niceness value.The multi core performance of KVM is not completely linear, though, and the only way to go about this is by doing real tests. If I provide you with a VPS instance are you equipped to run performance tests?  I'll have a quote for you early next week, but I believe it will be in the 150~200 coins / month (I assume you'll want to go monthly given the huge fluctuations in the exchange rate). Prices gets lower for longer term prepayment, of course.The VPS price is more or less bound by memory slice, and I can get you an equivalent VPS for 25~50% of the dedicated price. As for the CPU issue, unless you have a sustained requirement for intensive CPU usage you will probably never even feel the performance difference in the VPS. What OS are you targeting, btw? The full story is I have been "contracted" by a local hosting company to create a VPS managing system, and I have convinced the owner to allow me to attempt to run a bitcoin driven framework. But in the end I'll be collecting bitcoins and he has the option of charging me the bitcoins, or part thereof, or simply having me pay for a fraction of the VPS price is .Either way, the VPS' are running fine, I actually have some in operation and have a draft of the management system, but there are a few issues still and out of sheer lack of time the project has been on hold. I can hook you up with dedicated servers too but I'll have to get a quote from the ISP.If you want to give the VPS a go I can set it up for you, give you 2Gig dedicated RAM, but you will not have dedicated CPU time, so if you are CPU bound it will probably not be the best approach. The machine I'm currently working on is a quad core XEON, and because I'm using KVM for virtualization the most I can do is give you one core affinity.I can arrange for pretty much anything but this is not my main business and you will be better served elsewhere if you need 99.999% uptime and 1 hour response Oh, and we'll be putting no cap on traffic for starters, but the future will depend on how much abuse we get. I have a VPS service on testing stage (for too long now, have just been busy). If VPS is good enough for you let me know and we can come up with something. So say I sold a few coins, and I emailed the buyer... how long should I wait before I ask for the transaction to be aborted? Is there a system in place to handle lack of communication?I don't see anything related to that on the FAQ, but some guidelines would be appreciated. And we're back! I missed you, bobR, I really did  Fair enough, but I would argue that your understanding of what I meant is a bit flawed, though I may have worded it badly. I won't do business with you because I don't trust your reasoning when a disagreement arises. And in business, like in marriage, you get to know the other half not when you tie the knot but when things go sideways...But don't take this personally, I am not in the market for your services at the moment. If I ever am, these threads, and more specifically your position towards the potential flaws pointed out will help me make my mind you on wether to trust your business (not you personally, of course) or not. What you are doing, business wise, is great for the bitcoin ecosystem at any rate, so kudos to you for that! The more the merrier. Hmmm, I had promised myself I would not allow myself to give in to my arguing needs, but there you go, I can't help myself...I'm not a native english speaker, although my work environment is 100% english, and has been for more more than a decade. What that is worth, I don't know, but 2 things got stuck in my (digital) throat and I need to get that out:- I can't see the attitude issues bitcoin2cash is complaining about. Re-reading the message from madhatter does in fact provide all the sentences you question, but the meaning I attach to them is of a pure attempt to help. Maybe with a touch of arrogance, sure, but I believe one is entitled to that when there's a good deal of previous experience, which madhatter has.- bitcoin2cash; you say you take your reputation in a very serious manner, but from where I stand, nitpicking on the exact wording of a forum post by anyone, let alone a generally trusted member, will not net you much positive karma. That, and the fact you refuse to give in on the continuous attempt to raise a white flag from said member, by doing that puzzling thing of dismissing long rants by engaging is multiple dissecting quotes. Honestly, that makes me feel that if I do business with you and we have a disagreement you will simply refuse to listen to my side of the story, dismissing me with a set of handy adjectives. Not cool.But who am I to keep getting between you 2? I'll just go back to the stands and enjoy the show... you can get your gloves back on now, gentlemen!  I don't mean to troll or linger on a subject from which there is very little gain to be taken, but from my many months on bitcoin and this forum specifically I feel I need to say "chill out", bitcoin2cash...Maybe I'm just biased, as I have had conversations with madhatter in the past regarding myself taking the European front on the cash in the mail exchange he runs and I generally know madhatter is very trustworthy and fair, but reading through this thread and the other one he points to gives me absolutely no indication that he's trolling, trying to scare you or your clients off or anything of the kind. And I for one appreciate his doing this in the open, as I am always considering my next bitcoin related move and all experiences, good and bad, are very helpful.I don't want to be rude, really, please don't read too much into this, but you start to sound slightly like bobR (in a VERY mild way, it's just the direction of the thought not the position itself), by taking every attempt to "make good" as another attack, and in fact crying wolf too easily.Just saying, really. I have nothing more to offer other than my trust in madhatter and the knowledge that his experience should not be frowned upon, imho. That works great for bitcoins, but how do you get the client to do USD/EUR/etc transfers? But a client where you can work all the exchanges at the same time would rock, except that the second person to use it would find all exchanges operating at the same exact rates... ooops  There's even profit in the "aggregation" of exchangers... It always puzzled me why there's no known attempt to do that, as it would be fairly easy to have, say, bitcoinusa have a few bucks on mtgox and then offer theirs bids and asks at a slight markup, making the buy/sell on customer request. Hmm, how about an external proxy doing that on multiple exchangers? There, now he doesn't have to wait that long, assuming the teacher doesn't mind being paid only after the lesson (and also doesn't take the hint at the easier method for achieving the same end result  ). Well, it's a gamble in and on itself  Not sure if this was discussed before, I didn't find anything on my 5 seconds search. I needed to use ssl for remote miners and while bitcoind now supports that out of the box, poclbm didn't seem to, at least not the version I was using (and I'm too lazy to try and upgrade a perfectly running system) so here's a patch to allow for that. Patch is for BitcoinMiner.py and you just supply the host part with 'https://' prefix to make it use ssl.Code:158,159c158,162< <   self.host = '%s:%s' % (host.replace('http://', ''), port)--->   if host.find('https:') >= 0:>    self.connector = httplib.HTTPSConnection>   else:>    self.connector = httplib.HTTPConnection>   self.host = '%s:%s' % (host.replace('http://', '').replace('https://', ''), port)220c223<     self.connection = httplib.HTTPConnection(self.host, strict=True, timeout=5)--->     self.connection = self.connector(self.host, strict=True, timeout=5) So just like jgarzik's patch, only instead of 'mixed_debit' you call it 'immature'... Ok, can't see why the change knowing many are already using a patched version with 'mixed_debit' but either works for me, so as long as I can know when I have generated blocks before maturity.Any chance we get this on the mainline build anytime soon? So are we talking about 0 > mixed_debit > 100 > immature > 120 > generated? Why not mixed_debit all the way to 120, which is a transaction category miners already know (and what I was using on my custom miner, provided the listtransactions patch). I didn't even know about the 100 blocks maturity, I thought it was 120 just from what both the gui and the fact that balance was only accounted from those blocks at 120 confirmations on bitcoind.In a nutshell, is there really a need for a new transaction category? Using the latest plain vanilla bitcoind (0.3.20.2) I'm testing the getwork interface for remote miners, but I miss one feature from the listtransactions call, and that's the generated blocks before they are confirmed. Can I do that at all with the plain bitcoind, is there a reason for that not being in there?Thanks
And how is that working with the ladies for you? Seriously though, sad music? The musical richness of Yann Tiersen is probably what got me through the whole video, otherwise I would have quickly skimmed to the end... just saying.Oh, and 42! Há pelo menos dois Brasileiros e um Português (eu). Posso tentar ajudar a explicar algum detalhe técnico que te falhe, se for necessário. Pretty cool, it's all in the journey. But c'mon, not a single soul knows about life, the universe and everything? It's 42! Oh, that side of the pond... That is kind of a show stopper, I'm afraid. When you were to ship me back the thing it would almost certainly get stopped at customs and I'd have to pay for some outrageous yet totally arbitrary fee. Thanks anyway. Where are you located? I have one of the fatter DS, and it seriously needs a new touchscreen glass (dunno if that's the complete touchscreen or just some protective cover), as we lost the pen at some point and apparently some of us used pretty much everything to replace it, like rollerball pen covers, toothpicks, crawbars, chainsaws, small nuclear fission devices, etc... it is pretty messed up  I honestly don't know... Portugal I have no clue whatsoever as to the cost, but we now have a more or less general trend of having reserved parking places for EV on shopping centers and these have recharge plugs. And we have a lot of shopping centers... Well, my longest common weekly ride is 20 miles, and it is getting more and more easy to find an electric car recharging station. Even without that, I could 'juice up' a bit for the ride back using a common mains plug, I guess.But maybe a better project for me would be a home made hybrid solution. I've had this idea of putting an electrical motor connected to the main engine belt (is that what it is called in english?) getting feedback for the ICE effort based on belt tension and going full throttle when the belt mechanical tension is above some threshold, or something like that. Do you have any experience in such a thing? Manual gearbox. I know the costs are directly proportional to vehicle weight (does size really matter?  ) and I would surely shop around for all the used parts I could find. Because I have the space, and since the net weight of the vehicle will force me into using a large motor to start with, I think it would be more cost effective to go for lead-acids instead of lithium and the like. I know the energy density is far from perfect but they are very easy to find and much cheaper.5 years fuel cost? If you knew how many kms I drive per month you would probably come up with a different number... sure, I can do 5 years fuel cost, it's really not that much But back to reality, is this at all doable? What kind of price would you see me paying for all the parts? How much labor to achieve the all electric goal? With that on my hand I can make an educated decision as to pursue this or not. I've thought about this multiple times now, but never quite bit the bullet... Do you think a first generation Hyundai Starex (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Satellite) would be a valid candidate for a conversion? I mean, the chassis is great, plenty of space and all, but the engine is very underpowered (at ~80HP) and it is not exactly cheap to drive.I've toyed with the idea of just scrapping the diesel engine and putting some large emotor, but there are a few oddities I don't know how to solve, like the assisted brakes and steering, as well as the A/C (which I really need).Would you consider this doable? What would it cost me to get your help in coming up with a viable plan and budget? Damn, it took me a good 2 minutes to understand the 'pedophile' connection... I'm getting slow! Good one, though  Your logic is appealing, but at this moment wrong. You mention that a 5870 takes over 8 days to cover your needs for a single calculation, so you are not interested. You want 5970's which atm are the most efficient miner GPUs, so when people start turning off these cards you can rest assure the next difficulty step will make everyone go back to mining.But mining is a gamble, and you offer a somewhat more certain means of profit from the GPUs we all own and love, so I guess there will be people interested. Best of luck! In the bitcoin forum? really?  I really had a bunch of funny remarks to make. I believe they would be witty and entertaining but how can one be sure? It turns out that one can end up being accused (*) of being an asshole more easily than not. I *really* have to work on my self control now (*) - http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4505.msg68526#msg68526 I'm on the market for a 2.4Ghz Spektrum DSM2 transmitter, with at least 6 channels, and I'm willing to part with some bitcoins to buy it.I'd like to get a DX6i, DX7 or better transmitter or, as an alternative, a DM8 transmitter module (for Futaba, although I'll be putting that on an Hitec Optic 6). I don't need receivers or servos, but will also consider an offer with these.Any RC guys/gals out there looking to upgrade and make some bitcoins in the process? Make me an offer EDIT: shipping to Europe, so US based offers, while welcome, will be considered a last resort only. How does this protect one from the virus scenario? I'm assuming the wallet will have to be loaded in memory in an unencrypted way for this to work, at least while sending a transfer.And I don't know if this is an issue at all, but does this allow in any way for the mobility of the wallet? I mean, will the token and the wallet be paired in such a way that you can safely load your wallet into some bitcoin client, knowing that it will only be available if you use the token's OTP? I don't get it, sorry. What would be stored in the token? And what would the communication between the token and the bitcoin PC client be? If you are using the token to hold the wallet and do the transaction signing itself, then we are talking about the same thing, if on different hw (pics can come out REAL cheap, too).But if you are saying the token pin protects the wallet.dat file, then there's no trojan/virus protection at all, I guess. Once you unlock it, the file is available to the computer, period. So what would the requirements be for such a device? The bitcoin software would still run on the PC, but instead of having the keys stored in the local wallet it would communicate with the device?I can see myself getting a proof of concept going using a PIC32... would that be safe enough? The device would connect to the PC using USB but instead of providing a USB disk with the wallet, it would provide a serial interface or something alike that would allow the connected bitcon client to operate upon. So it would still be possible for a virus to take over the computer and ask the device to transfer whatever to wherever, but the serial API could use a password protection / encryption step to make this harder. And because the keys are NEVER shared with the outside world, one could also set up hard limits (no transaction larger than 100btc, for example) so it would be safe to use the device on public computers.Would this be safe enough? Even my jedi level mind game didn't work at all (saying I moved sell orders to $2 and actually moving them only slightly above 24hr high). It didn't move an inch!So either this channel of communication is very ineffective, though I'm pretty sure it is, or there is a real market force driving bitcoin exchange rates... we're getting more and more mature, quite a satisfying realization I say!
So, where is the 'it depends' option? I like having money, I even like making it (which with bitcoins it is not just a figurative thing), but I wouldn't trade anything for profit... it really depends. I take it you are the one that has been in a buying spree and moved the market down quite a bit then Still, I moved all my sell orders to 2.0 today, just for the heck of it... bobR are you ignorant or what ??What Bitter tea posted wasn';t clear ??If its not on topic STFUSTOP POSTING CRAP(I have to work on my self control) Ok, I apologize for the harsh approach, but please read the first OP and imagine you had no idea who this person is... doesn't it sound like either complete bulshit or at the very list a scam? Now that you have given us a little more context, and because you have plenty of karma points from where I stand, I can rest assured that is not the case and even consider using the service proposed, whatever that might be (I honestly don't yet know, is it spiritual guidance? some sort of long distance energy healing? what?).But next time you force someone into doing such a thing please either start out with a "letter of recommendation" or at least ask the ones you are enslaving to the bitcoin overlord to clearly state why their post looks like a scam, smells like a scam, even sounds like a scam and yet it is not a scam   You mean my problem regarding not putting my heart in my pocket? I'm not sure chinese, or any other medicine can help there. You see, I only have pockets in my pants and my heart has these tubes attached that look kind of important...Or did you mean chinese medicine will help me get my million coins? I'm all for it! Allopathic approaches have kept my urge under control, but did nothing to solve it, so bring it on! Aaawwwww, that's sweet. We love you too! The quoted post is the 6th reply on the subject. I guess it's not a clean cut, but I'd say it would leave me biased towards saying bobR is not a troll, but rather a troll wannabe still in training.You see, I'd expect a real troll to step in by the 3rd reply, at most. Still, the verbosity of the above quote still counts towards a good effort... keep trying, young grasshopper, you too shall get there!  Voted "other", because the:- Who gives a fuck? The laughs I get from reading the post cleanse my souldand- Who gives a fuck? He gives me the opportunity to exercise the 'smart satirical offense' skills, so very much lacking this day and agepoll options! Sure, you measured me just fine. I blame it on my raising up, never got the education and gentleman style to leave PMs like this:But you got me here, I'm sure you are making a most intelligent remark in the quote above, and STFU must certainly be your alter ego alias, though I can't for the life of me understand this you say I must do... coming from you I obviously will comply just as soon as you are kind enough to, using the word articulation skills and eloquence you got us used to by now, explain.I might be convinced to stop spouting, but only if you will first :p WHAT you are annoyingJust WHAT to do you have to say ON subject ??WHY are you posting If You have nothing pertinent to say  stfuI (never get sick of) get sick of .... people thaT HAVE TO SHOOT THEIR MOUTH OFF Just to say BSWhere what is ....  who the f are you But I digress... So you state your question is legitimate, lets try to work this out so LMGTFY leaves you well alone and stops the trolling.First of all, you already know the person advancing the difficulty is an idiot, so I reckon it's a rhetorical question. You can only know that for sure if you already know who the person is.Next you clearly state that it is only one idiot, oh, sorry, person. I can only imagine what kind of sick mind that person has, making it harder for all of us to get rich quickly and effortlessly. I mean, wasn't it enough when states started outlawing us folks printing our own money? sheeesh...I would just like to point out that, had you taken the time and effort to understand how this whole mining business works, you would know that the total amount of bitcoins generated tends to be constant(ish), thus difficulty increases as more generation power is added to the network, or, in other words, more miners mine.Given you openly confess you are mining, and as you decided not to share with us the knowledge of who the miner is that keeps increasing difficulty, I can only assume that the IDIOT is you. In fact, it is not an assumption, it is a simple logical realization. C'mon, man, stop your mining so the other folks don't have to suffer with the increased difficulty. Enough, already!I hope I spanked LMGTFY hard enough  Ok, fair enough. My doctor did advise me against removing the heart from the current position, but maybe your team can help me out anyway:- I have this urge to receive my first million bitcoins before the week ends, and I am willing to pay up to 50 coins for the job, on completion. I know you can help me, your team is of that much quality, trusting your words.Waiting for a reply... I'm having a lot of trouble with your syntax and spelling... I really can't "slove" it all by myself!Can you get your team on the job? I still confused.C'mon... really? While not holding data to prove one way or the other, I must concur with jgarzik for the simple fact that unless there is something predictable about sha256, and thus we should all be working towards replacing it for bitcoin usage, the random nature of the calculation means that historical data bears no weight into future prediction.This is just another way to say that just because you've gotten heads 10 times in a row, doesn't mean your changes of getting heads for the 11th time is bigger, assuming a well balanced coins and a good, strong throw. It is always 50%, really.If you can in fact prove that you found a pattern on the hash calculation towards H==0, that is a potential attack vector and should be investigated. Please share the real world data you speak of! Ok, so I can see my estimated bounty when in shared block mode, and the total number of shares I've submitted. But for calculating estimated payout in pps mode I'd like to see an up to date number of submitted shares since last block was found. Is that possible? What does this mean? So pay per share pays for all shares accepted, but the default mode (is that the shared block?) distributes the 50 coins by the shares accepted while mining for that block alone?If that is the case, only those that mine 24/7 will actually get payouts? Well, it is worth what it is worth. I'm now using your miner exclusively, so there you go Don't let my word be taken the wrong way, you've done an amazing work. Not only did you get the miner to search the full key space, which is the way I like it, you also give out very helpful information while mining, something that was really lacking. Kudos to you, and btc's too once this miner renders me some  While I've always felt more comfortable with iterating the full getwork, to the point of having done my own opencl miner integrated on bitcoind just for that, the mathematics you are describing are really a flawed kind of statistical proof. Yes, you do get a much better coverage of the getwork (which is what you call efficiency) and the original miner just throws away the rest of the work once a solution is found, so it is never as "efficient". But that doesn't mean it is slower or worst, as we are basically trying to find a solution on a random pool of numbers.So you count the number of solutions vs the number of value pools, whereas the original miner counts the number of value pools with at least one solution. In the end I would argue the success rate will be larger for your miner because the network lag is smaller, as the miner doesn't request a new work set for each solution found, but that's about it. The 17% vs 90% description is really misleading! No interest? I already bought another phone, so before I post this on the local auctions... 100 BTC shipped to EU, +10 US? Does anyone have one of these sitting around? I'm wanting to buy one used for bitcoins, if the price is right.I can also buy a used or new W90 instead.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pentax-Digital-Compact-Camera-Optical/dp/B000EG861K/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1299165256&sr=1-1http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0035WT8K8/ref=noref?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&psc=1Shipping to Europe, so I'd prefer sending from Europe. Any takers?
Well, I'm selling it to buy a full android phone myself, so there you have it  approx. 3 years, no warranty, no bill. You can't flash android directly on the phone because windows does a buch of init stuff the guys at xdandroid didn't reverse engineer yet. There is an util that boots android automatically after windows mobile loads, but I haven't tried it.XDAndroid is here: http://xdandroid.com/wiki/Main_Page the HTC Touch pro is the Raphael. Sure. Sorry for the suckish images but the only cameras I have available right now are webcam and the actual phone, so webcam it had to be. I can get better quality pictures soon if there's an interest in the device. So I want to buy a new phone...I'm selling my trusty HTC Touch Pro, unlocked. The phone has pretty much the same battery time as when new, which is not amazing but usable (I have to charge it every other day if using as phone, and every day if I use it for ssh administration or web browsing).The phone is this one: http://www.htc.com/www/product/touchpro/gallery.htmlThere are two things of note on this device;- The screen is scratched from carrying on the pocket. Lots of small scatches, a couple larger ones but nothing that blocks the view in any way. They are simply perceptible.- The volume up key stopped working, go figure. Not that I use it regularly, so maybe it was lack of usage that killed it Other than that it works great. It charges using the USB port, but I don't have a mains adapter. I will provide a cable for connecting to the computer.I'll also include an adapter so you can use your phones with it (I use that on the car) just like this one: http://store.androidcentral.com/htc-multifunction-audio-adapter/A11A4401.htmI don't bundle a minisd card, but you can use at least up to 8GB there (that's what I'm using). This phone runs on Windows Mobile 6.1, but it can run android pretty well from the SD card, except the battery life will suck deeply (slightly less than a day per charge, if mostly on standby). It is pretty good for development testing, though.So, BTC 150 shipped to Europe? To the US should be around 4~5 BTC extra, I think. How cheap is "cheap"? I'm always buying music CDs and LPs and DVD movies, but only when they are real bargains. I would certainly love to see a sample with prices of this offer. It only goes to show how self sustainable bitcoin is! All real windows coders are busy rewriting their PHP into C# anyway. Yeah, I'm probably crying wolf a bit. My development environment is highly customized, both for work requirements and laziness factors. I'll work my way around these issues myself, sorry for the inconvenience  Right, I'll find where that is on my OS and why it isn't picked up using the default paths then.Because:Code:$ ./configure checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -cchecking whether build environment is sane... yeschecking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... ./install-sh -c -dchecking for gawk... gawkchecking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yeschecking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... nochecking for gcc... gccchecking whether the C compiler works... yeschecking for C compiler default output file name... a.outchecking for suffix of executables... checking whether we are cross compiling... nochecking for suffix of object files... ochecking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yeschecking whether gcc accepts -g... yeschecking for gcc option to accept ISO C89... none neededchecking for style of include used by make...

Jed has always been *very* responsive and I have successfully withdrawn to EU bank once. I asked him on Sunday, he immediately took the money from my account and it arrived today. Now, having said this, he has been silent this whole week. I've sent a couple of emails and have not received anything back.But, seriously, I have no issue trusting mtgox with cash or coins. Trust wise he's very, very positive. He may have some personal thing preventing him from replying, I don't know, but I'm sure that if you keep trying he'll eventually come around.Btw, he also hangs around the bitcoin-* rooms on freenode, try there too. Rosalina, is that you?  I'm not saying we should complicate anything. Actually, all this should be transparent to the user, with at most a simple fee/priority option, and *maybe* a notice that 'maybe you should include a fee' when last block was topped up, or something.What I am saying is that with the current implementation there is a chance a tx stays in limbo forever, by being back logged by miners consistently. Hence the proposal for a default 'allow X free tx in each block' structure. Of course I run my own version of bitcoin and can hardcode whatever I feel like, but most casual miners make up most of the network, I guess. Say all miners enforce fees (which is unlikely right now, but still). I send a transaction without fees, does it get accepted but kept in backlog? If so can it be cancelled, does it timeout?Reasoning is in a high volume situation I may send a "free" transaction but it may be ignored by miners for a long time, as most other transactions have non zero fees. This is all good, I can resubmit my transaction with a fee so it gets processed, but what with the original "free" request?As a miner myself, I'd say I would never attach more than a certain (low) number of free transactions on my newly found blocks. This rule would allow the free transactions, but prevents spam from taking down the network without cost.In fact, why not a default increasing fee structure for block transactions in miners? Each block would take 10 free tx, 10 @ 0.001, 10 @ 0.01, etc (10 is just a number, substitute with whatever makes sense). Then the market forces would keep this structure fair, I guess. Semantics, semantics... the game is "active" until it is settled, but that doesn't mean you can still bet on it. Like a soccer game is active until the game ends, but you can only bet up to the game start. Any hints on better wording for the 3 states?1) game open, bets open2) game open, bets closed3) game settledThanks! True. I wasn't trying to stress SSD are a better option, in fact I don't think they are, but just addressing the concern that SSD's are not safe enough for bitcoin mining. I mean, if you are going to depend on the reliability of any drive, you are bound for a surprise, and not the good kind.Just saying... How does that make sense? Even if the data is irrecoverable, you do not want to keep your coins in a simple drive, ssd or otherwise. I can assure you, from experience, that retrieving data after hardware failure on a platter based drive is neither guaranteed nor inexpensive. You'd have to have a LOT of coins there to make it worth your while...Backups, people, lots and very often."It's not if your drive will fail, it's *when*" Let me translate that for you:"Keep paying those bitcoins for files I've downloaded from the internet, it has been lucrative thus far" Just kidding... right?  On action 8 I bought 10 items @ 2 btc, and bidder1 bought 5 @ 6. When I go to pay now, I get an outstanding value of 6 btc, which is obviously wrong. The page styles are a bit broken for me, chrome on osx. Specifically the user_menu is all over the place! I've sent you the payment address. If I receive payment on time I'll send the XO first thing tomorrow.Thanks!
Maybe nitpicking, but 'stop inflation / bitcoin.org' would work better imo. Google currently resolves the search for bitcoin very well, but seeing the added traffic the owner of bitcoin.com might pull some neat SEO tricks and get that on top of google... just saying. Ok, so money (I mean US$, EUR, etc) buys you drugs, prostitutions, assassination contracts, and lots of other nasty things. Google it, you'll find pretty much anything.Last I heard, Unicef and other such institutions were taking money (again, US$, EUR, etc) to buy food and medicine for the poor around the globe.I will not say I agree or disagree with any of the two things above, really, but they are on opposite sides of the 'moral scale' and still money is very much associated with the both. And with your groceries too, did you start not paying in whatever your local currency is because you can also buy sex with it???I think the real point is not bitcoins being themselves associated with whatever, but rather this particular forum being the central repository for everything bitcoin related and thus the place people end up at when trying to learn more. It needs to stay open and free, imo, and until there's a better solution for trading 'illegal' stuff for bitcoins (heck, selling your services bathing cute puppies for bitcoins is illegal if you don't submit that in your tax form) I don't see these threads going anywhere.I do agree that a tor hidden forum would be amazing for these trades, and a great 'plan B' if this forum is ever DoS'd. I'd love to see a full mirror available over tor, with some sections only available in the hidden one But posting on one or the other would still be voluntary, I guess. You can't force a set of rules and then say "a major plus is that we don't get enforced rules down our wallets"... practice what you preach, I guess. More than fair. Send me you address, I'll send you mine. Sounds fair, if you agree that if it gets caught at customs (which here can add two weeks to the delivery) you count the date it reached customs, not actual delivery. You'll only know that after you receive the package, but tracking may provide information.Also, if the delay is too big, lets set up a minimum amount I'll get, so you don't get it for free AND I end up paying on top of that  Just throw a number. So we need to pay to see the video to assert you are not a scammer? Cutting your losses, are we? :p WTF is the problem with Russia? UPS simply refuses to ship there (from my city, at least) and most others charge more than 500 btc for a 4 day guaranteed delivery... damn.Anyway, I will only sell the B2 (because I decided to keep the C1 and the B4 has been sold). If you are interested in being slightly more open towards the delivery date, my country's postal office does provide a 3 work day option for Europe, so if I was to ship it Monday, you'd get it at most by Thursday, the 10th. Or so they say...I will need to provide a description for customs, you tell me what I should put there so you don't have to pay tax on it.Finally, I will require payment ahead of shipment, but ask around, I believe I'm well trusted If you want to go ahead and close this deal send me a PM with your address.     Could you elaborate? What are you bidding on, and the time you mention is time for the package to arrive or date you want it sent? US ~$33, EUR ~$15. Add $5 if registered. If you make your bids in bitcoins including shipping, I'll be sure to compare taking the destination in consideration. Be silly all you want, I don't mind B2 is open for offers, please form a single line! Make me an offer, all bids in thread are inclusive of shipping. Just make sure you understand the XO currently on sale is a B2 version (see first post for links to specs) which, having only 256MB ram can't use newest sugar builds. It still works fine, though.I have one more, C1 version (first mass production, the ones on the "give one, get one" initiative) but I'm not sure I want to sell it. You are free to make me an offer on this one too, of course. This has got to be the strangest bid sequence I've seen in a while  I'm not selling it at that price, not with the shipping included, so feel free to retract or bid up at your leisure.No hurries, though. I don't have much of my collection with me, as I let a DJ friend use it, but for example vangelies I know I have:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_(album)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_You_LaterAnd a few more. I have to decide if I'm going to sell any of these, but since I go to a bunch of boot sales and my friends know I'm always on the look out, I may be able to get a second copy and sell you one.Anyway, shipping records internationally is a little scary to do on the cheap, let me investigate on that and see if with the P&P I can still make an interesting price. Feel free to make an offer on the two mentioned if you don't already have them, the cover is somewhat used, but the vinyl is in very good condition. I do, actually, a lot, but I'm not sure I want to part with these... getting cheap used CD's is real easy, not so much for vinyl in good condition. Still, give me an idea of what you like to listen to, and I'll see what I can do. I've dropped the price on the CD's. If you want something more specific ask, maybe I have it, maybe I can get it. B2 - Atlas @ 135 (Feb 2)B4 - sold to rebuilderAs I said, I'm perfectly ok with waiting, but since the deal isn't close if someone outbids you and wants prompt delivery I may just take it. Again, you are alone bidding so you should be safe  Not sure I understand here, Atlas... you mean you'll be ok to close the deal @ 155 for the B2 if/when prices settle at .55? You are alone in the bidding for this laptop, so I'm certainly ok with waiting, I just want to be clear as to what your bid and conditions are. Ok, B4 is off market, rebuilder takes it for 220 coins.I am unable to send you a PM, the forum software keeps telling me I'm leaving the body empty for some reason. PM me an email address so we can make the needed arrangements. I see 200BTC there, and when I read you previous message it was 208BTC (give or take). One of us is looking at the wrong place  It is still the site owner responsibility. I'm not saying there's an obligation of refunding any losses, that's where the contracts, insurances and premiums come in, but rather that only the site owner could have prevented this, and I'm sure in this case Jed has already closed this particular hole.If there's any obligation, legal, moral or otherwise, I'm in no position to say. Having happened to me, I would ask for a refund but not require one, as you put it, and very well, I'm the one that trusted the site in the first place. I would go so far as to say Jed should have an opt-in system that would raise the fee per transaction for those who chose to allow it, and the extra fees would go to a fund to cover just these situations, but then it would become very hard to separate real cases from scams, and I don't think Jed wants to become a lawyer (assuming  he's not one already)  If the story is as it was told on the forum, I'm sure Jed will come around. It does sound like you were not to blame in any way for what happened, an 8 char numbers and symbols password might not be a 'strong password' but it is still much better than most other passwords there, I bet. It was certainly better than the one I had (and have now changed to something more realistic).
I guess common sense comes to play here. I for one fully trust Jed, so if he told me someone used my account by trying out 3 different passwords I'd pretty much accept full responsibility. But that is not the case here, there was a dictionary attack so either the site doesn't allow weak passwords or it has to have measures to prevent these attacks. Or it is the site owner responsibility.Of course we are all grown ups and I'm glad to see that the parties here are talking to each other trying to find a solution. Cool, thanks! Yep, I feel the same way. There's some resistance @ .55 but that is all that prevents prices from going back to <0.5. Or course the market may prove me wrong (I hope so  ).If you don't mind, I still have a few hours of work ahead of me, so if no other bids appear before I finish, I'll close the B4 deal with you. If you want me to close right now I can too, it is a fair price. I don't think I want to part with it at that price... Sorry, I started playing with it and now I don't understand why I left it gathering dust  I can still be convinced, just not at that amount. Going twice...We have been seeing a huge increase in the value of bitcoins, and while it might be short lived, no one can really do more than guess.  So 3 options I see:- If you guys want to review your offers down I won't mind, though I do believe that they are still fair for both sides.- Another option is to take the current high value of bitcoins as leverage to close the deal. The 24hr average is now on .65, so if it doesn't fall under .60 and you keep your bids, I'll be happy to close the deal right now.- We can just wait this volatile period out.What say you? I wish we could use bitcoins as a full currency, without needing to compare, but that is not (yet) the case, so a good plan would be to extend what TTBit did on http://www.taters.net/cgi-bin/btc/matrix.pl?axisinc=0.01 with the 24h weighted price data, and add 7 days and 30 days to it, as well as BitcoinCentral following on top of the existing mtgox.With that we could have a good 'unit measure', and we could open actions with 'coins pegged to the mtgox 7 day weighted average @ 0.55', and adjust the final price accordingly. Of course this only works if both buyer and seller agree to adjust, as in 100 coins final price would mean;100.00 coins @ 0.55 7 day average 73.33 coins @ 0.75157.14 coins @ 0.35It would at least provide some protection to both parties. I'm no security expert nor am I knowledgeable of mtgox's code, but as a coder when I see my account being stripped of 0.005 coins, which you can't see on the UI unless you look at history and do some math... well, it sounds like the actual server was compromised and DB's scraped.Just saying. Code:01/24/11 00:16 Payment Process united 0 0 -0.002 0.005Don't we all... funny how the times are sync'd though. We will, eventually, think of prices in terms of bitcoins and not the other lesser currencies counterparts. I do need to pay for shipping in euros, so I don't want to sell for a price where I end up paying to sell, but other than that I want bitcoins. Of course I assume coins will increase in value, but I'm pretty sure we'll see both parity and back to <0.4 in the near future, so if your decision is based on the spot btc/$ index, you are in for a ride But because I understand the times are very volatile, let me hit the hammer once on the current bids... I can't promise an exact time to end this, but I'll try to keep it below 24h after the latest bid.So... going once... B2 - Atlas @ 155 (Feb 1)B4 - rebuilder @ 220 (Feb 1) B2 - no bidsB4 - rebuilder @ 220 No need to be (or send) sorry, it is just fair that as I mention in the OP I can choose to not close whatever deal, the same goes for bidders. As long as we haven't come to an agreement, no shaking of hands is done.You did bring the thread back to life, so thank YOU! Well, if that is so, that someone would have probably lost a fair amount of coins in the process, I guess. The .4 bet was already 'in the bag', and the total over .5 pot amount to 450 coins, give or take. Assuming that more than one person has placed bets, the potential gain is relatively small. And once again my attempt at sarcasm goes completely unnoticed... I really suck at this!  Current bids:B4 - Atlas @ 210B2 - ptmhd @ 127 Heh, I won't take it too hard if you retract your offer at any time until we agree to close the deal. I understand the bitcoin economy is small and volatile still, which is one of the reasons I don't think auctions work well right now. Thanks.You lead with that offer. 127 for the B2 shipped within Europe. Ha, yeah, I kept it for a week, then grew tired of no feedback neither here nor on the pond I'm just restless like that. I'll get the auctions back up for another stretch. So I believe he means that rudimentary form of communication of old, back from when fog prevented efficient communication using smoke signals, or background noise degraded the quality of whistle based conversations... I think they call it "snail mail", probably because it leaves a trail of goo or something  Do I hear 150 back there? That lady in the red dress behind the funny looking penguin with a super hero cape? No?Ok, 125 going once...
Yes, sending from EU. Shipping to the UK should be ~$7, or about 16 BTC. I have a pretty much forgotten MP3  (and OGG  ) player that has a 40GB 1.8" hard drive in it, and 10+ hours of play time on a charge. With a magnificent sound it also has a bunch of other cool features.It's an iRiver H340  and ships with a protective pouch and charger (EU 2 round prong plug, but it is multi voltage). I have it running the alternative firmware, Rockbox, which is much, much quicker to boot up, but I can revert to the original fw before sending, if requested.It has obvious signs of usage, but is in perfect working condition. The back is scratched, misses one or two stickers, but that's it.This is not an auction, there is no starting bid or end time and I reserve the right to not sell if offers don't "convince" me. But I am not using the player, so I'm inclined to convert to bitcoins I'll have to check the weight but I reckon shipping will be ~$10, or 25 BTC.Some links:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iriver_H300_serieshttp://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/iriver-h340-40gb/4505-6490_7-31120695.html#reviewPage1http://www.rockbox.org/ As you may imagine, the offer is not so attractive I'll immediately close the deal, so take your time, collect those precious coins. I understand shipping is quite high, but it is the cheapest I could find, and I'm not even sending it registered, which is probably wise to do.Also, I don't know how customs works for the US, but if it was the other way around I'd expect some taxes collected on arrival, just saying. Well, it is the best offer so far  Remember you are in the States (or so I assume) and I'm in Europe, so I'll be paying some $33 (75 BTC) for shipping, which I obviously can't cover based on your offer.FYI, for Europe I'll pay ~$15, or 34 BTC, if anyone on this side of the pond wants to make an offer too. An update on running bitcoin in these laptops; you can't (easily) with B2 hardware, not without doing your own firmware. The latest supported build is based on fedora 7 which doesn't have the needed libs up to date to run bitcoin.However I have it running on another XO, this time a B4 revision (http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO_B4) and with the caveat that you need the .bitcoin dir to live out of the system flash, due to some issues with mmap and jffs2, and if you ignore the fact the screen is too small for the GUI (you can't see the number of blocks), it does run perfect there.In fact, deploying a 'Bitcoin Activity' (http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities)should be pretty straightforward... A little python, a little gtk... hmmm. Anyway, I diverge. I could not upload pictures because the upload folder for the forum is apparently full, any good anonymous photo sharing site you know of?I am now selling both the B2 and the B4, if anyone is interested. I have not yet received a single offer. Cryptosporidium... So if my latin serves me well I'd say we only need to worry if cryptography is used sporadically. Since bitcoins use crypto in a very consistent way, I guess we're golden (pun unintended, but fits, doesn't it?).Ha! I don't see why not. This particular hardware revision is somewhat constrained in memory, but I'm sure at least the bitcoind variant it will have no trouble handling. It runs quake, so... My kids had a blast with these for a while, but these little machines and the sugar interface are not made to match PC / windoze users expectancies, so they grew tired. I'm a hacker by heart and trade (the good sense of hacker, mind you), so these machines served as photo frames, audio distribution clients, icecast servers, test servers, etc. But the really amazing thing about these is the screen, as it is both a normal backlit color lcd screen but also, if you turn brightness fully down, a reflective high resolution grayscale screen, perfect for outdoor usage in direct sunlight and great for ebook reading (http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Display#Understanding_the_display_system).And the cherry on top is twofold; mesh network (which you won't be using unless you have the right adapter or multiple XO's) and very low power consumption (http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO_power_draw). It was very well designed, too bad politics moved this whole thing into the wrong direction, imho. Ever heard of the One Laptop Per Child (http://one.laptop.org/) initiative? Well, once upon a time I did some work for them and got my hands on a few hardware test samples used to develop some software.I'm now selling these for bitcoins, if anyone is interested. I'll start with the oldest one, hardware version B2-1 (http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO_B2). I will recharge the battery to make sure it still has enough juice in it, and will  install the latest supported firmware and operating system build.I'll also clean it up and take some pictures if there is some real interest in buying it. No base price, no reserve but also no obligation to sell  This is not an auction, it's a 'make me an offer' thread. Yeah, slightly dirty, sure. Privacy need is a touchy subject.But I'm a moderately paranoid person, according to my own standards. My keen say I'm obsessed, go figure. That means I never, ever assume I have any kind of privacy on any service I don't run myself. That is why you will not find me on any social network, and I would never post any critically confidential or sensitive code to sourceforge, github or whatever. It does becom impractical and does not scale, but this approach has served me well to this day... that and open sourcing all that can be open sourced.And even those I do run, I tend to use stuff like, I don't know, operating systems and server software that I did not write myself nor did I inspect the full source, so I don't assume I have full control over anything that people actually have access to. But that's just me I know that's a bad thing, it's wrong, but the way you word it somehow makes it sound... dirty  darn... *grumble* stupid geeks *grumble* can't keep their mouths shut! Satoshi, stop fooling around, some of us have work to do :p Heh, ok, my (browser's) bad then  Major kudos to you, this game is an awesome way of loos^H^H^Hgambling Although, maybe a little rounding is in order?110.00000000000001%You won 1.10 BTCYour bet 1 BTCHeh Not right now, no, I lack the time. But I'm curious, why not use one of the much more optimized by now OpenCL implementations? 3 or 4 times in one year... that's nice...I had mine locked 3 times in a month, and it wasn't more because, well, one of the times took them more than 2 weeks to unlock it. Asking the same questions multiple times, obvious template emails, stuff like "this is for everyone's protection and security".Ah well, we that is why I don't use PayPal for anything where alternatives exist, and the funny thing is the alternatives are *always* cheaper than PayPal. Take for example getting money out of MtGox... I did a few trades selling my mtgox$ into paypal, which would 'only' charge 0.5% for the cross border fee, then I could transfer to my bank for free. Thing is I get USD and transfered EUR.Then I tried mtgox->LR$->ecardone->EUR bank wire... LR charges 1% plus some small fixed fee I can't really explain, then ecardone charges another 0.9% and still it's cheaper than the PP solution.PP actually uses a 3%+ spread on currency exchange, which is understandable as their volume is low and they need to protect themselves from fluctuations But you got to love the name, if you just add the correct prefix: "No use complaining, you have to PAY, PAL" Ahh, shucks. I can flash the cards, but not remotely, which is why I thought being able to do so using linux would rock. Thanks for sharing, though! Or actual games. I would spend some coins at http://store.steampowered.com/ for sure. I will not, however, try to convince them of that, as every time I tried it went over like a bad sales pitch, doing more harm than good. Can you tweak the voltage in linux? Please do share! Hello all,I've started listing a few used music CDs on biddingpond, and since they aren't getting much attention I decided to assert there is some interest in this at all.Given I buy a lot of used CDs from a number of sources I thought I'd try and sell some of those I don't listen to or can get a new copy easily. The price I'm asking is actually lower than my cost of buying + shipping, but I trust bitcoins will keep increasing in value and I'll end up with a profit.So, does this sound interesting at all? If you want to get something particular drop me a PM and I'll try to find it. I'll keep adding new stuff for a while, to see if this business model works, feedback highly appreciated.
Since thus far only TTBit and wobber have shown interest why don't you run 2 separate auctions, one for the software, other for the domain? Maybe that makes it easier to reach your "reserve"? I really don't have the bandwidth anymore, but frankly you can't expect miracles here, you may get a slight increase from using CUDA instead of OpenCL with your card, but no bit shocking increase. The problem with nVidia cards is not limited to OpenCL, it's the actual card design. So why don't you use one of the OpenCL miners instead? Not something I use, and I initially heard about them because I applied for a job a long time ago, but since that time it seems that everyone and their cat sells on http://www.etsy.com/ and a bitcoin clone could be fairly easy to implement.I don't have the bandwidth to do it myself, so I'll just leave this here  Would you consider selling the domain separately from the service? Well, it crossed my mind to send you 10000 bitcoins, but there are just too many zeros there, so I gave up on it Seriously, though, this has been discussed in some threads. I believe the idea is to simply handle division with better naming, like sending 35uBTC (that's micro btc or 0.000035). So your stock of kriptonite is good for now?   How many do you have available? You're renting the whole server with exclusive access, right? How long can I expect to keep the server?*pant* *pant*. Ok, that's it  Ok, someone please explain what this generation to BSB is all about? So there was a generated something on a mining pool and the receiving address was the one on BSB? Why would this not work, aren't the profits of pool mining distributed using simple transactions? Pizza or assassination... I'm carrying an EMP gun at all times, good to avoid being killed and grab a free lunch while at it  I have already tried to contact two geeky artists about bitcoins, Jonathan Coulton (http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) and Brad Sucks (http://www.bradsucks.net/). Coulton never replied, and Brad was intrigued, look about the bitcoin pages and dismissed it as too complicated. I offered to help but to no avail.Maybe if a few more people try to contact them these could bootstrap the process? I would certainly buy music from both  Did you start with a fresh wallet at any time? That property is stored (along with everything else and the cat) there. Lets see... put it on bitcoins runs the risk of bitcoins disappearing... the whole network, the coins themselves are as safe as the wallet file. On the upside, if the network is kept the coin value is very likely to sky rocket within a few years due to adoption, deflation due to loss and simply because there's a limited max amount for an immense user base still to come. 1 $0.22 coin may buy you that boat one day Put it in USD... you can collect interests, but chances are interests will always be lower than inflation, and inflation will tend to rise as more money is thrown at the inflation problem... And there is the chance of the whole system collapsing onto itself, more because of the attempted fixes than of the generalized crisis and whatnot. On the upside.. hmmm, I got nothing here. Funny, I was sure I had posted this... anyway, why not every 6048 blocks representing 3 difficulty adjustment steps? Maybe 2 steps, as that is closer to one calendar month even. Sorry Sofox, I was actually pointing my finger at Makhul  Read diagonally and assumed he/she/it owned the thread... Not wanting to steal the thread or the business, I also have a few to sell. Why not take this to #bitcoin-otc? (http://bitcoin-otc.com/) We must have broken some record of most records broken in whatever period of time too Oh, and with that one, we broke that record again.And again... doh! If anything can kill bitcoins, is governments adopting it, embracing and extending, making everyone use their client version "because you can pay your taxes with it" and then legislating their implementation into total control, thus obfuscating bitcoins for the general public.We just need to get wide acceptance before that  Wrong thread? Hat dude, look at PM Is there an option to buy generic coins in bulk (thus preventing the die fee), to be later pressure engraved? What kinds of metal would best fit this?Also, do you have some reseller on Europe, to avoid the extra customs taxes and delays?
+1I haven't got my hands dirty there yet, and would rather spend what time I find to do import/export of keys, but that is something that would help some of my scripts a lot. Sender sends emailSender pays to the clearthingy escrow -> Email is unblockedReceiver clicks "refund"Sender/Recipient pair whitelisted, not more need to pay escrowAll emails not accepted by recipient have the payment revert to escrow for keeping the systemWhere do I sign up for such an email service? I'm trying real hard to understand what the 'Sensitive' in the topic has to do with the offer...Also, if I get emails from unknown people selling me viagra for bitcoins, now I know who to target my wrath at  I'd vote, but my particular position isn't considered in the poll options...It's a personal view, but I'm sure some will share it, although it might be hard to express in a small amount of words, still I'd like to try and express it here:NO. FUCKING. WAY.But I'm not obsessed with my views and they tend to change over time, so feel free to change WAY to other less offensive synonyms. And you send these where, and at what price? For what target audience? Sure, it would probably be a major set back on getting the general public to get on board, but I'm pretty sure it would make the bitcoins already in the market much MUCH more valuable, though cashing in would be heaps harder, I guess. Ha! Nice answer... though I doubt those putting the dark orders would actually put them that low on the open, but hey. Nice theory... how is that working out lately? :p Ok, so I'm repeating myself quite a bit these days, must be the age catching up, but if we want real long term backups, we need a way to both export and import the priv keys... I really am puzzled about this thread... Why should we even bother to try and call attention to the fact that bitcoins are of great value for an organization such as wikileaks? It is only so if it doesn't get tagged 'illegal' and thus remove our chance of going mainstream first, which is part of what makes it of use to wikileaks.I mean, technically? Sure, great, resilient, pseudo-anonymous, almost untraceable. But without actual people using it? And yes, I do mean beyound the geeky folk already backing it up, there's no way we'll be able to value bitcoins to the point where their usage is of any interest to organizations...Also, c'mon, they know about it for sure... someone has told them about it, major coolness, cookie points to you, but give it a rest already. All we are doing now is begging for a witch hunt, old style. I see much value in bitcoins, I'm actually making extended investments in in, but not because it is of great use to undermine governments and powers that be, but because it is a better store of value, period!Or I am completely out of my league here and I don't know what I'm talking about, but either way I think it is worth noting that while "they can't kill bitcoins", and I agree with this technically, "they" can certainly scare everyone away from it and their cats... just my BC0.02 3rd person... ok, I cried wolf here with the collision thing Nothing to see, move along now... Are we seeing the first "pretty much impossible" collision here? Time to look for a transaction with that value and age on your histories, folks... PM me all you know about your account (so I can establish you are you) BCIN, BCOUT, login, current balance, last transfer (in or out), last bets, anything that can help me make sure it is your account. Well, I never ran the binaries headless, but I did run it many times by compiling myself. I don't remember the exact steps in fixing dependencies, but using macports it wasn't hard at all, but I did have to muck around the makefile to get the paths correct.The following is for r156, but should work pretty much unchanged for current svn head, I think. Just make sure paths are correct for you, and you are using 64bit OSX. If you're on 32bit, change the x86_64 to i386 (untested). Also, build with Code:make -f makefile.osx bitcoind, if you don't specify the target it will try to build bitcoin which is the GUI version.Code:# Copyright (c) 2009-2010 Satoshi Nakamoto# Distributed under the MIT/X11 software license, see the accompanying# file license.txt or http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.# Mac OS X makefile for bitcoin# Laszlo Hanyecz (solar@heliacal.net)CXX=llvm-g++DEPSDIR=/opt/localINCLUDEPATHS= \ -I"$(DEPSDIR)/include"  -I"$(DEPSDIR)/include/db46"LIBPATHS= \ -L"$(DEPSDIR)/lib"  -L"$(DEPSDIR)/lib/db46"WXLIBS=LIBS= -dead_strip \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/db46/libdb_cxx-4.6.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_system-mt.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_filesystem-mt.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_program_options-mt.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_thread-mt.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libboost_regex-mt.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libssl.a \ $(DEPSDIR)/lib/libcrypto.a DEFS=-D__WXMAC_OSX__ -DNOPCH -DMSG_NOSIGNAL=0 -DFOURWAYSSE2DEBUGFLAGS=-g -DwxDEBUG_LEVEL=0 $(DF)# ppc doesn't work because we don't support big-endianCFLAGS=-mmacosx-version-min=10.5 -arch x86_64 -O3 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat $(DEFS) $(INCLUDEPATHS)HEADERS=headers.h strlcpy.h serialize.h uint256.h util.h key.h bignum.h base58.h \    script.h db.h net.h irc.h main.h rpc.h uibase.h ui.h noui.h init.hOBJS= \    obj/util.o \    obj/script.o \    obj/db.o \    obj/net.o \    obj/irc.o \    obj/main.o \    obj/rpc.o \    obj/init.o \    cryptopp/obj/sha.o \    obj/sha256.o \    cryptopp/obj/cpu.oall: bitcoinobj/%.o: %.cpp $(HEADERS)        $(CXX) -c $(CFLAGS) -DGUI -o $@ $<cryptopp/obj/%.o: cryptopp/%.cpp        $(CXX) -c $(CFLAGS) -O3 -DCRYPTOPP_DISABLE_ASM -o $@ $<bitcoin: $(OBJS) obj/ui.o obj/uibase.o        $(CXX) $(shell $(DEPSDIR)/bin/wx-config --cxxflags) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(LIBPATHS) $^ $(shell $(DEPSDIR)/bin/wx-config --libs --static) $(LIBS)obj/nogui/%.o: %.cpp $(HEADERS)        $(CXX) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $<bitcoind: $(OBJS:obj/%=obj/nogui/%)        $(CXX) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(LIBPATHS) $^ $(LIBS)clean:        -rm -f bitcoin bitcoind        -rm -f obj/*.o        -rm -f obj/nogui/*.o        -rm -f cryptopp/obj/*.o Paxum is not all that interesting for smallish amount outside the US.

But again, if that is taken into account when making an offer, I will buy PSC for BTC  I can't find an easy way to convert PSC to money, except for sites that do PSC -> PP like http://www.paysafecard2webmoney.com/paysafecard_en.html but I'm not sure these can be trusted... anyone has experience?Still, if you want to try this out and are willing to cover that exchange rate, why don't you drop by #bitcoin-otc http://bitcoin-otc.com/ and make me an offer? I'm willing to give it a try for a small amount, and if all goes well we can talk larger deals. mtgox: yeah, it's not the first time, it happens every time someone buys or sells a lot, the market is still very small.pro-stuff: that is the trick, I guess. I don't want to be taken as against anything. I don't own a gun, and I don't own any pornography (believe it or not  ). I wasn't trying to say do one and not the other, but rather that we shouldn't try to police this things, when the very nature of bitcoins is to avoid that very control.But I see what I did wrong... I was looking so hard for an excuse to stop working that I posted on the wrong topic... I should have started this on the one where porn was bashed, not here.
The difference escapes me. It's sex when you do it, it's porn when you sell the tapes?Completely agree! Notice how I never mentioned any alternative? The thing with the "American Way" is that it is advertised as better than any other, and force fed onto those who are not Americans or are not in agreement with it. You are free to disagree with me, and you know why? Because neither of us is bound to a 3rd party set of rules for what we are supposed to do or think. Yes, Europe has it's way too, and that is try and mimic the Americans in most everything Yes, daddy.* nelisky looks down in shame, while slowly walking towards the corn field. Yep, and if Pornography would lead to rotten souls there would be a lot of people trying to justify owning guns... oh, wait, I just shot myself in the foot :pI don't like guns, shooting is not my thing. I never said it was wrong to own guns. The way they are usually used, well, I can object to that, but you are free to own a nuclear warhead for all I care.The problem I usually have on this subject is not related to guns, but to double standards... There aren't many things as healthy and enjoyable as sex, yet we talk about pornography and suddenly there are lost souls everywhere; We must stop this devilish thing called sex! It is killing society. Oh, and if you can enforce that using guns? win-win!:OBut, hey, I'm just a guy here, and the truth is I only mock because I jealous... I'm sure my kids are much safer with guns in the house than with Playboy TV, there are certainly statistics about it.I'm being really pedantic here, am I not? Sorry about that, work is boring today... Yep, the irony of the American Way (tm) at it's best, as I said.Now give me just a sec while I go rob a bank with my naked aroused body, the tellers' souls won't even know what hit them. And then I'll join the porn army to go and fight the infidels that, you know, like sex. Careful guys, he's with the Government.:p Yep, don't take my comment as anything personal or judgmental. I don't like guns, I like porn, thus I do have a bias, but I didn't mean to imply everyone should think like me, oh no! That would make sarcasm so very difficult Being "legal" is exactly what I'm crying wolf about. Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's correct, and the opposite also holds true, but I like to think we are more or less free, and freedom implies we don't need to be correct, we are not required to anything. Society will then, as a whole, mandate the price we pay for the way we act and we decide if it's worth it or not.But I digress, good luck with your sale, we should be using bitcoins for *everything*. Not trying to be moralist or anything, but I talk about porn for teenagers and I get "we don't want the parents hovering on us because of this" type of comment, but now you sell firearms and ammos for bitcoins... Oh the irony of the American Way (tm) The trust system would be the base for everything, as it always is for bitcoins. A good trust system would be one that allows you to filter the trust ratings to only those that were given by people you already trust, I think. But, yeah, trust systems can't be blindly trusted Just like in auction sites, feedback is not just a number, it has to include comments AND history of feedback for those giving out feedback, so we can at least try to filter out those that try to subvert the system to their benefit. You have my sympathy, but isn't keeping the threads on-topic against forum regulations or something? I speak out of experience only   We have VISA but from my experience no gift cards, thus merchants my frown upon accepting a card that does not hold the owner's name. But I never tried a card with no name, only have my wife use the card in my name, so that might be completely different. I'm the "uninformed type of person" that tries hard to stay that way by trying hard to make my own mind using my own ideas. I may very well be any of the options, but I don't really know any of them all that well, and many I heard about in this forum for the first time!"ignorance is bliss" See, that's where I think the beauty of bitcoins lay... we don't have to play cop for anyone, it's the individual choice thing, I believe they call "freedom" or some other abstract meaningless word disclaimer: I am a parent, I have an undisclosed number of teenage children, I understand your worries. I go around that by actually being there for my kids and talking openly to them... a crazy idea, I know! Give them a gateway that allows subscribing to porn sites using bitcoins, then they discover the true value of bitcoins... it's more than money, it's a great way to keep prying eyes away from your business, or at the very least heavily increase the barrier. I'm not half as educated in these matters as you guys are. I'm not a libertarian, statist, agorist or any 'arianist' of any kind. I don't even know what they encompass for the most part anyway.What I am is an outsider at any rate... I live by my own personal set of rules and I try my best to not step in anyone else's toes, while still obeying the laws of where I'm physically located, but I fail to search for others that share the same view or follow the view of others. I just like to reinvent the wheel as much as possible The statement above by rhorning sent shivers up my spine... So leeching off of someone else's work is a bad thing? That is the basis of the whole progress movement, right? If the first comer was entitled to be the sole beneficiary of an invention or creation, where would we be? Think computers... If a lot of bad ass copying and misusing IP didn't happen, we probably be bitcoin less... internet less... linux less... just keep going down that path if you feel so inclined! http://www.taters.net/cgi-bin/btc/matrix.pl?axisinc=0.01 will help you out in easy visualizations of the market status and how it would move if you buy / sell whatever amount. Who's in charge of the OSX build? Given it usually lags behind I assume it is done by someone not using OSX as the primary OS. I can help with this if that's the case, just point me to how things are done right now. Either your irony skills are much better than mine, or my irony skills suck to the point of them going unnoticed... We all want / expect bitcoin to be viral, so let me fix this for you:Or should we just state that bitcoin is the virus instead?  re: multiple dbs and such, what I would really like to see is not necessarily client suport for multiple dbs, but rather a clean wallet interface and a default implementation, much like what is happening with mining today.With this we could have custom builds for other DBs if need be and, more interestingly for me, make the import/export trivial and allow for some really neat tricks for web services without needing to keep mucking about the default client sources. How does the oldest key help in deciding when to backup? Looking for a timestamp newer than the last backup would mean that we're already running with non-backed up keys, or am I reading this wrong?We could say 'backup if oldest is less than a week old' or something like that, but I assume that is never a replacement for regular wallet backups. It is certainly less complicated than getting my hands dirty on FPGAs, but I can't find any performance numbers. I'm inclined to believe this is more of a 'secure box' than a performance contender.You would be hard pressed to try and scale this to a point where it was interesting, imho.
Well, I haven't looked at the code yet, but from what was explained to me there's an initial pool of 100 and every time an address is taken out of that pool, a new one is inserted. So you don't have a simple way of knowing you used X% of the pool from last backup. You get a new address taken out every time you send coins, or you create an address manually, or you generate a block, so as long as you know approx how many of these actions you do in a certain period of time you can get a notion of the safe timespan between backups. I understand the use case for external miners, but I rather like the all-in-one approach. Will I still be able to compile in my own mining code? I really enjoyed the revamped interface you introduced some time ago, and would very much like to keep on using it. Kudos to you for this. Two quick questions:- Where are these issued, or more specifically, what charges will there be for using them outside the US$ realm, other than the exchange rate itself?- What do we do to use the full credit, if for example I have $13 left and I want to buy a $14 piece of gum? If you're using the latest bitcoin client, nothing was lost as there's a pool of 100 addresses pre-created when you first started.With the old client what would happen is:- incoming 10 -> address X- backup -> address X is safe- outgoing 4 -> 10 out of address X, 4 to some external address, 6 into new address Y- incoming 5 (I'm assuming to address X)- crash- recover address X which has 5 coins, address Y and its 6 coins lost. So, if I have accounts and I still use the old sendtoaddress, will it fail if the empty account does not have enough funds? Or will it use these first, but then still go for the rest of the wallet addresses? Well, how is using your tech skills to put your machine mining better, or spending $300 in a GPU not count as buying bitcoins? Sure, if you have these things/skills you have a leverage on the getting of bitcoins, but how is that different from taking that huge bag of cash and buying bitcoins? I don't have a bag of cash, so I feel that to be very unfair. No one should be allowed to buy bitcoins, at least not if they have more money than the average user? For all of us Europeans, does anyone know if a wire transfer using IBAN + swift is possible without receiver name? Someone, myself maybe, could allow wire to bitcoins, and maybe even find a way to do wire to mtgox. PayPal (sucks) could be used to transfer to and from mtgox, I'm sure, if a single trusted entity is used instead of mtgox having to deal with chargebacks and such from multiple users.If done at low volume it should not be a legal problem and it would serve to help getting users into bitcoin. I wouldn't see this growing to a full blown exchange service without the legalities being solved, though, so just a "bandaid" solution for the time being?  With enough time and effort, you can turn any piece of data into any other piece or date... if you already know what result you want to get and you have a source, you need nothing else.So, unless I'm mistaken and motive can be assumed from medium (like all files in bittorrent at some stage where considered piracy) I think we're safe. As Shadow already mentioned, it's hard to prove the bitcoin network is there for the purpose of trading lady gaga movies, or any other type of imoral material  Ok, assuming a radiation surge powerful enough to be compared to microwaving a dvd... we need to add to the equation making paper printouts of our DNA, because we will also need to be recovered from such backup :p That would be great, if you could use them without needing an AUS address... but it surely is one step forward in transfering money, as the buyer needs not receive any details from the seller and vice-versa. You will still be bound to the scrutiny of VISA, though, but I guess that is not a blocker.If only you could register a foreign county's address  Given the huge address space involved, I don't think the fact that 'address may or may not be used' helps in confirming or negating anything. I do see an up point to NOT having the address used, though, it will simply not appear on a search for the history of the transactions, even if it appearing is always subject to plausible deniability. Sorry, too fast here  http://www.xe.com/fx/faq.php#faq So I guess the easiest way about this is to have multiple people sending transfers through a simpler proxy that makes sure txouts are always from a different compared to txin? A simple one address black list would do, which I assume is simple enough to implement... Then, if other addresses don't have enough the txout will just wait until there is.The only downside I see is if volume is low, transfers may take a long time to be forwarded... the proxy could probably run on a fee based structure (1 coin for 100 transfers?) and the accumulated fees are there to mitigate this? I guess we'll never find a way out of that... Ahm, and a backup of the block chain too as a printout. Oh, you'll have to get many more holding such a printout for confirmation... and print out the source code too, but I guess DVDs would be safe from a solar flare, so that might work too  The likelihood of that happening is directly proportional to the amount of damage that event would cause, according to good ol' Mr. Murphy  Is this not the default behaviour? I mean, the multiple coin pockets (addresses) will not have the correct amount for the final transfer, and yes I am assuming multiple users so multiple coin owners will all get randomized. A waiting period will always exist as the internal transfers will also need at least one block to get confirmed.But I see now that this prevents the "one wallet per transfer"... maybe one wallet per day? Just span a new bitcoin every 24h with a brand new wallet, transfer any coins still in the old one there, rinse and repeat? This step actually does the disconnection. I am assuming the send address, as values differ the addresses used for sending should be different from the ones used for receiving. Did I understand this wrong?And yes, a user can carefully do this without a proxy, but we know how many will do that... So the block explorer served one purpose above all others, showing what information is actually being stored.What if I want to make it harder to trace transactions back to me, by design? Mind you, I have nothing to hide. But that doesn't mean I don't *want* to stay stealthy, and it should be our option to do so, if only for the heck of it Ok, enough politics, not for the technical side of things; Transactions can be traced to addresses, sort of. It's hard to know which part in a transaction is a transfer, which part is change, and new addresses are always being created, but consider this:- A sends 100 coins to B- B sends 10 coins to C- C sends 1 coin to Alooking at the block explorer, and assuming the wallet address that receives each transfer is the same that sends to the next hop (possible, as values are lower at each hop, thus unless there's a better match at the user's wallet, that one will be used, right?), A can see that the address used to send to B is the same C used to send to A, thus establishing a connection between B and C. That and a little googling may disclose the identities of the people involved, not to mention inbound address for C that B is using, thus (assuming C doesn't provide a different address to B each time) recurrent payments from B to C are now traceable.And if you know that C gave you that address to pay for something morally opposable, like lawyer's fees, you will then be able to know how many coins C is receiving for such a service.I know this scenario is kinda lame, sorry about that, but how can one avoid that without needing to do anything hard or complex?Someone had a service for hiding transfers by proxying, delaying them and shuffling values. I think this is the answer, if we take it to the next level. A stealth proxy for bitcoin that would work close to this:- A uses the proxy API to say "I want to send X to B".- A receives an address Y- A sends some value to Y, could be more, could be less multiple times- Once enough is transfered, proxy sends to one or two new addresses internally, breaking the value in pieces with a little randomization along the way- proxy sends X to B- proxy sends change to A--- and the tricky part- after enough confirmations on both to A and to B transfers are received, proxy deletes the addresses from the walletIf you add a 48h log rotation to /dev/null (the 48h are there to debug any real issue) and this should be completely untraceable. Another option to prevent tweaking the bitcoin client in to deleting addresses is to use a new wallet for each transaction and killing it afterwards. The hard part here is keeping a block db available to 100 bitcoin clients, but I'm sure we can think of something.Am I forgetting anything?
Maybe slightly off topic, but I've been thinking about what would involve buying / selling bitcoins from my business. Selling is pretty straightforward, as long as I declare all income I can call bitcoins a "service"But buying, trading or otherwise producing is slightly more awkward. Paying an individual in exchange for something not physical is not easily justifiable tax wise, and even more so if I wanted to keep the individual 'anonymous' to some extent.I am not in the US, and as far as I can tell, it would be much easier for me here, but frankly my accountant isn't very helpful in that he does not understand these things all that well, and I suck at explaining them. Swfuoa? (*)(*) - Should We Fight Using Only Acronyms? I don't think so... it will get harder and more spaced, but I'm sure others have experienced the odd block found by the 2MHs machine, just like I do. Corrupt the blockchain? Is that possible at all? Or you mean extend it in their own branch?As long as we are using the default client, I don't see how that could hurt any bitcoin user (unless they exploit some bug, of course). If they use massive power and create the longer hash using the last block hard referenced in the default client and growing from there... why don't they just generate the coins to start with?To control bitcoins, you don't just need to control the hash, you need to control the client as the rules are coded there and it is distributed in a way each client can say 'aye' or 'ney' to any block. If, however, these entities use some social engineering trick to force upon all of us the use of their client (better, cleaner, not so open sourced) and then change the rules under our noses... that's a different story. New motherboard? Where were you planning on connecting the second ati-card to start with? Oops, I read it backwards... someone sold 100k bitcoins, thus lowering the price... I guess my point was completely wrong, then, this was just a simple 'cashing out my profits' scenario, though 100k coins is a hefty amount. looking at mtgox trade data there was one particular trade for exactly 100k coins that brought prices down to .20, and I'm betting that same amount will broken in multiple asks, which will, in the end, serve as a buffer against huge price increases. These radical changes are probably just the market adapting to all new comers than finally feel comfortable enough to put $ in mtgox, knowing they'll be able to cash out the profits. I'm quite busy right now but this is one thing I actually want to see done sooner than later, so if you pass some good pointers my way, I'll have a look at it as soon as I have a little spare time. I didn't know I lived in the great republic of "Other"... nice flag though. McDonalds, probably. It's the one place anyone can get a job, yeah, even if they are *gasp* lawyers. Do you even go to the grocery store? Because they make money from inflating the price of food, you know. And do you even know what a ponzi sheme is? Hint: it's not buying low and selling high  Well, this has been discussed many times... we need to be able to export / import one specific address key (or key pair? whatever is needed in the wallet).Having that, printing or typing back or qrcode scanning is a simple issue easily solved.The problem is actually twofold. We need to be able to import/export but also to move coins to one specific address, and not have them scattered in multiple addresses, at least for this use case. So much for the innocent child approach I know we shouldn't feed trolls but I just can't help myself... Macho, do you have any idea how much you sound like some priest preaching to those which are poor in spirit? Next step is to start burning everyone that doesn't agree with you... ouch. Even worse, you sound like a government mandated agent, with your own morale that stands above everyone else's because, well, it serves you "and everyone else" better.I'm usually on the side of the mild tempered, but I have to side with kiba on this one. She's ET's youngest offspring, you insensitive clod! So, Macho, do your statements actually apply here? You talk about rice, which is bought with money to then sell for more money. Controlling the distribution channels by all means possible (probably by owning the production, or at least holding exclusive rights to it) seems like the only way to achieve that.Now, bitcoins... you can't control production, anyone can produce. You can't hold exclusive rights to distribution, it's p2p. And, frankly, it's not some basic necessity that you can control people with/for. I have bitcoins because I like many of their aspects, and because I'm a geek. I know that there's much more to bitcoins than that, and the speculation is actually making these bitcoins attractive to at least one niche... the speculators, giving me a good leverage on my holdings.Of course they can make the coins loose all value, or just make them way to expensive for the average joe but... wait a minute, I can put my computer to work and generate these, or I can trade with the people that, like yourself, do not get fooled by speculators and all round "scumbags" that make a profit out of trading bitcoins, pretty much making these more valuable for everyone else, by the way...Yes, scammers and copycats will come and hurt everyone. Yes, not so honest hyip schemes will appear and steal people out of their coins. That's just a sign that bitcoins are now interesting enough for that to happen and that's positive I guess. And, frankly, where else do you get someone to ask people to invest in their ponzi scheme by calling the thread "just another stupid pyramid scheme"? Honesty to the extreme!So, in the spirit of disclosure, I developed the lottery site, out of the need to have some excuse to try the bitcoin client in a service environment. I'm not a die hard gambler, I'm more the type that loves to gamble because I'm always thinking about a way to beat the house, and I know I consistently fail. Heck, even when I'm the house I end up loosing money I think you are crying wolf too soon in the game. This is a small community that actually plays very well with each other. Yes, everyone has their own opinion about pretty much everything and we all have a lot to learn from each other. Your questions are not without a reason, I'm sure, but it sounds like you are being judgmental and, frankly, that usually just backfires. I'm lucky enough to not have to tinker with windows anymore, but assuming hardware is functioning correctly my first actions would be to check if windows didn't switch users or something. Do a full disk search for files called wallet.dat as you might find more than one  I have no real knowledge on either gift cards or credit card fraud (thankfully  ) but I'd assume that you could also ask for the gift card to be bought a few days in advance of the trade (they are dated, right?). Maybe 7 days would be safe to assume a stolen credit card transaction would be disputed... There is already, rpc method 'backupwallet'. PM and coins sent. Unless, of course, you have lots of computing power at your disposal and are planning to use it to overpower the network... that being the case you would try to argue as best you could that the "feature" is really needed, and not really a vulnerability.... oh, wait ...
Common sense doesn't come cheap, and that little pair of words has very different semantics value for different people. I don't know anything about Austrian economics, so I didn't find it funny nor offensive.I do, however, try hard not to be part of any 'group'. I find no particular group fits my exact thoughts or feelings because there are, you know, other people with opinions in them. Taking offense because a joke was publicly made referencing whatever group you consider yourself to be part of is slightly immature, but saying so out loud sounds like you are not completely comfortable with your beliefs and feel the need to justify yourself.There, I can derail a thread too! :pPS: None of the above describes my own thoughts or ideas, at least not anymore. I tend to change my mind a lot. Maybe the smiley made it look as if I was joking. I'm not. It looks like boobs* nelisky tilts head  One word? Boobs! Now if that's positive or not comes down to personal taste  "PayPal sucks. Bitcoin sucks less." by several orders of magnitude and then a little more.15 words. I really think he (she?) wants to buy my house... still no PMs though... Am I going to get the first bid for the house? No PMs yet...  That is exactly like my ring! Well, I guess I almost scammed someone  Great catch, ribuck, thanks for saving me the awkward situation. Well, I actually found it on the ground, though not in Paris. But the description fits that bill perfectly, it is too big even for me, and I'm not the smallish type. So all bids are off until I get this analysed, ok? Hard coded to 21M, we're at 4.43 right now.I didn't put photos on purpose. They will be provided to real prospective buyers with good reputation  Ya know, privacy paranoid. I will try and come up with a few that don't give too much on the exact location though. I don't think I could trust a spike in the price as basis for negotiating. If you would do that and a week passed, bcm and mtgox both had solid volume on that price range, sure.Also, according to the values you provide you would be paying 2.5x what I requested originally, which obviously gave me a buffer to work with, but I would have to see how the markets reacted for a few days before accepting, I guess. It's great for fishing! You get a seat by the lake with 1Kg fish in it  But you'll have to discuss that with whoever buys the house. I believe that was just for my own advantage, as I explained that I had absolutely no clue as to the worth of this ring. I appreciate the information, but that doesn't change the fact that this ring has no value to me other than getting some coins for it. I wouldn't sell it for money, as the simple effort of going to a pawn shop would offset any profit I'd make out of it, but here I can add a little bit to the btc ecosystem *and* gain a few coins.Highest bidder takes it, I don't have any reserve price whatsoever other than making sure I don't loose money when mailing it and France is ok, as is any other country that the post office will ship to. Wow, and here I was questioning if it was worth the shipping  What kind of tests should I do? Do I need to take it to a jewelry store and ask, or is there something I can do at home?As for the end, you seem to be the only immediately interested party... how about till next Tuesday, noon GMT? I'll have to hit the post office that afternoon so it seems like a good target. When the bids stop? Say 24h without any bids? Or would you rather have a specific date, or even a block like that new trend? So this is a ring I found a few years ago, and has been sitting around. It is quite big, there is no shininess about it but I'm pretty sure it's gold  In the pictures below you can see it and the inscription on the inside which, as far as I can make out, says '750' '18k'. I don't have a precision scale but on the kitchen digital scale, which should be good to the gram, it weights 10g.I will sell to the highest bid, postage included in the bid please. I can send it registered for about 35btc, so why don't we start there? I have absolutely no idea how much the ring is worth, so if you are knowledgeable on this, you might get yourself a sweet deal! Well, for 1.5K no, I'm not serious at all  It's not an auction because I will not sell for less than what I paid for, which is what I advertised. I am dead serious about selling it, though, as it is on the market already.I do not know if I will sell it for bitcoins, because right now it is very hard to convert them to cash even for small amounts, and I will need the cash. I could be persuaded to do part bitcoins though, and even all bitcoins if the market trend continues in the upward direction, but you are right, this is just a discussion starter, not (yet) an actual proposal. I meant if you were only taking the bids during the 10 blocks that precede the 90k. It might end up at unusable hours for some, like 9am  So I have a house on the market... it's in southern Brazil, near Joinville, about 500 Km south of São Paulo. It's a spacious 2 bedroom house (with 3 bathrooms, go figure) and has a detached house to rebuild, a place for the car and bbq and washing machines as an annex, has almost 10000 square meters of land, a lake, etc.Would you buy a house for Bitcoins? Is it too early in the game? I haven't spoken to the missy's about that, obviously, but if there was real interest (from someone with enough coins) I would certainly be game ~500k coins is the direct dollar to bitcoin conversion, but I'd probably want a little extra margin, for the risk (and because I will need to eventually cash in those coins, and fees for these amounts are a pain)So folks, is there a market this big already?.EDIT: Proposals using bitcoins, money and other commodities and currencies will be considered, but bitcoins should always be there, if modestly so  I never understood the online auction thing, especially when people bid early and often... I thing advertising way in advance is a great thing, very much needed, but shouldn't the auction be more of "between blocks 89990 and 90000 (about one hour)"?Of course timezone differences may become a problem for some so a 12 hour period is probably a good idea...
Now try to make a hat out of Bitcoins  I have mentioned this personally, as others before and after: We need to be able to import private keys into the running bitcoin process. This way you have your own bitcoin process, your wallet already there. You import the keys and the coins are yours. This does nothing to prevent double spending, of course, but make it really simple to transfer coins physically using usb keys or emails or whatever.To prevent double spending, the import method would automatically transfer the coins in that key to a new bitcoin address from your pool. If it confirms, good, if not someone scammed someone, and you'll be playing the role of the latter  Well, yeah, the way society is wired now... but you should be able to not follow law, assuming you don't break it, so here it should be unlawful to entice minors to gamble, but if they do, well, tough.But we don't put responsability in people, which is why we have laws and courts. We just don't trust people's good will or common sense. Yeah, some are crooks, but why do we all live under the assumption we are crooks?while we're on politics, why not touch religion?  Do god fearing people really need a priest saying they should not steal? C'mon! isn't that just common sense? No, because if they do steal there's a punishment. So stealing is not something one shouldn't do, but rather something you pay for if you do... as most good things are. It's the fact that it is law, and that people thing that's just what it is "in everyone's best interest" that puzzles me. I don't want to break the law, I don't have an issue with having the notice, it's the fact that people feel the notice is needed that shows the current state of afairs  Yes please! But I can't wait... cannot hold it any longer...What do warnings do for the user? Absolutely nothing! "No, officer, I didn't see the NO STEALING sign, or I wouldn't have gone for the cash register".What do warnings do anyway? They serve as 'insurance' for those who don't want to take responsibility, like parents. Yes, I caught my son watching porn and the damn site didn't have a 18 year + warning, or I'm sure he wouldn't have clicked on it... ?It's very late, I might have failed to express my feelings on this, but any kind of censorship is bad, disguise it as you wish. And I know, terrorists, child porn, you name your excuse for controlling everything and everyone, but I just feel that the flip side of the current censorship and control situation is much worse than what they say they want to avoid  And you fill in the 'they' placeholders with whatever form of government you have where you live, it's pretty much all the same everywhere.There, I said it, now off to bed. Yeah, I'm already running multiple processes, but not one per client, rather one per service. It's not practical at all, keeping the ports under control, had to create bitcoind wrappers for each one of these or it was total hell.I just don't see this scaling to one process per client, even if you don't have a huge number of clients. I can translate. Just post or PM and I'll have it in English for all. I have decided long ago against automatic transfer, as a simple software bug could get me in a tight corner, and this system allows me to have a buffer of control. Still, if enough interest exists in this, I can add the option. What humans are you talking about? We have had to struggle throughout the generations, sure, for survival, yes. But don't confuse that with being 'evil'. Societies have always struggled to keep their keens safe, and while the concept of 'society' is a little too wide, and may mean the world, a country, a town or a home, the basic thing here is that all the 'evil doing' that is hardwired on our DNAs is actually just survival instinct.We have, however, learned to be self conscious of our belongings to a point we not only have no desire to share them, but we actually want to take everyone elses. But this is a new thing, a taught thing, not hardwired in any way, in my opinion. I hold no degree in evolutionary theories, and I pride myself of being very much unaware of all that goes around in the world as a whole, but I do know that if it wasn't for the 'bottom line' people would do their best to have their surroundings prosper, as that would make them prosper too, and it has been that way for a long time, but somehow, with democracy as a form of control, laws that are not chosen nor vetoed by the people, currencies that serve no purpose but to control wealth and monitor habits, it just got lost along the way.Now, having said all that I must add that I don't have a viable alternative, hence I don't 'struggle the system'. I live in my own system as much as I possibly can, and feel very good about it. Bitcoins were a wonderful addition to said personal system, along with all the new knowledge I've been acquiring on the fora. No, no. Please disregard bitcoinex completely. I have done it and I can assure you it works! There is, however, a small change that you need to do there, and I'm available to share that with you for 100k coins or it's dollar counterpart. It's a great deal, if you think about it, as you will not have to pay electricity again, and you can even mine for the coins and get your money back in no time!Just send me the coins/$ and I'll be sure to fedex you all the diagrams to help you on this endeavor!... I can try and help, but I need more details.PM me your bcin, at least, and tell me if you mean the lottery or some bitpick Just a quick note to say that The pick6 has been awarded to whomever had a bet on b1be69 with a total pot of 2250 BTC.That's US$216 on mtgox, but who cares about non p2p currencies, anyway?  Just a quick note to say that The pick6 has been awarded to whomever had a bet on b1be69 with a total pot of 2250 BTC.That's US$216 on mtgox, but who cares about non p2p currencies, anyway?  Transaction done, if anyone's interested. I used personal transfer and got charged 1% from paypal. jgarzik received the amout as described on my send page. It's been a while since I last worked on this, but I have compiled on OSX, against revision 156 and the osx makefile changes are on the patch a few messages above. You will probably need to change the paths to the libs, but should be fairly simple to do so. Not personally interested, but that is a great idea! Maybe mtgox could get a small fee for the escrow service? He would assert the one sending USD out that he had received USDs from the other party, so it was safe for actual US$ to change hands. Just a thought... If that was true, then everyone was free to do as they felt would most benefit them, be happy about it and it would be incredibly hard to control them. I mean, we would have to come up with religions and governments and, if all that failed, we would even need a way to control what they could own or trade, so as to force them to comply to a set of rules made up by some institution we would have to create just to make up those rules...oh... wait...  Yes, you are right, I've used an up to date exchange rate now and ended up with .098 USD. Pardon my nitpicking Want to try a smallish amount, say 100 coins so we can assert that doing this using PP balance doesn't charge fees? I'm assuming yours is a personal account. PM me your PP address and I'll ship the  and respond with a BC address. I may take you up on that, but if this is an experiment you have interest on, maybe the price should be somewhat lower than the USD counterparts there? Although it is US only, afaict, if someone is willing to accept PP from us not US based but with good rep (or wire, but I'm assuming 0% fee personal PP transfer from PP balance) and convert to this with a fee, or the other way around, I'm certainly interested in seeing it supported.
Just letting everyone know I've put a cuda and opencl capable GPU on biddingpond. It's not a high end card, but it will do about 6x what my overclocked quad core can put out. Yes, I will keep calling backupwallet regularly regardless, but how often do I do it? That's the answer this whole thing will be able to provide, as it's not a static thing. I can then check every minute but backup every day, unless I hit a peak usage and have to put an intermediate backup. And if these happen a few times in a row, I'll adjust the auto backup time frame. You obviously understand that from the software perspective, the two approaches are different, right? Having a fixed trigger to backup is very easy and can be completely stateless, but backup every X whatevers means keeping a running count, harder to get redundant work with redundant data, etc.That's why I like simple, the kiss approach, within limits. The perfect approach for me would be manual triggering of key pool refilling, because that way the backup agent makes sure that there are enough keys from the last backup and, failing that, generates a new (variable size based on the average needed in the past) batch. This is very simple on the bitcoind side and very powerful for me.I just need a way to know if the addresses on the wallet are covered by the last backup, and if there are still leftover addresses in the wallet, without depending on running counts and persistent data not stored in bitcoin directly. So, 100 transactions from now and I'm in the same exact backup problem. It just moves the safety zone into the future "backup now and you'll be safe for X time" X being really small in a very busy service.Is it possible to have hysteresis in the pool? once it reaches 20 it generates the other 80, or something or the kind? That and getfreekeys on the rpc side and I can make sure I don't need to do backups for every transaction, I don't need to do backups based on time and I'm 100% safe. Or I can do time based pooled backup and be 99% safe.Even better, hysteresis as described and after every time the server generates new keys for the pool, it does a wallet backup with time signature. My backup job can simply detect new files as save them, a simple rsync would do the job in a guaranteed safe way. It is all a question of time... values have changed through time, but every time they changed a post was made, and for now you'll just have to parse the whole thread But I'm confused; bitpicks are winner takes all, as explained in the instructions page. You mean the lottery draws, right? No opinions whatsoever? Then it's settled, only for block 86000 instead. Let me put this clearly:The draw for block 86000 will be paying the full pot to whatever prizes are awarded. No first prize rollover on this one.Also note thatThe next draw, for block 86500, will get primed with the side pot, at 408.11, but that one will be running under the common rules of first prize rollover.This, assuming the never tested in production rollover prevention and side pot priming code is working as it should  That was my thought exactly. I sent them an email: That's true, but also true is the fact that if I needed to get my cash out, quickly, my only option right now was to buy overinflated coins and sell them elsewhere... I'm guessing S3052 has some of those coins to sell  You mean unbalanced like it is now? Or was it a coincidence that the price increase of BTC on mtgox neatly matched the moment withdrawal became impossible in any other way except for bitcoins? How's that for an unbalanced system, pretty young and so vulnerable? How about you open a side PP account to allow withdrawal, but not funding? I mean, I'm not going to be buying any bitcoins anytime soon on mtgox, as obviously the no withdrawal situation is getting the price sky high, and I have a couple dollars there I could use somewhere else. So you don't get the money locked out you could accept PMs from people wanting to withdraw and you'd fund the account just enough for that?I mean, not having a way to move US$ in and out of mtgox is a pain, but having the $ help hostage is, well, a bigger pain (I'm not in the mood for cursing right now  ). And if people want to trade in mtgox while you search hi and lo for the ultimate payment processor (tm) they can buy a few coins personally on the forum or on biddingpond (funny how noone did that yet, "I have $100 to sell, bidding starts and 500 BTC" sorta thing), move that to mtgox and trade away.  I would happily bid, but all my US$ are on mtgox  Dear betting friends,The last draw had no winners, second time that happens. And the side pot is larger than the average pot now so, time for a guaranteed jackpot? What this means is:- All the prizes, including 1st prize, are merged down if they have no winners, nothing gets moved to the next draw.- Side pot is emptied and added to the pot of the next draw.You guys up for it? I was thinking the running draw would be a jackpot (that's for block 85500), but can also do for 86000 if you want time to collect all the bitcoins you can get to bet  This really, I mean *really* looks great, thanks for sharing! Now, if they'd allow direct transfer to another registered user account, using the same currency, mtgox would have a great payment processor for people around the world in all currencies to transfer money in and out using bank accounts (i.e. zero chargeback) That's what keeps exchanges from thriving, I guess. Buying and selling stuff with bitcoins is, at most, tax fraud *if* it does not get reported to the IRS. Same as buying and selling using US$ for what that's worth.But exchanging money in an untraceable way for bitcoins, and then back, is kind of a big bright shiny red arrow pointing at the exchange service. I, myself, believe there's no such thing as "money laundering", only money that taxes weren't collected upon, but that's not the point.What can I, if opening a small exchange, do to prevent being mistaken for a money launderer and still keep the anonymous part of the deal? I mean, tax-wise, I'm more than happy to report as profit all the local currency profit I make, and even report on the size of my bitcoin stash (though as a non regulated commodity, there's no way to accurately correlate their value to local currency). But how can I keep away from liability, if the service I charge for is used for doing unlawful stuff and I don't report on the color of underwear of everyone trading on my exchange?Sorry for stealing the thread, feel free to tell me off  I don't think I fancy the comparison used. Bitcoins and sand, sounds like negative connotation... Let me try and fix that: I don't usually step into these discussions where I don't have anything of value to add, except to make smart ass remarks and take a shot at sarcasm, but c'mon guys, what's with this call to violence? You begin to sound just like the government: we can't outsmart them or we simply don't bother to try at all, so what else can we do? Oh, right, BOMB THEM.I'm not here to judge, nor do I have the moral to do it, but just my 2 bitcents here, can we not create a honeypot scenario and scam the scammers? I know there's a test network  So here's what I propose:- Lets come up with a legit looking exchange- Get some bogus volume going- Get the money stolen by the scammers on our pockets, along with the credit card details so we can give it back- Log ips, try to get into their machines, etcI can code something up, if there's people up for the design part. Also, we need to find a way to keep legit users at bay. Ah, yes, and there's no telling if mtgox and johnyrich didn't do that already... hehe Good for you!What was it you did again? You got everything correct, but left out the part where everyone else is a little richer after that (except for you). Bitcoins are very divisible and thus the 21M is just the number of coins, but put 8 decimal places on top of that and the "unit of currency" is a lot larger. I can get a bitcoind service going in no time:- You get one bitcoin server with a wallet- The wallet gets backup up every... hour? Or I can be smart and backup when new inbound addresses exist.- You get to use it in an rpc port (not the default) probably only responding to specific IP addresses- You can request physical backups sent to you periodically- The bitcoind gets updated with security patches- Includes (at least) getblock / listtransactions / rpcport patches, can include others by requestBut you'll need to run your service against a specific port to talk to bitcoin, and you have to trust me Is there interest in this? How much would you pay for it, knowing physical backups will be paid separately?
Please, do put it up regardless... some of us are not in the US  (though I understand you need to know what to say in the auction) <shamelessplug>You can also ask TTBit to get that on bitcoinsportsbook</shamelessplug> Much appreciated, this feature will be Now, is there/will there be a way to know how many free keys are in the pool at some moment in time, and trigger generation of a new pool of addresses in a determined time point?The idea is to be able to schedule backups when new adresses are going to be generated, and to never use an address not already in a backup. These keys will be used for both change and new addresses, correct?Thank you! I'm pretty sure that was a sw glitch though, as I and a lot of others had open orders to buy way over 0.01 and nothing got sold. As I understand it if someone was selling for 1c they would get served with the bids above that first. So, what happens if the scam is for real? The exchanges are being paid with transfers, but their accounts get frozen thus they don't have the funds to pay others? Coins being transfered out are transfered out, period, so the scammer buying bitcoins gets to keep them.What about the rest of us, who have sold? Is bce/mtgox going to get ahold of the US$ in our accounts?I feel a love song coming...  Please, do share some hw details  Yeah, been there, tried that. Turns out I kick started a cuda version that got embraced by eurekafag, which was pretty cool. But make no mistake, every time someone builds a slightly better version, the tendency is to keep it to themselves, unless they lack the hardware to use it to their own profit. Which accounts for the rest of us, I guess Anyway, I've been moving my attention elsewhere as the amount of interest I got from the community to pursue this was so small I feel I'm just doing this for myself. Which is fine, except I have other things I'd rather do right now.But if someone preps up a clean implementation against the default client I'll certainly help with all I learned in cuda (and to a lesser extent in opencl) and be a very avid tested! What planet do you come from, does it get cold there during the winter and don't you have other heating means, ones that don't include getting CPUs to 100% continuosly?Also, while on the subject, are you planning to rule the earth all by yourself or do we get to apply for sidekick? There's always some benefit to multiple time point backups. You might have bad ram in the computer and one of the backups is corrupted, same goes for hard drive or even just a slightly loose cable. But for the most part, assuming all goes well, the latest backup does invalidate older ones.Now, don't feel too safe because you have one backup, even 100 of them, on the same physical location. Same computer is asking for trouble, same house is calculated risk. Better to make a daily or so backup to an external storage service. It's always about balance; how much do you keep in the wallet, how often you do transactions, what would it cost you to loose such wallet.I don't see any technical reason to not do so that way. Other may think differently, but from the top of my head there's nothing preventing that. It would, however, create a very simple path to follow and find you, and while this may not present an issue to you personally, if your address is compromised there's a good chance the receiver is also traceable now. I'm paranoid, you probably aren't, so my opinion is highly biased  Trust. Or lack thereof. And that comes with a price apparently  Mail the physical letters? Sure, I can do that. Not as inexpensive as your in-country mails, but still much cheaper than the AUS to EUR alternative.Now, the problem I see is with translating the letters. I can do Portuguese, I know there are Italian and spanish speaking members around and, of course, Russian too, so lets get some templates going  Wow, there's an idea worth exploring! What proof of work could we use? Murder seems fitting, what about selfless generosity? Even harder to come by  I do not know Satoshi or what type or person he is. Heck, I don't even know if he is a person  I do believe that at the very least he has that sarcastic smile (if his physical existence, having on, so allows) every time he reads about how he's out to save the world from the bad guys or rather out to be the baddest of these guys.In his position, I would milk this to the limit, and would hold back on responding for as long as there were witty remarks. Even better, leave that to be answered on his autobiography, which you will only be able to buy using bitcoins. I fully understand that, I know what it means to be in pre launch mode, but I'm just collecting the pieces... why the surveys to keep the account active? And more to the point, why only webdevelopers are available for feedback from early birds? Just makes no sense to me, really, but I'm a known and registered paranoid, guess I could be searching for something to complain about. Hmm, why does this look like a scam to get you to fill surveys and they get paid for it? I mean, $50 for anyone + $5 a day + $5 per referrel *but* the $ does not mean dollar, it is just a virtual representation of nothing. Sure, bitcoins are nothing too, but these guys do specify you can't exchange these for anything, nor will you be able to anytime soon. Also, they have web developers on call if something is messy with the site, but no code developer to help if the internal transfer is not working? wtf? Are they not in development? There's a lot more than GFlops to this equation. Memory bandwidth, for one, will be very important. Yeah, I'm struggling with how OpenCL compiles kernels and the impact of the work size on performance. It is quite counter intuitive coming from CUDA, as the unrolling of loops and functions actually makes performance worse, as the kernel needs more space. I don't have any numbers for that ATI, but the 4350 seems to be a LOT less performant than the 5870, so it might not be that low.Once I have hardware to test this for real, I'll compare my approach to this one, so we can learn from each other. The difficulty isn't set by time, but by block count, so yeah, it would go sky high within the 2 first months making this pretty much impossible to scale... you would still get the whole of the generation capacity of the network, though, so as long as you can pay for the servers with ~200k coins, you are golden... but if you try to sell the coins to get US$, you'll be loosing value, so it's kind of chicken and egg, I guess. There, fixed it for you It will work for the first month, then you get 3 or four of these US$1k/month machinery going after the same thing, but difficulty needs to creep in and even the playfield. So after the dust settles you will have made a buck, a bunch of them actually, but once we're back to 6 blocks/hour we're in the 220k~250k coins generation per month, which nets you US$15k. Very nice, it you don't sell the coins... and there aren't a bunch of people doing it. License plate with BC address: +1, we don't have the customized plates here, and I don't think it's legal to add anything resembling a license plate, but it still is pretty cool As for paying your toll with bitcoins, how would they be able to subtract the coins from you, based on your address? Unless it's a service mybitcoin provides...
You know, I think it doesn't really work like that... I've been slowly generating with a 1MH/s machine, regardless of difficulty. It helps (a lot) to have the power, but luck is always part of it  Forgive me for being an ass, but if you guys do this, there will be someone else who will think "I want a cut, but not share it" and do this too, and probably a 3rd one will emerge, and my gut feeling is that there isn't enough to share amongst everyone. We will be generating 50x the notmal amount and, while difficulty updates are capped, it is sure to throw many more coins on the market than we expect. And you guys see the inherent value of bitcoins, but others will not and just sell all they generate on the spot (on the month bill cycle, probably) at whatever price they get. Great for buying, but still...Having said all this, I'm in for $50 too, and can create an automated manager, but I lack the time right now. Ok, Sunday is here and I think that I'm just going to let this sit for now. USD/EUR exchange is not favorable for me and the offers aren't that high so I'm going to do this step by step instead of just throwing myself head first. I have bought nVidia card for my development desktop, which will help me both dig into OpenCL and have a better notion of how to work with a more common (i.e. non laptop) setup.I'll use the very generous donation I got to help in that, but will just put my own money for the rest (FYI a great deal, I believe; 65/$90 for a GTS250, in the box as new). I will then buy the new MoBo and an ATI card, but sometime in the future.Thanks for the offers, though, I really appreciate it. I think you are asking for trouble The correct way would be to add an rpc call to backupwallet (which is supported from 0.3.12) passing a file path, and then do the gpg/sftp dance on that file. It might require you to, if running a GUI, start the program with the -server switch, though. Yeah, I'm careful with the wallets I play with, but there is a very low statistical probability that I loose 9000 coins anyway... Summing all my wallets I have ~2600  A hacker by heart and trade And no, from my personal experience I never managed to break a wallet using satoshi's deploys... but then again I'm not using them all that often. I broke my own wallet, my fault, nothing to see here! Yes, that is one of my biggest concerns. I don't have enough exposure to assert in multiple platforms / hw. And I have failed to provide a simple click and use distributable, as of yet, but as interest increases and more developers tackle this I'm sure one of us will provide a clean implementation that is production quality for satoshi. Amazing solution! Not good for the masses (it's better to integrate the miner in the binary) but great for experimentation and multiple machine mining. I'll be sure to have a go at this when I get a sec, kudos for putting this out. Generation will be less and less interesting in that way, as the coins per block will divide by 2 until there's no coins generated at all, and the system will need to be run by "volunteers", which aren't really volunteers because if no block is generated no coins can be transfered, thus removing all value from all coins...I think it's an arms wrestle to try to avoid having a few people holding most of the coins, that's all. I was trying to leverage that by making everyone have a fair chance at getting coins while they are still being generated, but I fear that it is not practical.. When it comes to currencies (and I don't want to get into a semantics discussion, humour me with 'currency') people are just wired in a very egotistic way, and even when offered the chance to balance the scoreboard, they will just try and use that to their own advantage, not everyone's... it saddens me, really, but hey I'll keep on doing what I do because I strongly believe in it, just as others believe in taking the largest slice. I was under the impression that coin generation was a way to make sure everyone had a fair chance of putting effort against coins, thus avoiding any central committee of deciding the future of bitcoins. Decentralized is the word, I believe...But I get it, if you put the time and money into getting better miners, you should be able to keep it to yourself, so the 4way patch should never had been merged into mainline, as its creator would have 2x+ performance over the same machine running common clients.I have to disagree here. Yes, competition is good and valuable, and people should not get into bitcoins for the mining alone, but if you let a small subset of people hold most of the future generated coins you are putting the whole project in danger of abuse and destruction... but I may be overreacting.I'll be glad to stop posting code, buy some serious hw and just do the generation myself. As difficulty goes up and people stop generating, this gets more and more statistically interesting... you say I should, right? Duly noted. I'll certainly consider that as I move on. I do think that OpenCL is the way to go, I'm really just not seeing enough interest in it other than a selected few. As a matter of fact, I'm not seeing much interest in the whole GPU mining, awkwardly enough. It is, for me, a question of what I can best do with my time, as I have very little of it, but every now and then I take a stab at OpenCL, so I'm moving that way already!I think puddinpop was working on opencl already, so maybe he'll just beat me to it. I won't share my technical view of his approach here, that has been done elsewhere already, but if you are satisfied with his code, maybe we should just bump his thread and ask for updates? My pleasure, really. But in all fairness, it is not true I don't get both appreciation and donations. What happens is the folks that do support me do so in a very altruistic way, as in "that sounds great for the community, keep it up" kind of way. These helping members do not have, to the best of my knowledge, any particular interest in the work I do, just think it helps everyone out.The ones that have the hardware to take advantage of this, if they do exist, keep very, very silent  Have done, actually. There is working (and generating) code already available here. It is known to work on OSX 10.6 (my dev environment) and linux (myself on ubuntu 10.04 and the Russian folks I'm not sure what OS).The mentioned thread is a request for help in pursuing this, which I will with or without said help so you can safely ignore and still have a go at the outcome. The difference will be the amount of effort I put in this and thus the time to completion.I'd also be happy to have someone else pick up the code too, but I fear all that have done so already are generating on their own, not giving anything back. The complete lack of developer feedback seems to point that way, at least. But, hey, we're only human, and we were taught to take advantage of the situation everytime we can, I understand. I'm just trying to teach my kids otherwise, by showing them being generous can work too  Pooled generation: +1Add more hash functions... how would this balance the generation? People with better hw would still generate more, in all hash functions. Maybe not GPU / massive parallel, but any problem more/better hardware can't help resolve is probably out of general user's boundaries.GPU and unfairness. Realize that the hardware needed to stand a chance of generating isn't all that cutting edge or expensive. Any mid-level gamer machine has the engine to put out 20 or 30 million hashes/sec, at least. The real issue is software, as this gives the owner of such software a huge advantage for a very small price, thus people will obviously take advantage of this as long as possible.I feel stupid, really. I could put a little more money/effort into this, say nothing about it, and generate away. Instead here I am with my sense of community duty and such... damn, I'll never get rich this way If you feel strongly as to the need for fairness, why don't you Help the little ol CUDA developer? It finally happened, I have corrupted my wallet file beyond any hope. Good thing I only spare change there Anyway, no more nelisky on the list, please! no reason sending the coins to nowhere at all. As soon as I make a little sense out of my 10+ bitcoin clients running with different wallets and versions I'll post a new address. And I'm running behind too, I owe you guys 6 payments already... That's the exact problem, I'm not in the states I don't even need a GPU, I've got a mac, and a very modest cuda enabled laptop running linux. The thing is, there are multiple things I want to achieve:- Proper hw detection, need to get a completely different platform (even though I'm only working on CUDA currently). I have my mining machine all set up, a good quad core, 6GB of ram, lots of hard drive and all my linux dev environment. What it lacks? A CUDA/OpenCL GPU- Proper tuning functions, as simple config changes yield a huge difference. But manually recompiling sucks, and I end up tuning to the one card I'm developing for.- Multiple card support. This is really important to scale. Unfortunately my motherboard supports a single PCI-e x16 interface, I need to get another one for two (that's 75 for a used one, at least)- OpenCL I can do even on nvidia only, but I'd sure like to get this running on ATIs. But as it stands, doing OpenCL means redoing a lot of work, and frankly I don't own a single ATI card, and while some community members offered to send me some, it always gets dropped half way through.My current plan is to get a dual pci-e mobo and a couple of fairly good nvidia cards, aiming at one 8800GTX for 85 and a GTS250 for 60, that's current bid, we'll see how high it gets. Add S&H of about 10 for each and you have my $400 plan (including paypal's fees for EUR exchange).But I could be convinced to tackle the opencl path, if there are enough people interested. It is really not a question of money, but rather of time to market. The cuda I have done, and needs some TLC to be widely used, whereas the opencl will take a fair amount of time to be usable, and on top of that I just need the cuda. But hey, I will do opencl sooner or later, that's for sure! I might even get myself a 5770 just to force myself into doing it!Please do not send any hw from the states, it will get stopped at customs and I'll have to pay the ridiculous fees that usually are higher than the cost of the hw. Not to mention it takes 5 weeks to receive the damn packages Everyone: I'm not trying to rip people off, I'm loosing a LOT of income by dedicating time to this, but only because I feel it is worth it. Having said that, if anyone wants to donate a high-end tesla GPU I will not refuse :p I have received an anonymous donation from a forum member, a wooping $50. So $350 is my current target, maybe even less if I don't get outbid on some local auctions  Heh, yeah, lots of money to be made on the lottery. Anyone wants to buy me out? I'd disclose the total profit I made so far but... I' ashamed to admit it And I do have a lot of coins bet on the pick6, a grand total of 121. I gotta say, don't know what I'll do with all these coins, they're burning my crypto pockets!Anyway, the code is actually not worth much to any individual alone, unless it is kept closed as it has been by some fellow members of the community. What I'm trying to achieve is effectively neutralize the value of that code for the benefit of the community as a whole. It sounds a bit lame, saying out loud, but the simple fact remains; as difficulty increases the generation becomes much more valuable to the few that have the mega crunchers, and a money pit for everyone else. Doesn't feel right... Oh, well, thanks again  Boy, you're fast... Any chance of getting a patch against the vanilla svn? I have a heavily tweaked code base (cuda and a collection of patches).
Hmmm, that's an interesting concept... I don't really like futures negotiation, it's not in my culture if you will. But the thing that I wonder about is how to actually control that, I mean, I know I'm honest but if between now and Xmas I don't generate a single coin (unlikely but still a statistical possibility) what would happen then? I'm doing this because it's a lot of fun for me, I love the challenge, and I'm not trying to cut any profit, but while it is really hard to establish an honest reputation it takes little more that a little misunderstanding to be stuck with a dishonest one.I'm open to such an agreement but only under the understanding that things may go sideways, I may have to stop working on this (though I already have a good part of the work done and disclosed) and I'm not going to take this as some kind of contract binding me to do this by a set date...And as for generation, yes I hope to generate much more, based on my current stats. Donations I expect at least 10 times what I got so far with the CUDA code I've provided, which roughly adds up to... 0.0000  That is why I'm trying to sell the coins, man. Well, I want to continue to pursue this CUDA thing, but funds to diverge to that are scarce, so I thought I'd try and get a little help from the community, in the form of an auction of sorts.I need to spend something around US$400 on hardware, which I will anyway, but in an attempt to reduce the impact of that in my very own personal economy, here's what I though; I have 2000 BTCs that I'll part of (though reluctantly) to help on paying for things, which at mtgox would net me ~US$120... very far from the target. Would you like to buy some, at a higher than market rate? I'll take paypal transfers for whatever amount you care to buy, assuming you are the highest bidder.If there are no takers, no problem, I'll work on this still and will release all my work MIT licensed just like bitcoin client. If I get more than I ask for, I'll even develop an opencl version for all you ATI users out there. If I get less or just enough, I'll polish the CUDA version I have so it detects cards and works with more than one if available, so you can build your very own Tesla based super bitcoin miner 20 blocks of 100 coins, from here to Sunday, place your bid for nr of blocks and price per block! Obviously I'll also take coins as donation, but I will not give anyone earlier access to code, or any of that, and I do no promises as to how much time I'll be able to dedicate to this, of course. Kudos to you!I will have to find the time to merge this into my private version, but this opens a whole new world of possibilities to me, in terms of code organization mainly. Thank you!Yesterday I've built on linux for the first time (I don't do GUI though) and it was a breeze. So anyone that has a cuda enabled device but doesn't want to use eurekafag's binary should have no trouble getting it compiled, but if you can't/won't, then major kudos to eurekafag for putting this out. Sorry for the english request on the russian lists, but if people are using my patch I would really appreciate all feedback you could give, and patches to make it work in other OSs. Please post comments that might be of use to the community in general in the original english thread if at all possible.Thanks! Why did you loose interest? That should get the discussion started. Also, what is it you were looking for in bitcoin that you need an alternative for?I use bitcoin because I'm very interested in a 'deal facilitator'/commodity/whatchacallit that is not centrally controlled, thus not regulated by a single entity. Sure, someone with a huge amount of coins (artfonz, satoshi) may tilt the balance, but only once if there's enough critical mass to absorb the coin input.What about you? satoshi et al: I have been thinking long and hard about security of the wallet, as I implement other web services that will (I hope) move larger sums of bitcoins. The backup wallet is great, I'm now doing automated backups every time I create a new address, including on sending transactions.But will this scale on a site that sends many transactions? I always have to backup the whole wallet, and that takes addresses, key, transactions, and grows considerably with usage. For more intensive usage I believe either less backup points or better separation of data is needed.The two simple solutions I can think of for this are:1) separate addresses/keys from everything else, so it is easy to do incremental backups or at least limit the backup size to that really needed to recreate the funds in a hardware failure event.2) implement what has been talked as a future feature, the ahead of time creation of address bundles to be used, so one backup of the wallet is good for 1000 future transactions, or something like that2.1) to use this efficiently, one should have the possibility to query how many addresses are still left in the unused pool and request creation of a new batch if needed so backups can be timely created and we drop to 0 the possibility of loosing data between address creation and backupOf course doing both 1) and 2) would be perfect, but can we expect any of the above for a future release? Should we start hacking our own patches? This has been discussed in many other threads, but it might be a good idea to do again, to avoid misunderstandings.The reason, as far as I understand, for the above stated is change. When you send coins, one or more transactions received and emptied, but that may not sum up to the exact transfer amount, so a new inbound transfer is created with the change. This will be a new address for you, and thus not backed up before. Imaging:addr1: 50BTCaddr2: 2.5BTCaddr3: 50000BTCAll this is backed up, now you send 60 to me, and end up with:addr1+addr2+addr3 -> TX (50052.5), broken in  myaddr: 60 (transfered to me)  addr4: 49992.5 (your change)So a new address is automagically created for you, and all your coins put there. This was not in the previous backup, so if you loose this wallet... you are hosed! Can you compile your own bitcoin? The latest svn has an option to allow binding to other interfaces, not just localhost. If not the next version (0.3.13) is supposed to have that. I have added ssl to bitcoinsportsbook.com and you'll all get redirected to https when you visit the site. Let me know of any problems! Hehe, two confirmations take 2 blocks' time. The expected average is 6 blocks per hour, but that doesn't mean there will be one block every 10 minutes, rather difficulty increases every now and then based on the average blocks created in the last iteration.It really is impossible to define a specific timeline, but the client does get almost immediate notice that a transaction is on the way. If it trusts that information blindly and is thus open to double spending attacks, or it waits for as many confirmations as it sees fit depends on you, the developing party, but two blocks in a min or two I don't think I've see so far  I don't get it. So people would buy in to collect the 50 BTCs from each generated block by the "lottery" site? If not, where would the 50 BTCs come from? One of the features inherent to taabl, as I designed it, is to become as insulated from "money" as possible. It deals with bitcoins, and nothing else, because otherwise we are talking about a full blown gambling site subject to whatever laws and regulations exist, and that is one mess I do not want to get into  Are you talking about market regulation on a site level or globally. The latter, to be possible, would imply changes to the protocol and frankly changes that would remove some of the benefits of bitcoins, like the pseudo-anonymity. Is that 'criminals' in the popular sense or do you mean 'the government'...Scratch that, it's as redundant as it gets  Which it is rumored he is... that is, until someone gets GPU mining mainstream. I have volunteered  myself to do it, but I lack the hardware and don't want to put both work and money into this. There has been a couple of members of the forum that have agreed to send me coins for GPUs or the actual GPUs, but in the end, it never happens, so either some coder with time and hardware does it, or artfonz and a few others will hold most of the processing power for some time still. Yeah, it is quite obvious. I suffer for over optimization obsession syndrome  I feel that as data flows only inside the application there's no need to register transactions and put that 'extra load' on the system, but quite frankly the extra load is perfectly ignorable, and the transactions help keep everything tidy. Are you planning to do anything on this regard? I'm sure I can find my way around to do it myself, it will just take time, but I don't want to duplicate any work though. I sure hope all the US based companies are quick to comply, or a new "terrorist threat" will suddenly appear, some country gets bombed and that will serve as justification to force everyone into wanting this because, you know, it's in everyone's best interest, it's the national security that is in stake.That, my friends, is the problem with democratic dictatorships. That is a much better approach, agreed. Assuming one label spans multiple addresses, so a client can accept transactions from an imported priv key (this being discussed on another thread), it seems to fit my needs perfectly, with only one small caveat which is internal transfers; say I use this approach for the lottery users (though that is not my use case, I actually would be more about site separation than user separation, but still):- Each account has on inbound address, annotated with the login label- Every time a user withdraws, I use the sendfrom mechanism you describe- The user hits the jackpot, but the prize is actually held in multiple users' accounts so  a) I need to, when users buy tickets, move the amount to a separate address (forces external transaction, sucks)  b) I leave coins where they are, and then on payout I make a normal sendtoaddress (both external transaction and breaks the label accounting logic)  c) I leave coins where they are, payouts do nothing to the wallet, withdrawals do as many transactions as needed from each user account (what a nightmare!)I don't see any good option here, and the best one, if I'm doing external transactions anyway, is a). I can trust these transactions with 0 blocks confirmed, because I'm both the sender and the recipient, and this would keep the accounts/labels in check, which serves as a great verification to the overall balances. Can you think of any alternative? I'm sure puddinpop has good reasons to not reply to my questions, but it feels weird. It's almost like he has something against me. Do you, puddinpop? Can't we just be friends? Anyhow, no joke, I have generated my first real block using the CUDA miner! Woohoo, 50 coins accounted for, *now* it was all worth it, the sleepless nights, the complaining family due to my lack of attention, everything!If I get another block I may start developing an opencl version, while I'm in profit! That is, if puddinpop didn't make one first and sold it for 20k coins Well put, the standard is certainly needed to move this into mainstream, and source code as documentation sucks. But that is slightly longer, more important goal, not one I will hold off on projects for. I'm sure you agree the standard definition alone will take a good amount of time, especially when people look at it and start saying what if, or wouldn't it be better if... Then we still have to develop standards compliant clients.I'm not saying that effort isn't worth it, much the opposite, it's mandatory for the immediate future. This hack jobs we do are actually a great way to get to know how things are being done, thus gathering any knowledge to help in describing the protocol 
Yep, my views are based on that very notion. I, as an artist, don't work with Free Trade because I've been instilled the notion that it takes an industry to make a living. I never meant to say "I'll steal your music, the one you are selling on the store, and believe I've done good". That's not it at all!What I mean is that I sell music, someone buys my music and lets you take a listen. You like it and make a copy. Do you have to pay for that copy? Better yet, should we put an effort in pursuing and convicting those that make a copy? Is there really a damage done by that copy?Even if we take the step up and, this really depends on the industry but for music, I buy the cd and make copies which I sell for 5BTC a piece. Am I taking food out of the artist's table? Is there really damage done? Morally? sure, I'm making money out of your work, which is pretty much what the music industry as a whole do to the working party, i.e. the actual artists, but they do it legally and with much higher profit margins. On the other side of the table is the number of people the artist's music is not reaching, and you can't sell copies of the emotions of a live concert, so maybe, just maybe these bootleg buying criminals end up actually as a profit for artist?All in all, there are always 6 billion (and counting) views of the same problem, so some form of arbitrage needs to be agreed and clearly disclosed up front. Just the simple fact that I read on the fora so many sentences of the type "But I've already explained" or "you simply don't get it" or even, closer to all of us "Why is this hard to understand?" makes me wonder just that... why is it so hard to understand opinions are just that, and even hard facts, those that you can't possibly disagree with because they are proven being any doubt, reasonable or not, may still be subject to someone else's bias towards not thinking that to be so.What we need is an agreement... and the right to disagree. But I digress so fast it makes me dizzy  I am in to the thug insurance brotherhood regardless of what gets agreed to be "correct" or "legal". These are muddy grounds we are stepping on and one may always need a helping hand sometime. I'll also do my best to lend the helping hand to others involved in the BTC businesses, whenever needed! I don't think FreeMoney meant difficulty going down, but generation power going up. My laptop did 1.4MH/s when I first joined. That same laptop does 7.7 now, so I can handle roughly 6x the difficulty and profit just as much (negatively  ) as I did when difficulty was 6x lower. Thus, for the same actual difficulty level, the difficulty dropped 6x for me. Yep, artists love the spotlight, I know I do in my own way. I don't have any real data to backup this, but I believe that artists will always share, give, offer or otherwise pay for showing their things to other. Making a living as an artist is only for a few selected ones that either are greedy enough to not be full hearted artists in the altruistic sense (not to put any limitation to their art) or have 'rich uncles' (don't know if that expresion works in English too).The latter are to blame for us associating art with money, I believe. They are not artists, they don't create, some are possibly frustrated artists but that should cover it. They are business people and they make (a lot of) money out of other people's willingness to create art for peanuts. So we assume that if we don't pay for what we download, some artist will starve? It's not morally correct to copy that album your friend has that you would otherwise never know about and become a fan of? How would you decide which live shows to go to? You'd let the labels just tell you what's hot? Are you *already* doing it?I think the whole file sharing issue is moot, when it regards to causing damage to the creators of the content (just art, folks, not industrial espionage and the like, that's a different, altogether more spiky subject). We aren't hurting the creators of content, even if we sell their stuff. We're actually helping spread out the word, which is what they pay labels to do anyway. But paperwork, records and statistics is what keeps the very fabric of society in place! Imagine if there was no record of how and where you spend your money, or of who you do business with. Then how could that great parenting institution we call the Government know what is in our best interest to be done, so they can tell us, show us what our best interest is? We would be totally lost without paperwork and pretty much left to our own devices.Just think that you might have to make your own decisions based on your own knowledge and opinions, without having someone telling you what you should do, what would work best for you. You would be lost, man!And the financial institutions, the base stones of our happy lifes? They would not know how to best service our accounts..."Get over here, drop your pants and bend over so we can... *ahem*... service your account!" I have updated taabl to support login usernames. If you don't have one, you can add it in the account page. This means that if you had a password set up you'll need to enter it to log in, so if you forgot it PM me and I'll clear it out, so you can log in and set a new one.Hope this helps making the site more user friendly. Best of luck to all, prizes are accumulating very nicely! Getting more interesting every day. Ha, ok, I misunderstood you. You are correct then, although the mentioned coyotes actually have a business model that depends on borders being heavily guarded. I have a couple of friends that have used these "services" and, believe me, you wouldn't want to subject yourself to it. The survival rate is not all that good..."Bien venido a Tijuana, con el coyote no ai aduana." (the spelling might be wrong)  Yeah, but do it quickly, before you get old and change your mind  I just love how you attach "investment" to "lottery"  Could be, but it's the 'non techs' I am aiming at, and more so the ones using Windows GUI, so shell is not even in their glossary. But even though you may object, humour me. Can this be done? Heh, that is so not true in so many aspects... For a Brazilian individual to visit the States there's visas to take care of and then there's the all common 3rd degree on the walk in. I so understand the reason, as without that the poor savage indians would all flock to the civilized America and steal all the jobs.But I did meet a bunch of North Americans in Brazil, and they really wished they could just drop everything and go live there, and also a few wealthy Brazilians that usually had vacations in Europe, as the US of A made it very clear they were not welcome.I could be biased, though, and only see a small subset of the reality, but then again, so could you :p Need a good backup espace plan, do you?  Almost, but not quite the same thing. A wallet includes the needed information, i.e. the private key, but its format may not be supported by future clients. It is not user friendly, can't do the 'here's a printed QRCode' or 'just open this file in the bitcoin client'Also, the end recipient would have to, as you say, open the new wallet and transfer. This is very non-trivial, especially on GUI clients, and all non technical users would get up and scream in one voice: "Huh?" Yeah, I've been considering how to best go about this for the web services. Right now multiple services on the same machine run multiple clients bound to separate rpc ports. It works... to a point.What I want is a separate wallet per user, and that scales pretty badly, so what I thought could be done is have multiple wallets in memory at the same time, based on some key (which would be the subdir inside the datadir for the wallet) and the rpc calls would take a -wallet= switch. I just don't know how many wallets I would be able to keep in memory at the same time, and I would loose the ability to move money instantly amongst them, but that's ok, I guess.A slightly more scalable alternative would be to lazily load the wallets on demand. I know wallets keep a bunch of information, but maybe we could limit that to own addresses and transactions?Satoshi: are you planning on doing any of this? As I'm not familiar with this part of the code, it would suck to spend a week trying to figure out the best way to do this and then you pushing the perfect implementation to svn  Heh, it's the wrong thread altogether, but I'm not saying I agree with that or any of the other unethical events. What I'm saying is that I believe it is a good thing that the possibility exists, as while it's true we all probably agree some things are out there, completely out of bounds, what happens when we feel very strongly about something but we just feel different things? Who is right?My only line of reasoning is: I don't think we should be imposing moral or creating rules of what should and should not be done with this. If we don't like it, we don't use it. Stay clear of all the things you oppose to, but let others do what they like with their own lifes... so as long as they don't affect negatively the lifes of others, but that's a completely different issue. Receiving wires between EC countries is free (for amounts up to 50k) although this excludes the UK afaik. Sending wires is not, and $10 wouldn't feel outrageous, though my two banks would charge much less, 1.5 and 3 respectively. But a company account for a foreign entity will probably be ruled by totally different values, especially if the account is twinned with another one US based on the same bank.Is there enough need for this? I could probably start something of the kind, assuming people wouldn't mind a small extra on the coin price (I don't have that many, so there would be some brokerage). I could probably offer the transfers, though. Or even better, what do you guys think of AlertPay? Not wanting to step on anyone's toes here, but I like the unethical possibility. Not that I want to start any unethical event prediction, but I do want to be able to do so, if I choose to So, tip-toeing to avoid hurting anyone, this is a really small project, the design is way more challenging than the actual logic, so if there's more interest in this for sociological reasons than just me and Babylon, I can prep something up. I like that idea, I like it a lot! I'll try and give this a go, and we can all do a global geocaching hunt! Yeah, that's kind of what I want. Not the exact thing but a great use for it  I have a new usecase that is somewhat related to this thread... I have multiple bitcoin clients running, on multiple platforms. Specifically, I have one GUI based Mac client that holds addresses I have advertised, and I was trying to get rid of it.The funny thing is that wallet.dat, if just moved to another client (even a custom compiled bitcoind on the same machine) simple refuses to work, screaming at me about corrupted databases and such. There's probably some easy fix for that but, what if I want to take 2 of my addresses out of that wallet and put them on another wallet, or on my mybitcoin account? I can transfer the balance, sure, but say I am receiving donations on that address and can't really ask people to change the address?So what I would like to do is to export the privkey for one address in one wallet and then import it into another wallet. I know it's not implemented, but is it technically doable? I may take a stab at doing this, but just wanted to avoid a wild goose chase. Good people of the bitcoin world, I'll be moving taabl across servers either today or tomorrow, so don't be alarmed if it goes out for a while. It is for everyone's benefit And if you are itching to bet, why dont you [shameless plug mode] try your luck or skillz at bitcoinsportsbook.com?[/shameless plug mode] 
It depends on what us, the programmers, are willing to do. Some of us will require coins for our effort, some of us just need to manage time, I personally am bound by the latter and would appreciate help in getting the hardware to test outside my laptop. I almost got it, but then puddinpop's ransom was paid and everything is good now... isn't it?? :p Consider this; you set  up an account as things are now, and I'll see '1NiXpzvWedn6iu514oLUxhpeF7cagu6Gw Nope, you log in with the address you provided as the one you want withdrawals to be sent to. Did you have a password set? PM me the password (you can later change it) and the bcin (or a list of possibilities) and I'll dig your bcout. hmmm, for testing I would probably get a UART core and feed the half baked hash, the initial nonce and the 256bit min hash value. It would do one set of parallel hash calculations for incrementing nonces and return the nonce with the lowest hash. This would make interfacing with bitcoin pretty easy, especially after svn r154. Hmmm,it depends. Will you know anything that allows me to retrieve that information for you? If you know your bcin it's pretty straightforward, and assuming you didn't loose your wallet.dat (*that* would be pretty bad) you'll have at least one transfer to it. But even without it, if you can give me enough information so that I'm sure it is your account, I can probably get it for you, say you password (of which I only store a digest, obviously) and the amount in your account, as well as the number of tickets you bought on some draw.I think you'd be fine  Would you guys rather have a login/password pair instead? It was just me being paranoid about the anonymous bit that got me to develop things like they are, but that can be changed... I've been meaning to dive into FPGAs for too long now... if there are no takers that have both the hardware and the time/inclination, I can be bribed into doing this in exchange for a dev board donation  I'm just saying...In fact, this could be the start of a company selling bitcoin generators  Just wanted to mention that while the Pick3 hits at least once a day, we've finally had a good pot being given out on the Pick4! If you had bets there, check the site, one of you walked away with 286 coins just now And did you notice the announcement for BitcoinSportsBook.com?  obviously, *ahem* just checking if you were paying attention, that's all  Will transaction fees be applied to transfers above 0.01, but with more precision? I wasn't aware of it being that way.And yes, I am rounding for now, but I like things clean, and I can either allow withdrawal of higher precision amounts, or I can round to 2 decimals the prize handout, I just rather do the former, that's all.And no, it's not *only* for the sportsbook. I have plans...  Hey FreeMoney, sent you a PM. Just thought I would add a little bump here  Hey,So there is another thread asking about bc and decimal places. It is stated that the client(s) only show 2 decimal places, but there are 8 in total. Now, working on stuff, I find that it would be nice if I could transfer at least 4 decimals precision, but the full 8 would be great.Looking at the code it seems simple enough to remove the rounding from bitcoind, but what about the receiving side? If it's a non UI client, then it will show everything, but would I be making things overly confusing for GUI clients?Is there any shortcoming in me patching my client to handle full precision? Now I don't understand you So, how does the above pieces of code not do what you want? You don't need to send coins to check an address, you don't even need bitcoin at all, just the address. And python being very readable you can easily port that to any other language you need and know (yes, including pgplsql, assuming you have the appropriate crypto calls available) Thanks for the heads up. I'm actually checking version on my web apps, to assert if backupwallet is available, but as my private version is now widespread, it should be very simple to cope with that change. And what about this, which is a slightly tweaked version of that, to just depend on Python 2.5+?Code:## Stolen from gavinandresen's django field validator#  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1026.0#import refrom hashlib import sha256import math__b58chars = '123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz'__b58base = len(__b58chars)def b58encode(v):  """ encode v, which is a little-endian string of bytes, to base58.      """  long_value = 0L  for (i, c) in enumerate(v[::-1]):    long_value += (256**i) * ord(c)  result = ''  while long_value >= __b58base:    div, mod = divmod(long_value, __b58base)    result = __b58chars[mod] + result    long_value = div  result = __b58chars[long_value] + result  # Pad front with Base58-encoded-0 for leading zeros:  nPad = int((len(v)*8 / (math.log(58,2))) - len(result))  return (__b58chars[0]*nPad) + resultdef b58decode(v, length):  """ decode v into a little-endian string of len bytes  """  long_value = 0L  for (i, c) in enumerate(v[::-1]):    long_value += __b58chars.find(c) * (__b58base**i)  result = ''  while long_value >= 256:    div, mod = divmod(long_value, 256)    result = chr(mod) + result    long_value = div  result = chr(long_value) + result  if len(result) < length:    n_pad = length-len(result)    result = chr(0)*n_pad + result  return resultdef get_bcaddress_version(strAddress):  """ Returns None if strAddress is invalid.  Otherwise returns integer version of address.

Take this exact situation, where puddinpop walked out with 10k bc for something that he will not maintain (well, he might, but doesn't have to) and most other technically capable bitcoiners have probably created their own solution, so they will neither share nor help in balancing the board, as they fear they will loose the edge.So probably for 10k I would have, asked nicely, made the effort to make my approach more user friendly, or usable. But I'm not greedy, so I didn't ask. In fact, I was going to make a linux package in exchange for a couple of graphics cards, but since puddinpop received 10k and open sourced his half-way solution, the card donation got aborted.And understand 10k coins don't pay for the time I already put in the code I disclosed, I just mentioned that value because it a real price tag, paid once in the past.And what really tickles me, to the point I find myself laughing as I type, is that when puddinpop received the donation/ransom, the threads got a bunch of "great!", "finally!", "what a great thing for the community" comments, when in the end there was already code for free, and open sourced, and although not as polished it is pretty much in the same need for a maintainer, so just as usable. Really, I said it before, I'll say it again; very well played, puddinpop! You were the sole winner in this.So I think that this is more of a sociological problem than it is a technical. Got 10k coins for me to hack up an opencl version? Probably puddinpop already has one and will opensource it, for the right fee, and then abandon it in whatever state it is :p Hey puddinpop, I'm curious. On what OS are you compiling this? If it's not OSX, care to share the makefile? Also, what is you graphics card and how does my patch compare to your version on it? I got about 20% increase on mine compared to yours, but then again some things like the threads per block or the total number of blocks have a huge impact on the overal performance, and I didn't try to optimize your version. Thanks for trying it out, finally some feedback You are correct about the revision number being wrong. It was actually against r154. The fact I did a hacky job at including the miner means that problems do exist. I find that using all the cores + the GPU actually slows everything, and that reducing the number of mining threads on the fly doesn't do the right thing. One has to, as best as I can understand, start with 1 and up to 2 or more, but reducing threads leaves the system in unexpected states.As for using a limit of -1 slowing things down, it makes some sense, as the CPU still is at 100% when using the GPU, doing memcpy's and finding nonces that are potential winners.I'm attaching a new version that unrolls pretty much everything and nets me an extra 1MH/s, but this is finely tuned for my own system. This comes from a slightly more patched code base, so I hope I didn't leave any extra stuff. It's in my todo list, but as all 'just for fun' projects, it depends on me having the time... I will, however, post all sources if I get to do it  Hehe, my ironic tone went completely unnoticed... I know what we get from open source, I didn't mean to imply you should continue to support this, at least not that it was your responsibility.  It really strikes me as awkward that you would feel that I was pointing a finger.Remember me? I'm the guy that *did* implement a CUDA miner, and *did* release it as open source before you ever got your "ransom".As it seems obvious that my joking tone is not understood, let me be very serious and say that the problem as I see it is that everyone assumes that something being open sourced means that a huge geek community will just jump in and support it. Not in my world, it doesn't. I can certainly do that, sure, but why should I? My personal version works on my only CUDA enabled computer, and performs better than yours. Sure, all the work you did in detecting the hardware I don't have, I just fine tuned it to my machine, hard coded.The thing is everyone wants it, but no one knows how to go about it. And frankly you came out as the only real winner, so congrats! No sarcasm or irony here, you played your cards right and won.I just hope some coder gets annoyed or bored and steps in, I just don't have the need right now that justifies the time expenditure. I did my part...
Yeah, when do we get anything out of the code puddinpop opensourced? Well, puddinpop? Now that you got the hefty donation, are you to do any support? Is anyone up to take this? So I could use -inboundport=<port> and use that instead of DEFAULT_PORT, or if 0 disable inbound completely like I do now. Hmmm, I feel a patch to your patch coming. Well, I don't know what your native language is, but most tech terms don't have real translations to Portuguese, and instead translators use some sound-alike replacement that is usually both lame and wrong. I'll take english for any multi-lingual computer related project, thank you But I understand that often people's grasp of the English language is less than perfect, and makes their life easier to have native language interfaces, so yeah, I agree, but my interface will remain in English, regardless. I know my usecase (multiple bitcoin clients on the same server) is not the same thing that is being solved by this patch, it does fix most of it. The only thing remaining is to prevent binding to 8333 (no reason to change that, as other clients only try to connect to 8333, afaict. IRC only advertises IP, right?).I've patched my client with this simple change:Code:--- a/net.cpp+++ b/net.cpp@@ -1236,6 +1236,9 @@ bool BindListenPort(string& strError)     memset(&sockaddr, 0, sizeof(sockaddr));     sockaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;     sockaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // bind to all IPs on this computer+    if (mapArgs.count("-disableinbound")) {+      return true;+    }     sockaddr.sin_port = DEFAULT_PORT;     if (::bind(hListenSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&sockaddr, sizeof(sockaddr)) == SOCKET_ERROR)     {so passing the -disableinbound switch makes it not try to bind the 8333 port. That use case has never crossed my mind I really want to throw a transaction into the bitcoin ether, and then be able to provide the information to someone else so they can collect that transaction. Who that someone else is I don't know at the time of the transfer. You mean multilingual as in programming languages or spoken languages? Because for the latter I think it's in everyone's benefit we stick to English, and as for the former, I don't see how that can be an issue.I never used MantisBT, but I'm always up for learning something new. Having said that, the one most people are comfortable with would be my first choice. So you are the one person betting on my lotteries... besides me, that is :p I guess there's no magic here. Although there's probably more to the story than what you found, the simple fact is that I have gotten my CUDA version to pump ~7700Kh/s on my system, and while Puddinpop's version is slightly more optimized the simple fact his kernel workers take multiple hashes on a single call makes the system very unresponsive and the amount of data he's moving in and out of the card makes the whole thing slower.But even at 7700 I haven't yet generated a single block (yes, it does work on a test network) and the last 3 blocks I got where instead found by another machine runnnig at under 3000Kh/s. Even doing half, randomness has it's way of giving an edge to that one If 10 of you were using puddinpop's version for a couple of weeks doing 10M each, it's kind of expected to get no more than ~10 blocks, combined. But again, you could have generated a lot more, I'm just saying... "Dear IRS,I write to ask you to remove me from your list. I regret this decision but your ability to provide me with any helpful service or in any way improve my quality of life has been null, and as such you leave me no choice but to terminate any relationship you may assume we have promptly.I will add you to the 'no call list' as soon as possible, and I must request that you do not try to contact me through phone, letter, email or any other medium. I am not interested in your services.Very best regards,nelisky" There are many, many bug trackers out there, and I've worked with a good bunch of them. The good thing about any of these is organization, and preventing other users from posting duplicate bug reports (well, to the point where the user looks for them first  ).But what I would really see improving things as we go on is git (or bazaar, or another decentralized source tracking system) and a door to give satoshi patches for consideration. This goes for both bugs and enhancements. In the end, as long as the sole keeper or the bitcoin key is satoshi, we just need whatever means of communication he feels better with. Forums, you say? Well, good enough, I guess.But something like trac (http://trac.edgewall.org/) would really help keeping things organized, and I'm sure everyone would appreciate it. How is this a bug? I may be reading it completely wrong but:Code:/usr/bin/bitcoindstarts the daemon whereasCode:/usr/bin/bitcoind ""calls the rpc method "" in the running daemon which is not there, so you get the can't connect. If it were there you'd get:Code:error: {"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found"} Not really a bug, but a left over... that used to take you to the active pick, when there was only one, now takes you to the first one  It'll do the right thing when inside the pick betting page, but all that is going away in a future version. Fixed. Nice catch I've been meaning to get rid of the bet page and drive bets out of the details page instead... been a little busy though  Ok, I lost. PM me the address for settling the wager  Ok, the server code went through a major refactoring, so if you find any glitches please share asap. Not much changed visually, except now I can run multiple picks concurrently! A Pick4 will be appearing soon, and these tend to end very fast so take your chances, people!If all goes well I may add a Pick5 too.Thanks, everyone, for supporting this idea! Fun, fun, fun  You don't, and you don't do that to MacOS clients either  It's a patch for the source of bitcoin, only of any use if you can compile it yourself. This is not a ready product, read the appropriate thread for more information. Just hijacking the thread a little bit to say I've posted a new patch to enable CUDA on the default client: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1009.msg13028#msg13028Still very specialized, but wide open for you to change that  Just hijacking the thread a little bit to say I've posted a new patch to enable CUDA on the default client: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1009.msg13028#msg13028Still very specialized, but wide open for you to change that  This patch is done against the latest SVN, r157, where satoshi made it so much easier to hook up a custom miner in a clean way, including a no nonsense hash per sec calculation. Great work there, satoshi! I have tested it on a test network and at difficulty 1, doing ~6MHs I was generating a block every couple of minutes, with a standard client accepting it.This patch does a much better job than the previous one because the hashes are no longer taken out of the GPU, only the number of 0's in them. That makes parsing a few thousand hashes that were calculated in parallel by the GPU a breeze. And then the nonce is passed to the Crypto++ hasher if one is found, which makes it double sure the hash is valid.Also I cleaned up the makefile (still only for OSX 64bit) to make it easier for people to port to whatever system they have. Now, if any of you has a CUDA or ATI Stream enabled card, PCI-e that is gathering dust, consider donating it to me and I'll make it work on linux. It can be oldy, slowish, don't care. I just need it to be compatible so I can test.Have fun, and keep the code open!PS: the first miner generating is always the GPU, and I don't check if you have a compatible card, I just assume. When I have the time, I'll change that. I'm pretty much giving up on hoping for someone else to pick up where I left it  Everyone developing this GPU thing seems to have an agenda. But that doesn't allow separate ports to run multiple clients on the same machine, does it?
Yes, at least three things are missing from the equation:- Time to move data into the GPU. I've tested my alg doing the same sha2 (so only one 64 byte transfer in) and got ~100MHs. Compare that to the 6MHs I get with the full implementation.- We are actually doing 2 sha calculations, so halve your expected times.- To avoid transferring all hashs back to the system memory, the comparison of the result hash against the target difficulty is done on the GPU, which takes a slice of time there too.Of course implementations can be very optimized, all loops unrolled, memory used more efficiently. But the target should never be anything over 25% of the sha1 test, I'd say. I, personally, think that we are poking the wrong people way too early in the game... I mean, we are giving the tools to those who:1) most desire to be able to prevent taxation and control from the governments2) pay a large bill to said governments every yearIf we are trying to get the attention of the legislators, on the other hand, that it's the right way to do it imo.*ducks* "It is OpenCL"? I'm guessing the bounty starter meant either cuda or opencl, but although I only have nvidia (and cuda is so much less verbose) I think an opencl version would be more appropriate. You probably need the listtransactions patch. Can you build? If not, what platform are you on? So, how much interest is there in this? I *could* put a little effort in making something a bit more generic than my osx version, and I don't even need a bounty or donation. It's a simple math problem, as the coins I'd need to ask to make this monetarily worthwhile are simply not going to be offered, so I'd rather do this for the community's sake.  Donations are appreciated, but judging by how much I got from the implementation I posted (a hefty sum of 0), I don't think that is going to tilt my balance anytime soon On the other hand, are there any takers? I'd offer my support and my code to whomever wants to make this happen in a short period of time. I don't. I want to accept a transaction using a provided key and immediately transfer that out to some address. Running without a wallet is kind of an eufemism.So basically I send a transaction to an address that I own, but no client has, not even mine. That transaction gets into the next block and will be confirmed, but never collected.Time passes, I provide that key to someone (QR code, email, smoke signals, morse code, whatever) and they want to collect. Notice I didn't transfer to that person, neither did I use a 3rd party payment processor.Of couse, after providing the private key to that person I can still use it myself, but then that person has the option to, be it by a new feature in the client or by some service provided in the web, say "here's a key, transfer all that it has to my bc address". After that is done, I no longer hold any value in that priv key.The reasons why I think this is useful are, for now, only mildly disclosed, but can we, technically, do it? Heh, TTBit was meaning to get you playing on the Pick6, but the lottery draw also needs some attention  No, it's nothing personal, and I'm not thinking about getting in the race, for sheer lack of time, and because I get obsessed very easily (I pulled an all nighter with my implementation, and it had been a while since I last did that). Join the two and I'm the perfect guy to do this, only I need to work on the other, less important types of income I'm just saying that stating "I'll donate X" is not the same as having an account with X times the people that donated, psychologically speaking. And having that account held by a well established party helps wiz newcomers consider taking the bounty, that's all.If I'm to do it, you can hold my bounty, I trust you  And with what I assume was your bet, we have reached the bit 1K. There's 1000 Bitcoins to collect, people. Don't be shy, there's still plenty of tickets to sell  woot, finally someone steps up! I wish I had the time, as it's a ton of fun to optimize code like this. But to be taken seriously you'll need a trusted wallet keeper to collect all donations, serving as escrow. I could make mine (assuming a CUDA only solution) work for linux and mac in a couple of days, but my employers wouldn't be too happy about it!Windows? I have no idea, would need to set up a build machine and that I'm not looking forward to :pBut anyone wants to pick up where I left? People, I'm getting tired of PM'ing to warn that I'll do this, so I'll just go ahead and do it:DO NOT POST YOUR BTCOUT! That is your log in to the page. For those of you that already did, please go into the lottery account page and change it to another address you own. Give TTBit either you BTCIN or a personal address, just not the one you register with the lottery!Also, don't forget to set a password while you're there. You don't need it to login, but you do to change the btcout. This way other people can bet your coins if that grab your address, but they can't withdraw them.Sorry if I didn't make that clear enough before. Are we really discussing intelectual property licenses now? I mean, really???There's this friend of mine, who I greatly admire, that says that "the world is not made of laws, but of people". When we need to hide behind license agreements and we didn't even leave the neighborhood, something is really rotten. While I must say that puddinpop has a point, he can actually licence sw based on MIT core in whatever or whichever way he feels good about, I just think that making a point of it goes to show a bit about his education towards open source and its beliefs.So, in my mind, we get a 10000 BC bounty for him, he makes us a pretty opencl version and then states he found a way to increase hashing, 10 fold... but now he wants 10 fold the bounty! I'm off this thread now, I hear my conscience calling me. Yes, the community prefers to work with people that have the open source mindset unless there's no expertise in it, or the closed source is amazingly better that all others. But hey, that's just me Your code may be great, and your heart in the right place when you say "convince me to open source", but the paragraph you just wrote spells out "either you pay me or I'm not releasing the hostages". The pun regarding ransomware is well intended, but in a satirical and well intentioned manner! I told you, I understand perfectly what you are trying to achieve, we are all going for the same thing. It's the route you chose that I'm not comfortable with. So you are running a PIII? Just kidding, but that is kind of slow. I do ~1400000 on my mac using the CPU (that's an i5), around 6200000 using my cuda enabled GPU and custom code and on a Q6600@2.4 OC'd to 3.0, I crunch ~5000000. There's a makefile.mingw, and although I haven't tried yet, I'll probably take a stab at windows building for my cuda miner. Can I not use this? Check.Ok, so there are 2 elements in play here, addresses and transactions. Addresses are safe so as long as I do as described above, but transactions may be lost? Outgoing transactions are not a problem, obviously, as loosing them means only that the coins don't go out, so using a previous backup would show the correct amount before transaction.But incoming transactions could be a problem? So someone sends me coins, I receive the transaction and then loose my wallet. I still have the address and key, so shouldn't the transaction be replayed when I parse all blocks again?The means by which transactions get transported are the blocks, right? There's no out of band communicating of transactions between clients?  This is, I believe, the biggest separator between bitcoin backers and mildly curious people; those who believe that bitcoins do infact have intrinsic value, if only for philosophical reasons, or even privacy concerns, don't use BCs to get EUR or USD. It's the other way around. You think in terms of country currency because that's what you use to buy bread and gas, but my personal take is that bitcoins are their own value. Sure, you can't do much with them right now, but think about a month ago... there was no lottery Bitcoins ARE a detour if you want to go from USD to USD (or whatever currency you use). But that is NOT what bitcoins are about at all. Hey, so making my Lottery more disaster resilient, and taking on satoshi's backupwallet feature, I just wanted to double check I'm doing the right thing (tm).My understanding is that the only important information on the whole set of bitcoin client data files is the private keys, one per incoming address. And all of these are stored in wallet.dat. Everything else, including the transactions themselves, is stored in every other bitcoin client running on the network. Is this correct?Now, when does the information on the wallet.dat change, in a way that it makes our last backup ineffective? I'm guessing on every sent transaction, as bitcoin automatically creates a new receiving address for the transaction change portion, and everytime we create a new address.Incoming transactions don't create new keys, do they? So I can safely receive without creating a new backup...As a side thought, the import / export of keys has been mentioned now and then on the threads I follow. Would it be possible / practical to export all new keys from a wallet (passing an id from last backup, or the last key from the last backup) so we have granularity, and then be able to recreate a wallet by importing each of the pieces?webservices in mind, this (efficient and effective backup) is the most critical point imho. Hehe, we'll see... You are welcome to get into our friendly wager 
Here, here. I can't say I don't understand his actions, I just wouldn't take that route personally. In any case, if you don't like/trust his offer, don't take it. You can always code it yourself to understand the effort involved.Heck, you can actually use my code or one of the others to help you bootstrap things and I bet ya even so you'll start to appreciate the effort that needs to be put in doing this  You're on! Yep, Friday. I'm on GMT+1 so so that's Saturday 5am for you EST people :p That's my gut feeling, yes, but not what the math says, it seems  A full discussion on the numbers can be found on the Lottery announce thread. Still, a Pick4, with 65536 possibilities got a winner in 181 blocks, or somewhat over one day, and had less than 100 bets on it. I would bet you this one will be over before the working week is...But I'm preparing to try out FreeMoney's idea of having multiple picks with different sizes, say a Pick4 and a Pick5 running at the same time. We're playing this by ear, so if you have some insight on how you think would work best for keeping you interested and betting, please do share! Updated stats:7 accounts, 7 betters, bets ranging from 5 to 108 BC. Hey, I'm writing the rules page as fast as I can! :pBitPick bets stay active for the duration of that pick, i.e. until somebody wins. Only one winner on the BitPicks. You are right, I have dedicated all of my spare time to coding the lottery, it left very little to make it user friendly There are 2 types of game, as you assumed;- Lottery - A block number is defined as the one carrrying the result, a number of prizes are distributed based on how many hits you get on your bets (this one is fairly well explained on the rules page)- BitPick - Every block is checked, only one winner. You buy bets, but they only become active 6 blocks later (to prevent me from cheating), from then on if your bet matches the most recent block hash (rightmost characters) you take the pot home. The number of characters to match are defined by the type of BitPick, so Pick6, currently active, matches 6 characters.Hope that helps getting you going, I'll take some time to put this on the site soon. I can give you mine BUT it's not statically linking cuda, so you need the SDK installed AND it's 64bits. Assuming both these things are good for you, and you don't mind using the terminal instead of the GUI, give it a try. This is the latest version that does ~6.2MHs on my system (assuming I'm calculating correctly  ) and you should try it with just one mining thread (although it works with 5, the speed actually decreases from 3 up, and if you generate, you can't be sure it was the GPU miner).Grab it at www.datlatec.com/bitcoind.zip and let me know how it goes. Current stats since the handout began:4 accounts, 3 betters, 2 with 8 BTCs and one with 16. I have no problem doing some checking. But trusting is really the better option. If someone wants to scam you, they can still, even using the lottery. But, c'mon, what are 8 coins when you can win 691+? hehWhen you asked before there were 2 new accounts created. Right now they are 3... not logarithmic, but great  Yes, those 12 did arrive. Did you send the other 2x16 to the same address? What is the BTCIN? The one you posted? Can you log in to your account there? (don't post your BTCOUT!) omg its 5kr1p7 k1d3 all over again... I don't miss that era, so count me in for the ney It is not silent at all when it fails. The result is that the hash calculated is all zeros, thus passing the difficulty check. Then the client double checks the hash and dies on an assert. Still, I could just not start the cuda miner and allow the client to still use the CPU  Transfers: 2 -> yours and, I assume, sgtstein's (where's yours macdrai?)I'll grep for accounts created in a minute and keep everyone posted Well, I'd say the best way is to limit visibility. If people give you the address by private message, you can then keep posting as to how much is left, and I can keep track of the amounts received, confirming the process without too much disclosure. You know everything, but then again these are your coins until you give them  A new transfer and bet of 16 entered the BitPick... so much for the anonymous part, hey ?  On steroids... I want to be able to tell the client:bitcoind collectfromkey privkey amountAnd it would create the transaction with the privkey as sender, amount as, well, amount, and my own address (may provide it on cli too, of course) as recipient. It may be actually importing the private key, sure, although I don't think that would be needed technically, so as long as I can construct the transfer pdu. Say you generate a new address on your client, its 1abc...Now on another client you transfer to that address, so when the 1st client sees that transaction in a block, and checks it using its priv key, it knows the transaction belongs to it.If you add that key to another client you can grab the transaction elsewhere, right? Spending it will only happen once, but multiple wallets can have that address.What I want to do is to have the address+key so I can, without ever adding that key to my wallet.dat, create a transaction spending the value in that address+key, effectively sending it to my real address.This would make for a proxy address schema, where you could send money to the network and then provide the key information to anyone to collect, but without actually holding the proxy key, it would be use and throw away.Is that any clearer? Thanks for the link! I'll be sure to try and follow as soon as I have a moment. The only thing is I don't have any linux with a cuda enabled gpu, but I can still try and build things up so others can test.I don't use IDEs at all, I try very hard to avoid them. It pays in the long run to know and understand your tools.As for helping in compiling, I've taken a very shortcut approach in my system, just copying the calls from the nvidia SDK template. There's a variable (is it debug or verbose?) that you set to 1 in your makefile and you'll get the calls it makes to compile printed out, so I just copied the switches over to the bitcoin makefile. That is one place I really need to improve, but didn't have time to. I don't even check if the gpu is cuda capable, for crying out load  Funny I missed that, as I actually tried the client on OSX back in the days. So there are a bunch of alternatives, only nothing maintained or production ready. I could maintain such a thing, but right now I'm so mixed up into many things that I have to balance cost/benefit, but I'd gladly support (i.e. donate to) someone picking this up. If there are no takers I'll still continue development, but at a slow pace.
Could this be done?Ok, maybe that's not enough information there  Here's my line of thought:- I have a wallet, it has some funds. I create an address and send a few coins to it.- I'm on another client altogether now. I want to collect these coins, but the address isn't mine. What do I need, which keys does it take to create a transaction from the sender address to a private address of mine?In other words, what do I need to own the result of a transaction and where does bitcoin client store that (in code, I know its in the wallet ) There are at least three other implementations around:-artforz' but I'm guessing he's keeping his edge-sgtstein hinted he was working on one too, and would release-mine at http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1009.msg12334#msg12334 which I have a major update for being tested, currently giving me 6200khs on my laptop GPU alone.I'd be willing to work harder on making this usable by other people without having to tweak too much code for some coins, sure. But frankly I see a handful of people complaining here about how puddinpop is closed, how it might be a scam, and that we need an alternative but, frankly, I've received zero feedback on the usefulness of my approach.Oh, and keep in mind I'm releasing everything I do, but I'm only doing it on OSX 10.6 because that's the only cuda enabled gpu I have. Also, for all the ATI users out there, I'll try opencl soon, just don't know exactly when.But I don't want to hijack puddinpop's thread, sorry for the shameless plug, if nothing else he did me a huge service by releasing his client close source, making me get my first cup of cuda, something I was meaning to do for a long time... I'll send him 5 coins for each block I generate with my client, if I ever do  But you know what?"There is no spoon..."Hah! Almost right. You do your own cooking, not him, but by using his special spoon, you'll get your meal quicker  You will, however, loose 10% of your meal in the end. Aha, ok. Well, haven't thought about that possibility... in fact have coded the thing in a way slightly incompatible, but can fix. It's a great idea, certainly worth trying. I just hope I'm not diluting the (3) betters too much Yes, the idea as I remember (I didn't read back the thread) was as soon as the side pot reached 500, but can also do on the first prize reaching 500, or whatever.I also intend to change the draw to get rid of the bounty and instead get a cut for the house, probably the same 5% I take from the pick. I need to get a little stash so I can seed a bit jackpot not too far away from now  You guys cool with that? Heh, got confused there, sorry. But if by 'cracking this' you mean reverse engineer it, from experience it's easier to just code it from scratch! If, on the other hand, you mean remove the ransom part, then yeah, I guess it can be done with little effort. Run 2 on different time scales? What do you mean?Again, I don't follow. Sorry if I'm just being dense. Are you asking if we are going to have 500 block intervals from now on? I'm experimenting, it feels like 1000 is just too long. Yes, please do release yours! I loved the experience of thinking massive parallel for coding mine (and I also need to release my 2x speedup update). I'm really interested is understanding your approach to the problem! We are just about crossing the 300BTC pot on Pick6! Woohoo...So, statistically speaking, what is the correct bet char size to have an average of one pick per day, at 1000 bets per pick? Yeah, you're right. And I really like the idea of allowing people to buy BTC directly from the lottery, but that could get messy. It's not an exchange site, and all logic is bound to the bitcoin client, so I don't really want to get into that right now I could build an EUR based exchange client, hook it up to mtgox with automated transaction sharing, and people could just send the coins to the taabl address. Or they could do that right now from mtgox site!In the end, volume is the key, but I can't advertise winners and call the lottery anonymous, now can I? I stopped counting my losses, but I can tell you the grand total of losses I suffered in the state lottery to date are embarrassing. I guess that when the pots get to 5K you say "I only lost 100 so far but I can still get rich"... The whole TAABL ecosystem right now is composed of 25 accounts, of which 3 (this including myself) are actively betting Not much to see here, really. I know this will change someday, I'll keep things running until it does. In the mean time we keep bouncing coins amongst each other and hope others won't grow tired of the process.I think the lottery framework is pretty good now, it only needs, ya know, people betting. The BitPicks... well, there's the automatic better feature that would really increase usability, so I guess I'll do that and move back to Pick4 or even Pick3. In fact, removing the seed and adding the auto better (where I'm a seeder in the form of bets) is a great plan that was hinted by TTBit. I'll try and cook something up this weekend. This is starting to be another nitpick thread, but I'll try my best to keep it civil I'm not arguing everyone should pay everytime  they generate a thread. That is the purpose of the infrastructure and people get paid for the work they are doing suporting that infrastructure. In fact, if noone generated blocks, we wouldn't be here in the first place. So, yes, I'm doing my best to help satoshi and everyone else by generating more blocks and making the network harder to defeat. I don't have to pay others for the work I do, that is just nonsense!What you are doing is slightly different. You create a better hashing mechanism/algorithm and you can capitalize on it by generating more blocks. Go for it, it's what we are all doing anyway. But then you decide the effort you put in this isn't going to pay off anytime soon by just generating, moreso because regardless of how fast you hash, there's always a component of luck.So what do you do? You sell your work. Actually, you rent your work. So now you are not suporting the network, you are capitalizing on top of it. You have every right to do so, mind you, I'm not arguing with that. If you had a way to hash 100MH's on a P3, I know you could sell that on biddingpond for a lot of coins. It's not the idea that bugs me, it's the process. By providing a closed source system you depend on other's trust, which is fine if they trust you. I don't trust you any more than you trust me, insofar as we don't know each other.I run very little closed source software, and yes, I run OSX and linux and no, I haven't read the whole source for the kernel, but still a group of other people have, and I trust numbers.Again, I'm not pointing a finger or stating you are wrong in your intentions. I'm just saying I don't see what the big deal for this to be so secretive and closed, and I have put my money where my mouth is and went ahead and developed something myself. It's crude, gives me ~7MHs at this moment on my macbook, which is a 4x speedup over the CPU version, I'm happy I did this in two partial days without any previous cuda experience. Yeah, I'm a coder by trade, but still this gave me a warm feeling...I will continue development until someone else picks it up, at the pace I can afford. It  may end up amounting to nothing, but hey, at the end of the day, I feel very good about myself, as I know you do to, so two thumbs up, my friend. I'm following TTBit's clues and formulas. I don't want it to take long, but I do want the pot to grow so as to attract more betters, and when these get closed so fast you can't really raise much interest.If the site ever gets very busy, or I get to put the auto bet feature, then maybe it's ok to have 4 picks close in the same day.Would a Pick5 be more to your liking? Right, I may simply be dense, sorry. The way I see it, you did an amazing job which I, unfortunately, can't make use of. If I could, maybe I'd gladly give the 5 coins to you, who knows? But the fact remains that while I feel that this has a niche to it, and while I'd love to have a farm of multi tesla computers to generate coins to my heart's contempt, I don't like the idea of closed source, binary distributed software for security reasons. And on top of that, you are forcing the (fairly distributed) payment of your work, but fail to move that income down the line, to the base of your own work.But that's more philosophical  than anything else, and you did nothing wrong, you disclosed your intentions from the start, etc. I just feel that the community would be more forthcoming with sharing their earnings if given the chance, that's all. Having said that, I don't expect a bitcent for the  work I did, but then again I'm not doing it for profit. I have nothing against closed source by itself, and I surely understand the profit taken after hard work has been done, me being a coder working on the comercial arm of an open source project. But that's where my positive reasoning ends.Charging for work is important, but not so much taking a ransom. And are these 5 BTCs per generated block only from blocks generated using the GPU? And are 4 of these 5 given to satoshi and all the others working on the open source?Anyway, still crude and already outdated but look here -> http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1009.msg12264#msg12264I didn't understand what all the fuss was about in this cuda development so I decided to take a stab at it. I only have very limited time, but I am now testing a version doing 6Mh/s as opposed to teh 1.4MHs I get from the CPU. And it has only been mildly optimized, so there's still much room for improvement.My hardware is limited too, so I only tested in my OSX cli client, but the idea is there for other to work on. I can be convinced to work harder on it, but this was just proving a point for me. Ok, thanks to TTBit for showing me the math stating "there's no way I can not loose" with the BitPick as I had it. Pick3 and Pick4 are just too easy to win, and not enough people bet on it fast enough, so we are moving to Pick6!Also, the pot seeding + 50% for the house on bets is also something that will only work when I have a lot of coins to seed this. As that's not the case, I'm dropping the seed completely for now and moving the house cut to 5%. C'mon people, get it while it's hot! Well, then it sounds fair to me, all of the sudden  Did I get davidonpda's penny? I'm really puzzled with all this. I also generated a block and transferred it out on the spot. Looking at the transaction:     "address" : "1LCSXSx8sjcZKHFXbyasBsuEdJtBVRaco7",        "label" : "",        "txid" : "1249190d1a13b03b51c27ded2e8441d446a8ae6ef90f90db31a8267da0845685",        "txtime" : 1283997623,        "category" : "debit",        "amount" : 50.01000000,        "confirmations" : 228    },it seems I paid the fee too. Why would that be? A block that had too many tx, the value coming from multiple small value purses (but the client should see one purse that satisfies the whole transaction, right?) or what else? Ha, there were only 3 people actively betting on pick 3, hardly justifying the cost it had to me If eventually we get enough people on board, there's a lot that can be done, but for now, while pots are small...And capping, that I cannot do for 2 reasons:- Against my principles- Completely impossible, you can open as many accounts as you wantPlease go ahead and try the pick4, I'm sure that if the bets get high enough it will be really frequent too. And maybe I'll find a way to do a super seed!But if enough people request it, I'll drag Pick3 back, with either seeds completely gone and bets at 100%, or smaller seeds and smaller cuts. But really, I think a Pick4 with a 1000BTC starting pot would rock   Maybe you could give me your address and I can just send you all my coins, saving us both some trouble Yeah, I never got around to putting that in the rules page. There's an initial seed, which is free for all (is 50 currently), so if you bet 1, you can get 50.Further bets will increment the pot 5 btc for every 10 bets. So 50% of the bets go to the pot.There is a confirmation period for bets, and that is why you see 20 bets and a pot of 50. After 6 blocks (roughly one hour) the bets are confirmed and the pot raises by 10, moving to 60.This confirmation period has nothing to do with bitcoin confirmation blocks. It's to make sure the total bets for a block are known an hour in advance so I can't just put in a known winning bet after the block comes out and cheat on everyone I get 50% of all bets minus the seed. So the theory is I can get a truckload of coins, and reality is I'm bleeding coins. The earnings I make on this, if I ever do so, will have an impact on the seeding of the next pick, so if I make 1000 coins, you'll see a much larger seed on the next pick, probably on the 500 coins area, so I can keep a buffer. Not right now, no. The auto betting feature is something I have on my to do list, but don't have time for... if there's generalized interest on this, please speak up.Thank you for playing, and the (continuation of) best of luck to you.
This new patch has been tested and is generating (at least in a test network), and the move of scratch space into thread local memory has improved performance quite a bit, from ~1880kh/s to ~3000kh/s on my system.Did anyone succeed in building and testing on other platforms / GPUs? Ok, I'm done with Pick3, lost almost all of my coins on it... it worked out great... for other people.So, say hello to Pick4. It's 1:65546 instead of 1:4096, maybe this way enough people will have time to bet. It's all about the number of betters,really. It seems that the bitpick didn't become the automatic success I thought it would be.Also, I've been thinking about the lottery prizes and for the next one I'm getting rid of 1 hit prizes. 1 in 16 is just too easy and it dilutes the total pot too much... I'll run some numbers as for the new pool division percentages, but share your mind if you have an idea of what these should be. Yeah, while implementing the cuda hasher I thought about this. There should be an interface to the hashing handler (or even a full miner per implementation) and we should have a simple way of giving it a known block, ask it to hash 1000 nonces and compare the result, while benchmarking at the same time. Shouldn't be too hard to implement and would help when developing new algorithms.The interface schema would also help if we were to plug in an fpga based engine or something of the kind, having specific entry points into the code without having to tweak on the default mining schema. I have my Q6600@2.4G clocked properly at 3.2Ghz and the fan runs full speed, go figure  I do crack an extra 50% hashes from it, though. Yes, that's true, you can loose. I'm the one behind the wheel and I've only lost so far :pBut mining right now, on commodity hardware, is almost a certain loss. And it's not only electricity, the cpu fans are bound to fail soo too! And running at top temp certainly impacts life span of components. Nice! I've wanted to get into FPGA's too, and bitcoin seems very fitting, but unfortunately time doesn't stretch that much.BTW, the code I posted is slightly broken  If the cuda thread generates a valid block it will die, for where it reads in main.cpp:          if (DEBUG || hash <= hashTarget) {            pblock->nNonce = keep+i;            break;          }it shoudl read          if (DEBUG || hash <= hashTarget) {            pblock->nNonce = tmp.block.nNonce = keep+i;            break;          } I don't think that the bias should be towards the ones with better printers having more money  The Bitcoins are a whole ecosystem, and mining for them is a small part of it, I guess. If lots of people start running GPU based mining, then the advantage that was owned by artforz and a handful of others will blend into more hands and pockets, thus making the mining less efficient for everyone. But mining is part statistics, part luck. I recently generated 3 blocks, running a machine that has been mining non stop for over a month. These 3 blocks are the only blocks it ever generated.Of course artforz would like to keep the advantage. Heck, I could use this to my advantage too, but I'd rather take the open source business approach and say "here, take it, my treat" but expect you to do the same for me and others (yes, trust is the base for this), and if you like it, I'll take whatever you feel fair. You want me to do something specific? need suport? Well, priority and special attention comes with a cost.I may never get as many coins as artforz created, but I hope I did my share on helping to spread them I've got a GT330M, really basic entry level thing. And you are most welcome. Honestly, I can't understand all the secrecy on the CUDA / OpenCL / Whatever GPU enabled versions of bitcoin. Sure, it's nice to take advantage of the extra edge you get if you want to build an efficient mining farm, but really, what's up with everyone on this regard?So, not really having the time to do it, I decided to take my first cup of CUDA (as all I have as hw to test is a macbook pro with a nvidia inside), and I'm attaching the initial version here. Yes, the source, for you to do as you please! Just remember the reason you got it in the first place, which was that someone didn't take it and hide! Anyways, it's *really* crude, has static compile instructions on the makefile, only for osx and with the cuda dev sdk in the default place, compiled for x86_64. But I'm sure you can quickly tweak it to compile for your system, though...The code that runs in the GPU is a 1:1 copy of the Cryptopp source, only slightly tweaked. There's a lot of room for improvement, I have some 20 hours total of working with CUDA so I don't have the faintest idea of what optimizations I could achieve, but at least in the memory layout there's a lot to do. I compared the resulting hashes with Cryptopp and it matches, so I'm assuming it can generate blocks. I'm tired and thus haven't tried a local network, but I will soon.I get 1400khs from the CPU with all cores combined, and 1800khs from the GPU alone, so it's pretty nice. It does take a lot of cpu still, for some reason, so run it with cores-1 or you'll loose performance. I *think* the hashes per second calculation is correct, but may not be.The first processor is always the cuda, it will not run if you don't have the GPU / kernel, no error handling, ugly hackish code throughout, but it serves as a start. Lets get this production grade to include in the main clients, shall we?Now, if you want to thank me for doing this just head to http://taabl.datlatec.com and place a few bets. I'm starting to think the time I spent developing the lottery wasn't worth it, as it got too little interest so far, so it would be super if you all gave it a try.If you want me to continue to pursue this, then toss a good amount of coins my way  or send me some hardware. I have linux and windows machines, but not the GPU for them, so *wink* *wink*Most of all, share your code! Or, in other words, you have a much better chance of getting some coins if you play on http://taabl.datlatec.com *ducks* You can double check by looking at the details page. Under 'Total Bets' there is the count of confirmed bets, and the unconfirmed ones are gray and italic in the bet list (underlined if yours).Right now there are 10 bets unconfirmed. And another pick went by, another chunk of bitcoins removed from my personal wealth... Come on, people, we need critical mass here! Go on and bet!On a side note, the payment for the pick was automated and a new one should had been created on the fly, but there was a small bug preventing that... should be good for the next one. I'm doing backups every time I create a new address and when I send btcs. Receiving should be safe? Also, I'm collecting other stuff and doing offsite scp based backups of the wallet, meaning I have the trigger embedded in my program logic, but auto backups would be great, as one can look for changes in the backup file and use that as trigger to do the offsite.But what I *really* think would rock is some kind of event mechanism  Yep, that did the trick. Thank you.Now I just need you to include the getblock and listtransactions patches and I'm a happy camper. If you still feel strongly against these, I just need parts of them, really:- From getblock: A way to extract the hash signature from a specific block (which I use in the lottery)- From listtransactions: Well, I need everything there, really, but mostly for housekeeping as I need a way of quickly getting a log of transactions. But not all information is important, only the address (in or out, depending on credit or debit) the type and the confirmation count. I also like to be able to see blocks generated before they mature, but that's not that important. I've been getting this from the start, and it is only a mild nuisance as I develop in OSX but then deploy on linux.Anyway, the bitcoind process doesn't daemonize itself on my system, OSX 10.6, not with nor without -daemon. I can background it with '&' or ctrl-z bg, and it works correctly. Woot, double thumbs up on this. Great work, satoshi! Yep, exactly. No bets are returned on the lottery, as there is no wait period. Bets are not accepted within 6 blocks of draw.The reason for this is not to avoid people doing crazy things, but to prevent me, as the lottery operator, to cheat on the betters. There's a buffer of 6 blocks (roughly 1 hour) where you can download all the active bets, so if you take a snapshot of the bets every half hour (just to be safe) you can verify if I'm not putting false bets after the result block is known.If people rather not have this wait period and just trust me, so be it, but I don't want to even have a chance of cheating, be it on purpose or due to bugs in the software. Also, if my time runs too short I may hand this over to someone else, but I'm a better myself so I'd rather be able to make sure that person will not even have the chance to cheat on me.It's not I don't trust people, I just think that if trust is not an issue everything goes smoothly  This is just getting silly I can't automate the Pick if it closes in 6 blocks! Either this is just one of those really unlikely events that will probably not happen again, or I need to add another character to the bets...I'm opening another one, and use this to exercise the 'give back bets that didn't get confirmation blocks'. Thank you! You saved me a bunch of number crushing, although I had the empirical feeling that the 100BTC seed was probably a bit too much. I'm not trying to get rich out of this, obviously, but I'd really rather not loose all my bitcoins to it either. As such, I'm going to seed the next few pick 3s at 50BTC, which seems like a great compromise. If we get a lot of people betting, great, if I'm in profit the seeds will increase. If I loose it all, well, tough, I'll just stick to the other lottery  Hey FreeMoney, you have officially been appointed TAABL's favorit charity cause  Heh, congratulations! So it was you who took all my seed btcs Yes, you haven't been paid yet, the pay script was horribly broken so I'll fix that today and then open a new one. I just hope more betters come in on this one before we get a winner or I'm better off just giving the seed money away :pOther than the fact the house looses too easily, this Pick 3 schema seems very interesting, so I think that as long as I can afford it, I'll keep it up.
The Amazing Anonymous Bitcoin Lottery!And it may be ready for prime time... maybe taabl.datlatec.comThread at http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=896 Hmmm, it's interesting and I'm interested but:- Who are you again? When was this up before, so that it is up "again"?- Anyone did business here that can share the experience?- Why didn't you even bother to use secure http for credit card info form?- Are there any fees on credit card / paypal, or are these accounted for in the exchange rate?I want a good chunk of these, but I'm afraid to step forward without more information... That is expected, seeing as I up the pot by 5BTC every 10 bets. It's a psychological thing, I didn't like the 0.5 or 1BTC increases in my tests, and honestly would go as far as 10 each 20, but I thought I'd be stretching the rope there, there's not enough betters yet.Good luck! The BitPickStill an early version, lots to do, but functionally should be good. Here's how it is set up: I put a value, some value, in to bootstrap the draw. First time around, it's 100BTC. This is the initial pot for whoever guesses the 3 rightmost chars on one of the following blocks.- No dups, maximum 4096 bets, sure to have a winner in the next block- Bets are only activated after 6 blocks from the time they are submitted, but that bet is immediately removed from the available pool- Only one prize, only one winner. Every block from the start of the BitPick is checked (even if the server goes offline for whatever reason, the block order is always maintained)- Not yet coded in, but any bet not yet active at the time of the winning block gets returned to the better, i.e., that value is not part of the prize pool- For every 10 bets in, 5 BTCs are added to the prize poolI'm taking a 50% cut of the bets, but I'm also advancing a value. The largest Draw was 330BTC, over half of which was mine, so I feel that targetting for break even at 200 bets is realistic for the moment. If for some unseen reason we get a lot more bets than that, well, I'll pay for a real server  And I'll put more BTCs as initial pool for the next one (not automated yet, when one ends a new one will have to be created manually by me, which may take a few days at worst).I'll be updating the server now, so share your thoughts as to what should change and, as always, bet your bithearts out! I didn't put a bounty recipient on this one yet, I don't know if I will at all, but first I need to get a feel as to how interesting this is for you and how lucrative it is for me... My lottery is probably the only one in the whole wide world where the house keeps loosing more and more :p Ok, another one is done, this time it was a slow one. I was in for 116 bets, got 10 x 1 hitters. 3 other betters got 1 x 1 hits each.There's a little side pot now, and a little jackpot too. The jackpot, I just realized, may actually shrink between draws, as it is divided amongst all prizes. The division is good to make betting more interesting, but this may need to change eventually.Anyway, I am doing final tests on the pick 3 system, which I'll describe here soon, to see if everyone is in agreement with the rules and prizes. I obviously can't. The reason I stated that was because the RECEIVING address was the same *slaps head*.In my defense, your honor, that happened before my first cup of coffee, and I can't really be held liable for my actions before my first cup of coffee, can I? So, playing a bit more...'I' call, 'he' raises, 'I'... don't get any action buttons, my time starts counting and I time out. The hand is closed with 'he' winning (everyone folded) and the next hand simply doesn't start. Sound plays fine, messages work fine too, just a lost hand that was actually quite good and no more cards. Good thing it's the micro stakes table! My stats so far: received 3 times within 2 days (including initial tx from noagendamarket), paid it forward 3 time within a few hours of receiving to all 5 addresses that were around at the time (excluding my own, of course). The last transfer I made forward was on the 26th.Today I received 5 (!) transfers from the same generous party... I wonder if that was for real of it's an experiment to see if he can get 5 forward threads going on Values were not discussed on purpose, as they should not matter for whatever this experiment is for. Ok, it's pay back time. Well, it might just be me, but walking into the (insert favorite large surface store here), standing in line for 10 minutes and, already having 10 other people behind me I head to the counter and they say: "that will be 5461BTCs please, sir" to which I reply:- Wait, I'll just log in in my android phone, how was that 64 random characters address again? 'T' or 'D' again? Can you write that down, thank you.- It will just be 10 minutes now, sir...Ok, maybe it doesn't have to be this way, but this check / note/ scratch ticket thingy will still need to be confirmed online, or else there's really little you can do to avoid fraud, and that will do more hurt to bitcoins that one initially imagines. Sure, completely offline secure transactions would rock, but I just thought this would be a great middle ground solution. Easy to create, hard to copy without physically stealing, easy to assert if used before. I personally think it would rock And it would make it much easier to sell this idea to local shops, while also allowing offline transactions between parties with some trust level, as in the 'neighbor kid moans the lawn' scenario. Although with this sticker style coating thingies, it gets much easier But I was only considering an online transaction, as in debit card style. For offline usage, I'm not sure I have read of thought about a single system that would work, without some central issuer and physical material that is hard to counterfeit and/or more expensive to copy than the actual value it holds. Scratch-offs are an amazing idea. They could have qrcode to a mybitcoin address, and the password be used as 'PIN code' like in an ATM machine, thus loosing the card would not mean loosing the coins.Also, you could pair a bunch of same address cards that you hand off to (physical) merchants, and have another scratch off with 10 BTC worth codes, each one single usage. you could easily see if someone used your codes as they would be scratched off. So you hand out one qrcoded scratch off, and you use your own multi pin card and scratch as many as as 10BTCs you need. If they where those 'easy rip apart' things you could actually hand over the codes too You would then carry only as many pin codes as you wanted to carry around, reducing the possibility of loosing them. But if you did loose them, you could completely cancel all unused address/pin code pairs. You now have a slightly over complicated version of the 'full coverage' requested. On the bet page you can, in addition to stating how many tickets you are about to buy, define a 'sequence base'. What this does is increment that base sequentially as the bet's rightmost characters. So if you enter '0' as sequence base and '16' as 'number of bets' you'll end up with 16 bets where the rightmost character will go from 0 to F (thus covering 100% of 1 hit) and the other 4 characters random for each bet.If you do more than 16 for a single char base, it will continue throughout the 2 char sequence (10, 11, 12, etc) and if you enter 5 chars as base, there will be no random part, it will just be a sequence, thus '00000' and '16' will do '00000' through '0000F'.I hope that helps everyone's betting pleasure!A small caveat, though. If any of the random bets is already taken the system does not try another for that particular point of the sequence, it will just ignore that one and do the others, thus you can end up with holes and less than requested tickets, but you will get a description of which bets failed so you can do just those. If you want I can fix that, I'm just feeling lazy, really. I love, live and breath python, so that would not be a problem. But I'd still need the bitcoind on another server, and the matter of the fact is that I developed this to learn some new things, and these will take considerable effort to port to app engine. Frankly, I could save some dough, but I'd loose many other advantages, so I don't think I'll take that route. Well, thank you  But it's all a question of scale. for 2% to cover $20/month (~300BTC) then I'd need to take 75BTC from each weekly draw, which would only happen when we start getting 3750BTC bet pools in!Of course I can dilute this by putting other services in the same server, but it's a psychological thing, I either see it as paying for itself or as a fun personal project I pay to keep. It's the latter for now, the future may change that. I manually gave you your coins back, canceling the tickets. I'll make the coverage based betting soon, and you can then go ahead and bet again.Yep, it's quite different. But I don't want to be an active part on the lottery more than I need to be. It has to run on its own, or it is just too high maintenance. As such I seeded this one with 100 bets, with the promise (as before) that all gains will go right back to the lottery as new bets. But if I quit at any time, because I lost everything or whatever, I need to know all my work wasn't in vain :pAnd I still need to find out how I'm going to get this to pay for its own server, but that's for later, when there's enough traffic to justify so. The lottery is up again!New rules page, just a basic draft at http://taabl.datlatec.com/rules5 hex char bets, unclaimed rollover only for 1st prize, all others blend in. 20% of rollover goes to side pot.Shall we try it this way? I have put 100 in, and anyone wanting to help bootstrap this lottery is thus invited to put an outrageous amount of bets in the system  Only 25% will be used for jackpot but still. Just been playing. The general sensation is good, but one small thing kept bugging me, as setting the raise amount manually in the text box would never assume the changed value. If changing using the slide it works ok, though.The other thing I got is once Insti, which was already there, left while I was playing against LINKOU which had joined after myself, the whole thing slowed down to a crawl eventually killing the flash plugin with it. Might have been unrelated, but hey... I was considering a much simpler 'winner takes it all' setup, as taabl doesn't take absolutely nothing from the lotteries. But that may change, I could make it sponsor a server eventually, in which case a seeded pick 3 with a set prize could be interesting... I'll read over the rules and try to make sense of it I) Not yet, right? We're still playing with possibilitiesII) That's what the side pot would be in my latest planIII) That's actually a great idea! Once the system is stable and running on its own (and on a real server) I'll certainly take a stab at that!I copied the local state lottery, but they do two things differently:- keep 40% of the prize pool for themselves - Have millions of bets every weekIt's very easy to perceive value when you look at a million euro first prize, even though the chances are 13,983,816 to 1, with bet repetitions allowed. But they do prime the lotteries with a big first prize, and only the others are number of bets dependent. Remember the side pot, or rake or whatevery. After you do the 1000, and the whole of the 4000 BTC pot gets distributed, there's a 1000 pot priming, so it's not back to square 0.I know the math skill is always there, and the math simple enough for those so inclined, so my only defense is to make it too expensive to have a guarantee of profit. This is fun for me, and if I had 10k coins I'd certainly be able to bootstrap this is a much more appealing way, but I don't. And I'm not asking anyone to do so when there is nothing to give in return Keeping it 3 digits will prevent the pot from getting interesting, basically, as you state there at the end. There are other ways of preventing that (like securing 10% of the tickets to myself on opening a draw) but frankly I'd want this to be as independent as possible... I feel very torn about how to best move forward, and I don't want to get into the "pick 3" until I leave this one running on its own. So, my thoughts right now are that we need to make sure that prizes are interesting for new draws, rollovers exist to increase capture of new betters but guaranteed jackpots are needed to share the wealth. Also, if jackpots increase we need to make sure that it doesn't pay off to just buy all the tickets and walk away with guaranteed profit...My only defense against that latter part is the 2% bounty (unless the bounty recipient is the one doing this, of course  ) so the jackpot must always be smaller than the 2%, making sure that if you buy all the tickets you end up with a loss. This is supposed to be about luck, not good math skills!So far, I have:- No duplicate bets- Rollovers of only the 1st prize, all others get paid in the draw- 20% of rollover goes to side pot, used when jackpot is won- Whenever the side pot reaches an interesting level (say 1000 btcs) there's a guaranteed jackpot draw, where the 1st prize is also divided.- 5 character bets with prize distribution:5 hits: 25%4 hits: 10%3 hits: 12%2 hits: 16%1 hit:  35%bounty: 2%You'll notice that I reduced the 1st prize in half and upped all others, effectively distributing 73 percent of the pot in every draw, thus making it worth it to play right from the start. And for someone to guarantee 73% of the pot they'd have to spend 65536, 1310 of it going to the bounty, and 16384 going to 1st prize slice. Assuming one does not get first prize (although chances are 1 in 16, which is not too bad) the accumulated jackpot would need to be around 20k to be worth it. Because 20% of rollover goes to side pot, that pot reaches 1000 when the jackpot reaches 5000, thus eliminating that chance (we could go higher with the side pot, but for now that would mean too much time between guaranteed jackpots, I guess).Would this work for you? I locked the current draw as only my 100 BTCs are in so far, but will unlock if you rather have things as they are, but I really think that we need a better plan, and I like this one 
Too late! Ok, it seems to have gone fine regardless of the fact that I was sleeping during result processing 10 3rd places, 3 winners, me being the big winner this time (I was the big looser last time, even though I won  ). Got myself 7 x 3rd places, for a total of 82.32, which will go directly to the next draw. Everyone else, thanks for playing and for those who won, congrats!Lets make the next one a big one, shall we?  Because there were no repeating numbers I decided to go ahead and make the unique bets on this one. I'll still keep the no rollover rule, but the next one will be different  Now, because we'll have almost one full week up to the next one, I'll be happy to change that in the mean time if you convince me to do so.Here's what I've changed:- No more ticket cancelling (you can still cancel pending bets though)- Bets are unique, no repeating, limit 4096 bets on the draw. Will add a fourth character to the bet if we exhaust this, and will also add the 'set your own price' on the tickets sometime in the future.- You can see your earnings (if any) on the closed draw details page.- Roll over of prizes is back... but am working on side pot and limit for 'guaranteed jackpot' draw.If any of the betters of the current draw disagree... PM me your BTCIN and I'll cancel your tickets PS: this current draw is not on automatic pay yet, as I've done extensive changes to that code. So, while your prizes will be advertised promptly after the result is known, the actual prize will only be distributed to the accounts after I double check the thing. Right, if one is on this to try and make a buck, I guess one can do that. But I brought this on myself, by trying to build a community lottery, where there's no one owner that takes part of the cake for its own benefit. I try to disclose as much as possible because I like numbers and stats, but most of the issues would not appear if I had decided to hide the information from the start... I deserve this But I guess that if everyone buys random (I'll probably change the interface to do one click ticket buying) then the bets are spread correctly. If you like one particular number, well, then you can buy it. If we were on the million possibility scenario, I could make it so you can't repeat bets, period. But 4096? I hope we'll see more bets than that soon, especially with jackpots.However, I can easily make it so you can't repeat numbers, and add the possibility of setting the price on tickets, as was asked before. That way, if you like a number *and it wasn't taken yet* you can buy 100 BTCs of it Hmmm, I like that, no repeating numbers could work. I'll try that in for the next one, maybe? Oh, and I forgot, the buying of all non duplicate tickets problem will be addressed by me removing the bet cancel, and only showing the bets after draw is locked. But when you buy random you are guaranteed to have unique bets at that point in time, at least until 95% of the bets are taken. Ok, this is becoming a little daunting for me I know there will always be different opinions, and it's hard to find a solution that is agreeable to everyone, but I feel like the current plan simply sucks, so we need a better one.The 2 problems we are facing are:- Make sure people want to bet, even though there's no added pot- If there is a jackpot, how to make sure the ones that bet *only* on the jackpot don't gain an unfair advantage over all others, whose bets make up the jackpotThe former was supposed to be solved by not having rollovers, but that didn't really work out. I think the only way to to solve this is to have rollovers, and probably to have an initial pot.The latter is somewhat more complex, and the only way I see this going is for guaranteed jackpot games (the ones with no rollover) to have a longer bet string, thus making it hard to cover the whole bet range. This doesn't deter you from buying 4096 ticket spread such that you cover all 3 char possibilities, but because 1 hit prize percentage in the 5 hit draws is almost 4 times the 2 and 3 hits, the jackpot gets distributed in a way it doesn't really pay off doing so, while giving you every reason to at least buy 16 tickets I think that will make the system run smoother, but on top of that I would do a side jackpot, taking some 20% of every rollover. Once the big jackpot is won, either by 3 hits or by guaranteed jackpot, the side jacpot is used to prime the next draw.There are 2 things open, one is how to decide when to do guaranteed jackpot, my gut feeling is when the rollover is bigger than 4096, but we can also do time based, like when the block count crosses the 10k boundary (every 10 draws effectively).The other thing is the fact that we are dealing with 20 people betting, and that number needs to at least be tenfold so to make this interesting, but once that happens, is the 4096 possibilities enough? I'm guessing yes, until we see one single better take more that 50% of the bet space, but that is something to worry further down the line.This next draw, completing soon, will be just like the first one, but the next should have new rules set. I'm going to start it based on the same rule set, just because time is short, but I really think we need to do something in the lines of what I've described. I feel the same, really.How about the rest of you, what do you think? No, rollover was removed as explained in a previous post. I will add to the next one what would rollover from this though... if you check http://taabl.datlatec.com/details?blocknr=76775 you'll see that the sum of 2nd + 3rd + bounty equals 330, all the bets. Ok, fair enough. Lets leave it manual for now, I'll add the option in the near future. So this means you get 0 warning that you won a prize, or that the draw has ended. Given the 'anonymous' thingy, I'm not asking for emails... I can implement ways of giving that information out, though, like RSS or IRC bot. But that's very low on my list for now, hit refresh often  And that is why you have those backups... you do backup, right???  Indeed, and congrats to all the winners!!!I got 3 x 3rd places, which means I lost a whole bunch of bitcoins, and yet I feel like a winner So, 8 winners, a single 2nd place takes the large slice. What stats would you like to see appearing? I'll show you what you won on the finished draw details, and keep the ticket list for downloading indefinitely. Anything else? Any statistics? Just name it Now, payment, I'm going to bite the bullet and run the payment script, which will deposit the prizes in the taabl accounts. Next time it will send the prizes directly to the BTCOUT address, as part of my strategy of making this very anonymous (you don't need to log in and withdraw, thus leaving your IP address behind, just paranoia 101). Anyone objects this?I'm hoping to get a lot of feedback, so bring it on! And obviously I failed at the most important snippet of code in the whole system: I'm comparing drawblock < currentblock, meaning we need to wait for one more block sorry guys, next time it works as expected. I'm actually quite nervous about my code handling the real thing I'm a veteran at these things, why does it still happen? Aha, yes, I get it now! Well, sure, why not. The way the thing is coded already supports this, though the interface doesn't. I'll run some tests, I'm sure I can put this in soon. As I run the final tests to the prize distribution without the unclaimed rollover, it occurred to me: If we let the unclaimed prizes be evenly distributed on the claimed pot... should we not go back to the 5 characters bets? Yeah, chances of hitting all 5 are 1 in 1048576, but the prizes are split down, so it just adds to the distribution of prizes. Can I get the next one on 5 chars, people?The prizes could then be, as initially proposed:1st prize - 5 characters correct - 50%2nd prize - 4 (rightmost) characters correct - 6%3rd prize - 3 (rightmost) characters correct - 8%4th prize - 2 (rightmost) characters correct - 9%5th prize - 1 (rightmost) character correct - 25%bounty pool - 2%open to discussion I'll open a quick, 3 digit draw at 77000 (that's 225 from the one open now!) just to even out the numbers, we can discuss till then. After that, we'll be at every 1k as decided. Yes, but when the dollars get stolen/spent, you no longer hold the bills. It's pretty obvious that something happened.If you could spend based on the serial of the bill, or something alike, that would be a good analogy. Huh? I don't get it, can you expand on your reasoning here?And you will get it... but not on the 'classic' lottery. There will be, when I get around to finishing it, a parallel 'pick 3' game on the site, on which you buy a number and that number is in play until someone hits first prize, taking the whole pot. The 'number' (it's a number in the hexadecimal form, so I guess it's safe to call it that) will be matched against every future block until there's a winner, as proposed. Good eye you have there. Fixed on the development version, will be up for next upgrade. Thanks! Almost there!Remember, this one will not pay up automagically, as I need to double check the numbers first. So have some patience if you do win....As for the poll so far, consensus on ticket price (1BTC) and draw interval (1k blocks). That much is settled for now.a) Cancel tickets:  1) remove completely - 3 votes  2) allow for 100 blocks after ticket registration - I would vote this one  3) allow till draw locked - 1 voteI'll remove the ticket canceling for the next draw, and we can discuss if its better for most that wayb) Other bets visibility  1) only show when draw is locked - 2 votes  2) show but don't state number of duplicates - I would vote this one  3) show everything, all the time - 2 votesWell, it's a draw, so I decide We will go with 1, but with the knowledge that random bets will not repeat numbers already registered. So if you choose a number, you choose a number, your call. But if you buy one ticket, you buy one unique ticket at the time, which might become a dup if someone manually selects your number, but only that way.The exception to the random uniqueness is when 95% of available numbers have been taken, to avoid taking too much time going for the holes.c) Unclaimed prizes  1) Just roll over to the next draw - 1 vote  2) Just add to the prizes actually won on the same draw - 3 votes  3) do 1) but when pot reaches 5000 (or some other number) do a special "Guaranteed Jackpot!" which is just 2) above - guess what my vote would be?I still feel that 1 is better than 2 in the long run, but I get that you don't feel the same way. The only way I can see this keeping interest by high pots is from human intervention  I am going to try and keep at least 50% of the total bets for as long as I can (just like I do right now) to up the pot, and we do 2). All donations made to the address in the site will be used for betting, I'll try to keep a log of what I bet and earn, just for kicks. If anyone wants to do that instead of me, that is also fine... I'll post that person's address on the site with an explanation of what is happening.We'll revisit this at some later date.All good? I'm going to quickly code the blend in of unclaimed prizes real quick, and hope it doesn't break everything  Superb! Thanks a lot. Well, the rules haven't been written down, and all my extra time has been spent testing and fixing. But that particular scenario has been mentioned a couple of times before... 1 ticket = 1 prize. You don't get on second and one third if you get one first...Is this something you'd like to see changed? If so, why?I'm just mimicking the local state lottery on this one, really. It also makes prize calculation easier, but only marginally so 
Ok, so what's wrong with the simple standard fstream usage from that snippet I mentioned? I think simple is best But if you are already using features from boost::filesystem you can use copy_file from that. I just think that, if not already required for something else, it's a tad overkill. Don't get me wrong here, you obviously know way more than I do about this, but just indulge me for a little longer if you can.You say buy every ticket not taken so all dups are working for you, but then you show math where you buy *all* the tickets and only one other is bought. On top of that you assume the one duplicate ticket is not the winner. This is where I think things go crazy, as we're talking about optimal situations which are not, I believe, remotely real. If you don't buy every ticket then the chances of ever winning the prize get substantially smaller and not every ticket is the same.There's 1 change in 16 for everybody to share 25% of the pot, and 1 in 256 of sharing another 25%. So if I buy 256 tickets wisely chosen to cover all 2 digit combinations, I have secured 15 64BTC in 3rd prizes and 68BTC in 1 2nd. Not enough to cover my bet, so you actually make a profit unless I hit first prize, which I have a 4% chance of doing...I just proved your point, didn't I?Damn...So what can I do to deter this? add a number? Right, that and the full list of *active* bets should be all the disclosure needed... thanks! I get all that, the tendency to balance. It just doesn't apply on a small timescale (within a few years small) when you get one draw per week. It might, and it might just have you loose every single time. You play poker, you know about probabilities, and yet it's not the math wizard that makes it to the high stakes tables, it's the guy who can read other people's behavior and uses that to get some leverage.That is just wrong. Your bets go to the pot in full, but you don't take the whole pot if you win. Poker? sure, but not lottery. The first ticket gives you a chance of winning, at best, 0.5BTC, and it did cost you 1BTC. The second? in a perfect world an extra 0.24, so you are not even making up for the initial bet. It only levels out because many people play and, if you were to make no duplicates, the bets would be spread so well that prize distribution would suck even more.But I get it, eventually you'll bet, as well as many others and only you will win, making up for all the other losses. I say go for it! The more the merrier... Ok, ran some numbers, made a few bogus attempts with past data, seems like a good bet, but I have one problem I need some help with: How am I going to give the better some assurance I'm not cheating?In the lottery I give out all bets before the result is known, so I can't make up numbers after the fact, but here I don't know... I could just show all bets all the time but that would still not prevent me from adding a winning bet a second before the block arrives... don't know what I can do here, other than say 'trust me', which is all fine but, I don't know, feels weird. It does, noone is arguing that, I believe. It's your assumptions that are slightly off There was this statistics professor that started the first year class with the following pearl about averages (loosely translated):"Statistics are like a bikini, showing almost everything but hiding the most important... If you and me both go and eat together, I eat two chiken and you eat none, on average we each had one, but I'll be stuffed and you'll be hungry."The error, in my non educated opinion, is one of historical averages. Take the coin toss example:you throw a coin 10 times, 8 of them it falls on tails. What would you say your chances are of hitting tails the 11th throw?Amazingly, they are 50%. Every time 50%. Regardless of how many times you throw them. This is not true for a physical coin, as it may have unbalanced weight or whatever, but still the same applies.You are assuming that if you keep betting all numbers all the time, chances are that your losses and your gains will accumulate to void one another. Each time you bet is a different time, same possibilities regardless of past prize history. It's a gamble, no matter how you dice your numbers (pun obviously intended)...You can minimize you chances of loosing by betting less or not at all, but your chances of winning depend on all the betters, not just on your own actions. Alright, I propose we vote:a) Cancel tickets:  1) remove completely  2) allow for 100 blocks after ticket registration  3) allow till draw lockedb) Other bets visibility  1) only show when draw is locked  2) show but don't state number of duplicates  3) show everything, all the timec) Unclaimed prizes  1) Just roll over to the next draw  2) Just add to the prizes actually won on the same draw  3) do 1) but when pot reaches 5000 (or some other number) do a special "Guaranteed Jackpot!" which is just 2) aboved) bet price  1) 1  2) 2  3) 5  4) depends on the pot that rolled over (assumes c:1) or c:3) )e) draw interval  1) every 1k  2) every 1k  3) every 1k, but if c:3) the Guaranteed Jackpot happens in 500 blocks, just to force people to pay attention to the site   4) every other 0.5kShare your thoughts! Oh no, you were clear. It's just the unspoken assumption that if you bet on uncovered numbers you'll win (and thus profit) that I find somewhat misleading Fixing your sentence:You bet on uncovered numbers and if you happen to win, and the chances increase with the number of bets you cover profit from when people duplicate each other, knowing that the profit will be reduced and may actually be a loss even when you win as your number of bets increase. If someone lands on you, you take your bet down (while canceling lasts  ). Hey, I like that! I'll put some thought into it and maybe we'll have a test fest soon... Great idea! Except there's statistical advantage in doing that, unless the number of of 'other betters' is very low, and that defeats the monetary advantage, right?I mean, if there are few uncovered numbers, your investment is small, payoff potentially big, chances of getting it small.If there are many uncovered numbers your investment is that much bigger, chances go up in accordance and the payoff just gets smallerIn any case there is absolutely no guaranteed return of investment, mainly because you're not investing  It's a bet and what you bet on, how much you bet is only one part of the equation. The other part, what other people do, affect you greatly and you have little or no control over... maybe you can influence other betters, but that's that. My idea here was; I'm waiting for 2 confirmations, which can take 20 minutes or so. A new user comes in, makes the transfer and wants to play, but can't coz the coins are in transit. He can come back, sure, or he can bet (random 10, in your example) and as soon as the coins arrive the system places the bets. This was supposed to be part of a bigger plan, an auto better, so you can leave an open bet to be played on each draw, if you go on vacations But I see no harm in removing that, sure. I would then remove the pending and the cancel, is everyone ok with this? My argument is that if a considerable number of people bet less than you, say 200 bets of 20, chances are you'll be dividing the amount you put in with them, thus effectively doing charity for all the winners As a  side note, this was part of the decision of letting unclaimed prizes roll over to next draws, giving them higher jackpots or, alternatively, using the full bet pot on the current draw, blending in unclaimed prized with the for for those actually claimed.In the latter approach, betting all possibilities would, I believe, be even more harmful, as in the former at least there's an accumulated jackpot to add as incentive to your bet. How about instead of a blind draw, I still allow you to see bets, and those that you made BUT not duplicates? Each bet appears exactly once. Then, when the draw is locked, full bets appear and are downloadable for auditing. In the spirit of full disclosure, the canceling of bets is a safety feature... for me It was never intended to be used in the spirit of "I will bet, because I can cancel", but rather as a fallback if you happen to have 1000 pending tickets and instead of sending 10 BTC you send 1000... this way I don't have to manually go and fix it for you.Now, I can completely remove the bet cancel, or I can put a timer on it. Bets can be canceled up to 100 blocks from when they were registered? so you have a margin, but there's no analogy to 'chargeback' behavior in the lottery. It has just occurred to me, should I not lock canceling bets in the couple of days that precede the draw? I mean, I could put 2000 coins in just to drive people to bet more and then retract 1950, which would lead to a much lower pot, but eventually much bigger for me than it would be without the bait.I would still allow bets to be put up to 6 blocks (~1hour) before the draw conclusion, but would lock canceling maybe 25% through the draw? say 250 (~1.25 days) blocks for a 1000 block draw interval?I won't do it on this draw, as it is almost up *and* I hold most of the bets, which I will not retract, but for the next one? That is the way things are implemented  One ticket, the highest prize. Right! We have enough pyramids already, so I'm going down the viral path... So every time I get one I pay 3, it's just a pitty so few have joined so far, I'm already repeating addresses. It's a sad thing, this society we live in that so easily puts a price tag on our chicken. How can we do that and sleep at night? Well, it's well deserved if you do. Your help, and that of TTBit has been most refreshing.But... you do realize that now, with the added 150, the odds are totally on my side, right? :-) Lotteries are all about masses. Lots of betters == more for the winners.I guess I couldn't expect a flood of bets right from the start, so we need to get the word out. I didn't want to just spread the word like wildfire because this is very experimental and I can only cover for so much if things go bad But lets get some numbers out: The largest better has 26 BTCs in the draw which is 20% of the total bets, the 2nd and 3rd prize pools are at 28, so that doesn't make it very interesting. First prize is 60, for less than 1% chance of getting it, not very interesting.I'm guessing a tenfold increase in the bets (so for 1200 total prize pool) things would get interesting. This would only happen if we see a tenfold increase in betting, which at this point is not very much likely, or we get some from the previous draws. I can, and will, make the pool of unclaimed prized blend in to the current pool if everyone really just wants to get a cut and be done with it, but I really think it would be much better to let the prize pool for the next one grow, this all assuming noone gets 1st prize, of course With all that, I'm going to bet an extra 150 BTC and any prize I get from that I'll use to bet again on the next draw, just to kick up interest a notch. I will need to make a decision on the unclaimed prize distribution today, so speak up now. I'm still very much biased to moving unclaimed to the next draw as initially planned.
It's not as complicated as it may seem at first read. Basically it's just making sure the whole cake is distributed on that draw, regardless of there being no 1st prizes.I like the 1000 / 2BTC + 500 / 5BTC for those 'guaranteed jackpot' idea... would that deter you from playing?sig of lottery details... hmmm, that's a great idea. * nelisky pushes sig to top of todo list Yes, I saw your other post and I really like the poll of addresses, but we still need a way to easily back up when those get all used, don't we? I know the address space is huge, but there might be applications that deliver thousands of addresses per day.Great on all accounts, name and implementation approach. As for the file copy, why add to the boost dependency? I for one would love to get a core lib with very little deps. In C++ you can just use standard file streams, can't you? Something like http://www.dreamincode.net/code/snippet2306.htm (out of a quick google, didn't try but looks correct).To put the cherry on top, why not add a trigger that makes the copy whenever there's a change to the wallet? Well, this would depend on file locking to work properly and that sucks on windows iirc. Been a while since I had to code there  Bitcoin Watch has implemented a way to check all details of a block, including the hash we will be using for the lottery:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=928.0This is a good way of confirming the result is correct for users that don't wan't to/can't recompile bitcoin with getblock. Now you don't have to take my word for it Major thanks to Bitcoin Watch. The most important feature in 'community controlled' is, imo, trust. And trust is gained through disclosure. Think about my lottery site, I am actively preventing suspicion by providing everyone with as much information as possible, including the distribution of bets, so when I say there were 5x2nd prizes, that information can be checked against data that existed before the winning result was chosen.On the same train of thought we could do accounts based on alias + public key, and allow people to choose their trusted parties (or untrusted, +1/0/-1). If we then disclose the alias trust linkage, I'm sure that all the smart people around here could detect suspicious movements. How could this system be broken? If I create 100 users that all trust my real user, then that user has +100, but none of the 100 fake users is trusted by anyone, so no profit there. But if my real user get trust points from the community, and I trust the 100 that trust me back, this would be slightly different, unless I don't care about who else trusts you, unless they are already in my web of trust.But I digress, and I need to work  Wow, a trust linking system that doesn't require any personal data, that is freakin' awesome. Kudos to you for thinking of that It does sound a little daunting at implementation. You mention p2p distribution, which makes it somewhat complex. A centralized, community controlled site would work too, no? But what about in the long run? You don't want to see very large jackpots there?You are the ones in charge though, if you prefer blend down to rollover I'll just do it... but read my previous post, might be a good middleground. Right, in a nutshell keep the 3^16 until we exhaust most of the betting space. Raising the ticket price is actually a great idea, funny how it didn't ever cross my mind. I thought about lowering so people would buy more tickets thus improving their chances of winning, but the pots would invariably be smaller.I'll adapt the code to cope with different ticket prizes, and open the next draw. I'm inclined to go 78000 / 5BTC *if* the first prize gets moved over, and 78000 / 2BTC if someone wins it.For now it's ok to experiment, but I want this automated so I need to get a set of rules down. As before, everyone's help is appreciated:- make draws at 1k block boundaries for primed pots, 2k for empty ones- 1k draws @ 2BTC, 2k @ 1BTC- If the pot reaches *SOME_NUMBER_HERE* a special draw, at the next 0.5k boundary is held with tickets @ 5BTC, where the total pot is guaranteed to be distributed like this:  - For every prize without winners that amount is distributed by the prizes with winners, keeping their relative proportions  - for example a 1000BTC prize pool would pay 500 to 1st, 240 to second, 240 to third. If there is no second the 240 get divided 162 / 78 added to 1st / 3rd.  - with the same base as above, no first prize would add 250 to each 2nd and 3rd prize poolsWhat do you think? What could the *SOME_NUMBER_HERE*? Should we do time span instead?Was just trying to be sarcastic. No web server is ever fully secured, and in this particular case I only have the basic walls, I'm not being paranoid. Well, not about penetration, but the hardware failure does get me kind of nervous, after the story of the lost 9k BTCs, so there I'm maybe a little over the top, with RAID10 + on site backup + off site backup. But hey, today it's 120 BTCs, which I can cover from my (virtual) pocket, but tomorrow... Just looked it up and... go figure, that IS the name of the movie!  "Amazing coincidence?" - he says while while blushing ever so slightly. Perfect, works great for me. Thank you. You know what would really help me as a buyer? If I could filter out all the 'Ships from USA, no international' auctions. I see stuff I like at a price I'd pay, only to find seller will not send to me.Is that possible? Just Europe / USA / Everywhere else would be good enough (for me). What is the error the RPC calls return? And more importantly, how can I simulate this? Can you add a flag to start the server in degraded mode? Ok, thinking this through, it only gets interesting if we do pseudo-random donations (viral style). I say pseudo because I'll send first to the people I like, then to those I don't know  The fw payment should be done in any particular order? The 3 addresses posted after mine? Any 3 addresses posted after mine? Any 3 addresses?Is this viral or pyramidal? :p  This reminds me of a movie of which I don't know the original name, but covered the viral approach in helping people out and getting them help other people out in exchange...My address: 1Mz6PNnCJ1cwVK3qaH66QtCko5oNaHN4a I may have mislead you to believe I play an active role, my wife does all the hard work In all seriousness, I work from home, we travel a lot, my wife is dedicated to education in many ways, and thus is the perfect educator for our kids. But they will be going to regular school this year, as they are now teens and, quite frankly, we have done our share. Now they have the tools to 'survive in the wild' or so we like to think. It is part of the process I guess. I see you do  We have done the same for the past few years, and have even joined in with a group of people to open an alternative school, but it's quite a struggle. Even those who consider themselves alternative are way more biased than they think, and in a frightening, so are we.We don't tiptoe around knowing things will collapse, mind you. Every single one of us knows the thing is dying and we "blame the government", we "blame the EU", we "blame the immigrants", in a nutshell, we "blame everyone else".But while this is really bad for the country, as very little gets done, it does provide kind of a safeguard if you're trying to live an alternative life.Yep. Things will change as their economy grows, I guess, but there's a set unspoken way of doing things that is cultural. Financial overlords go to great lengths to overpower and effectively transform cultural traditions, so as to use them to their own benefit (think Coke - why is santa dressed in red again?) so the danger is always there, but I have hopes the whole global system will collapse due to excess awareness from the people... one can always hope! So, as many others, I need to backup wallet.dat. And since this one is on a server, I need it to happen unattended. And because this server is being used by the lottery, I must not shutdown bitcoind.So far I just copy the file over, and do it often so I can outlive one corrupted file. But this is not ideal, as I should backup after every transaction (sent, right? no new addresses are created on receiving a transfer ) or after everytime I create a new address.For that I thought about instead of copying the file I could use db_dump to dump it's contents, using the -r flag just in case. Would that work?The ideal solution would be an rpc call that would either:- flush and lock updates until a new rpc call (any call, didn't need to be an unlock command) would come over- flush and cp wallet.dat to a side file- flush and dump through jsonrpc. If each key would come separate in an array, we could then call this with 'lastseen=X' to just get new keysCould this work? Which would work best? Not any more, right? I'm experimenting with mongodb replication, which implied a db server restart, sorry about that. And education, and the environment. It's a sad truth, we're mostly all sheep. But all it takes is a good sheppard.... No, I live in Portugal. You probably will do alright in Portugal when the US comes to grips with the fascist state they are (there, I fixed that for you). Our government sucks, our system is always in the verge of collapse but we still are very down to earth people and the truth is that we are years behind most every other country which, in my personal opinion, is a major bonus. And the beaches where I live are great.I do go to Brazil often enough and have very dear friends there, so if you ever need to quickly escape I can make your arrival easier From an  economic view, Brazil is probably the best place to be right now. They not only have a growing economy, unlike everyone else, but they also still accept that people will do business with people, not just with taxed businesses. It's a reality they don't fight.They even have a name for people who run local businesses without having an formal business. We call them illegal, they call them informal... it's beautiful. http://qrcode.kaywa.com/ with which you can encode strings and urls and the like, and finding a reader for mobile phones with webcams is really easy. Maybe we could even develop a specific app for doing that, paying bitcoins to addresses captured using qrcode or another 2d barcode schema, by passing the address to mybitcoin or something.It could take bitcoins to the outside world (literally), people!
Right. I don't think we can hold the 3 character bet for long, if this ever picks up. That's a 4096 values bet space, so if we ever exhaust 50% of that, I guess it's time to move on. I would probably go for cheaper bets, less probable hits, but I can understand that not everyone thinks like that.Yep, I think alike. But I didn't make the lottery so people can donate, it's more like touching the greedy bone of people (even if they then get the rewards and distribute to whoever, it's their bitcoins). Everybody likes to win, and while greed is a big problem in the world today, that is only because it's misdirected. There's nothing wrong with wanting to win the lottery, and if you do, what you do with the prize actually tells more about yourself that "it's better if I just donate my 10 bitcoins to someone". In my personal opinion, that is.I don't know if I understood your proposal, but I don't care for it too much. If you win the bet you get the prize, so then you can give it to anyone, it's up to you. Why should that be part of the framework? Unless, of course, I was to get rid of the bounty purse and just use that, but I honestly am very fond of the bounty purse This is not 'my site'. I designed it so I could try some new stuff, specifically mongodb and the tornado web server (*) and it is just fun to keep. The problem is I take my pet projects very seriously and I don't just want to put my own view of how things should be in there. Please keep giving your opinion, I need it!(*) Yes, there is no sql injection path here. Just thought people should know as someone lost some time trying that a couple of days ago. There are other paths into this system, as it is not secured properly, so have fun trying  So what kind of warning do admins get from bitcoind? Is there something we can grep from debug.log? Or will rpc calls raise some specific error? Is there a way to locally force this to happen, for unittesting services? While you are obviously right in stating the current trend, there are some factors, like the slashdot effect, that will probably be repeated a few times still, but that are maintained in time, especially when you think on a broader time lapse. The bread index, or the milk index or any other basic product for that matter is just a reflex of my observation, not a science I grasp. I used to buy bread cheaper, in absolute values. Maybe taking inflation into account that is not so, but when Bitcoins, not having a Fed making it's value decrease to 'stabilize' the economy, stay at the same value per dollar while 1 dollar buys less bread, I guess you can call it deflationary. It's not that bitcoins are worth less, much the opposite, but this goes against what most everyone is used to, or has been taught is "normal".Not at all. I'm a native Portuguese speaker. I do have a *lot* of exposure to English, in its most varied forms, though  Hmmm, I could get a BTCIN that would have a BTCOUT to whatever charity, but that would only pay if one of the bets wins. That's what the bounty purse is all about. The more we bet, the more goes to the recipient. I unilaterally decided for the faucet on this one because that's where my first 5 bitcoins came from. And I have worked closely with mtgox, made a little profit I must say and have put an ad to them because I like their work very much. So next up is mtgox, I guess.Also, because the default client doesn't allow checking the block hashes, I asked Bitcoin Watch to add that to their services, and that is apparently going forward. An independent way for users to check the hash I post as lottery result is the correct one. So they are next in line for the bounty.In a nutshell:- Bitcoin Faucet- MtGox- Bitcoin WatchI would really like your input on two more things:- Is the 6 day (1200 blocks) between draws a good choice? If I make them daily, the prizes will probably be too small. If I make it monthly, I guess people will loose interest, but I could make it every 500 blocks, or 1000, or whatever... what would work best, in your opinion?- The 2% for bounty arrangement was just a number. I actually wanted to go 10%, but thought that would take too much of a slice from the prizes. Given people's inclination to donate, maybe I could go up? Or as an extra provide, I don't know, 50% of the unclaimed prizes to the bounty purse, and the other 50% are added to the next draw?Keep in mind that if we start having big bets I'll need a real server, and that costs money, so unless someone donates a VPS somewhere we'll probably need to considers factoring that in too. I can keep the system as it is indefinitely, but there will be regular downtime (yesterday it was off for an hour, due to an IP change). I'll gladly donate my time to keep the thing running and updated.This has been a lot more fun than I thought it would be  the risk I mentioned was very well contextualized... I called it 'risk'. As in, not a real risk, but something that over and over again is discussed in the threads as a risk. People debunk that, explain, complain and eventually got bark at some other tree, because those who perceive deflation as a problem, or lack of inflation for that matter, are the majority and are pretty stubborn.I like the fact that Bitcoins are pretty stable, but that actually deflates them when compared to currencies (and notice I didn't say *other* currencies), because the same amount of Bitcoins within 1 year is supposed to be only mildly inflated while the USD will probably be much more so, hence 100 Bitcoins buys less bread, because bread in indexed to the USD. Of course, once there's enough critical mass behind the Bitcoin ecosystem we can index stuff to Bitcoins, but for the time being... Bitcoin is deflationary.I hope I got the terms straight, I'm not a native English speaker and while I know all the geeky computer terms, the financial theories and their terms escape me completely  Maybe I'm not as paranoid as I advertise, but I actually think there is a social interest in this. On the one side is everyone who, while looking for alternative currencies (because they are pseudo-anonymous, because their favorite mmorpg accepts it or 'simply because') don't really see with good eyes the deflation 'risk', or simply can't cope with following another currency, as because of that end up never adopting bitcoins.The described system would not overrun or replace bitcoins, but it would allow for a 'buffer mechanism' for those that want to use another currency (which is just dollars, as it is pegged to them, but goes by another name... think linden dollars, they actually have a huge user base). What I don't see is why would anyone take the effort and risk of running this service. It would be a sitting duck if governments ever come after this. I mean, it's dollars by another name, how can it not be a currency controlled by the feds?  Nice... this is very close (in philosophy, not implementation) to one of my wannabe projects, which is a connected exchange framework. It would 'copy' mtgox but operate on a different exchange pair, and under the hood both exchanges would fill out bids and offers by buying/selling bitcoins on the other exchange, if the exchange was favorable.So, having mtgox doing USD and mtclone doing EUR, and using the exchange rate for USD/EUR without any spreads, we could operate bitcoins in a way that their price actually fluctuates to negate the differences between to USD/EUR pair (assuming enough people trade on both exchanges). This is cool, but now imaging you do that for 10 other currencies too... Bitcoin would become pegged to the balanced average of *all* those currencies, not USD or EUR. I think that would do wonders to get the financial wiz dudes paying close attention to this system.I'm not a financially educated person, but I am a coder, so if I do find the time to put on this, I will create a package that anyone can use to create their own exchange site, and connect to others they trust as described above. Heck, I may even run one myself!The only thing still on the open is: how do we get the money in? Paypal is obviously not a good idea. In Europe we have very low wire transfer charges, so that could work but I don't know the legal implications of that. Right now duplicates appear twice, meaning you can assert exactly how many tickets have won by keeping a copy of the bets from before the result is out. I've now put the numbers you own in bold (I'll add an underline later) so you can easily see if there are dups amongst your bets.If to that I add a download link once the draw is locked, would that be enough to prevent me from cheating? I don't see any other safe way taking advantage (bar stealing the actual bets).I didn't think that was possible. As the difficulty makes the average ~6 blocks per hour, even holding 20% of the CPU power you can be pretty sure that without those 20% the network would still resolve ~5 blocks per hour. But I'll take your word for it, and honestly I added this locking not to avoid that particular race, but to prevent people from canceling all their bets just before the result, something that would be very hard to explain to other betters: "I don't know where all the money went, it wasn't me, I swear" Having said all that, I'm targeting one draw per week so holding back 3 hours / 18 blocks would be just fine. I have this idea of, once the system is tuned, making a lower bid, faster turnaround set of draws, say .05 per bet, 2 days, to allow people that just get some from faucet to at least feel a little thrill, but its all about critical mass. The site has been having wonderful reception, but it needs to hold a good number of "returning gamblers" to make it fun. In theory, when there are two block to go to the draw, all is locked up, including the pending ticket acquiring. So it should be safe. If confirmation of the deposit comes after the draw is locked, it simply goes to your account balance, and the pending tickets stay that way. Thank you, you're too kind. And the nice words totally offset you calling me predictable, so we're good I didn't mean to say no one will answer. I would answer the poll, but I'd just lie about the 'too personal' question that allow anyone that lays hands on this data (who controls it? how safe is it?) to gain leverage on me. Country? sure, there's 10 million here and it's a very small country, but age? Too specific. Suddenly it's 27k possibilities where I live, taking 365 days in a year into account. Add gender and it halves that. Gather some more data from the thread posts and you know who I am. No can do.Many will answer because they feel it's a service to the community, getting to know our demographics, but is it? We're opening the door to exposing unknowing users to getting their details on the wild, and remember although we are not all zealots, we all should be aware of the real danger of, if this thing gets raided, things getting ugly for all that traded bitcoins. I don't live in the US (obviously) so I'll be safe, but is everyone else?I'm not trying to convince you either way, but I'm not one of the 'crazy privacy freaks'... well, maybe I am, but still I just feel very uncomfortable when the unwanted disclosures that may hurt us are started from within the community itself, with the best intentions I'm sure, but that's just too much detail you're asking imho. Random bets are now unique on the whole draw, until there's only 5% of bet space left, at which point it just takes any number.You can see the bets for the draw in the details page. I added a blank when bets are not in sequence or duplicated, to indicate a 'hole'. I'll try to make that downloadable once the draw is locked, so everyone can verify the prize distribution when the result block gets issued. I think that's as much disclosure as it is possible, but if you'd rather have some more information, speak up. You're kidding, right? I mean, collecting that kind of data when we're struggling to stay as anonymous as possible, kind of makes me giggle... and then get seriously worried.Sorry for the bluntness, but I for one tell no one my age  "I have a plan..."So you say you want the random to be unique, right? It just sidesteps a bit from 'random' when we get picky, but a subset of random should be random enough, I guess.As for the list of tickets public, I didn't want to do that while the bets are on because, well, it felt wrong. But I can't find a reason in logic to substantiate that, so if there are no objections I'll make a list of *all* taken numbers.Remember that 2 blocks from the end the bets are locked, and that's when I though I'd be introducing the list, but I can do it before.What more information do you need to make sure I (or any other future operator) am not stealing? Knowing the numbers provides you with enough knowledge to block me from stealing a top prize but not from stealing a lower one. For that you need a list of bets *and* how many tickets exist on each bet... How should such data be provided?I'll start by just posting a list of bets to a page, a big ol' dump, and then I'll think about something on the likes of a csv file that gets generated as the draw is locked. Is it just me or this conversation has had a very sudden sidetrack here? Unless the EFF has Australian offices and you'll be sending them the gold along with the letter, of course. For all of you doing random bets, right now I make sure these bets don't repeat themselves *within your tickets* but would it be useful to make them unique on the whole draw? Luck is luck, there's no real statistical gain for the individual to do it any other way, but we would cover much more betting space, thus making it more probable for the high prizes to be hit, if I were to spread random bets that way.What do you think, which do you prefer? And, if I do change this, you can always cancel all your tickets and buy them at random again, if you want unique bets system wide (unless someone else manually enters bets matching yours after you did that, of course). Yeah, well, kind of It does not log you in automatically, but it does tell you 'Registered!'. If you then log in from that page, you'll stay on the page and get a 'You are already registered' which is only slightly less confusing... but as it is working, that's low on my priority. Right, so here's what I did:An optional password can be set on register or in the account page. When set, you'll need it to change the BTCOUT address. You can change it too. That password is not needed for login, the BTCOUT is still the only information required by the system.There was another unrelated change that was logging people out when they changed BTCOUT. I've fixed that, but now everyone must log back in  It's not too much work at all, but it is a little daunting for basic users... I think asking them to provide a password on register, but allowing it to be kept blank (thus allowing BTCOUT to be changed just by knowing the original) would be a good trade-off. And then you can change that in the account page by changing or clearing the password, I guess.Will try that, thanks. Being open source does not mean every user is a coder (I am, but still) so I guess the point that "you can just roll out your own client" is a little off.But why is satoshi integrating this on the server in the first place? I say that the libbitcoin / bitcoinUI separation is starting to be really important. Put the messaging system on IRC on the UI, make the UI smart enough to stop, block, maim, impair the server running beneath it if certain messages signed with certain keys appear. But DON'T make the server respond to anything outside local GUI control, just because that is too dangerous and in the end does more harm than good.This way, average users will have the upgrade notices and the generators stopped and whatnot when needed, but those of us running services over bitcoin will not loose shop because of that. Also, if the key gets compromised, the network still runs without worries, and a simple GUI change will unblock everyone.For server admins, why not a mailing list for update announces? That would certainly be enough for most. Yeah, I make zero effort of asserting registered address is correct, and other than trying to send bitcoins over, I know not of a method to assert it... probably could patch bitcoind to add an rpc method for that, though.I can also check string length, I've just been lazy. But if I understand you correctly, it would be ok to deny changing the btcout so we can recover the account safety?
People, I've added the btcout edit and coin withdrawal, but I'm having second thoughts here... The reason I left the login based on btcout alone is because even if you can hack it, you won't be able to do much about it.That is no longer true, so if I hacked into some account by bruteforce (maybe try all addresses in the block chain? Probably someone is reusing addresses) I could now change btcout to something mine, cancel all open tickets and grab the dough. How can I avoid this? Ask for a password on register, and use that password to change btcout? Don't allow changing btcout at all (but them, if you make a mistake on register you are screwed unless I manually help you out, there goes the anonymous part).Help me out! So how simple is it? I'm just now thinking about foolproof backups on the lottery site I posted about yesterday, and I'm struggling to find information on this. Can bitcoind dump it in a safe state, or at least flush it on request? If I backup the file mid transaction, do I loose the whole thing or just the update in progress? When do I need to backup? Every outgoing transfer is obvious, there are key pairs created automagically, but what about transfers received? the key pair we already had, no new address needed to be created afaict. Or does bitcoin do the same change dance on the receive side too?This part is, I believe, the most critical of them all. While MSE and clock skews may prevent normal program usage, the wallet backup issues have made people loose a bunch of coins which, obviously, sucks and doesn't do much on supporting continued usage. I really don't see this as a feature, usability wise, but lets pretend for a minute I do. The difference between what is there now and the proposed 1 ticket / 1 address is that you have to send as many transactions as tickets you want to buy, each to a different BTCIN address, and provide as many different BTCOUT addresses to make the pairs. How would the UI work? Is this really worth the effort?On a different approach, I could force a different address pair for each draw. So when the draw ends, outstanding coins are returned and I delete the link on the inside. But then you'd need some reference to the individual tickets to be able to track status.How much can we do here without breaking the ease of use? So, a single ticket gets bought by the buyer providing an address, I'm with you so far...But what happens to that generated url? I will not be sending emails, as the thing is, you know, anonymous, and for a single ticket I can copy/paste, but imaging it's 200 tickets... or I could have a form where you enter the address and I give you the ticket status... but wait, don't I already do this??? It's the login form!Truth be told, the disposable address was the way I initially implemented this, but I tend to loose these addresses and, yes, if you add labels to the addresses you can recover, but it's a LOT of work for the regular joe, imho.You can, however, create as many accounts as you want. I'll eventually have a close account feature, that gives back whatever bitcoins it holds to the user address and then break the link. Lots of possible ways to go around this, but the one I have is, I believe, the best balance between anonymity and usability. I'm open to changing it, of course.  Yes it would, but the buying of tickets needs the open draw context. If I always keep one, and only one open then it should not be a problem. I need to write rules, faq, thank yous, etc and make a bunch of visual fixes and improvements to the site, but this has been a learning experience for me, and my attention has been elsewhere (bitcoind jsonrpc integration, new web engine, new template lang, new db).I will improve site navigation next, though, just because you asked first  There was an issue with the random generation, with a buggy bias towards lower numbers. Sorry about that Should be all fixed now. Updated the TAABL to move to the new prize schema, which is 3 character bets, prize distribution 50% + 24% + 24%.Also included a random bet generator, as requested. That's what I get for following a lottery that gets 4M in bets every week Yes, that sounds much better. So bets will get trimmed to 3 characters and prize would be 50 / 24 / 24 / 2 (bounty purse).The money going into the total pool also makes sense, seeing as we are a small community and chances are the jackpot will just grow bigger and bigger... We can also have a "special" draw every 3 months or so that just distributes the total including all jackpots by all the winning bets, even if they're all 1 hits.But your odds seem off. Isn't 2 hits 65536 variations, and 3 43046721? It just adds to your point, though. edit: Of course you are correct... nibbles, not bytes.The random will go in soon. I don't want to keep the 1 in a million, that was just my first guess. I want bitcoins to be distributed and with those odds... lets go with the 3 characters instead.Thank you! That would have been hash 00000000005936a8d5637765967ad4da3599596adf19879f5e65d6940da7fa64, so the winning sequence is 7fa64. Sure, they're all in the front page... as this is the first one, and hasn't finished yet, you'll find all the links were already available I call open draw, and it calculates current block + 1200 (around 6 days in the future). That's because I thought one per week would be perfect, but would you rather have one every couple of days or so, at least as we start?Thought about doing that, just didn't have time. Lets call that the next feature... Do you want me to make sure you get a random number noone picked yet, or just random?And just fyi, the system does check the bets, so you couldn't guess 1234z. It simply ignores that bet request if you try.Glad to know  I've put in 1 BTC myself, and will be betting throughout the week so as to test different scenarious.Best of luck to you I'm good at pretending  Lets say there were 100 bets, so total 100 BTC on that draw. Now say 30 tickets get the last character right, 3 get the last two and 1 gets the last three. This means that1st prize - BTC 50.00 - not taken2nd prize - BTC 6.00 - not taken3rd prize - BTC 8.00 - 1 winner, BTC 8.00 each4th prize - BTC 9.00 - 3 winners, BTC 3.00 each5th prize - BTC 25.00 - 30 winners, BTC 0.83 eachbounty purse takes BTC 2.00the unclaimed prizes, totaling BTC 56.00 get added to the 1st prize jackpot of the following draw. I had forgotten to mention that, mainly because I'm not sure if I shouldn't instead add that to the total prize pool of the next draw instead, thus upping all prizes, not just the 1st... hmmm, what do you think?As for the lottery numbers, they are the 5 rightmost digits of the bitcoin block numbered matching the draw, which you can verify using the getblock patch if you are compiling bitcoind yourself. I'm sure there are other places you can get that info from and, of course, that will get posted on the draw details page.It's kinda late, so that may be it, but I have no idea what you just said... That is TAABL for short So I needed a good excuse to start scripting on top of bitcoind, as I have a few projects in mind. But them being too time consuming I needed something smaller, which is why I ended up doing this.What is the TAABL, I hear you ask? Well, glad you asked  It's a lottery, where you bet on the last 5 characters of a specific block hash. I take nothing from the bitcoin pool, it is all divided as follows:1st prize - 5 characters correct - 50%2nd prize - 4 (rightmost) characters correct - 6%3rd prize - 3 (rightmost) characters correct - 8%4th prize - 2 (rightmost) characters correct - 9%5th prize - 1 (rightmost) character correct - 25%bounty pool - 2%I didn't just take these number out of my ass. They roughly follow the structure of a local state lottery. I can change them if you can convince me I should, though.The bounty pool is the 'charity' part, and one must always exist to lend some sense of reason to all those that bet. But what bounty will that be? Well, you can vote on what you want to see as recipients of that. This first one will most likely go to bitfaucet, but we also have EFF, some specific bounties that appear on the fora and, if this actually becomes a thing to keep doing, maybe pay for a site facelift or server costs.For now, everything is open. Three things to keep in mind for the adventurous betters:- This is really alpha quality code, I tested a bit but not so much to think things will go glitch free.- The site design sucks, and will stay that way until the server side is fine tuned. My availability to do this is limited, but I'll try my best to keep things running.- This is running out of an office server, meaning connectivity is far from perfect. Don't be too alarmed if the server disappears for a couple of hours, I promise I'll move this to a real server as soon as I can.So, some basic rules:- Each bet costs 1.00- You can put as many bets on the same character string as you want to- There is no way to see which numbers others have already bet on... I'm of two minds as to this being a feature or a problem- Although you put money to bet on your account, prizes are not put there, but rather sent directly to BTCOUT (explained below)- This first round will have payments processed semi manually, to make sure everything goes ok, so expect delays. It will all be automated later, when I'm comfortable with the processTo use this system you have to register, but what about the anonymous in the lottery name? Well, no personal data is requested, or even allowed. You give me one bitcoin address to which prizes will be paid, and I give you one bitcoin address to which you can send your bet bitcoins. These are BTCOUT and BTCIN respectively. The OUT / IN are always in relation to the TAABL, so it's easy to remember.Once you register, you can log in using the BTCOUT alone. As an almost random string of characters, I feel that using passwords is unnecessary. There isn't much you can do that is of harm if you use somebody else's account. If you feel otherwise, I'll come up with something better.When you are logged in, you can bet on the open lottery draw, and you can see the draw details. You can also cancel tickets you bought. All of this gets locked 2 blocks from the end of the lottery draw.Best of luck to all, and if you do hit the jackpot, you can always share the wealth with yours truly Check it out at http://taabl.datlatec.com Ouch, feelings were hurt, blood got spilled... I meant no harm there, fresno. Sorry if it came out way too harsh, I'm not shouting you down at all, far from that. I am, in fact, just stating my personal opinion on the fact that most of the threads I follow with interest tend to derail into semantics discussions. Nothing wrong with that, it's an open forum, but so much so other people not as interested in semantics, such as myself, feel the need to sometimes speak up.Nothing personal, I think your opinions are very insightful even when I don't agree with them  but, hey, just speaking my mind here.PS: I kind of pictured the two of us in a dusty road at sunset, facing each other ready to go for the guns, silence all around broken by the sound of you saying, in a deep voice: "You shout me down, I shout you down. You want that?" If it crosses my path before it crosses yours, I'll grab it and call you to do the kicking  And no, I'm not stalking you, just am in a mood for satire and your comments were the last in the last two threads I visited... see how lucky you are? I hope you're bitmining. Oho, oh no, no, no, no... Not that again! Please don't get yet another thread into the intrinsic value of things / is bitcoin a currency / why do my feet smell route. I was enjoying this one so far :p Yep, it's working all right. The number I had posted were from an old svn revision patched with tcatm's changes, but today I compiled trunk and while I had to once again tweak the makefile, after I did it works great with the numbers matching what I experienced before.Changes I did for my system are below, and while some are cosmetic, like removing wx-config from making bitcoind, just to avoid the warnings if you don't have it installed, others are system specific, like the DEPS dir, and the fact I don't have 32bit libs which makes the link step fail if -arch i386 is there.The bsddb changes are, I believe, a typo. Includes and Libs point to db46, but then the object list for the linker states db48.

Should you not randomize the sponsors for those that (like myself) registered less than an hour before you decided to randomize the sponsors? Think it would be cool. Or, you could allow us to change sponsors to someone down the pyramid if we are set to 1 (I wonder who that is :p ) And i5, at least on my macbookpro
Bingo! I've been following this thread and others thinking to myself "why the money obsession?". Even those that argue on different economic philosophies compare to money, use money, use the lack of money, money, money, money...I compare Bitcoins to beans... when we played cards as kids we used beans as measure of wins / losses. We didn't trade it for money, we didn't play for "make believe money", we played for beans. It worked because we all agreed that beans where the game measure, and because there was a limited supply of them (in our game table, that is).If we had some special engineered beans instead of Bitcoins, that took a full hour to produce a batch and for some quantic weirdness could only be produced one batch at a time in the whole universe, but anyone could try and grow them, we could use those instead of BTCs, with the obvious caveat of not being virtual, of course... They wouldn't be money, they would pretty much not have any value except for what you and your peers agree it had. It's the same. If I think you whispering 545 decimals from pi to my ear is worth me giving you a deed to my house, does that make pi, or it's value, a currency? I've never been to Sweden or Canada, but I can tell you that we pay a lot for our "free" health care, in form of mandatory taxes. Of course, the ones who can afford just pay those taxes *and* the private health care. It is certainly better for those of the lower income spheres, as they at least get the basic health care for free, but the invoice is still paid up by everyone.On a related note, I have been to Paris a couple of time and didn't get any 3-way action. It's just like minting bitcoins, I guess, you just have to be lucky Well, I don't think that is accurate, really. I may be more on the inside, as I have worked with / for US people most of my professional life, and have good friends scattered along most of the states, but we do know about the rivalries between 'neighborhoods', which you call states or parts thereof. Even the TV shows depict that all the time, and at least in Portugal we have every American show, and then some. The truth is that while that is changing slightly, we have always worshiped the States and everything that comes from that side of the pond, to the point where it's just nonsense. I love the States, and if it wasn't for immigration rules (I'm too proud to let my life be investigated just so I can live there, although I have nothing to hide) I'd probably be living there. I already pretty much work there!I don't know what your relation with Europe is, but believe me there is a world of a difference between the American States and the European Countries. Lets just say that Americans have a tendency of uniting against any external foe (an action I usually dislike, based on the way this is done, but the heart is certainly in the right place). We, Europe Countries, are each other foes for better or worst, and the fact that every one of us is taught how amazing we were in 'the times of our kings' and history is measured in thousands of years around these parts, the 'cultural bias' we tend to hold very dear for some reason makes us very unlikely to see our fellow Europeans as the same as us. It's sad, really.And again I get as off-topic as I can, just like on almost every other thread I comment on! I'll get myself banned eventually :p I'm game, for sure.

From my own experience, a change commited will always make some happier than other, but in the end everyone will get used to it, whereas reverting a change that is already in and doing one more change to copy with the reason why the reverted change was initially submitted will just make everyone confused. Proof of that is the phrase I just wrote down! While at the same time North American governments try very hard to teach their citizens to obey without questioning, and succeed at doing so by surrounding them with notions that outside America every country is lagging behind someway or another.Heh, sorry, I had to put some fuel in the fire, but I suck as a troll. Seriously though, our federal government? Europe, as a community, is a total failure. Each one of us, big or small, is so much convinced we have to best solution/society/enterprise/tax system/"add your own here" that the only thing we agree on is that we should all be granted subsidies... the exact distribution of them is obviously something we will never agree on for the reasons stated. So I really fail to see where you are getting your kicks from  But then you need to do so for all your addresses, and these get added on every transaction outbound... back to backing up wallet.dat, I guess, and that is exactly what the average user (heck, even the more technically inclined) will fail to do. I see the solution I proposed (or anything else, it's just an example) as something that could be done so it's a backup once and forget about it, although obviously for a limited time span, but this could be then supported in an automated way by a backup provider for a nominal fee, which I'd be glad to pay so I keep my bitcoins safe *and* still control the client, so I'm sure it's not all in some other server like mybitcoin. An alternative would be for mybitcoin to provide the private keys to the wallet so I could import them on my local client, basically using a single mybitcoin address as the 'savings account' and if in the future their server goes down in a big ball of fire I still have access to my bitcoins.Backing up would thus be transfering coins to that account. Granted, not backing up, but keeping bitcoins safe, with minimal user knowledge needed for the process. Speaking on behalf of the whole western europe, just because I happen to be the 4th most important individual here from a personal viewpoint, I'd just like to state that while I don't care for the tone of the thread comment asking, or rather, telling us to use the comma for 1000 separator, my decision that we should not care so much about the thousand separator as we must about the decimal separator is pretty set.So, because I've been working with computers since I can remember, and been bitten by the comma/point confusion often times, I declare all Western Europeans will use the dot as a decimal separator for bitcoins, and refrain from using that same dot in the thousands separator at all costs. Use commas, spaces, thin or thick, or even a pretty picture of yourself, just not dots.Unless you don't want to.There, I think that settles things. So, in theory, I could parse all the blocks, extract all the addresses and then make a tree of txins and txouts. With a little (a lot of?) effort, I could then try and split the txins from a txout into payment / change, effectively knowing which addresses belong to a single user. For those users that have a public address, this would be an unexpected disclosure.I know the 'splitting the payment / change' is somewhat of a flawed argument, there is no way of being 100% sure all the time, but some rules might apply more often than not:- Is there a txin for change = 0? This one is obviously from the sender- On transactions of high value, chances are the highest part is the change (the 8999 lost coins thread being one such example)- Future transactions from the change address will always carry the exact change amount + new txins, whereas the transfer receipient may very well already have a balance on the provided address.I'm sure that all the statistical inclined fellow bitcoiners, being presented with a large enough annotated sample of the transactions to date could come up with a hihg accuracy model. I know that when I transfer out, I generate 3 transactions, one for all in adress, one for new personal address with change and one to outgoing address with transfer amount.Now, if I generate one single address (or a batch of them) on a wallet, and encrypt and store that wallet somewhere/everywhere I can, will I be able to use it as the "savings account" by transfering to that adress(es) without ever needing to run a client with that wallet?With that and a 'backup' script that simply transfers all of my wallet except for some 'pocket money' to a fixed address, I can produce a safe backup of my bitcoins. This only gets somewhat more complicated when trying to take money out, but if we could have a way to import a keyset to the 'pocket money' client, we can then in theory be in possession of the whole balance for a specific address in the savings account, transfer what we want to keep there to the next address in the batch and the pocket money client would keep the change...Should be pretty simple to implement in a way even noobs can use safely (maybe even provide an encrypted wallet.dat safekeeping service?) if only we could do:- generate a batch of addresses- encrypt and store the wallet holding these addresses- keep these addresses in a format we can later import individually into the everyday bitcoin client- allow for listing these addresses from the bitcoin client (so users can just say bitcoind transfertosavings XXX)I think all of this is pretty simple to implement, although I haven't looked into the code yet. Sorry if I got a bit off-topic, I just realized that  Because what the world needs is more entropy... and I'm not even joking! Right now, it may actually increase Maemo's reach!  I think you misunderstood my point, kiba. I didn't mean agorists and market anarchists are all old, much the opposite. What I meant is everyone in my generation and the one before seems to assume taxes, mandatory disclosure of all transactions and overall giving up privacy for "everyone's gain" is obviously correct, and in fact the only way to go. Actually trading goods for goods, or otherwise having community controlled markets (which bitcoin and any other non centrally controlled currency, given enough critical mass, can facilitate) is something we, as a group of people, frown upon, just because we were taught that's how the drug lords rule the streets / kills investment in public schools / hospitals / security / roads, take your pick. We don't see just how expensive these things end up getting when the governments to them for us, I guess. Can't put a price on freedom. I don't want to troll here, but why are you wasting your time on the internets instead of giving your time and effort to the starving communities around the world. Even that may not be a great enough good if you think of the food you'll be eating for the little change you'll do in the world...I mean, better to be "wasting" cycles on something that may very well become an alternative economy system, or at least put a little leverage into forcing the governmental controlled currencies be managed more fairly, than folding proteins for the big pharma, although I'm sure the drugs they'll patent and sell with your help will be a greater good to the world, as a whole.I've often heard these lines of reasoning when I was working for the OLPC initiative... Why waste time and resources trying to create a tool of education, i.e. a computer with a very connected nature, targeting communities that have very little or nothing of their own? Isn't, you know, food more important? Keep feeding them and that will certainly solve all the problems in the world quickly, I'm sure.Anyway, sorry for the rant, I've done seti, folding@home and a few more, but bitcoin? bitcoin is not about philanthropic egos or greater goods of scales we aren't really equipped to grasp. It's all about the fairness and privacy of community markets, something all of us below the age of, what, 120 don't really understand and have been taught to loath.  Hehe, thought about it, and I actually have a 32bit PIC dev board with which I could do something like that, but at around 40Mhz I doubt I could squeeze too much out of it, even if I was doing it in assembly (which I won't, that much is certain  )On the other hand, I've been waiting for a good excuse to dig into FPGAs... I've got one of these http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en021940 PICDEM-FS USB boards I bought 2 years ago, with plans to do lots and lots of things out of it.I ended up connecting it once to the computer and burning a single test program, thus I'm selling it if anyone's interested. The S&H alone will be around 130 BTC for Europe or 180 for other places, thus I'll be accepting offers starting there. My Core2Quad (Q6600) slowed down 50%, my i5 improved ~200%, thus I don't think what you state is accurate. Maybe starting at some specific Core2? This should cover all the problems in low value transactions, I guess. If I'm to sell my $1500 for 20.000BTC, I, the seller, may not have that much in BTC, so that's where I, again, would depend on either trusting the other party or some human escrow. Not at all, satoshi. I do a lot of business in the local auctions and I'm all for paying up front, but only when the feedback mechanism provides me with some insight on the previous trades for the buyer / seller. Failing that, I sell and buy using COD, which is  almost like an escrow, except there's no way of asserting the goods are what was previously agreed upon before paying. But I do get the option of putting forward a complaint with witnesses (the post office clerk) which helps somehow.So, this escrow as I've put it would be someone trusted in the community, effectively removing 75% of the fraud opportunitiesa) Say I'll pay but don'tb) Say I'll send but don't and collect moneyc) Send some bogus item and collect moneyd) Say I've not receive (money / goods) but didSo d) is the one place where the human escrow will need to dig into the trade and assert who's saying the truth. All other are (more or less) easy to prove. The automated escrow service as you describe it would end up in burning money on all 4 situations.Again, if you are to trust the other party, then cash up front works very well. If you are working under anonymous aliases and there's no previous trade trace, well, I personally prefer to not buy at all, if there's a chance I'll loose both money and goods. Regardless of what the technical options are, I think that an escrow will always need to be, by definition, a trusted entity. I can see the automated workflow being easy enough when things go well:  - Buyer sends btc to escrow, stating the recipient address  - Seller sees btc in escrow, marked to send to his address  - Buyer can release funds to seller  - Escrow will automatically do so after x days  - Both parties can open a complaintAnd that's all I would automate. When things go bad, both parties should have a fee to pay to the escrow (that fee may be paid in advance to open account there?) so everyone looses something. Then the escrow will just have to mediate.Because there's a fee *and* a human intermediary, the chances of successful fraud will probably not be economically interesting in the long run. Someone already trusted would make the ideal person for this, and maybe for a small fee some of us 'common guys' could help assert allegations from either side, if we are local to them.But the money burning solution, while great at preventing economically viable fraud, does nothing to prevent revenge and actually makes everyone loose if one side is dishonest. I would certainly not endorse that.
Bought some Poker$ from Freemoney. Will certainly do it again once I go all in with a pair of fours again, with the statistically obvious outcome  And because he/she/it are always trying to beat the system and get some more free BTC, the end result will be voluntary turn in to collect the bounty :p What do you mean productive? I'm doing the buying part in small scale for myself already, and the selling part shouldn't take too much of my time. If this adds  to the offer bitcoins provide and gets more people to join, then I'd say it's pretty productive.If you meant profitable, yeah, that's not what I'm after. Well, I can't do that for bitcoins legally without getting into the market of itunes and the like, and this is not something I'm eager to do... really! CDs, on the other hand, are physical licenses to the music, and as such easily sold as used items. And the price per album is more or less the same as mp3s from itunes, and with a little work could be brought down.Scavenge for used electronics? Is that still useful these days? I have some computer hw laying around, cd units included (they should all be working), maybe I should make a list and send to you  Or put everything on biddingpond... Hey,I usually buy a bunch of music CDs from amazon UK with prices ranging from £1 to £3, to which I then get ~£2 p&p added. I thought I could open a store selling these for bitcoins, if there is interest. Of course I'd have to add yet another p&p fee to it, but the question is:- Would you buy music CDs at ~200BTC (shipped, current exchange rates) and if so,- What type of music / band / artist would you like to see available.Thanks I still don't have a perfect grasp of the communication tokens used in bitcoin, but could we not extend the bitcoin proxies ever so slightly to accept another type of payload, a message? This message would be encrypted using the recipient public key and probably a hash of the transaction in question. I'd make completely separate from the blocks, storage wise, probably storing only messages for the last 24 hrs or so on each node.Of course, to avoid DoS attacks the message needed to be sent after the transaction and be somehow cryptographically connected to it, so proxies can:1) ignore any bogus message that doesn't relate to a specific transaction2) find a message related to a specific  transaction (only important on the receiving address, but non-proxy clients would ask the next node, I guess) I was just reading the faucet drainer thread and it came to mind that no one was brave enough to say they're from Spain I'm from Portugal, btw. Which one of you is the butler? But that is only as good as the trust you have in the distribution channels, which are being discussed in other threads. If a compromised client was to be served as an upgrade, and most running clients would be using this version, then a new chain would replace the old one. What would happen when, after some time, the attack was disclosed and new clients with the real block chain signatures were run? Would the old (real) chain still be alive and replace the bogus one? Did you see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=528.msg4923#msg4923 ? That might be the problem... I had read somewhere about python urllib and bitcoing not playing along, but curl had no issues. Can't find that thread though. Well, kudos to you for trying. Now if I can just get your code merged with the old cuda version on my macbook pro, I'll be a happy camper  SHA256 test started70293found solutions = 70293total hashes = 139463136total time = 222110 msaverage speed: 627 khash/sSo slightly better, but still far for good... As for AMD vs Intel, on my Mac, which is an intel i5, the performance boost was almost 100%, so maybe some compiler thing? I did have to remove the -arch i386 from makefile.osx to have it build on osx 10.6, but there's no such flag on linux' g++ and I'm pretty sure the 64bit g++ will not compile 32bit anyway. datla@bah:~/src/bitcoin/bitcoin-cruncher$ ./test blocks.txt SHA256 test started70293found solutions = 70293total hashes = 139463136total time = 235480 msaverage speed: 592 khash/sI'll send you the obj file now At the risk of getting this thread way off topic, I have to agree with NewLibertyStandard. I'm not a native English speaker, and while I do have a lot of exposure to English on my everyday's work, some terms, such as the one in the thread topic, get me thinking: "Hmmm, I wonder how it is that bandits make out."I don't like these thoughts, mind you, so I'll just distract myself by typing './bitcoind getinfo' on the console over and over again, and wonder in vain when is it that the pesky number of bitcoins will decide to change! I've tried the git branch and results stay the same, almost half of what the vanilla svn can pump out. I'm running Intel and not AMD, but I am on 64bit:Linux bah 2.6.32-22-server #33-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 28 14:34:48 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/LinuxAnything I can try to help and debug this? Why would you assume they hate it? The problem, afaict, is just controlling it. It's hard, almost as hard as the drug market. If they find a way to prevent anyone from gambling online without their approval and scrutiny, then you'll see online gambling on government sponsored ads everywhere (with a disclaimer saying "gamble responsibly" in very small letters). The same applies to bitcoins in general, it is just something they don't control which means can't easily tax, which obviously is seen as a threat, especially when they have a concurrent thing, which is controlled and taxed by said governments. I believe there's a huge difference between porn (which is art, weather you like it or not) and poker (or, as the governments like to put it, gambling). Basically, gambling is highly legislated, and online gambling even more so these days. The sites need to keep records of everything and while BTCs could be seen as 'play money' that would only work to a point, I believe.Porn, on the other hand, is just art (so as long as all those involved are at or above legal age, of course) and, "no dear, of course I don't browse those stupid misogynous sites" but I would certainly pay in bitcoins for that because... ahem... I want to help the economy pick up.It would also rock at poker, sure, but I don't think any of the established sites will want to venture a government action because they allow 'anonymous money' to go in. I'm trying on a Q6600 running 64bit linux (ubuntu server) and it makes things slower there, so not 64bit only. And I'm running on my mac laptop which sports an Intel i5 (also 64 bit OSX 10.6), which great speed improvement there, so not AMD only. Yep, definitely the wrong thread... I'll paste it into the correct one. Funny thing is I wasn't even following this thread and I'm pretty sure I did post it while looking over the other one. Ah well, go figure. I'm not an American, and thus the IRS system is deeply different where I live, but still I really think that kiba put it right: toy money. You could trade monopoly money for groceries, if the owner of the grocery store would feel so inclined, and for low volumes it's just a 'loss' he incurs, much like giving away eggs or bread.But when your business takes a loss, the loss, according to the IRS, isn't just yours, it's everyones (if you believe in the IRS and its credibility on using collected money is a different discussion), Basically, you don't pay taxes for (some part of) your earnings because you've offset the positive income with the sale of things you had bought (and thus spent money on) for, well, nothing of value.If the practice of turning goods bought with "real" money for "toy" money becomes something of volume, you don't only skip paying taxes for the goods you sold for BTCs (which is ok, I guess) but you also further lower the IRS slice by reporting on the spendings for material you bought and then magically disappeared without rendering profit.You can sell products in exchange for services, but in this is inherently different as these services you would pay for if you didn't get them in exchange for goods, making the delta of the operation the same (in theory).This whole discussion of multiple hard linked currencies seems to me to have some technical merit, in terms of the resilience and redundancy of the system, but not so much in the economical side. It's just like when the Euro was introduced, and all local currencies were hard linked to it. Basically the local transactions were still in the local currency, but it was no longer a "real" currency, it was just a token of "worth x Eur" which you could trade both ways knowing that the value would always be the same.
