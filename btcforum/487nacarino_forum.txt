I am from Venezuela  Well the problem that I found is that it deals three cards for each hand and and the dealers hand is always a ace of diamonds. you do your normal movements of hitting or standing and anyother combination The first hand of the player shows NaN and the other two are fine. when dealer shows the other card it shows a 4. which would be 15 but shows up as NaN then it deal himself another card which is a 9 which would add up to 14. The dealer stops there and player loses his bitcoins even if his hand I higher than 14. Happened to me three times in a row   but I hope that they fix it soon. Well blackjack really has some huge problems. While the error doesn´t appear it fine but please check it out. Sometimes it deals to many cards making the player lose no matter what. When it starts dealing cards you will see that the dealer underneath the cards you will see NaN. Apart from that haven´t seen other errors.
