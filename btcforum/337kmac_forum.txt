27.  I got into bitcoin back in 2009 and only ran it for a few days then forgot about it till I heard news it was ~$30USD/1BTC.  I thought I would check to see how many I had.  150BTC...  in an adrenaline induced state, I sold it all off then.  Semi-regretting that decision now >< 1Ns3SVj9TZA9juoDd82Z29gzeM1Dj3UPe6thanks! would be nice to get some free ones through here =)otherwise will just be waiting for more opportunities.r3q5bgD97F17coeFmTexGuXGESF4qANaSz After about a month I got an email for free Ripples.  Ended up getting 1000.
