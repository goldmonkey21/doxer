BTCIN: 1N24BVph2iUh7hHbpdSe2pHQ9a8V77AsiRI sent 12 BTC again. Hope it works this time. I'm actually waiting for my BTC showing on TAABL. I sent twice 16 but nothing shows up :/. Lurker doesn't mean newbie.... I received the payment, thank you.  Okay, here's my adress: 17Udj62X4R92Yk2UAKTPGjcwwuksQS2oEo I just sent 16 bitcoins.That's a really good idea to get to know TAABL.
