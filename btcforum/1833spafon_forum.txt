That worked thanks!! everytime I try to start bitcoin 3.13 I get an error message "Error loading blkindex.dat"  I am running XPHow do I fix this?  It was running fine then I rebooted the computer and now I keep getting this error.I tried to uninstall the program and reinstall it but same message.  Evidentally bitcoin puts a config file on your computer that doesn't get removed when the program is uninstalled
