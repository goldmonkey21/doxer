Thank you!  I'll pass the good will along  Woo.  I'm quite excited about this coin.  Would someone be willing to send me a handful of BURST so I can secure my account and assign mining?  I only need 3.BURST-WRV6-MGJD-Z4TT-DDVLAMuch obliged. I'm running a small pool at skadi.nawk.net:8000 which could use a few more miners.  Spread out, people! There is none aside from the wallet.  cpuminer is being adapted, but I don't think it's working.  Ask on IRC or wait til tomorrow. It's not all that bad.  With the nfactor, you get about half of Litecoin scrypt mining hashrate on your GPU, which means a mid-high end GPU is only going to pull a few times that of a high end CPU.   Certainly not the 50x or 100x we usually see with scrypt, or the many hundreds of times with SHA256. Okay.This is only for OS X and Linux.  I have no idea how to compile this for Windows, Windows people: good luck, post a binary if you manage to do it.https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iu1ieqz2th5kfhj/o_G3gRnGMa/cgminer-vertcoin.tgz^^ is a modified cgminer for vertcoin that'll run on the http://vtc.pool.pm pool!Extract, then run ./configure --enable-opencl --enable-scrypt && makethen run cgminer as normal for a scrypt cryptocurrency.CAVEAT: this is a very dirty hack originally done by Trullala.  It hardcodes the nfactor, so it will only work through 2014!  A future version which handles the vertcoin nfactor more elegantly may be forthcoming. The miners on the pool are running a modification of cgminer -- this has been talked about to death on the IRC channel, #vertcoin on Freenode. Vv4erZQZhqenicgDzyCrRLGfSjvXPoXLan Come join us on Freenode IRC, #vertcoinSome discussion about pooled mining is happening right now! LJfgYFkQQ7Y1NpQjFcfReC9VXjg1msBN8bI also was unable to run the Mac client, OS X 10.8.4 Well, I can't get the Mac client to build.Still trying the Windows client under Wine, it shows 8 connections now with bitwho's list from above, but still remains hanged at "No block source available" and I'm running out of ideas here. :/ Thanks for that, it starts off with 8 connections but then quickly drops back to 1 and still says "no block source available".  I'm going to try building it from source for Mac and see if I can get the native client working on here.
Hey,First up, the Mac client doesn't run, it simply crashes when you try to run it.  I'm using the Windows client under Wine.I'm getting a "no block source available" error with the Windows client and it only shows one connection.  Any pointers? rDQUSJJtdwdHsk8MDbJtwMb3nwns1dUMdq IANAL, etc. etc.In a fair court (one not overly biased regarding e-currencies (the MMO companies have a lot invested in them not being declared property, etc.) here in my jurisdiction (Canada) I think this would be the tort of conversion from a civil perspective, and should be similar for any other common law countries.Are Bitcoins property? That would require them to be uniquely possessable, transferable and to have value. IMO Bitcoin does meet these requirements, though it could take a lot to argue that to a judge successfully. The fact that it's intangible isn't very important, numbers representing money written on a ledger are still property. Notably, copying data stored in computers (and then deleted) has been considered conversion.The principles of lost and abandoned property cannot be applied here, since the receiver knows who the owner is and knows how to contact him.Conversion is the unlawful deprival of the use or possession of property. Basically the civil equivalent of theft. Possession is not ownership.  There has been no transfer of ownership. The sender retains legal ownership, a refusal to return the property is depriving the lawful owner of his property, and is conversion.Most of this applies to the crime of theft as well.Yes, it's likely almost impossible to litigate or prosecute unless you live in the same jurisdiction, but it is both a tort and crime, and IMO quite immoral. The OCR is generally very good but the formatting isn't always the tidiest, which is why I'm hesitant to offer text-format books.E.g.: Code:"Matched FETs can be used to construct high-input-impedance front-end stages for bipolar differential amplifiers, as well as the important op-amps and comparators well meet in the next chapter. As we men- tioned earlier, the substantial VG5 offsets of FETs will generally result in larger input voltage offsets and offset drifts than with a comparable amplifier constructed entirely with bipolar transistors, but of course the input impedance will be raised enormously. In general, FETs have characteristics that make them useful substitutes for bipolar transistors in almost any circuit that can benefit from their uniquely high input im- pedance and low bias current. A particular instance is their use in high-stability LC and crystal oscillators; well show examples in Sections 5.18, 5.19, and 13.1."-- Art of Electronics, page 150.Proofreading is quite labour-intensive so if you wanted a fully OCR'd book in a text format while I could offer that it'd probably take considerably more time. The following is mostly a feeler to see if there's any interest for this:Are you an avid ebook reader, or frustrated that some textbook you need isn't available on the torrent sites / edonkey network?I will scan any public circulation book in the Toronto Public Library system for 0.01 BTC per 10 pages.  One thousand pages = 1 BTC.Toronto has the largest public library system in North America and the second largest in the world.  Almost any book is available!Catalogue: http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/advanced-search.jsp  ("Circulating materials only")The following conditions apply:* The format will be PDF and/or DjVu, with an OCR layer.  It may not be suitable for all ebook readers, but it will generally be very crisp on-screen* I will also release the book on P2P networks at no cost for general availability.  Help liberate our culture!* Payment will be up front.* Please allow anywhere from one day to about two weeks if the book is not currently on hold at the TPL, otherwise be aware that I can't scan the book until I can get my hands on it, so it may take quite some time if the book is on hold.* Some materials may not physically fit in my digitization setup, I'll let you know if so (and provide a refund if you've already paid).Discounts may be available for academic works.Also offered -- Scan tidying!Do you have a book scan in PDF format that is legible but ugly?  I will flip, deskew, crop and tidy up your scan to meet a uniform black-on-white format for half the price of my book scanning service (0.005 BTC per 10 pages).  I can't work miracles -- the full text must be visible and not terribly distorted.Examples of my work in this area:  Original input https://i.imgur.com/flr7u.jpg -> https://i.imgur.com/xMTqX.jpg + https://i.imgur.com/aboMH.jpgIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. Based on this, I can only conclude that the owner of Nanaimo Gold is a homophobe with no respect for queer customers.Until he apologizes I'm boycotting him and I encourage others to do so as well.

Well, the creator freely admits it's an unsustainable Ponzi scheme.  It's not fraud if the "fraudster" is up front and tells you he's de"fraud"ing you at the time, is it?I'm fairly sure it'll be profitable to join if you join towards the start and pull your money out soon after you make a return on your investment.  Ponzi schemes remain profitable for investors so long as there is a continuous influx of new investors. Ah yes, it's a sense of entitlement to expect when you have what is in effect, a contract with someone involving money that they might respond to inquiries... *roll eyes*As for the free bit, I disagree.  He paid you $50, and it's reasonable to expect that you'll deliver the goods (the bitcoins he bought).  The fact that your service is unprofitable to you is irrelevant to the purchaser.Yes, one week is a bit soon to start worrying and sending off emails, but it wouldn't kill you to respond "I haven't got it yet, just be patient."Anyway, I got the impression that the original poster was complimenting your service, notice the "expect another order soon" line.  You turn it around and insult him.  Very smooth. My post, and no worries, I sold my stock as it was anyway   Heh, Genjix is a fine looking lad though rentboys aren't really my thing.Fun idea, going to be an interesting BitCoin first!Avoid your wife or boyfriend asking about those pesky credit card charges -- pay bitcoin! And Canadian Tire Money!Do you actually get any xactions for that?  I have a whole bunch stashed away for no real purpose, heh...If you are Canadian (I'm presuming you are), have you considered Interac email money transfers?  Or do you prefer the papertrail-free route? Reading over the bitcoind API, the only way I can see how to sync new transactions in the wallet with the state of my bitcoin-oriented web app is to read the entire wallet transaction history, then compare each transaction with a database I maintain in the app to see whether it has already been processed or not.This seems ugly, difficult to code and also prone to scaling issues (going through each and every transaction is fine when it's 50, but what about 1000, 250,000 )Maybe I'm just really clueless and failing to see an elegant solution. Could you (or someone else) explain that a bit further?  I've been trying to get 0.3.19 it to compile on FBSD for about half an hour now with no success.  Which is, minor market variations aside, roughly the monthly subscription fee for EVE.Like I said, aiming for competitive rates here.  I don't sell them, no.  They can be bought in-game with in-game currency, they convert into 30 days of playable time.  They currently average about 340 million ISK each. I think for now I'll limit trades to 100 million ISK. Heh, I wish, I'm totally broke in BTC!  This is my evil scheme to make a few BTC.Once I have some BTC, I may start trading both ways.  I figure there's a number of EVE players in the Bitcoin community given the general economic-oriented mentality of the game.
