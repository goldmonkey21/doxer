heya,I manged to get past the ecdsa error.Downloaded openssl, make all, make installcp R L include/openssl /usr/includenano w /bitcoin/whereverthemakefileis/makefile.unixthen added I/usr/include to the include path now i have one last issue to get past, the error is below. Code:No rule to make target 'obj/nogui/util.o', needed by 'bitcoind'. I have tried downloading the util.o from MIT but it had no effect. Hi,checked for the header file ecdsa>h and it is in the following pathCode: /usr/local/ssl/include/openssl/ecdsa.hi have no idea where to go from here. Any suggestions or solutions?  I've just had a suggestion from a colleague to put the openssl header file in the wanted location. Will do that when i get to my pc. I'm still open to any other option.Thanks people   Thanks,i found the reference in the Configure file, where the build would auto disable ecdsa and commented it out, as seen bellow.Code:#if (defined($disabled{"ec"}))# {# $disabled{"ecdsa"} = "forced";# $disabled{"ecdh"} = "forced"; #  }However i still get the same error.Thanks for your help Hi,I saw the other thread that had some compiled the binaries however they are old and don't provide what i need.I have all the prerequisites install according to the documentationsudo make -f makefile.unix bitcoindis the command i'm using.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Cheersdestine
