Popular cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage service Coinbase may soon remove support for decentralized applications for its Apple users. The firm cited the App Store policy as the reasoning behind the decision.I hope their will be solution for this because it will affect many US usershttps://beincrypto.com/pressured-by-apple-coinbase-to-remove-ios-dapp-support/ Some of the feuds of this year come from older grudges, while others are entirely new. 2019 was like pretty much every year in cryptocurrency, with no shortage of head-butting and insults being tossed around. So now, lets take a look back at some of the most notable moments, and jokes, from the previous year.https://beincrypto.com/biggest-feuds-and-best-memes-in-cryptocurrency-2019/  1. Total Value Locked in DeFi will continue to raise and might reach X billion mark. ▪️"We'll see significant growth over the next year, both in terms of value locked in the DeFi smart contracts and user base" by DeFiprime▪️"Total value locked up in Ethereum DeFi will surpass 1 billion dollars in 2020" by Outlier Ventures▪️"Value locked in DeFi hits $5B" by Blockchain Capital▪️"The DeFi sector will continue to grow. The amount of funds locked in DeFi will double at least" by CryptoRank2. Significant competition to Ethereum will arise. ▪️"More cross-chain DeFi projects and at least 2 major public chains other than ETH will establish a noticeable DeFi eco, competing with ETH" by Ryan Tian▪️"Ethereum still will be the #1 platform for DeFi projects. We'll see fully functional and trustless bridges from BTC to the ETH-based DeFi ecosystem.  We'll see 10x attempts to build the DeFi ecosystem from scratch, both on old semi-dead blockchains from the past, and on newish VC founded" by DeFiprime3. Interoperability will arrive in 2020▪️"Interoperability will arrive in 2020" by Roy Learner▪️"We'll see significant progress with blockchains interoperability and the adoption of DEXes with assets swaps between more than one blockchain" by DeFiprime4. We might see the fall of at least one DeFi project either because of regulations or volatility of the market and systematic risks of the collateral. ▪️"We'll see at least one project being slapped by regulators. It'll force other projects to switch from the team ruled somewhat-DeFi/CeFi to non-custodial/DAO-governed." by DeFiprime▪️"There will be at least one major collapse of the current well-known project due to the volatility of the market and systematic risks of the collateral." by Ryan Tian5. The amount of BTC locked in DeFi will significantly raise and might even outperform ETH▪️"BTC will eclipse ETH as the primary value locked in DeFi" by Roy Learner▪️"Don't bet against Bitcoin, and try to pull its value into DeFi machines" by Lex SubstackAny additional thoughts? Credit: cryptodiffer One of the ways to measure the month to month usage of the blockchain platform is to check the amount of average daily active addresses. "Active addresses are unique addresses that were active in the network (either as a recipient or originator of a ledger change) that day. All parties in a ledger change action (recipients and originators) are counted. Individual addresses are not double-counted if previously active."According to the infographic, Bitcoin remains to be the leader. ETC came back to the second spot followed by Ethereum. Digibyte lost 11 positions this month and the average of daily active addresses is down by 98%. The activity of Digibyte addresses stabilized after the sudden surge in November.This month, Tezos has entered the list, Tezos took 14th spot with average of 5957 active addresses in December and outperformed Ripple and Cardano (Cardano took 16th position and are not represented on the infographic)Overall, we can see that 9 out of 15 analyzed platforms have experienced a decrease in the amount of daily active addresses in December. Top gainers are Stellar (27%) and Ethereum Classic (20%). Top losers are DBG (-98%), Ripple (-33%), and Tron (-27.5%).Credit: Cryptodiffer You are right on YouTube not deleting informational videos on crypto. YouTube has also released a statement that in bid to sanitise it community or those crypto videos that are primarily for fraud, it erroneously wiped some important and informative crypto videos. They have restored normalcy ever since anyway You can't be any wrong on this at all because if these exchanges spend extra cash on bug hunting on monthly basis, I am sure a lot of vulnerabilities these hackers swoop on to their advantage would have been discovered on time and as well corrected  Libra and IEOs made the year for me in 2019, it woke up the market which has been really boring for the whole of 2018. I am hoping that this 2020 will bring new tidings for crypto. New innovations and ground breaking projects that will force investors hands accross the globe I understand your concern but matic dump was bound to happen because its tokenomics and allocation was clearly indicated on the whitepaper. So team released a percentage of the tokens as planned. I have no problem with that seriously, smart investors would have sold matic after the incredible moon and bought back.  Well the positive thing remains that Altcoins are not dumping terribly too. They are holding strong on support and it shows belief. Sometimes, you just have to look on the brighter sides of things too. Hopefully we will record more landmark achievements in cryptocurrency that will boost investors  ⁠Crypto influencers are frustrated and confused by YouTube deleting crypto-related content on its platformBased on Twitter and Reddit threads, YouTube suddenly began deleting a number of cryptocurrency videos on Dec. 23.YouTuber Chris Dunn, whose channel has over 210,000 subscribers, noticed on Monday that the platform had removed all of his videos that mentioned cryptocurrencies.https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-influencers-speak-out-on-youtube-deleting-crypto-related-content?utm_source=Telegram&utm_medium=social Blockchain platform Nuls has lost almost $480,000 worth of NULS tokens due to a hack, according to a security update tweeted on Dec. 22.In its tweet, Nuls said it had detected that 2 million tokens had been transferred, of which 548,354 tokens  worth roughly $131, 600  had entered the trading market and were now untraceable.https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-grab-nearly-480k-from-blockchain-platform-nuls?utm_source=Telegram&utm_medium=socialWill there be a remedy for the incessant hacks in 2020?  The Bitcoin (BTC) subreddit has seen a remarkable increase in its number of subscribers since the cryptocurrencys price spike last summer.Cypherpunk and proclaimed Bitcoin maximalist Jameson Lopp posted a tweet on Dec. 23, saying the rate of new subscribers to the /r/bitcoin subreddit accelerated after the exchange rate jumped this summer. It grew in size by 222,000 users - 22% growth in 2019.https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-subreddit-subscribers-surge-following-cryptos-summer-bull-runTwo more of such bull runs and we will have BTC and Crypto saturate the globe   I believe you know Bounty Campaigns are form of marketing. So basically, it hovers around the best decisions need to make a bounty campaign more fruitful. If reaches and desired results are not met in the future, the campaign organisers and custodians like bitcoin talk can make changes to bring desired results. This are is not may worry as long as it doesn't decimate bounty campaigns by crypto projects Take this to the bank if you wish. The next bull run will happen after adoption by centralised bodies and government in USA and Europe. And of course this means regulation. If this happens, I am sure the rest of the world will jump into cryptocurrency and then comes the massive bull run Bitcoin halving may not really meet the high price expectations people set for it simply because of the reason that market expansion is direly needed to achieve that. If the market remains as compact it is currently, then the margin may not be too high.  I think BNB did far better than ethereum this year because it crossed its all time high up to 25usd although the glory was short lived for its investors. With that being said, 2020 will be a huge year for eth because of it innovations and upgrades on the chain. We have already seen two forks already. Hopefully by next year, the effects will reflect on the eth prices Since I learnt through the hard way during the early days of myetherwallet that phishing was rampant, I now know better that the best way to access project websites with assurance is via coinmarketcap.com From a holders perspective, I doubt there should be any reason to worry about these daily price fluctuations. Holders should leave speculation to traders. Cryptocurrency and bitcoin has come to stay and its value is high important to the scheme of things which makes bitcoin integral to the development of future world economy  Exactly my friend. I am more interested in bitcoin crossing its all time high of $20k than making new records at x3 of ath. Although previous history of bitcoin during halving had a tremendous return but we can't still overlook other variables that might take its toll on the price as well. So I will generally buy some btc and keep an open mind  Also Investing in the top 10 crypto-currencies is never a big mistake for me. Investing in some of these cryptocurrency is also a guarantee of security.What interests me is how to invest in cryptocurrency with less capitalization. For Altcoins, there are about 2,000. While some projects have enormous potential for growth, others are either scams or projects that are destined to disappear. It will, therefore, be necessary to be particularly vigilant before investing in one of them.
Investing in cryptocurrency sometimes requires being very patient. The price of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency is reputed to be very volatile.  In case the market is not looking good, getting a return on investment can be longer than expected. You will then inevitably go through a phase of losses. If you ever need this money to live, heres what it can cause;You will withdraw your investment by having made a dry loss. Basically, I think IEO eliminated most of the inherent problems of ICOs. And there's nothing much that can be done about it than stop participating in ICOs for a proven and safer investment fund raising models like IEO and STOs. The Crypto environment is still young and we are all learning daily to make it better  I believe it is possible. The world is seeking for better ways to interact economically and there's no better way than through cryptocurrency technology. Ecowas is already seeking for a single unified money for its member states. Bitcoin and crypto can unite the world and the global leaders might take their chances if they can control it Good advice foe both bounty hunters and investors. Hunters should spend more time on researching good projects, they don't come often nor carry heavy price reward which might be unrealistic. Also I hope that IEO will keep living up to the expectations crypto investors have put on it so far This is my first time of coming across this post and I think it's spot on. On the first point which says a holder must have another source of income is very accurate because a broke man or hungry person can't really hold because he will always sell too quick. Also, if you must hold altcoins, you must be updated OK every happenings on the altcoins because of the frequent swaps that usually happen nowadays. Else you may loose your coin I have watched this space for a couple of years and while on it, I felt that bitcoin prices are usually driven by global supply and demand which is a factor of real world usage. But recently, I have also gotten another perspective that bitcoin might just be a tool in the hands of a few whales, manipulated for quick and short gains on daily bases. If that's the case, as we near $6500/btc and even lesser as analysts suggest, when then do we see $100k/btc or its just a hoax to keep the pump and dump pendulum swinging  Yes I remember the rumor making rounds last few months that Justin is under a man and close surveillance and he can't leave China. Which made him to miss the proposed Warren Buffet dinner which he paid so much to arrange. 2020 will be an interesting year filled with drama and positive strides in crypto as well I think they want a substantial control over it if we judge by their demeanor. They have tried doing it from outside but they Couldn't. Now they are in the system, I feel they will have a more informed outlook and a better authority over it. Expect more regulations from China Despite the bearish cryptocurrency landscape in 2019, blockchain projects and cryptocurrency influencers seem to be bolstering the technology with brazen advancements and optimistic views for the future. Below are the top 100 crypto influencers. Do you agree with the list? https://cryptoweekly.co/100/ Well I just got of my coin check app and lo and behold, Tezos has done over 13 percent since this post. Obviously, all indicators now points to Staking. I personally doubt Tezos will risk the fame and position they have built over the year to be on top 10 coinmarketcap over a couple of million dollars Popular cryptocurrency TRON (TRX) is in the news again, as the asset seems to be making good fortunes in China.TRONs chief executive and founder, Justin Sun, recently published a tweet showing a list of the recent rankings from Chinas Global Blockchain Technology Assessment Index.https://beincrypto.com/tron-ranks-third-in-chinas-latest-crypto-rankings/ A deposit into Binance may be an indicator of whats to come. One user just deposited some 500,000 XTZ ($800k) into Binance from an unknown wallet. The deposit set off Whale Alert (@whale_alert), which notified its followers of the transfer earlier today.https://beincrypto.com/500000-tezos-deposited-into-binance-staking-or-dump-impending/ Justin is a very stingy man in my opinion. As well as CZ. Look all the money they have and how little the have given away. Energi project did four rounds of global Airdrop and paid all happily. People like Justin hold tight on riches for nothing. I won't participate in the 5000 trx giveaway. Congratulations to the future winners  You are right. The movement of bitcoin after halving can be either ways. Perhaps will take more shape then as regards to market sentiments. I rather fold my arms and watch. Instead of investing in a gamble  Its not compulsory to burn tokens left after ICO sales. It's just a strategy introduced to attract customers who will now have the impression that the token circulation will be low and thus translate to high price (according to supply and demand laws). That not withstanding, some projects also lock up such tokens for future marketing and promotion. Which is no big deal Crypto politics! I don't need to be a whale or an expert to tell that the cryptocurrency market is dominated  by decisions of the cryptocurrency power brokers which played out in the fight between Craig Wright and Chanpeng Zhao which saw many big names and players in crypto take sides. Digibyte should have known that the best way to get by for most rich people is to join the band wagon if they can't beat them  Lite pins growth wasn't as impressive as expected for me because even a Binance listing can push a cling to over 20 percent. What concerns me more is the sustained increase of the prices of these coins lest it becomes basically a pump and dump coin after all that's what we have been on to for a while now ⁠Bitcoins May 2020 block reward halving wont affect price, says Morgan Creek. "In a tweet on Dec. 1, Jason Williams, co-founder at digital asset fund Morgan Creek Digital, said that unlike many others, he believed markets would not move as a result of the halving next May". https://cointelegraph.com/news/halving-will-be-non-event-for-btc-price-morgan-creek-digital-exec?utm_source=Telegram&utm_medium=social True. May not be similar issues resulting to the closure of both exchange but I still wonder why this usually occur during the year end especially Christmas. And Yes I saw the Coinexchange announcement too. I feel nostalgic about it having been the best CEX for me in its early time  That's correct. Bitcoin seems to to accurately elude predicters and analysts. When they say we will go low, boom, it goes high and when they think it will soar further, the next minute it tanks. I remember many predictions on bitcoin reaching 16,000 usd by November which never happened. One thing is certain, bitcoin is key to blockchain - cryptocurrency adoption and the future is bright. So maybe we should focus more on adoption use cases than speculation 
Similarly, a lot of Crypto projects usually die off as Christmas approaches. First it was IDAX, Now CryptoBridge is set to shutdown its activities and advices users to withdraw all assets before December 15th, 2019.https://crypto-bridge.org You have a good point on translation. It's quite more lucrative and a bounty campaign or field that has not been bastardised by bounty hunters yet unlike Article writing. However, the best profession with most job in crypto and blockchain space is the programmers, UI/Ux, front end, back end developers etc You are right. We can easily say that investors have seen it all. They have been around for long to know that the jargons and sophisticated words thrown around into whitepaper doesn't transform automatically to profits or depict a sensible project devoid of scam.  It is all relative to the project. If you jump on a shit coin wave hoping to catch the top but unfortunately it dumped hard. All you can do is to time the project, monitor developments and evaluate your position as investor, if you notice red flags, you sell off immediately and cut losses. It happens in Fresco and Nobs Crypto. Not coin or token bounces back when it hits rock bottom so you must learn when to cut losses and move on It is not just a scam attempt but a well executed scam from the IDAX team. Only criminals abscond with funds kept in their care and thats what IDAX CEO did as comfirmed by other members of the team. Funny enough, the signs have been there since quarter one of this year which was given by project platform cry outs on how the exchange renegades on agreements Majorly depends on how the project is designed but it most cases that I have tried like that of veil privacy coin. Staking is done in the Veil wallet. All you need do is leave the wallet open. Generally, it's relative to platform in most cases besides wallets are safer too Unicorns, companies that have crossed the $1 billion valuation mark, are a rare breed. Even more so in crypto. Heres a list of the 10 most valuable blockchain companies.https://cafe4apps.net/the-heavy-weights-top-10-most-valuable-blockchain-companies/That's a lot of money there guys. Fear not cryptocurrency is going no where. See how much these companies are worth. Huge In my opinion, I think the exercise should be extended to all exchanges across the world. From South Korea to Hong Kong , China, USA and even Malta or Estonia. We need to put huge responsibility on exchanges towards ensuring that cryptocurrency trading and the likes is well protected against scam of all sorts including hacks Talk about legitimacy my foot! These exchanges can host any project that meets up to their financial feels or demand. Remember, the bigger scam don't even come from the hungry developer around but those highly connected ones that can pay big bucks to get top exchange listing opportunity to sell a fake and unrelatable use case. They use words like "we are in it for the tech". Think twice whenever you see that statement "The government of South Korea wants all unregistered crypto exchanges in the country to shut down. If they dont, their owners may go to jail.Recently, lawmakers of the country decided that all exchanges should register with the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Now it has created a bill that determined that any administrator who has not done so and continues to do business, it can serve up to five years in jail and will have to pay a fine of around $42,000 USD."Is Regulation Just Around the Corner Guys? https://telegra.ph/Unregistered-Crypto-Exchanges-Must-Register-With-South-Koreas-FSC-Or-Face-Jail-Time-11-22 Seriously, I can only but have an open mind towards 2020 but also with hope that adoption is right around the corner as bitcoin garners more pace next year with its halving and other positive events around it. I also hope that Libra will be given license to operate in America and America will publicly accept cryptocurrency like China did. Generally, I hope it will be a good year for the cryptocurrency space Idax, Exmarket, p2pb2b, Probit, Latoken, dcoin, Exrates, Ddex, Coinlim, Vindax. If any bounty project you are hunting lists on any of these exchanges, then the price is as good as dead. On most occasions, projects don't do well on these market because of poor liquidity and thin exchange community   That's true. With a good legal counsel, fraudulent ICO developers can still flourish. I remember EOS paying a few bucks as SEC fine despite generating billions in token sales. I agree harsher judgments should be doled out to discourage scammers. Like someone said, getting a few jail time for millions of dollars can be a very fair or lucrative trade for some people  Maksim Zaslavskiy, a computer programmer from Brooklyn and the first person in the United States to be convicted of running a fraudulent initial coin offering (ICO) has been sentenced to a year and a half behind bars as over 1000 investors were duped.https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-ico-scammer-sentenced-to-18-months-in-jail?utm_source=Telegram&utm_medium=socialI think more of this Jail time will help sanitise the cryptocurrency space. What do you guys think?  You have a point. A lot of newbie are not properly lettered on cryptocurrency tenets. Partly caused by their friends who introduced them to crypto and also on some of them who are after quick cash and forget that the first foundation to riches is knowledge and having it in abundance  Bitcoin and maybe one or two other coins might be worthy of hold for long term but on a large scale, I would say that the word "hold" has the biggest exaggeration and mis understood in cryptocurrency. In my understanding, hold actually means waiting long enough for a good exit point that guarantees your profit irrespective how small. It doesn't necessarily mean you should hold a coin for eternity. Even most developers have a sale plan in 6months to 18 months.  The best way used to be Luno for Africans until Binance came along. Binance is dubbed the most secured exchange and there rates are cheap. All you need is deposit fiat through your bank and buy crypto via Binance  A new record has been set with over 6,000 Bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide. Everyday, cryptocurrency achieves a unique milestone which further puts it in position for global adoption which is inevitable.  If that's the case for privacy coins, what truly then is their usecases. If I were a layman, I will choose Monero and Dash to be the favorite dark Web coins over bitcoin 
A zero-knowledge proof is a digital protocol that allows for data to be shared between two parties without the use of a password or any other information associated with the transaction.Everything you need to know https://ct.com/81at The foresight and pragmatism of Coinbase is laudable. The are not just making themselves a multi billion dollar company but creating also a billion dollar employee through the crypto retirement saving plans. I know people may have doubts about the gesture due to the volatility of cryptocurrency but it should be thought of as an investment option with a likely positive outcome due to the recent boom of cryptocurrency as well as its predicted future which looks bright on all sides Rightly put. As observed in imtoken, eidoo, Enjin and a host of others. I hope the Ops shill don't just have the swap utility as its only usecase. If it is, then it should be fast, very secured and very cheap to survive the competition offered by other strong options Its not just a good idea but a terrible idea, especially when pool is not increased. Once I encounter such, I rather quit and do more meaningful things with my time that working off my butt for some developer with in humane working conditions. To ice the cake, some add token locks to the condition  I do not agree with you because so many other bounties paid this year. Namely Temtum, content protocol, carry protocol, Velic, zeux and so many others. Some projects still come good. It depends on where you are looking  I would advice you to put it into bitcoin because of its foreseeable longterm profit but sincerely speaking the investment window of 6months which you gave is quite short. 6-8 months ago and bitcoin was trading under $4k. The market is too volatile to say the price of btc in the next 6months. You might have to wait a bit longer for gains I was about to mention changelly and even shape-shifting. Because thats kind of the services being offered by enjin or imToken2.0. So i dont think the OPs idea is unique perhaps its offered in a different way. I have seen some other swap projects like swapzilla springing up to offer same services too Bitcoin has to be the best option in terms of acceptable and traceability. I believe traceability is important in todays charity industry. Transparency is a major challenge in Charity especially in Africa and Asia because most of the funds donated are usually unaccounted for because of NGO looting. Blockchain can help solve this problem and should be adopted for this course  Istanbul hardfork for Ethereum mainnet is scheduled for December 4 (block 9069000). Will the value of Ethereum now improve. What really is the essence of these forks and does it really improve prices positively https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1192360910314262529 Yes, i dont think its entirely a bad idea to create an exchange tailored to best serve the US customers because of the regulations and laws directly affecting a US user because so far, what is applicable in China or other parts of the seems to be different for USA. So its fair Bakkt Warehouse has received authorization from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and is now available to all institutions around the world.Previously, the Bakkt Warehouse only served clients trading the Bakkt Bitcoin Futures contracts. Is it safe to say that we are getting closer to adoption day after dayhttps://medium.com/bakkt-blog/raising-the-bar-announcing-bakkt-institutional-custody-ed5e2ad0da9a It is one of the demerits of decentralization. Its provides the leeway for every tom dick and harry to now launch a coin to feed their greed. This is why i call for regulation. To have more sanity in this space. Without it, i am afraid we cant do much to market crypto for better acceptance due to these incessant fraud  With more cryptocurrencies debuting on coinmarketcap daily, the task of sifting through for the best crypto to invest in becomes tougher day by day. This has made me go after short term coins more for quicker profit. A good team, working product, Tokenomics (little in circulation) and small market capitalization well below $5m The keyword here is "saving" for a house, so i will suggest putting your money in usdt/usdc/pax, then store in your private offline wallet (ledger or trezor). Please do not store in any exchange buy if you must, coinbase is good. Moreso, if you choose to invest the money, then my safest bet is on bitcoin Affirmative! Bounty hunter should limit their greed and manage their expectations better. In most cases, developers can only give what they have. Irrespective of what is written on the spreadsheet. In most cases, i actually go after bounties with reasonable reward allocation and reputable team because money is involved  You forgot to mention that for you to get your bounty rewards from current you have to perform kyc with coinlist while parting with some Ethereum worth 6usd. Its dreadful how all these things are schemed to favor developers without any rebuke.  It will indeed struggle. Its losing the spotlight gradually to Bch, Ethereum and sincerely speaking, apart from using litecoin as a mode of payment, I don't see any other use case it posses. And like you rightly said, litecoin adoption is slow. I have used some seo services online and I only see btc, eth and bch as payment options  I can't agree any less. Most acts of extension has a fraudulent undertone and thus the project fails in the end. Like you said, if a project that extends bounty but yet to meet softcap, it's rather advisable to quit further work and seek your trade elsewhere before all efforts becomes waste Number 1 looks like a 3d art work which looks bogus for my liking. Definitely not number 2, it is tasteless. Number 3 looks good, the triplet rhombus in a circle looks more like it. So I prefer no 3 Seems like Top cryptocurrency exchanges are making ways to create a separate market for USA customers different from what is obtainable at the international market (probably because of SEC) Binance, Upbit, Bittrex and now. Huobi. What does this spell for crypto market as a whole https://huobiglobal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000659122/
I think it's such a humorous question. And for a moment I thought he might be joking but alas he probably confused on the subject matter. Doge is a community project. Its a cryptocurrency which is developed as a Meme coin featuring the Shiba Inu dog which is an Internet Meme sensation   You are right. Sero remains of the humble projects that shocked the crypto space because it started from a less popular exchange Qbtc until its announcement at gate exchange for IEO and I think Sero remains the best performing coin in IEO history or rather from gate exchange because I remember it doing x50. What I believe sold Sero is its unique privacy blockchain and Tokenomics which had very little supply in circulation as at then  I think what he wants is a system of sanity wherever the cryptocurrency market presents only a few working coins and maybe deletes all the existing shitcoins to tidy up the market but I don't think that will ever be possible. Op should rather with top 100 coins on the coinmarketcap or whatever number he prefers as the investment scope  Op and some other altcoin hopefuls have to be aware of the fact that not every altcoin will do well. Infact, a greater number of them are shit and mere money making tool for the token creators with an end result of eternal dump. It will actually be considered a wise move for an investor to sell off and move on even at all time low having know that the token has no future. Its better than holding till the project gets delisted on every exchange  You just put out the basic difference. ICOs are fund raising campaigns organised by the developers of the project itself, they have full control of the funds. IEOs are organised by the exchange and they have initial funds control. Asides this, the result which is "loss" is usually the case for investors when they allow complacency to kick in. Nothing different in that regards  The Market is ready for any good coin as there's always a room to confrom to by good coins. The problem is that Libra is not yet ready for the market. Maybe it should scale the hurdles it faces which is becoming to high already as investors like PayPal, Mastercard and co are already jumping ship How can they create a coin to cancel out cryptocurrency. Technically incorrect but from economic view point I think I might just understand where this is going. They want to hoist a crypto people will look up to and they will exercise controls over it. I am assuming it will be another stable coin which will still remain second to bitcoin in global ranking (not Chinese ranking where Neo comes first)  No way, I think China has done its best in boosting cryptocurrencies(Esp China based coins like neo, TRX, ontology, and so on) the last few days after President Xi Jinpings announcement. Next move is expected from USA. Maybe that will trigger the bullrun.  Asia and United States of America are the biggest players in cryptocurrency and yet they criticise and scrutinise it the most. They understand the importance of the Blockchain technology and the key role crypto plays in revolutionising the financial world. I am glad China has owned up to it and released plans to develop one for its own.  True. We can't entirely say its scammers that wholesomely make cryptocurrency unattractive but we should also point at the high volatility. Bit I think the volatility shouldn't be a problem if scams and negative events that shift tides In crypto can be controlled. The fact remains that frauds, hacks and the likes contribute a major factor to it all. I hope it can be solved as time goes on The only coin I hold in my hardwallet is bitcoin. I save a portion of every profit I make in trades in Bitcoin because I believe in the Bitcoin revolution. I don't like holding altcoins because they are too transient for my liking. It might be the best today, but tomorrow, another is launched with better tech and structure. I can't deal with that  I learnt that bitmain and its accomplices hold over 30 percent of bitcoin. Now that China has openly quoted its need for cryptocurrency and blockchain, i believe cryptocurrency is gradually tending towards centralization because that the only way it can be fully monitored and managed by the centralised bodies  Good observation. Well some of us know they are paid ratings. Although you can take a decent opinion from ICOdrops. They seems to have dominated the reviews space because of the fact that over 60 percent projects featured there do raise huge money at ICO. Nevertheless, the onus remains on you to make your researches before any investment. Only you can protect yourself  Two words: greed and dishonesty. It is one undesirable characters you wouldn't want from a developer but unfortunately, most humans are that way. Theses managers and developers are all nice and friendly before and during bounties but once bounty is done and it's time for payment, they will renegade on their promises. I hope that top bounty managers will find a solution to such ugly situations  Not just scams but pure copyrighted works of original platforms which existed two years ago. Nothing unique to offer anymore. They only speak big grammers to make it look appealing to investors but unfortunately, investors are now wiser. It used to be Blockchain 2.0, Blockchain 3.0, Quantum Leap Tech and so many other terminologies that have lost taste I can't agree any less. The fact that they do all these honorably and transparently gives me joy for cryptocurrency and forms anew beacon of hope for enthusiasts and other cryptocurrency platforms as well as worthy of emulation. Another project which deserves our adulation is the stellar lumens foundation. From November, they will be placing all keybase subscribers on 100m usd release. Its awesome Blaming the bearish market is a weak Alibi. Samsung, HTC, Facebook, kakao and so on are not investing in the industry because of the bears and bulls but rather they are looking at how the technology can help then enhance and improve their services. Quality projects that solve real worlds needs will always have investors. Did you see what Aergo and Chainlink are doing?  Hardwares are more advisable for long hold coins/tokens. Because the ease of access is usually a problem for me. I prefer a well backed up imtoken 2 or Trust Wallet with access to my finger print such that even if I loose the phone, someone can't crack my password. These mobile wallets are among the safest too if you observe basic safety precautions  I am not sure we are to blame the so called inexperienced hunters because we truly lack quality bounties. Truthfully, there might still be some amount of good money to be made but then it requires keen research. Things have changed from what it used to be due to increased bad projects and hunters Aptly put mate. I quite agree with your analogy although I still think that our Devs and CEOs who are part of major stake holders of this cryptocurrency market still have alot of good roles to play at this younger stage of the cryptocurrency market till it grows. Or don't you think so? 
I think the OPs concern is the fact that cryptocurrency is fast deviating from secure, centralised, privacy space to a more open and tolerant space which is in bid to accommodate the rules and regulations of financial operations in the centralized world. If he's only interested in IEOs, them I am afraid he must pass through KYC unless there's a Dex offering IEO sales. But if he can't, then the only option is to buy from exchanges after IEO sales. That's the most obtainable for OP Yes, you are right and that is why the more bad projects we have than good projects, the more people loose funds and interests in making any investment. I think the onus lies on every cryptocurrency enthusiast and evangelist to always engage in positive publicity of crypto and chide scam. Also we should always learn and relearn and better the crypto knowledge of others as well.  40 percent to early investors is way too reckless and discouraging for investors like me. Infact, once I see that in token economics, it turns off my investment drive and I look elsewhere unless in cases where there will be lock up periods for the token release. Only then can I have a rethink. Also most developers that offer such high and ridiculous bonuses are just thirsty money mongers looking to trap some unsuspecting investors  I can't agree less. I believe a lot of people have either tested the cryptocurrency space of have good knowledge about It but not interested due to the incessant rippled effects of bad players withing the industry. Its either exchange or coin hack this week, or a project developer has eloped with community funds. The stakeholders that be, needs to find a way to checkmate these scams to have a better and safer business environment  I am a fan of VID and what they are doing to bring a decentralised and privacy focused social media to 7 billion World population using the zero-knowledge encryption technology. Zuckerberg's Facebook really messed up in his handling with 2billion personal datas committed into his care and that is probably the reason why the United State Senators and not keen to trust him with Blockchain banking through Libra  I am so certain that cryptocurrency will not go to zero but rather remain stable or evolve. The world's technology advancement is moving too fast already. Quantum technologies, virtual realities etc and only a digital asset can match this pace which is what crypto will bring. We should actually look forward to crypto adoption rather than crypto annihilation  I believe so too. The FOMO will be sustainable and hugely dependent on user satisfaction. If it solves no lingering scalability issue facing Ethereum, the community will be disappointed and not too keen to buy in. So it basically depends on Ethereum 2.0 delivering the promised functionality we crave for Basically, it's to trade it for profit. There's not more practical applications of cryptocurrency at the moment in terms of spending it on physical items. Although alchemy has a usecase in that region and via its payment portal solution, btc, eth and bch can be used to purchase items in a physical store called Pricerite in Hong-Kong  I will not invest in VIPER because it has its own hardware wallet like Ledger and Trezor but if I see potentials that may suggest VIPER may become the next biggest hardware wallet, then I will invest in its tokenised asset. But until then, I will rather stick to proven and assured investment options till I am convinced of the risks of investing into new hardware platforms  The statistics may not be exactly correct but a large proportion of these developers are in it for personal gain not for a better society and humanity through blockchain. They create a fictitious IT, Ecommerce, health or Finance startup and solicit for funds which will be embezzled by them. We need to start doing researches enough to bust these bad players and keep the cryptocurrency and blockchain space clean Telegram has really come a long way in cryptocurrency. I thinks it's among the first community crypto has asides Bitcointalk. But what amazes me most if how Telegram raised such huge amount from VCs and other private investors swiftly without even soliciting for funds openly. 1.7b us dollars Is really a lot of money and SEC couldn't look past it Maybe so! I remember some projects like CMA accusing IDAX of scam and then I remembered I have not really come accross a successful IEO from the exchange. While that may not be absolute, the purpose of IEOs was to eliminate scams from project developers during fund raising and I think that aim was achieved. So generally, IEOs went on fine  Bitcointalk name: Nanaimogold Rank: Snr Member Current post count: 554 I understand the token will go for 3.2usd per coin. I am yet to have more technical information on the usecases to see if there's anything exquisite maybe I will but from the tokensale which will continue on exmarket till 8th October I don't know how long you have been in crypto but I am sure I am older and I command more experience . Times have changed for bounty hunters and you must accept that. Earlier years, you have 7 good paying bounties out of 10 but nowadays, out of every 10 bounties, only 1 is good paying. And this one good paying bounty will be filled with crowded spreadsheet. Do you now see the difference now? The numbers of good bounties have reduced drastically and it hurts most hunters In my opinion, no! Cryptocurrency is fast gaining adoption but alot of people who focus on the trading aspects don't know this much. I saw a video of bitcoin and Ethereum being used as a mode of payment in a supermarket (Price rite) Hong Kong. Cryptocurrency adoption is certain  As long as his wallet functions. I have many of such coins too from airdrop and bounties. 90 percent of them are dead projects. It's like an eyesore in my wallet. Having over 80 tokens in your wallet but all of them are not worth up to $5. I have turned off the button of all these shitcoins in my imtoken wallet so that I won't have to see them again   I thought as much. Why would anyone sell his house to invest in altcoins (instead of bitcoins). I do agree that some altcoins have potential to return huge unprecedented ROIs but then looking at coinmarketcap with over 1000 altcoins, the probability of picking the gem altcoin becomes a difficult math with me. So I will rather stick with btc. But then if the Original poster truly meant it, all I can say is good luck Here is what happened and why it's difficult to have such phenomenon pay out again. Back then in 2017, crypto was largely new to the greater percentage of the public and most coins witnessed organic growth prior to the bull. Nowadays, you don't wait for organic growth in coin volume, you rather pay for market markets and exchange bots to boost your coin trade volume to millions and yes you boom.  I agree with your premise. The new projects are not recieving much attention nowadays because of what I call redundancies. Same thing(Whitepaper, usecase, Tokenomics, mainnet etc) over and over again. Traders and enthusiasts need something new or assuring to revive the interest in new projects. IEOs brought it early this year but it seems to be fading gradually. 
Rising bitcoin prices is always positive for cryptocurrency market. The growth in market capitalization will portray general acceptance by the public and new people will be eager to ride the wave by investing more funds in cryptocurrency projects  I don't think It all depends on how long it lasts before we call it a bear market. Bitcoin touched $7000, Ethereum $160 and currently, the total market capitalization is way under $220 billion. So I think we are in bear market already and there's no long green candles foreseen to snap the market out of it soon Has Telegram (TON) concluded its IEO. Since it will not behave like a stable coin like the proposed Libra coin, it might just be wise to get some now. If its listed in any exchange, kindly drop the trade link.  I will never sell bitcoins for altcoins. I rathe take on some bitcoin trades and then invest in altcoins. Selling your bitcoins is a wrong move and you might even be caught unaware of any bull run I think investing in cryptocurrency is a good idea if you are doing it with your spare funds. I choose to invest only in bitcoins and I have new ledger wallet ordered from Amazon for it. Anyway, endeavour to diligently research on which every crypto that interests you for investment  I am almost oblivious of the waves blockchain at the moment. The last time I traded a token on waves platform was in 2018. Waves do not have a versed community nor strong developmental milestones, I wonder how it will be better than Ethereum which is actually the biggest coin after Bitcoin and keeps maintaining its position because of its strong foundation and architecture  The market conditions are generally poor and cryptocurrency traders are not happy buying at the moment. So this causes a general poor volume flowing towards newly listed altcoins also, the high bonuses given to investors makes them dump easily at exchange listing. To add salt to the injury would be if the developers distribute airdrop or bounty rewards too at listing   That's quite alot and ambitious to say the least from the team. As much as I like to dream because I am a holder of bcz coins, I would rather say that it will be an undoing on me to hope that listing on Binance, Huobi and Coinbase listing will be achieved so soon. Any good exchange like KuCoin will be the best news for me this year I love pundix. As a matter of fact, I have bagged enough I can. Next for me is to be patient while their products infiltrate the market. It may take time but it will surely happen as more and more people adopt their point of sales solution and BoB phone from their sister blockchain FunctionX  Apart from general market conditions, I feel the powers at Ethereum foundation knows how important the Ethereum 2.0 implemation would be and that's why they work hard on it. The recent high gases and frequent clogged network is a disatisfing factor that all Ethereum fans wish to see solved soon. Once it's done, the price will improve  I wish we can really bring it down to the layman's level, I equally agree that a true cryptocurrency has to have all fundamental qualities to make it so but with all been said, can you please enumerate the few cryptocurrencies that make this cut of being a true crypto. It will help the ordinary cryptocurrency enthusiasts outline and identify true cryptos The last time I checked, it looked like Bitwings are making plans to launch a blockchain phone like FunctionX. I didn't see much partners to further convince me on it but now that you have brought it up, I might just have to revist the Bitwings website and dig further  That is true, asides Us dollar and Gold, I have not really come across any cryptocurrency backed by physical assets like crude or other precious stones. However, I belive it will come soon or later as cryptocurrency adoption gains momentum worldwide  #ProofOfAuthenticationBitcointalk username: nanaimogold Campaign: Twitter, Facebook Telegram: chisomgold While it's commendable that our celebrities are joining the crypto fray and will help with publicity which is very much needed, yet, I am poised to ask if effort on the blockchain must have its own crypto. The last time I checked, Akon is set to launch his cryptocurrency too and some other celebrities. I get we just have to focus on the positive sides of their involvement  Sincerely speaking, if I were a newbie I would do less research on a project seeing that it's from a Legendary member of this reputable platform. Legendary members are the highest ranking members of this community and are often respected more because of their wealth of experience. But then, its still imperative to always personally research on any project you wish to invest into. The Acronym DYOR can never be overemphasised  As regards fixing the issue, there should be a mechanism that converts the Ethereum recieved by the store owner to stable coin immediately on receipt to avoid loss of value(based on store owner's preference). With that been said, the perpetual hack and fraud incidents in crypto is also a major displeasing factor why adoption stalls One year plus down the line and I wonder what happened to this promising project. Ita token is not listed on coinmarketcap, their last pinned message on Telegram was in April and last tweet was April 28. Are they still developing the project underground or it has gone down the drain with other numerous projects with lip sync promises. Project developers should really do more to stop tainting crypto image As it stands, I am rather putting money into the top 10 altcoins for the 10 percent trades. These coins are the primary reactors in the market after bitcoin and safer to trade unlike other coins on coinmarketcap. Till there's a positive turn around and trust in the market, investing in any other coin will be considered high risk by me Ethereum has been quite frustrating for over two weeks now. Gas fees are so high and the network lags hugely. Reminds me of a tweet from Vitalik where he said that the network has little space enough to take more cryptocurrency projects on its blockchain. I hope Ethereum 2.0 improves the network because its highly needed at the moment 
You have spoken well. The culture of reading in cryptocurrency has diminished as people are now after quick bucks. Years ago, you have to read tons of materials to learn the do's and don'ts of the industry even before participating in trading. Another factor making traders loose money is greed. If you have lots of it, you will be recked Cryptocurrency will always look good in the future and so will any fund raising method adopted. It will be more secure, confident and assuring and scam limited. It might be IEO remodelled or something entirely novel and unique to suite the demands of that time That's correct. People believe and trust the judgement of certain exchanges like Binance, OKEx and Huobi when it comes to choosing the best cryptocurrency projects for fund raising. The invest knowing that exchange listings, reputable team and partners have been assured. However, the frenzy is gradually dying down because in the end profit to investors is what matters most and many of them are not getting as much as thought or planned It has really lost it power and fear factor. Plus most projects now prefer to have their own blockchain too to have their specifications tailored to taste. Furthermore the heavy lagging Ethereum network is not helping instill confidence in investors too.  All these are good ideas. Especially number one that has the opportunity to play a key role in sanitising the cryptocurrency market. However, there are fears that the true tenets of cryptocurrency and blockchain which is on decentralization will be defeated and also ICO regulators might abuse their powers too Use multisend.Co and you will be fine. All you have to do is to input all recipient addresses and send collectively making it far easier and cheaper for you. There are other technical methods too but multisend tops it for me  Lol. Reminds me of the Will Smith movie 'I robot'. The ability of robots to self learn through AI can be quite threatening and the fact that these robots will put multitudes out of jobs especially in the manufacturing sector is not very appealing but I trust humans to always put in a control measure in every design to ensure the safety and comfort of the human race This is a hilarious caption. . You deserve some award for the title. Anyway, like I always tell friends, the actual worth of your bounty tokens is calculated at the exchange not at ICO or IEO. Maybe you have to conduction your mind to this to help you manage expectations. Altcoin markets are bad at the moment Irrespective of the fact that Ethereum as well as other altcoins are not fairing well in the market. That not withstanding, Ethereum has to rollout its plan and upgrade its blockchain as quickly as possible to solve its scalability issues. Its getting me and some other like minded enthusiasts pissed I have not really traded much on stellar Dex. My first stellar trade is pizbe. I am a fan of the stellar blockchain and I will equally look out for more of these coins performance in the market. I have bookmarked the thread too Cryptocurrency will certainly get better because people are getting informed about the utilities of this digital assets and how it can positively impact the world. Instead of death, I rather see evolution Brough about be modifications and regulations maybe to tailor it pleasantly to the centralized bodies or governments I totally agree with you. It is not just the security of funds offered by Binance exchange but the assurance of funds offered through the 'safu' funds too which we saw during the last hack worth about $40million. CZ has done alot to win hearts of cryptocurrency investors and that's why the exchange largely occupys the number one spot I don't the possibility of that happening. The probability is 0.01 because really, no sensible team will be happy to pay the whole tokens allocated to signature bounty campaign worth $25000 to one participant. It is not logical  BNB should usurp Ethereum position first before going even closer to bitcoin. In my opinion, I think bnb has been overbought and over shilled by the master CZ himself and if he doesn't continue to vigorously innovate and inject more usecases to the coin, it will drop out from top 10 coins Lol. It's very difficult to me meet financial or profit expectations in reality. Only few people finally realise that. Its first month of Q4 and I am yet to realise 1/3 of my crypto revenue goals for 2019. Well, there still time and since crypto is full of surprises we can remain hopeful.  While this looks technically and fiscally impossible, but on a softer note, at such event we can now expect double of current cryptocurrency market capitalization which means growth and adoption. But then I don't really see any of this coming to fruition  Just like the wall street, cryptocurrency does not sleep and I check prices every now and then. Coinstats is my home and cryptowhalebot on Telegram is my buddy. This is basically the lifestyle of an average cryptocurrency trader or investor because every price movement by bitcoin or Ethereum directly or indirectly affects your portfolio  While our altcoins keep depreciating in value daily as we keep vigil for altseason, bitcoin dominance has crossed 70% and keeps growing in strength. Will there really be an altseason. Kindly read - https://medium.com/bull-bitcoin/alt-season-scamming-noobs-since-2013-71bd19410d98 DEX are technically safer than CEX but not totally a hundred percenter because there has been a case of such hack where multitudes lost fund with Ether delta which led to some legal actions and fork to Forkdelta. So don't leave huge funds in wallets connected to an exchange  Sincerely speaking, you have been Frank enough. Atleast with mining you are assured of some profits maybe not as huge or quick as ICO returns might be. Mining might even be considered as a better calculated investment than ICO because of the controls you have over it. All you need to do is get your mining rigs and calculations right, then you are good to go
Proof AuthentificationBitcointalk Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=12Telegram Username: @chisomgold  Campaign : Twitter and Creative Yes more secure because you have your private keys to yourself and no exchange can wake up one morning and tell you stories of why Withdrawals have been disabled because of a hack suffered by the platform. But then decentralized exchanges has to work on their user interface and operability to make navigation and trade easier for prospective cryptocurrency traders Compared to 2017, I think bounty hunting saw it better days then but things cannot be completed overruled with respect to the fact that bounty campaigns improved this year 2019 from the abysmal state it was in 2018. I have seen very good projects come and gone this year and more already up and running. You just have to look the right places to see them Scam has largely been a contributory factor but again is the world focus on Bitcoin which has made it gain massive dominance in the cryptocurrency market. This means that the bulk of cryptocurrency investments by investors are not withdrawn from altcoins as well to buy and store bitcoin with hope for a tremendous rise in the future as adoption looms. This is why alot of altcoins will die off It is as easy as ABC. That is the more reason why you must trade on secured and insured exchanges. Many of these much room exchanges and projects conducting KYCs are merely doing so to sell it to a third party for private you. I mean even Facebook once did that and its a cash cow for them If you have coins for long hold, then mobile and Web wallets is not for you coffee of thier high prone to attack. But if you must, ensure that you didn't save your private keys anywhere online especially your email. Also, never fill any suspicious form or site asking for Passphrase or private keys to earn a reward.  I am not sure 370 dollars will do alot for you considering the fact that you are looking to invest in multiple altcoins. But if I were in your shoes, I will rather split the money into equal ratio for Ethereum and Binance coin.  Bounties have been really profitable this year unlike last year 2018. It all depends on where the bounty hunter is looking. Atleast I can recall that content protocol, mitx, Zeux, Harmony and a host of others had bounties in 2019 and it was well worth it for hunter last that participated  It's daily for me. When I wake up and before I go to bed. Cryptocurrency market is too fast and unpredictable and one needs to keep apace with it especially with the recent developments happening everyday capable of effecting serious changes in prices and portfolio  The survival of cryptocurrency can no longer be questioned because it appears to be a evident necessity as things stand. China has announced its blockchain project launching soon, Iran and several other countries including America are about to join the fray. So cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is now a survivor  It can easily be deduced that Bgogo and gate are huge exchanges when it comes to fund raising for cryptocurrency startups with an average to tremendous return on investment for its its community especially in the case of gate exchange. I will look out to invest in these two exchange upcoming IEOs next instead of the popular Okex and Binance with an average return That is more like it. Bull run favors holders and traders whom must have bought very low during the bear run. Trading squarely during bull run be it scalping or otherwise is very risky to me because we are in green candle period and any trade you exit may not give you an opportunity to reenter due to the upward trend  None. Although, Huobi and Okex are close based on adjusted volumes. However, I think Changpeng Zhao works too hard to maintain the highest level it has set for Binance and it has put the exchange in so much spot light making it a high target for error and FUD. The latest IEO on Binance after several hype did only x1.5 and bnb now at $25. It only says that Binance hype is gradually getting low as people are tired of the antics This is where I thought SEC would really extend services to. Instead of fining erring platforms that conducted ICOs illegitimately or fraudulently, why not mandate a every platform to go through SEC vetting process before launching an ICO.  Basically, Ethereum now has viable and worthy competitors which offers virtually one or more of the products offered by Ethereum in terms of smart contracts, dapp hosting, cheaper transactions and scalability. These competitors such as icon, stellar, Binance Chain etc are now seen as more lucrative alternative by developers and this has made the Ethereum platform loose its aura I was perplexed and also thankful when I saw the news of the scam exit. Happy that I didn't later buy in after a friend tried his best to convince me that the platform has real life use cases in the Bangladesh telecom industry. This exist scam remains one of the most shocking for me as well because I never really expected this unfortunate closure of the project  Those exchanges are open for profit and if your coin offer no liquidity to the exchange then its sure to be delisted. As for the impacts on the coin, there's is always an impact (mostly negative) which can be on the short run or long run. Although the impact depends on the strength of the coin as in the likes of BSV which was delisted by Binance but the impact was short and it wore off quickly because BSV happens to be a very very strong coin It's a hilarious and yet an annoying experience. You have to be patient with Forkdelta since it's order book always gets updated late. The best you can do to save yourself the stress is instead of market buying, set your comfortable order and hope it fills by the time your check back. By the way, you can try IDEX too, it's a better Dex  The key is study study study. That's the only way to be good at trading. When I started out newly, I had to familiarise myself with technical analysis and I found materials from babypips very helpful. Also experience and patience matters alot. Even when you make mistakes, always keep your cool and learn from every incident and remain consistent  I am actually not looking. There are so many of the promising ones out there but I can really trust bitcoin at the moment as the whole globe and government focuses on it and its prominence grows. I will rather like my investment insured at the moment? 
I have always thought of this exact idea and how it can't be implemented and have come to a conclusion that we can't really have a usd or btc paid bounties accross cryptocurrency because of the fact that there is now bounty unions to enforce it. But there could be a way, which could be through Bitcointalk. Since over 90 percent of bounties are hosted on this community, a law to have only stable coin or btc bounties can be enacted. I am sure the community will support it irrespective of the short term consequences  Not really much into gambling but my friend say that crypto sector is really doing great. As for me, I am an investment kind of guy, once my research is done, I pick a coin and invest. Right now, only bitcoin is worthy of my investments as all indicators point towards a 17kusd/btc rate by October 2019 True. Alot of top exchanges now offer creditcard facilities. With Visa or mastercard you can purchase major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum. Try Coinbase Pro and Okex. I am sure there will be more exchanges too It's simple. Liquidity dies off immediately all activity on any cryptocurrency project as regards development and marketing ceases. A Large majority of token holders who are aware of the incident sell off and move to the next project while other unsuspecting holders now bag a truck of shitcoin Bounty hunting reputable projects managed my experienced bounty managers who has the eyes to pick out rewarding projects remains the best. If you find this combination in any project, I am certain you will reap huge benefits afterwards. Asides Bounties and maybe airdrop, then I will rather buy my coin.  I do  other think there's anything wrong with the system, the IEO or investment funding process but the investors who are too callous, careless and crude to understating the basics required before every investment and that is why when they are caught off guard, the cry wolf. Investors should work more on their personal development  The benefits of IEO over ICO can't really be quantified. It's is a major reason why we have a saner cryptocurrency clime at the moment as witness some glimpse of bitcoin bull. IEOs offer security to investors funds and this has attracted more funding into crypto market  Quite a lot of forks there with only about two performing above par unlike the Bitcoin forks. Etherinc showed alot of promise last year and I thought it was the best break out coins but I am surprised that its hardly alive today I think Changpeng Zhao is trying too hard to remain relevant in the scheme of things. Personally, I do not presently see the need for this new open blockchain Venus. Hopefully, more will be revealed with time Mitigating cyber crime would have been easier if the tenets of cryptocurrency have not been architectured to evade the long arms of the law. Decentralization and blockchain technology makes it difficult to track the digital prints of an offender Idex is probably a central Dex because now kyc is required to trade on the DEX. I regard Ddex and Forkdelta as the major true Dex I know on the Ethereum network and Cryptobridge for other chain networks  I agree buyback is not the only way for developers to stabilise thier token prices but it is the easiest and fastest route with little sustainability anyway because no Coin survives on just trading. Having a working product adopted in the real world is very essential  There are not even enough creative people in the world so there's always room in all faucets of world economy for such talented people. Even most top rewards in cryptocurrency bounty programmes are for Content creators  Facebook libra is not yet open to public sales and they are currently battling for controls with regulatory bodies. Furthermore, libra is more or less like a stablecoin and it is not one that you can leverage on like other volatile coins on coinmarketcap for profits  When it comes to mobile wallets, security, ease of use and exchange abilities is my best criteria and you just excluded the best wallet for it Enjin. That asides, you can go for IMToken 2. It is equally as good with exchange facilities too It's no rocket science. If bitcoin continues its dominance at a larger percentage, many altcoins whose funds have been diverted to bitcoin will die because developers will lack money for development and sustainability and thus decimating the altcoins I am more of a weekly/monthly investor than a day trader. Therefore, I check prices mostly in the morning or at night to determine if I should tether before bed. This is how it works for me We must understand that bounty is a form of marketing and will continue to be profitable coupled with this year's improved market. I understand that some tokens you earn at bounties may not fair well at exchanges but then, there are other bounties that pay in btc too. You can find those and participate in them The STO market wasn't fully developed due to the intrinsic complicated nature of its make up that is why cryptocurrency enthusiasts have not found it attractive. The only STO project I platform I know of is Bitbond from Germany. You can check if its still running  Content creation is usually the best and more convenient form for me. Be it articles and videos. I think this job role is more popular and project developers pay more for these jobs too as I see its listing offers regularly on cryptojobslist.com
 I will most likely invest it all in bitcoin and have some rest of mind. Bitcoin is the only asset that appeals to me at the moment as it has a mind of its own. I can't really trust any altcoins at the moment because of their over dependence on Bitcoin market performance  I am actually of the opinion that coinmarketcap should put more effort into scrutinising coins and tokens listed there in. The criteria of the platform listing in two cmc supported exchanges and maintaining a reasonable trade volume if not enough, a working product should be a criterion too Heard about sweatcoin too. But I am not sure the platform is still afloat. Such business will need strong sponsorship from sporting companies like fitbit, wellness corporations, Nike and co to keep it afloat and I don't see them interested in crypto just yet Speed and accuracy is one of the core concepts of technology. Blockchain technology is very important to the financial sector and as such have millions of people willing to learn and transact on it daily, this influx calls for optimum speed to reduce operational drudgery and thus that's the need for high blockchain scalability.  Dex is more safer because you have authority to your private wallet which might be imtoken or Trustwallet connected therein but former cases of Dex hack on Ether delta still begs the question on if Decentralized exchanges are truly 100 percent safe These projects do bounties mostly out of two reasons. Firstly to give more coins out to the community as stipulated in their token allocation for community reward or for marketing purposes where by they seek for more recognition and popularity. So, In most cases, Bounties are inevitable and it does not matter if its a trading coin or not It wouldn't have been said any better. Concise and on point. These few points have made a lot of traders rich when acknowledged and practiced and aswell made many more traders poor gamblers because they didn't adhere to the tenets Basically, there are three things I lool out for which are firstly, team make up and partnerships has to be standard. Secondly, Tokenomics (distribution and allocation) is very important. I don't want many tokens in circulation and Thirdly, product quality and relevance to blockchain  WEEK 3 (01 AUGUST  TO 07 August)  This is spot on. No matter how much you love a coin, always keep an open mind and never forget to use or apply the stop loss. It is your only insurance against dips which might even happen in your sleep  If he has taking or transferred out your valuable coins already, then there's really nothing we can do. Please take this as a lesson and store your private keys offline and not online especially without 2fA else you run a risk of hack Well more has been lost and more will still be lost in the future if the governing bodies and top cryptocurrency personalities do not brainstorm to fix it. Just QuadrigaX and Cryptopia made participants stand on the verge of loosing over $100m It might be considered bad because it sways individuals especially newbies to fomo into  a coin they might not have prepared to venture into but then almost everyone in cryptocurrency does this indirectly. Including the big coin CEOs Bear market is actually the most favourite period of seasoned and experience traders because it offers them the advantage of buying cheap good coins. For example, waves is currently trading at 1.5usd and will surely hit over 2.5 usd in few weeks time. This is guaranteed 30 percent plus Just like ICO was remodelled into IEO in the past, I think same will happen to IEO in the future to control participation and dump which occurs with few weeks of sale. Change they say is constant  The best mobile wallet I have used is the Trust Wallet. Its has a seamless operability and also accommodates the storing of other blockchain coins such as Binance BEP2, Bitcoin, Ethereum and so on. The wallet has cheap transfer fees too as well as good security  This is the picture that a lot of Project developers used in 2018 to make investors fomo into their Initial coin offerings only to discover at the later end that its nothing but an organised scam. Designed to fleece unsuspecting cryptocurrency enthusiasts of hard earned fiat Buy back and Burn which usually go hand in hand is a strategy employed by some project developers to maintain coin stability or asset stability of their projects. It is practiced often by Binance and will be employed by Bitfinex for Leo I noticed this scenario some weeks back. Old and failed cryptocurrency projects juggling up in the wake of bitcoin moon to see if the can cash out on unsuspecting members of the cryptocurrency community. Everyone should beware 
Choosing the right wallets is one of the important ways to protect oneself from phishing scams or related hacks. For offline wallet, I choose trezor and for online and mobile wallet, coinomi and imtoken is the best for me It is truly not about holding but being smart about it. Everyone in cryptocurrency is a holder but the duration of hold is what separates us all. This art is what everyone needs to learn to function effectively in the space  This is true. No 5 is highly underrated though. I do specific bounties and they come highly recommended based on project and team quality and bounty manager. I know some bounty managers that don't take shits projects and I know some that take all including scam bounties  Quite an impressive list you have there. There are so many other good coins I am watching too and I  a hoping that Dfinity fulfills the promises hanging around its neck too. Facebook libra coin will be a top 29 coin to when it launches because of its gigantous community  Monero is one of the old coins that has a strong psychological stronghold on the minds of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It offers the least technology as at today's rankings but it has more trade volume and acceptance than the rest and even predicted to go as high as $3000 by 2021 Too many privacy coins in the market with many claiming to be better than Zcash or Monero yet I wonder why these two have better trade volume and adoption than the new ones. Does it mean that cryptocurrency community are not really after the new technologies springing up recently  I recently invested in a coin with similar features. Privacy on zero-knowledge technology and built buy one of the founders of PivX but I am considering pulling out soon because it seems like privacy coins have saturated the market and people don't seem to be much interested anymore  Thank you for such succinct post. I am only interested in the Stellar lumens and Ravencoin. I see them performing better than the rest in the next fews years because of their solid architecture and endowed team BAT has fewer use cases and its struggling to compete against the big wigs in the market. I believe it has to put in more effort in developments to drive its adoption accross crypto market. They have started well will Opera but they can still do more. So, Ethereum for me is better Keep 25 percent each in bitcoin and ethereum and then, invest the remaining 50 percent on litecoin.. Sell before or after the halving and then reinvest your profits in bitcoin and other top blockchain altcoins My problem is will Ripple ever get to its all time high of 3usd. Bitcoins looks more likely to meet its 2017 all time high price after Binance coin. Well, one thing to pick so far is that this will be a massive year for cryptocurrency Bull Market seems to be already here as bitcoin comfortably traded at over $11000 which was its all time high since March 2018. This is a natural growth and its slow but steady which has made it sustainable How the cryptocurrency community has not found a way to insure itself against these kind of exchanges with tendency to cause harm and loss baffles me but then it goes a long way to show that this market is still very tender and hopefully, ills will be corrected in the future I would have suggested Ethereum or stellar but considering that litecoin halving is few weeks aways from today, its only wise to convert to Litecoin. Ltc is currently at $142 but will be am easy $210 in the coming weeks This is hilarious. It's indeed strange that a coin(bnb) which is the only coin to shatter its all time high record at over $24.5 from 2017 does not top a list of top 5 performing coins in 2019. Another exchange coin which catches my fancy is Nash(Nex) Any idea which coins it would be? This is where the difficulty lies. If anyone can successfully tell the best three coins to invest with a six months cashout plan, then you are rich. Most successful traders have made it through learning and practical experience Any good year for bitcoin is a good year for altcoins as well. It showcases adoption and acceptance. Many good altcoins in the market will witness tons of buy orders just like in 2017. I am completely bullish on the crypto market this year Bitcoin is truly performing wonder and I guess it's partly because of the fact that there's no going back on the innovation anymore. The centralized world live in denial of cryptocurrency utilities but since Facebook mentioned its coin, Libra, the world is getting set to embrace cryptocurrency finally Bnb was a good buy. My friend Mike has about 3000 units of the coin. Its early adopters are already in money. Although I missed the opportunity to get in on it in 2018 and far beyond my reach at the moment, I also think Unus Leo from Bitfinex might be another good buy because of its buy back plan and perfect deflationary properties.  Harmony is a quality blockchain project with unique and more powerful sharding technologies even better than quarkchain coupled with the IEO on Binance so the ROI was very much expected 
The best time is now. Always learn to follow the trend if you can't start one. I have managed to get into two IEOs, Harmony and STP Network and it was profitable with atleast X5 ROI at average  Certainly looks so. I have taken a grand position at 135 usdollars and if I get a x2 after the Litecoin halving in the next month, then I will be more grateful. I will look to buy more it it retraces at 135usd though  I believe you are already acquainted with which exchange to get your IEO coins from. I will also like to  tell you to look out for IEOs that operate a lottery system like Binance and if fcfs(First come first serve) is the model, ensure its a has btc pair aswell I rather think the growth is going just fine. Quick flashes of pump and dump will never yield the growth and stability we want in this industry. We need organic growth and that is what we are currently witnessing  Study has it that over 2.2billion people will be introduced into cryptocurrency and blockchain technology because of Facebook Coin launch. It is now obvious that cryptocurrency is not every going to die and this is the best time to buy good altcoins for keep I have not seen any attribute of such plan as making Ethereum a stable coin in its development map. So I will rather say no. Ethereum fairs better as a volatile coin without restrictions to its growth  This is hilarious but then, this is cryptocurrency and anything us possible. I have seen a coin called 'bomb' with no form of utility but deflectionary quality move from 0.7 cents to 11 dollars at all time high. I will look further into the coin to verify if its worth a dollar As global adoption builds up, I believe the biggest bullrun better than what we witnessed in 2017 will  surface in 2021 before and after bitcoin halving when the whole world would feel left out of the massive innovation called bitcoin to drive a gargantuan FOMO It's ridiculous when people unnecessarily compare bitcoin, Ripple etc with Facebook Coin and it makes me begin to wonder if there are other utilities attached to Facebook global coins asides as a form of stable coin and for transaction within Facebook ecosystem  I am reasoning in opposite direction. And I want to load up more. Because it might be on its way to dethrone bnb as the seventh most bankable coin based on market capitalization  I might seem like a good buy but I don't see it as a coin you can invest in for quick returns because its designed to be a stable coin. Perhaps if you seek for an asset to help stabilise your funds, then you can invest in Facebook global coin Binance and bnb is now at the center of everything cryptocurrency this year like Ethereum was for ICO projects in 2017 and 2018. From IEO to Exchange Listings to Binance Chain and so on You have got a concise and elaborate portfolio although it's not expansive enough for my liking. Bitcoin and ethereum are most holds for me including Ripple and now we have strong coins like Aergo and Harmony, I am beginning to make rooms for them too I am wondering if you later bought bnb coin. It is the most performing and valuable coin in the market buy all standards and the first to reach a new all time high from its previous record of $24.5 You are hilarious! Well, for every profit, there is a loss and its equally common among whales too. But from a general perspective is not doing so badly despite trading at - 87 percent from all time high of 10.92 dollar  Bitbond is an STO not an ICO but nevertheless, it looks promising because its an established German company with potentials to become the first STO to successfully launch in this cryptocurrency space  Most of these coins are IEO projects from Binance but then, generally, IEO projects from blog exchanges like Binance and Okex has further restored the confidence of the cryptocurrency community because of their high ROI Proof of AuthenticationBitcointalk username: nanaimogoldBitcointalk Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=12 For all the multitude of possible reasons for mail to be late, from nearsighted posties to stamps falling off, and a hundred other possible reasons, you can only conclude that I am delaying this myself? I think there are many much more plausible reasons for this. Yours is the only complaint of late mail. Perhaps the fault lies with fhe sender?And you scream graft after only a week? You don't have much experience with the post office I surmise. How is it that newbies are posting to tbis thread? Policy changed to suit those who need to change thier identities? I'll bet that new persona calling me a dick will resist my challenge to read this whole thread. The underlying complaint is that I thwarted a credit card fraud. For stopping crime I'm a dick?For every one so quick to call fault, there are a thousand quietly enjoying the stealth of private currency. For every loudmouth angry at me for outing the diddler who perverted mybitcoin, there are legions of those thankful that someone would stand against those with such a dirty agenda. Nanaimo Gold is likely now the longest standing digital currency exchange service on the planet and by far the first to trade in bitcoin. Psople who use the service mostly appreciate my tough mind, wiley staff and our and refusal of political correctness.  Back up.New hardware, infant mortality, small ISP,  high security, few authorized to be in that room, Easter weekend. Just an inconvenience. All systems go. 
What countries and national currencies are you able to accept?  Yeah. 13 hrs and I still don't know what the trouble is. New ISP, new hardware, new techies, new melon-scratchers.  Takes in Bitcoin and pays out Paypal? Paypal is not automated? No other payout currencies?No other input currencies?What does this thing actually do? Write an email to a human who does a manual exchange?Does it test for confirmations? How many? Seems a easier way is just to look at the website. You've got your trust issues backward.The guy accepting the charge is the one running the risk. The guy accepting the bitcoins is home free. The credit card can be charged back, the bitcoin cannot. In dispute the onus is on the sender of the bitcoin to prove he did so. No credit card company is going to accept the blockchain as evidence of a product being delivered. Whether the cardholder is lying to get his money back or he really did have his card number misappropriated, the result is the same, the money pulled back from the merchant account to refund the charge card.To add to the injury, the card issuer will charge the merchant $25 - $40 service fee for the privilege of being ripped off by the scammer who got him for the bitcoins. Double ouch!It's no wonder that the banks and other card issuers don't supply the needed tools for a merchant to scrub out this type of "friendly" fraud or even for stolen cards. They are complicit in the crime - they make a fortune in service fees. I've seen merchants ruined by this friendly and stolen card number fraud. Not just in currency trades, but in anything that is easily liquidated.  Centregold.ca has been risking it for many years, since long before bitcoin was released. They have very sticky verification, as you should expect. The fee is high, as you should expect.It takes time to do the investigating, that you should also expect.Paul is legit. I can vouch for him - almost ten years a trading partner.If he has no bitcoin, you can take another hard digital currency such as Perfect Money, which is trival to swap for BTC at a number of sites.

What about the inevitability of Gox operating at a fraction when they started bleeding for lawyer bills while fighting the FATF closing their French bank accounts? Or while bailing out the *ahem* hacked Bitomat? The answer to this and many more questions about getting warned is a resounding YES.

Every man has at least one crazy vindictive ex. Update: One crazy vindictive ex and the man she was stepping out with. I'm glad he has to put up with her insanity now. No, I do not want her back.

Any exchanger cashing out gamblers in Merika is laundering money and a "special kind of terrorist".The serious exchangers exist mostly in Russia and Canada.  I did have the site multi-lingual for some time in '07 but discovered it invites people to submit support tickets in languages I can't communicate in.

Do you realize the invitation you are presenting? One of the dirtbags that infest this forum can just buy a phished CDN bank account login for a few bucks LR, make this trade and when the bank discovers you have received stolen money you are out $2K - just like that.What makes this all the more ridiculous is the fact that all five major Canadian banks have branches in almost every neighbourhood in Canada. A cash deposit to your account cannot be phished while an online bank access is about as tight as a sieve.Why do this to yourself? Why not insist on CASH deposited to your account? Or even accept a cheque by mail. It only takes a few days to clear. Online spends can be clawed back months later. You might even face criminal accusations for receiving stolen property.

Be prepared to present yourself fully, ID, verification, credit check etc. If you are less than genuine, you don't have a chance of being accepted.When you are deemed to be a good risk you can buy any of several digital currencies that are easily traded into bitcoins, although not bitcoin directly. ( try this https://www.nanaimogold.com/lr_exchange.php )Anyone who is serious about trading bitcoin and other currencies needs to find a better way than credit cards. There is high risk in chargebacks due to stolen cards and those thieves who might just lie to the card issuer after purchasing something very liquid and practically untraceable. Either way, it's the merchant, not the bank, who pays for the loss. The banks are actually complicit in the crime when they fine the merchant to cover the chargeback costs. Accepting credit cards is more or less risky for any merchant, money trade the riskiest. That's why you need to expect close scrutiny and large costs if you want to pay online with Visa. There are often better ways. Is something not clear? Can you be more specific about your difficulty? There are lots of well established options in Canada. There are lots of options in Canada already. If you are close to an RBC, you are close to bitcoin at the best price around. No ID, no signup, no snooping. You have more options in Canada than any other country in the world.

I have been giving away small amounts of bitcoin almost since day one, 2-1/2 years ago.My motivation is to allow people to test their clients and get a feel for using bitcoin. This promotes the concept generally. Better someone see first hand that bitcoin confirmation takes time and not be panicked when their first substantial trade is not confirmed instantly. Since a bitcoin is so very divisible, even a tiny amount can be used to make many test spends. Hence, I give people tiny amounts to play with as a learning aid.I have also given to charity because I support the cause, but that's another motivation entirely.

Your problem stems from your trying to trade soft money for hard. People are used to buying goods and services with soft money and it's surprising to them that they can't buy digital currency with the same.Paypal, credit cards and online bank transfers can be reversed later, in some cases six months later. All it takes is the account holder to complain to the account issuer. Scammers take advantage of this to steal from those they trade with. They either use phished accounts to spend from, or they just use their own accounts and later lie to the issuer.Those scammers look for the most liquid items to gain in this ill way. Also attractive are items that can't be traced or be proven in delivery, such as when signing for a package through the post. Nothing is more liquid than digital currency, and providers of soft money transfer services refuse any available proof that a digital currency has been delivered. Can you imagine a Paypal dispute resolved by a Liberty Reserve screenshot? It will never happen. In practice, it's much easier for those providing reversible payment systems to simply declare currency trades against their ToS. Too bad, so sad for anyone who accepts such soft money that later is reversed. Soft money can work for goods that can be tracked in shipment, or for subscription services that can be cancelled for non-payment. Soft money can not work for currency trades or trade into any other very liquid goods. Soft money works best when the receiver knows and trusts the spender, hardly the anonymity we want and need. Alert Pay and others like it are a money hardening service. They offer to accept soft money, check out, identify and verify the spender is the real account owner and has good character (credit check), and to accept the risk that they will occasionally get burned despite their efforts. All that checking and risk mitigation is expensive and time consuming.You should look for an exchange service that offers a payment method that is cheap and easy for you to make. In person cash is perhaps the cheapest and most reliable, but not practical for long distance. Cash by mail can work well, but is sensitive to big mouth assholes, of which there are many in this particular forum. Depositing cash to a branch of the exchanger's bank is also fast, safe and cheap. Cash transmission service, such as Western Union Money Transfer or MoneyGram, is reliable and fast, but more expensive. Look for an exchanger that's easy for you to pay. The fee the exchanger charges is likely to be less than the fee to transmit to him the cash national currency. I have explained this 43823849 times over the years. People are so conditioned to expect online payments and consumer protection that they most often fail to consider the other side of the trade. You getting burned by a bogus exchange service is a lot less likely than it is for an exchange service to be burned by carders and phishers. Still, there is a never an end to the people who think they can offer hard money for soft. They pop up all the time and disappear just as fast. I've seen hundreds of them get frauded out of business. It simply can't work. Even you noobs who think bitcoin is the first digital currency (it is not) already have seen the Paypal, Dwolla, Paxum and Alert Pay failures. I warn them, they fail to heed and are invariably screwed right out of the scene by the hordes of stealer munkees infesting the internet. Most of the oldest and best established digital currency exchanges are in Canada. This type of business has been repeatedly shut down in the USA and it's almost impossible to keep open a service if your meatspace is in the land of the free. Bitcoin has always been a very Canada-centric thing. The first year or so it was almost entirely Russian and Canadian. You have more choices in Canada than any other country in the world, Russia being second and UK third. Those trying to operate in usaland now have an unpleasant future ahead. I don't expect they will heed this warning, even though my track record in predicting such things has been 100% over the years. People believe what they want to believe and avoid facts counter to their wishes.If you ever do get your AP traded for LR (a hard currency), you might find this useful.

That is because you say so?People must wonder why you would be so keen to jump on this thread and hurl feces. Is it that you have been black listed by WU for accepting stolen credit card payments? Well, I'll never know for sure what your problem is because I'm not privy to your illogic. My fraud prevention technique stopped a credit card payment. I'm very clear about refusing all payments not made in cash in person. That is why, after more than 10 years in this trade, I am still able to pick up WU transfers with my own real name.I think that you can only embarrass yourself further by continuing this.  Just when I dared hope Bitcoin was finally mature enough to use as money, Trade Hill has quit (at least for now). The idea of a fair "prevailing rate" is now more elusive. It's not fair to compare fully liquid offers to an internal coupon that can't be spent anywhere, digital currency payments limited and delayed by weeks, or  bank wires sent only when it's most advantageous to that small group of market manipulators dominating Gox.Nanaimo Gold is a full service _exchanger_ not an auction platform with a lame escrow. Rates and fees are clearly described. The more people who use bitcoin as the money it was intended to be, the less influence the minority will have in playing the market. ***SPECIAL DEALS***Only 1% fee on all bitcoin paid for with cash by mail - No surcharge on foreign banknotes!***The ZERO fee offer Western Union to Bitcoin continues.***Get bitcoin fast at a firm quoted price based on prevailing market rates! ***AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE***Liberty Reserve to or from Bitcoin - automatic exchange operating 24/7 The author of that thread, a carder frustrated by my fraud prevention, was not Bruce Wagner.

At no point am I mentioned. Do you think that people won't notice that you are lying? Do you think you are allowed to just tell the world lies? That nobody is going to call you on it? You are not truthful. You know who robbed you and how it was done, yet you still want to blame someone else for your own mistakes. You had no stake in the MBC hack. Your MBC account was pwnd when Gox leaked their password file - weeks before the problem at MBC. You run all over the internet whining when you can't command the support staff to answer your same questions over and over again. You got plonked from the issue tracking system and you just can't let that go. The whole situation was explained to you in private immediately after the Gox fiasco, but like so many other ass clowns in this "community", you have no sense of what is private.At no point during that podcast was I ever mentioned, but the comments made about people having to learn how to grow up were inspired by yourself. You, personally - the center of attention, just as you like it.So what's your next move? Go post crap about me to another thread? Your credibility is gone. Even the gamers who share your fantasy world are not listening anymore.There is no mystery about what happened to MBC. There is nothing for you to discover. Fuck you too crybaby. If it's ever convenient for me, I'll spank you so hard you won't be able to sit down for a week. You certainly deserve it. Another one who spouts off what he would never have the guts to say in person. Electronic payment systems have been used since electronics were invented. Just because this is new to you does not mean you were first in. I know so many people and have so much insider information about payment systems and the attendent crime because I am an insider, and have been since before many of you were even born, since before the internet was popular, since before the web was even invented. Deception is like an onion, peel off a layer and look, another layer. I'm nost surprised that those less experienced are more likley to be deceived, but what really does surprise me is the appearant lack of regard to consequence exhibited by members of this "community". Shit you do and say does have repercussions in the real world. Also surprising is the collective aversion to historical lessons. Stuff did happen already. Your denying that does not change reality.This is not a game. When you shut off your Colecovision console, your actions are not lost. Things you post here remain practically forever. It might take months or years, but all pigeons come home to roost. You said you wanted answers, well now you have them. I'm not surprised you are dissapointed. Reality is just ordinary, not like the amazing fantasy world contrived to entertain you. Yes, your MBC account problem is your own fault. Another of your faults is the endless stream of crybaby emanating from your pie hole.https://encrypted.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=%22Angus+Boyd%22+bitcoin&pbx=1&oq=%22Angus+Boyd%22+bitcoin&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=8346l10302l1l10691l8l8l0l0l0l0l305l1815l0.2.5.1l8l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=3e82efc6cc141df0&biw=1270&bih=852Another fault you might work on; spewing insults that you would never have the gall to say IRL.  Trade Hill is American. MyBitCoin is American.Perhaps there is a connection? Are you not listening? Nobody is going to show you anything until the law is done.The passwords stopped working because the Mt Gox thieves changed them. The people who foolishly used the same passords for both systems were robbed faster then MBC could stop it. Only those who left an email address could hope for a password reset. For most of them, it was already too late as their holding had already been spent away.You get something in your head and nothing can dislodge it. I must be a fool for trying to talk sense to you. You personally were actually used as an example of the impossible overhead of support. Note that I did not say customer support, you, like all the others was never a customer. You used a free service and when you got robbed you refused to accept the responsibility. You had bad password habits and you got stung. You can't accept responsibility and are crying for some anarchist's authority to help you lay the blame somewhere else. Suck it up. You fucked up and are the only one to blame.And before you go lying about your password here, remember that I have all the microlionsec documents. Hiro said;"I've known for many, many years""philosophical and moral values""not any form of scammer"interested in "liberty and true real money"He also mentioned Occam's razor. It seems to me that your assumption that the operator of MBC stole anything is based on nothing and the explaination Williams gave is far simpler than these crazy theories.Tom Williams said an unknown party hacked the MBC server and made off with the bitcoin. He then gave up on the project and divided up what remained amongst the users.Wagner's statement that the system stopped sending payments and was still accepting payments in the 24 hrs preceeding the outage has never been corroborated. In fact, it's just plain false. We have all seen spends that have take hours to confirm. Perhaps he misinterpreted while waiting for the network to confirm. For whatever reason he said so, we know it to be a false statement.As I recall, the operator of MBC continually suggested that people NOT store their coins in the system. The sweep function was designed to make it easy to clear out business receipts as they came in. Also, as I recall, the addition of an email address to a user's account was made optional in response to users' complaints that requiring it was an invasion of privacy. There is no way to reset a password if the user has not left a valid email address. Those people who were unable to reset a forgotton password were those same people who refused to leave an email address. That was always their own choice.Bruno's statment that MBC was paying Bruce for advertising is also false. In fact, the opposite was true. Bruce was asked repeatedly to stop associating himself with the MBC system because his lurid past was known to the operators since November. They were not keen to have Bruce's filth rub off on them. MBC was never a commercial enterprise, it was an operation without a cash register. To become more busy meant more computer and human resources were spent to maintain it. Frankly, the operators had no incentive to become busier. The advertising sales revenue model proved to be folly when it was discovered that none of the users wanted to advertise. I quit my own paid support of the system when it became appearent to me that it was being used as a clearing house for payments made to a child sex tourism business being run out of NYC.These actions do not look like part of a plan to scam. As for the current silence on the part of the operators, Bruce did tell us the the FBI had been in contact with him. I don't believe much of what Bruce says. It's more likely that it was himself that called the police in. Regardless of how the cops got involved, let's assume they are. What would lawyers advice their clients? Silence. What would police threaten to those witnesses who talked? Obstruction of justice charges.Occam's razor; The simplest answer is probably the correct one. As I see it, MBC got hacked. Williams told the truth about that. He gave up on an unrewarding project and returned what was not stolen. Anarchists seeking authority called the cops. The cops and the lawyers told the MBC principles to shut up.Simple. Now all we can do is wait until the police are done with this or until the gag order has been lifted. I have seen that take years in some cases.
 Piss off ass clown.There are plenty of places online to talk peversion. An online payment system discussion is not one of them. The necessity that mothered the bitcoin invention is the need to make private irrevokable payments over long distance without having to trust or even know the spender. Social disease networkers like Bruce have consistently tried to adapt bitcoin to meeting up in person and getting to know the spender. There is no need to use bitcoin to pay for what Bruce buys in person. Paper money passed under the toilet stall works fine for his purpose. It's better even, because there is no need to carry a computer or wait for a confirmation.The problem with the original invention that addresses the necessity as described above, is that criminals could, and did, steal the ledger books and the gold backing. In that way the privacy and the value were lost. Bitcoin is hoped to be the solution because criminals cannot rob the vault, or steal the data. It's been a long and painful process to get to where we are today. Probably less than one in a hundred posters to this forum have this understanding. Lo siento. No comprede. I don't believe the inanimate can actually form intent. Would you like to try again? Perhaps put some thought into it first?It's below my standard to battle wits with the unarmed. Ass clowns trying to distract from the topic are so transparent. Nothing they say is truth. In no way can they be trusted to any purpose.The only thing I was wrong about was assuming Bruce and his gaggle of sodomites to not have any busingss using privately issued currency.It now appears that they do, or rather _did_ have a sex tourism racket laundering profits with bitcoin.Oh well, I wasn't far wrong. na na na na - hey hey hey - goodbye ... If The sender has to put some instructed text onto the money order, he is not as likely to be fooled by a scammer selling a Russian girlfriend or a mail order puppy from Cameroon. It does not matter what it is that I instruct to be written in the memo feild, as long as it lines up with my order record. It's simply fraud prevention, to keep an immoral liar from using my service to facilitate stealing. Since the memo field is for my use and no one elses, how can anything I instruct to be put in there be a "misrepresentation"?As you might become aware, the banks will not allow a digital currency exchanger to hold an account, The banks consider private money to be a threat to their illusion of monopoly in money creation. Ask Mt. Gox about their commercial bank account problems. The holder of a  personal account has the rights of a human being that a corporation does not. Demetri is my business associate. How is that a problem for you. You hate people who have Russian names?You are grasping at straws, trying you best to show there is something wrong with what I do. The truth is I have more experience and better systems in place than almost anyone else. You, on the other hand, have a narrow and incomplete perspective of what is going on here. The immoral know no boundries. As I  recall, #bitcoin-otc was initiated about a year after the launch of bitcoin. If you need definitions, try dictionaries. There are no exchangers in the USA, they were robbed, chased out or imprisoned ~ 5 yrs ago. (April 27, 2007)Bitcoin is a Russian and Canadian thing primarily. The only aspect where US Americans are prominent is jabbering nonsense on this forum. You know, seeking authority and begging permission while proclaiming to be anarchist while calling the police and trying to secure copyrights. Trying to collectivise and centralise what was designed to be the antithesis of authority. There is even a thread about electing a new leader to replace Bruce. Nonsense galore. Bitcoin is for privacy. The real business is conducted without any mention in public. The gay-mers blathering here are just playing the speculation. By what they say I have concluded that most of them don't have a clue. They seem to think that gambling on Mt. Gox prices _is_ the business.As for authority imposing it's rules on us, just say no. After all, without your assent, they don't have a contract. You have a God given right to trade your own property or make contracts as you see fit. It can't be unlawful if there is no crime. Don't contract with a corrupt regime. State your intention to dismiss them. Make that intention public. If they try to make a case against you, the first thing they have to prove is your agreement. Mike Gogulski, who posts to this forum, is an expert on the subject.Best advice, don't open shop in the USA. There is a reason that Trade Hill is in Chile, Mt. Gox Japan, Goldnow, Austrailia, AurumXpress and Nanaimo Gold in Canada. Sadly, land of the free and home of the brave has become a nation of cowardly brainwashed slaves. If you want free and brave, try Russia. Accusations? Bruce admitted his crimes. I only pointed that out. The only false accusation that still needs addressing is his using the media to accuse ME of a crime.So, where is this proof I'm asking for?There is none.You perverts think you can do whatever you like and be excused for it by crying "bigot" and "homophobe". That shit does not work on me. I will grind on you forever if I want to. I am right and you are wrong. It's like science. It's not a matter of opinion.  Why do you believe that?I recall the opposite to be true. Who are you to tell me what I can start on? What a lame attempt to change the subject.Read the whole thread ass clown. The OP was trying to card WU and cash out through my exchange. When I thwarted his crime, he did what ass clowns are famous for. He lied in public. The other ass clowns were either trying to SE me or became so insulting as to inspire me to exersize my right of association. People without morals know no boundries. You can count yourself among that number or not by choice of free will. Now, where is the proof I asked for? All we have here is proof that ass clowns hide their immorality behind insults and that by their devience they expect to be exempted from responsibility for choosing to lie, cheat, steal and sodomise.  No, you did not show any proof that I have ever voiced an opinion on homosexuality. All you posted was your own opinon of what you think I might say. Come on you ass-clowns. Let's see the proof to back up your claims.You know my next challenge; What make you entitled to your opinion and me not to mine? Why the double standard? Now that you have started the insults, you leave me free to reciprocate. Do you think that your gang of fairies is going to save you from my wrath? Do I sound afraid of homos yet?One thing that really exposes the disingenuous is their willingness to say from behind their net connection what they would never dare say IRL. Note that anything I say online, I will say to your face. You cannot make that claim methinks. All of Bruce's conferences and "meet-ups" have been held in or planned for homocentric venues. It seems pretty clear that bitcoin is just a cover for his real agenda. For years he has openly bragged of being a sex tourist, bragged of traveling to places famous for child prostitues and told the world of his hiring "boys" in these places. Regardless of the ages of these boys, the conclusion is the same. Bruce is a pervert. He is also a liar and a con man and a thief. The proof of all this is in his own words, posted to the public internt, revelling in his own obscenity and in the public record of his convictions for sex crimes and financial judgements that he has ran away from. Hi Bruno,I know you are having fun with this. You might get some insight from this;http://agoristradio.com/?p=480starting at about minute 15Shane Sociopaths don't apologise, they rationalise. In the sick mind, there are no moral boundries. Consider how poorly he covered his tracks. Note how he easily discusses in public the raping of children (who are adults). Or of how he travels from place to place perpetuating the same financial scam even after he has been caught and censured by the courts. He clearly does not have the conscience to determine right from wrong. What I find to be astonishing is, even after my pointing this out TEN MONTHS AGO, it took until now for the truth to finally sink in to the users here.We are not finished exorcising this devil yet however. There are some moderators of this board who need removing. Word wankers and twisters are liars who are injecting their own agenda into this forum. The Paxum discussion illustrates this well. The moderator lied and then closed the thread to prevent rebuttal. Since then he has resorted to attacking my character repeatedly. He is just one of those not suitable to moderate our important discussions.We need to chase these dishonorable clowns back under the rocks they crawled out from under. This forum is too important to the education of the new users to allow these abusers the ability to skew reality to fit their own diseased paradigm.  Bruce interviews Adrianne Jeffries here;http://onlyonetv.com/2011/08/the-bitcoin-show-episode-034/Everyone has their own tastes of course, but to call her "hot" would not be my choice of adjective.  The "homophobes" are the people who won't stand up to this shit in public.They tell me this by private communication in a deluge of message I don't have time to completely answer.I can see their point though. An organised group of immoral haters is something to be feared. 
I'm still waiting.Where is this proof of irrational fear of homosexuals?Losers hiding behind the internet feel safe to shout perjoratives and express fighting words, come on now and back it up now.I can back up everything I say. Why not you in this simple demand? To those tossing around the perjorative, I ask;What do you think the word "homophobic" actually means? To resist immorality and inappropriate behaviour? To be disgusted by people who are lewd in public? The word describes someone with an irrational fear of homosexuals. Who is being irrational here? Who here is actually afraid of homosexuals? The haters causing dissent are the stupid homosexuals who support each other no matter what. The haters are the ones calling names, pulling dirty tricks and rationalising criminal behaviour. We live in a civilization with an expectation of certain moral values. To lie, steal, pimp children (who are really adults) and to con desperate homeowners out of their last money is NOT acceptable. To define yourself in public by your chosen use of your private parts is NOT acceptable. Lewd and criminal behaviour is still not acceptable when the perpetrator is handicapped by birth defect, maimed in accident, poison damaged of endocrine system or any other misfortune. Being homosexual does not excuse anyone to abuse people by stealing from them, failing to pay what is owed to them or carnally exploiting them because they are poor. Astonishing. It's been 10 whole months since I first pointed out, in this forum, that Bruce's immoral and criminal behaviour makes him a poor choice for our spokesman. For that I was shouted down and had my character attacked.By now his sex tourism business, his pimping of boys (who are men) and his conning of desperate homeowners is inextricably wound around our new payment system. Will we ever overcome the stigma? The smegma? Ocassionally I have described such narrow-minded people as having their heads up their own asses. In this case though, I think it better descriptive to say you haters have your heads up each others' asses. Of course that applies only to that vocal minority of bonded haters. The quiet majority of moral bitcoin users know I don't include them in that assessment.For more thoughts on this;http://www.talkgold.com/forum/showpost.php?p=4478894&postcount=22 BROOCE!!!!Another one! How many accounts do you have on this board?Just keep digging boy. I surely do.I also wonder who paid for those 25K bitcoins he complains of losing. I know some people, including Adrianne Jeffries and her office staff bought a few on a lark, but that doesn't begin to account for who owns the bulk of that load. Who are these friends? Do they like to travel to Bruce's bitcoin conferences? Perhaps employ a few boys (boys means men) for some stinky fun?I'm not going to beat around the bush. I submit that Bruce was selling sex tourism and laundering the proceeds though MBC. Something went wrong with his plan and it became easier to just steal the bitcoin rather than follow through. Or maybe his partner Tom/d Williams double crossed him.Either way, there is still some malignant tumor that needs excising from this "community".Somebody please bring some air freshener.  That is a very good question, one I have been waiting to learn an answer to. Since brooce and Adrianne accused me of stealing the MBC, I've been expecting the knock on the door. Really, I'm tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Perhaps I'll walk over with a lawyer to RCMP tomorrow and find out for myself. Better than than get rousted by a swat team or whatever. No point in driving. I live almost next door to the main police station. Everyone knows where I live. And where my office is, and my country home and my phone number. In fact, even my aged mother is in the phone book. Not running from scam victims or from the law. Not like brooce the con artist. I wonder now what Adrianne thinks of her relationship with brooce. Still keen to protect those sources huh girl? Maybe it would be better for you to roll over on yer buddy now before your publisher meets my Bronx lawyers? No point in protecting that nest of vipers. You know how to reach me. Everyone does.  brooce shows off his 1337 hax0r skilzhttp://mike.brisgeek.com/2009/02/15/an-army-of-retweet-bots/ Moar funzies;http://www.imarketlive.com/USA/biz/bruce-wagner-omnimedia-inc-MTE2NDIwNDU.htmlhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/brucewagnerhttp://www.bbb.org/chicago/business-reviews/financial-services/bold-funding-in-chicago-il-23000452 Pushing these threads into off-topic highlights the fact that at least some of the moderators on this site are complicit in brooce's scam. If you look at when the most vocal broocy fanbois joined this forum, you can see that they came here together as a group. They are constantly boosting the brooce or hurling insults and accusations at anyone who questions what they are up to. Twisting other's words, quoting out of context, deleteing posts an otherwise censoring. Many serious people left this forum last fall because of this. I was forced to come back here recently to defend myself against this allegation that brooce conned into the NY Observer. But the off topic folder won't stop this discussion and Google will still index it. Since Brooce was apparently running, state to state, from the victims of his scams, I have to wonder why he left his beloved Thailand? Was he running from there too? I wonder what the Thai police think of bruce? Or perhaps he is Tod Williams when travveling abroad.And I'm still wondering who paid for those 25K bitcoins that were parked at MBC and what those people were expecting in return.   Oh, that was a JOKE! Well my bad. Some news reporter in a foreign country was just making a JOKE when she told the world that I'm a thief. Bruce is a con artist and he surely conned you, didn't he?Joke indeed.So assburgers, where is that proof that I made some negative judgement about being gay. Come on already. Lets see some proof of your claims! You call me a homophobe, show your work! Ah, right you are. My mistake.BitCoinMagic > Yes, VERY MISLEADING.Haha - you joker. No matter. Any Judge in Canada would look at this and say, Broocie, you did start this by calling Shane a thief. Do you really want to try to prove damages here?At that point Broocy's lawyer would ask for more cash up front. And speaking of cash, just where did Bruce get that 25K he had in MBC? He said something about his friends. Maybe those friends were paying to accompany Brooce around the world to places only notorious for sex tourism where they might pay for sex with boys who are of course all over 18 yrs old.Hmm, what was that big pile of loot earmarked to pay for brooce? Could the ledger at MBC shed some light on that? Perhasp those "friends" you speak of owning that loot might tell us why it was there, under your control?Hmm. misusing those elipses - sort of like rainbow sprinkles on a cupcake - eh scrotum cupper?You just live a sociaopathic existence, don't you Broocey? Oh, the shit just gets deeper and stinkier.http://mortgagefraudblog.com/perp-walk/item/10674-illinois_foreclosure_rescue_company_fined_and_shut_downhttp://web.archive.org/web/20040923210936/http://boldfunding.com/ Still no example of any occasion when I voiced an opinion on being gay.Not even one.Just blame it on the assburgers. That's not true at all, and your saying so betrays your lack of understanding. People still face the same problem they had getting into e-gold, Pecunix LR and now bitcoin. If you can't pay in cash, you can't get in. The auctions like Mt Gox serve a different function and are no competition to an exchanger. You might hear people refer to Gox, TH et al as "exchangers" but they are really not exchanging at all. The exchanger is Dwolla or Paxum. Mt Gox is the auction where traders meet. There is no exchange of fiat to digital currency there. Nobody at Gox will hold your hand through a WU, wire or other payment. You have to already have the DC when you get to Gox, or you can't trade there.I hold bitcoin that is decreasing in value because of this scandal, but it's something that has needed to come to a head for almost a year. Bruce was asked nicely then to not mix up his hobby of boy fucking into our new payment system. He feels entitled to goatse everyone who looks into bitcoin and has done huge damage to us for all this time. People don't want to associate with a staid subject like payment systems when it fronted up by a self appointed spokesman who clearly does not understand it and uses it only to further the above mentioned hobby. psy > U mad bro? Maybe because people have more evidence that connects you with the MyBitcoin Scam than you have against the ones you accuse?psy > If you are really that aggravated because of someone falsely accusing you, then you should be the first to hold back your horses before accusing others without evidence.As for "accusing" him, I did no such thing. I pointed out that he was inviting forum users, who are largely minors, to conference in a bath house without revealing that fact. I did no accusing. I offered the opinion that this tactic is sneaky. I have not changed my mind about that.Bruce did all the accusing of himself. I think he is so lost in his sin that he does not even recognise it as such. To him the only thing wrong is the existance of a law that opposes his luring and sexual interference. He shit his dirty felching smegma on my life's work. He brought this gaggle of supporters in with him from some bath house forum of the underground. The real payment professionals abandon the bitcoin ship in disgust. We need a conservative educated in finance to speak for the system, not a fruity dumfuk who can't get it into his head that bitcoin was developed to address the need for anonymous non-reversible payments made at long distance. Instead he wants to mold it into "meeting up" in coffee shops. We have no need for that, we have silver coins and fiat dollars already. He spent so much time trying to make bitcoin some extention of "USD" - it took people on this forum months to get him to stop doing that. He published online that my own system was some extention of USD without any idea of the tacit agreemnt he was creating for me in this.He simply DOES NOT GET IT. But he does get excited boys to "meet up" for what we have recently learned to be a fact. And one more point I need to make especially to the liar hugolp. I have NEVER had more than one nick on this or ANY forum I have used. I rarely even look at the pile of crap that this forum has become. I wish I had never even reigstered here and am ashamed to be recognised in the same species as you clawing screeching filthy lying gaggle of immoral nancys.Yeah, I'm mad bro. I've spent almost ten years working what a bunch of sociopaths has completely defiled in mere months. You are so full of shit. You twist what I say to fit you own agenda. At no point have I ever changed my mind or backed up on my opinion of that Mallick gang. I take nothing back and never did. Some moderator closed that thread before I could reply. You are a sneaky word wanker. You even misspell nanaimogold and paxum to avoid people finding this nonsense with google.  Consider when I joined this forum, and my post count. Then consider your stats, then tell us all who is here whoring for attention. makomk> Edit: Oh, and it wasn't actually Bruce or Adrianne that came up with the potential links between nanaimogold and MyBitcoin either, though I can't remember who it was that did.I don't know where that originally came from either, but the NY Observer printed the allegation and it was after my threat of legal action that it was retracted.da2ce7 > So because Bruce is gay (so what), that automatically means that he wants to have sex with children?Automatic? Have you read the material? He has been at this for years. They are selling sex tours to brothels where the victims are as young as 7 yrs old. The mob at Something Awful have uncovered loads of sick shit after discovering Bruce's other nicks. I think you better do some more reading and not try to invent soming into my posts that I never said.da2ce7 > Being gay is nothing more different than being black...Nor different from being from outer space! LOL I can't believe you just said that. You are another one who defines himself in public by what he does with his private parts. You might want to ponder that crossed wire in your psyche. Perhaps you have the assburgers, it could not be that you are just a lewd asshole, could it?The challenge remains. Where have I EVER posted any opinion on anyone being gay?COME ON NOW! You MUST have something to back up this claim!For those reading this who still have their brains intact, look at who is the most vocal haters of moral values on this board, then look at the dates they joined up. Telling, isn't it?Lies, slander, false witness, assault of children, stealing, soddomy, there is no taboo left but one. That is the act of criticising the sinners. You can't do that. Just to clarify; Bruce's referrence to "fugitives" couldn't possibly include me. My real name, address and telephone number are in the whois record. I might be the easist man to locate in all of the bitcoin realm. Nanaimo Gold is now the world's oldest running exchanger of digital currencies, the first exchanger of bitcoin and the only exchanger to run through the entire lifespan of bitcoin without a hack or more than a brief downtime.A fugitve could not accomplish that. When and where?By my recollection I have never discussed homosexuality here or anywhere else in public. My own sex life is not up for discussion either.I asked Bruce to not "wear his genitals on his shirtsleeve". I said, "I don't care if you are gay, straight or zoo, just close your bedroom door". I said it's "lewd to define your public self by what you do with your private parts". That's what prompted him and Adrianne to print lies about me being a thief. To deflect cricism for his criminal interference and luring.Yes it was me that pointed out that he was luring minors to bathhouses, but not once have I said anything about being gay or about homosexuality in particilar.Bitcoin represents the fruit of my life's work. Of course I'm angry when a dummy like bruce, who clearly does not know what bitcoin is for, nor understands the necessity that mothered the invention, does all he can to use that as a vehicle to promote his sick numbers game. When was the last time a bank exectutive tried to lure you into a coffee shop toilet? It's my point that it's inapropriate behavior. So, I challenge you haters to show anywhere I have made any judgement call on being gay. Or to anywhere that I have indicated my own sexual preference. The truth is that you DON'T KNOW because my privates are not for public discussion.And this repeated accusation that I am "homophobic" is laughable on so many levels, not the least being that I am well known for my daring and am afraid of nothing almost to the point of pathology. Afraid of homos? How ridiculous!A small vocal minority on this forum is not representative of the majority who are sickened by this whole mess and who recognise that the false accusations that I have commited a crime is a just poor attempt to smokescreen a real crime. My inbox is full of people agreeing with me, people who don't post in public to avoid the clawing gaggle of shrilling nancys that bitcoin is infested with. That will change though. Mark my words. I was wrong about them not having business using digital currency, but I'm never much wrong about anythng.
Sometimes it take a while for the truth to come to light so please excuse me for resurrecting this old thread. Because I have a good relationship with Western Union, the loss prevention officer I have been dealing with let me know what a good job I have been doing in stopping the fraud that carders attempt online with stolen numbers. Unlike many exchangers who accept WU, I can always do so using my own real name (or my partner Demitri) and do not have to hire strippers or crackheads to pick up the money for me.The OP, the guy who started this thread was doing just that. He was attempting to defraud WU by cashing out a stolen credit card through my exchange service. My old and tested fraud prevention policy stymied him. He authored this bullshit thread in retalliation. There was no possible way for him to set the Q&A as I stipulate in my instructions. He was lying when he said he did so because it's not possibile to do so when making an online payment.I hope that readers of this thread get a glimps into how difficult it is to operate a service to exchange people in and out of digital currency.  I was wrong!  It's not hard for me to admit being wrong on the occasions that I am wrong. Every thinking man makes some mistakes.   I have stated in forum and private communication that the perverts and soddomites who are sullying bitcoin with their lewdness and inability to seperate their public lives from their private parts would eventually die off or drift away from bitcoin because they have no business using private currency.  Well, I have proven myself wrong about that when I exposed their international business of selling opportunity to rape children.   Sorry about that; my mistake. They do have a big business in pimping little boys. I had no idea of how big when I first called attention to the crimes of sexual interference of a minor and of internet luring.  I suppose the next item I need to uncover is just how corrupted the moderation of the bitcoin forum is. I see a flurry of delete actions in a lame attempt to cover their filthy tracks. If this post is also deleted, it will not be lost. If my username is deleted, consider why the first registered regular user of this forum would get that treatment.   I can't be wrong about much else, hmm? Bruce and his fandom is a deliberate plant by the banksters to destroy the credibility of bitcoin? Adrianne Jefferies is a post-op transexual? The Mezi Grill is a meeting place for would-be sex tourists? MyBitCoin was the clearing house for payments made by the johns to the pimps of children? A small weekly paper in NYC is going into receivership?   When Bruce got on his stupid TV show and cried for his viewers to call the FBI, I hope many of them did. I'm not in trouble. I did nothing wrong. Bruce publicly accused me of stealing the MBC holding without any evidence as retaliation for my shedding light on his viciously evil schemes.   I'm really surprised at how stupid users of this forum were to fall for his lame attempt to shift attention away from himself and onto me. He should have picked a poor young man who knows few people in the world to scapegoat.   Well, I suppose those who deign to rape desperately poor children can't be accused of being smart enough to avoid earning the wrath of veterans like me.Shane Smith > You're even more confusing, Nanaimo.  I googled my name about 6 different ways to find these 'goth' people and all I can find are pages about my winning a recent science competition.  "More confusing" than what exactly? You say I have a poor command of the language. Do you have a "poor command" of the Google? Do you really want me to post that Goth hate shit here? I'm determined to honor my commitment to your privacy, but if you insist, I will post the goth hatin' right here. Just tell me you insist because it's your privacy I'd breech. I did not read through all this crap the other evening when you tricked me into working for you, I only spent a few seconds on it before moving on to write you, in private, "Hahaha. Goth." You remember that private email that you posted into public? Now that I look again at this, it's absolutely you for sure. There is no possible way a man could forget creating this foolish stuff, so you have to be lying about it not existing. Obviously you have been playing dirty tricks on people from the safety of your computer for years already. You sure are a piece of work, what a word-wanking, lying, hateful, selfish clown you reveal yourself to be. > Regardless, just because I don't post my name on Internet forums doesn't mean I'm some low life.  Of course not. What makes you some low life is that you posted obviously secret private material to the public for the sole purpose of hurting someone who never did you any harm, and with no consideration for any others who might be effected. That must be low life behavior to the privacy conscious readers of this board. And here's a photo of you too. Goodness, you really are a fat pasty-faced obnoxious scumbag. Not an spec of testosterone in that soy-goy. I gotta say, you look just like you act.Think hard Bobby-boob. Where did you leave this embarrassing stuff.  It comes up on the first page Google results. Shall I tell the search parameters? It's your call.There is no excuse for what you did. You approached me with the sole intention to socially engineer me. I spent valuable time checking you out and coaching you. You rewarded my effort by blabbing my secrets. > Moreover, you're 'attempt' to contact me about a financial transaction wasn't professional at all.  If you wanted to make a joke to break the ice and feel me out, I think it could be more clearly constructed.  I'm simply looking to make honest, straightforward transactions with professional people.  It's clear it is not to be found with you.> Good day, sir.Fuck you, goof. > Did you just craft a statement and attribute it to me?Perhaps I did make a mistake. With all these girls yelling, I might get confused about which one shrill what statement. At any rate, the deal was postmark within one day or the quote is stale.> You also just called one of your customers a fag and then lament "Where did all those men go?" Well, that's crafty. Take two out-of-context quotes, glue them together and viola! Something else entirely! And I did not call him a fag - he called himself that or similar.  You choose to play the sodomite clown - I choose to not take you seriously. You have no idea how I make my money, otherwise you would not provoke me. Your analysis of my trade is also laughable. Your belief that I want to trade with you, or that it is important that I trade with you is stupid.Bitcoin is not useful for anything yet. This gaggle of Nancys clawing at each other is not commerce. I will continue to do what I have always done. This forum is only useful in my weeding out idiots not to be taken seriously. > nanaimogold, I did not ask for a quote. I made an order and mailed the money. See the difference? It's not my fault you're accepting orders for something you don't have. I have bitcoin. You have pocket change stuck in the mail. You were quoted a price when you ordered. By your own word you waited a week before deciding to honor the agreement. You business practice is shady.>> And more people will give up on reading this board, like so many have before.> Do you just write like a malignant narcissist or are you a full-blown psychopath? There is nothing wrong with this forum.That makes no sense.Lots of people have given up on this forum in disgust. Consider the first members, the guys who came from the payments business, primarily the men who worked to invent bitcoin. Where are they now? Not here.I have heard from dozens of businessmen who shun this place because of the clownery and predatory pederasty. Look at who first offered to trade in bitcoin. Where did all those men go?Many traders I work with shun not just the forum, but the bitcoin itself because of the nasty self serving perverts who are so vocal here. I find myself having to explain again and again that bitcoin has potential to be a good payment system, not the extention of social disease network that this forum represents.  > I crossed the street and Royal Bank honoured the MO instantly without problems.You had to take the post office money order from the post office to the bank because the PO did not have enough money in their til to cash it. Remember when I told you about that? Remember when you called me a liar? That missing liquidity didn't stop our trade though. It was your ill manner and your breech of our trust when you put this private stuff here for the whole world to see forever. What part of private currency do you not understand? I just made arrangement to run the mo through the bank. When Demi saw the vile shit you wrote and that you posted private emails to the public he went livid. At that point there was no way he was going to cash that through his bank. No Deal. I've changed the policy and do not accept CP MO any longer. If they are not liquid, they are not worth the $5.50 extra charge. I'm not required to do business with anyone I don't want to. You can't make demands of me and insult me and post private emails to public and expect me to do as you tell me. Fuck off are the only words I have for you. Put the shoe on the other foot. How would you react?I mailed it back to you. I exercise my right of association. I don't want to trade with you. You fail to afford me the dignity an adult deserves. AshleyAshes, you never did any trade with me. That I never took you seriously is your problem. It remains your problem. You just sent me a series of email expressing your observations and making demands that I re-write my faq and to tell me that you don't like my offered price. I responded to all that and even offered to answer questions. The only one I recall you asking was as to why the Paypal payout option was grayed. "I don't have any" was the simple answer. I don't have any. Can't offer what I don't have. No Paypal today, option grayed. Pick some other option.WE HAVE NO BANANAS TODAY!My offer is very clear. It is mine to make. If you don't like it, don't accept it. Don't like the site? Don't use it. Maybe looking at it so frequently is making you mad. You say it's misleading, and I can't see that at all. I even use a nice grown up type size. Clearly laid out against other recognized sources of data, all presented in the same value denomination to avoid misleading. Good contrast - no weird colours.  No Ashy boy. You are chock full of it.https://www.nanaimogold.com/bitcoin.phpnothing misleading anywhere - at least not intentionally. It's a dynamic business and the web site is always changing. Chock full you.And your naivety is quite amazing. Anyone can Google to find what a sissy furfag you are. Why would anyone take you seriously when you present yourself that way? Especially in a financial transaction? You must have some idea of who and what I am, where I'm from. Why would you even engage me this way? I am not here at your beck and call. I laugh at idiots like you.You have no complaint. Again I exercise my right of association. You, I don't trade with. STFUIf you Google eRage's name with home city you find a pack of goths hating on him. I thought that was kind of humorous so I used it to start our conversation. I have to engage people in conversation before I can allow them sensitive information. It seems unlikely that a pack of goths hating on oneself would go unnoticed, but I suppose it's possible that another man with the same name in the same town is the object de scorn. It does not really matter how I open a conversation does it? If I google your name and something funny comes up, why not comment?This thread is ample reason why I have to feel people out before I can tell them anything. I don't know why it is that you guys think it's acceptable to post secrets in public. Shame on you all. You prove yourselves unworthy of anyone's trust.I notice eRage deleted his own real name information from his tattle, and you all should note that, because of my respect for privacy, I'm not pasting his real name and city here. You'll just have to take my word about that Google hit with the hateful goths.I need a picture of the bank receipt, not your face! But no, it's my right to not associate with you either. pfft!And to re-cap, for anyone who has waded this far through this scat-fest, the original poster discovered that he could snag quoted trades though western union by failing to set all the options correctly and gain a week to see which way the market moves before either paying or refunding. I think he did not do it on purpose, but his post in public describing how inspired a whole bunch of you dishonorable rejects to pull the same stunt. I can no longer accept WU for bitcoin because of such scum. I no longer accept cash by mail for bitcoin. It was a similar game, make the order, get a quote, wait a week to decide if the market was in your favour, then send the payment or not. In all my years trading e-gold and other digital currency, I never had such problems before. People did not wait to see the price of gold move for a week. Now it seems I'm going to have to screen even harder to select those who can trade with me through my bank accounts. I certainly can't let you privacy hating yiffers know any secrets. Canada post money orders for any digital currency I can no longer accept. That pretty much just leaves trade from other digital currency into or out of bitcoin.Some of you guys have serious moral and character flaws. To think that it's OK to post obviously secret material in public in an attempt to hurt someone, in this case me, to the inconvenience of all the people using the service, is really inexcusable. I really hope that people who miss these trade opportunities grant you all a bit of goth hate. You certainly deserve it. The topic so common to us all is privacy and encryption, but you clowns have no idea how to keep a secret and you are so selfish that you don't care a bit about the people you harm. And I suppose I'll have to put spam filter on the email address eGoof revealed. I got a cease order from Western Union about using their marques. I wonder who instigated that? Shameful behavior. Zero honor.zallon41, I don't know what happened to your letter. I process mail as it arrives. Yours is very late and will probably wind up back in your own hand. That's what my experience has shown. I don't want you to think I assume you're unable to address a letter, but it's surprising how many times people screw it up. Other times, there has been nothing wrong with addressing and is returned for no good reason. I have a large body of experience, and the mail is reliable, but nothing is infallible. I'm sorry that your experience has been bad. It doesn't make sense that I would do anything to sully my good old reputation. I'm glad you only sent small money and not more. You might be pleasantly surprised. If so, please let me know. Take a picture of the envelope for me please. Always interested to know where errant letters have been.The mail has been very reliable for many years, however, this talk of cash in the mail is contrary to security. The security at my office is ruined because of this forum. I can't risk using my office to receive mail any longer. I've had to change to another more private mailbox, at more expense, in order to protect the secrets better. I now worry that one of these privacy hating bitfags will trick me into revealing it, then post it up in public to spoil it for everyone. How girlish is that? Why am I reduced to asking people to promise to keep secrets before I can do secret trade? You guys just don't get it. Shhh It's a secret.Not everyone reading these words is a clown, of course. I despair that the clowns may have a majority on this board though, but some of you guys will tell me in private how I am right. People will still use the service to trade with me even though the screening is now lot stricter. And more people will give up on reading this board, like so many have before. > So trying to not pay you is a ridiculous claim.I never made that claim. You can twist all you like. That facts remain;I never touched your money.I tried for days to get you to fix this.I wasted my time.You were rude to me.The conditions of our trade were clear. You had one day. I let you 4.blah blah blah all you like. Don't expect me to hear any more of it.PS: Another thing. The conditions of trade are clear. I do not accept third party payments. After all your wanking, that's clearly what you and your pal were up to. I don't accept online purchases due to the high incidence of fraud. The sender can only set the Q&A when paying in person, not when paying online.That's why I use the Q&A - to weed out those who try to pay online.If he had followed the instructions, instead of trying to play me, he would have got his bitcoin just like the many others who have used the service since 2005. Instead, I refused to pick up the payment which later proved to have been attempted with a stolen credit card. It is by this wisdom and experience that Nanaimo Gold has continued to function for so many years. I'm looking forward to a wee dollop in my dry process coffee!  Well, hate me if you must, but if you expect Hugo Price and I to show up for these things we must know what is on the menu due to our chosen dietary requirements. Still I implore.What are they having for supper? Don't bother telling me what to say. I'm all for freedom of speech. Your delusion that Mexicans speak Latin is not an "insignificant detail".Of course English is a Romance language. And please answer the question, does the component "Supper" in your function's name indicate that you will be eating together?PS: Know that the OP has since edited his post. It changed the original "latin speaking country" to latin-american country. If that's what you meant, the word is Romance, not Latin, which includes the French, English and Portuguese speakers of America too.Something else I don't understand. Supper Happy Dev House, are you people going to be eating supper together? I doubt many people in Mexico can speak Latin. It's the big producers that use PE tubes cleaned with formalin. Stanley Burroughs warned us against that some years ago. God rest your soul Stanley.Is this syrup produced this year or last?

Back issues are available from 2600. The website lists the prices.  I was able to integrate bitcoin into my automation. Look at the bitcoind client. I'm sure you will be able to make it work.Or, you can use the MyBitcoin ledger system. It has a real sweet sci/api Oh cool. I did not know that.What I'm asking is; Is there any mention of bitcoin related services in the marketplace - that's 2600's classified section. Is there any ads in there that relate to bitcoin?I'll have to go buy a copy because it's not in my mailbox yet. Any mention of bitcoin services in the marketplace? I meant US bank with a national presence.The comments are interesting but I still don't have answer to my original question;"Which US bank has the most branches in the most places?"Anyway, I went with BoA and have collected a dozen counter deposits from almost as many different states. There has been some differences in paperwork, but happily there has been no additional fees so far. The experiment continues.I deduce that BoA does NOT serve the following states;HawaiiMississippiMontanaNorth DakotaSouth DakotaVermontWest VirginiaSo I don't have that 100% mainstreet USA penetration that I have in Canada. Folks in the above states can still send cash by mail. Is there any other bank that might be better suited? Or that may compliment what I have already by serving the states in the above list?I might be able to receive cash deposits from Vermont through the TD as cyfrocash. Any more ideas? Any mention of bitcoin services in the marketplace? Oh no. You used the word "fuck" in front of children. Snedie will now pitch a fit about your "vulgarity".lolGood luck in your search for an authority figure.Do you mind answering my questions about your fiat vector? You can elect to have cash deposited to any Canadian bank. I had a quick peek. Something I don't get;What do you mean by GBP? What method do you expect that to be delivered to you? By what method do you send GBP when out exchanging?Are you accepting cash by mail?What is your opinion of the Royal Mail since the big push to clean up the corruption?> We are currently in talks with legal professionals and gaining international licenses.I'm concerned that, by begging for permission, you are just setting yourself up to be consumed by parasites before you can even get going. Ever consider that, as a free man under common law, you are entitled to earn an honest living without interference? Yes, I remember. You are that address in Alabama that some folks complained was losing mail. You were not trying to mail out cash (only receive it) until now. As I recall, we suggested that you not use the word "cash" on your mail.Anyway, I'm not interested in spending time discovering your past. You are not going to succeed in mailing cash to people. In the least you will get joed and your reputation smeared.Good Luck! In spirit I accept this wager but practically we need some standard of proof. I can't think of any way to be sure that he is doing any trades.Until we can agree on that, I can't see this working. Ideas?S I'm sorry. That was not called for. Sometimes I let my frustration get away from me. I'm finding the pool miners like this service because there is no fees and no minimum.Into paypal is easy from anywhere - nothing is softer than PP. It's the other direction that can't work.My Paypal is CAD so if folks want USD, they get ripped off by PP in exchange. Nothing I can do about that until I get an account attached to my US bank account.Roberto at Aurumxchange told us he was going to put up a BTC <--> LR auto exchanger too. I hope that works out.S OK, I'm in.The way you have displayed the bitcoin addresses to spend to, as anchors, makes it difficult to select to copy to the clipboard. Really difficult.You might want to re-think that.> Why rely on the Canadian lotteryLOL, you cloistered dumfuks never fail to amuse me. How would it sound if I referred to a lottery in your country as if it were the only one? Especially if that country were the second largest on earth?lol Generally, horses are not permitted to bet on their own races. There is nothing to stop you from pretending to remain in business past 45 days just to win the bet.The offer to bet must be limited to those not involved with your enterprise.Any takers? For a quick trade in or out of Liberty Reserve, you might use the automatic trader on the bitcoin page of the Nanaimo Gold website. https://www.nanaimogold.com/bitcoin.phpPlease do not look for support in this forum. I don't often post here and less often read. Please use the contact form on the NG website. PGP and SSL are both supported. You may also use the live chat feature - also protected by SSL.Shane All the national currencies are compared by the spot price of gold in those currencies. Because there is so little volume traded gold to bitcoin, I used the relation to USD for the basis of that comparison. It's how I price Pecunix to bitcoin trades.Beware that, in the real world, the banksters will steal 2-5% of your value when you actually go to make a trade with them. Many banks post up their rates for cash trades. That makes the bitcoin calculator very accurate in comparing rates of exchange, but don't forget the bankster's sticky fingers when you are figuring stuff out. > the only other cash-by-mail Bitcoin exchangeOh, contraire!There are several others.Nanaimo Gold is the oldest and largest exchanger of bitcoin. I likely do more cash by mail than all the other services combined. My daily volume often exceeds that of Mt Gox and I am only one trader. I have been backing up bitcoin with gold, silver and digital currency since day one. I have been involved for almost a decade in the design of this P2P money. Not for the sake of making exchanges, but for the sake of the commerce it allows.OK, that being said, Madhatter is right on all accounts. I can tell you from a vast experience that you can't mail cash to strangers. If they are not outright lying about not receiving their mail, they are outsmarting themselves by having you send to the empty house next door where the crackheads are currently squatting or they are failing to provide you with a deliverable address because they are too stupid to address a snail mail.Everyone is responsible for what he mails. You are never going to qualify your cash recipients as honest, and you are never going to have force of law in international trades. When your cash is lost to thieves, as it certainly will be on occasion, you will be obligated to replace it. Everyone is responsible for what he sends. Nobody is responsible for what he fails to receive.Don't forget that the people of the USA are minor players in this trade. If you restrict yourself to just that one country, you will be barring more than 70% of your potential business. If not, most of your cash mailings will have to cross customs and you will have to know what mail ports are not safe, in what countries. This knowledge is hard won and took me many years.Don't expect the police to help you combat fraud. They are players for the bankster owned government that already hates you as a unique terrorist.I have been involved in cash trade for gold by mail for 30 years, since before many readers of this forum were even born. I know all the tricks and all the pitfalls.Listen to the Madhatter. He is correct.If you are not too arrogant to consider a partial solution to the problem; you can safely deposit cash to your recipient's bank accounts as long as they are using a national bank that you can reach a branch of. That will cover about 8% of your potential trades. If you can prove to be a team player, which I currently doubt, I can send you to make lots of deposits on behalf of Nanaimo Gold as I only have one US bank account (BoA).Your idea that any of us are competing suggests to me that you don't know what you are doing. There is too little profit to be made here. The exchangers are vital to the health of the bitcoin economy. The more the merrier. We need MANY more services like your's and Madhatter's if the prices are to ever stabilize enough for merchants to adopt bitcoin. Just don't expect to make much money from doing exchange. The real money is in the commerce that bitcoin will eventually facilitate.I expect I know how you will react to this sage advice, so really, this post is for the benefit of those not still enduring the teenaged know-it-all years. You can't trust people unless you know them. You can't have anonymous trade if you have to qualify customers for credit.And who the hell is going to pay you $15 just to mail a letter? I only charge $7 to stand through a bank queue! All you are going to attract with that pricing scheme are scammers who will try to get you to pay twice.I predict your service will fail and be gone within 45 days. Anyone care to bet against me?Flame me all you like. I won't bother to respond. You can have the last word on this thread. Anyone who want's my attention can reach me through the NG website. Reading this forum can harm one's intelligence, so I tend to ignore it. You might find use for the currency calculator onhttp://www.bitcoinroundup.com/ MyBitCoin has a new internal messaging system for support. You can log in to send a message to admin. This will work even when email is failing. If you don't have an account, you can easily make one. If you lost your password, there is nothing to stop you from opening another. Apparently, there is no support presence on this forum, so let's be logical and not demand to get admin help here. Thanks Klaus for the lucid explanation of the email problem. hippich, was your problem resolved? Intermediary, did you get an answer? Don't leave your complaints dangling in public. As for closing a digital currency account, there is no purpose and no function to do so. Accounts of this type are simply abandoned. Spend it out and forget it. Somebody put a lot of time and effort into the creation of MyBitCoin and is graciously allowing us it's use. To be less quick to condemn would go a long way to help the entire movement. 
What are you talking about?> The site says the don't accept responsibility for transactionsWhere? Why would I say that?> It does also say that previous transaction info is availableWTF are you talking about? In what legal regime do you lay your head at night? Serve the site from? Hold your bank accounts? Are you now, or do you plan to incorporate? To what arm of the FATF are you expected to report? Do you intend to file a promise there? UmmmHow does an ISP make an exchange business "legit"? DNS is poisonedNon-authoritative answer:Name:   mtgox.comAddress: 74.52.143.58try adding the IP to your HOSTS file or just wait it out.

Nothing.No one will use it.Only dinosaurs and bus riders read printed newspapers and only then if the news is very fresh.Anything that has to be delivered by mail is too stale and too expensive.You would be better rewarded by putting that effort into an online magazine or blog.This coming from a former newspaperman who rose from carrier to publisher; Paper news is old news. Try using 'www' ptmhd mailed me hundreds of trillions of dollars!Arrived today. What comes after trillionaire? That's me. I'm a bazillionaire! Are you saying that your bank account number is a secret that you can't trust Papal to know? That makes no sense at all. There is a community of Brazilians at goldage.net They can steer you to a LR exchanger that is local to you. With LR in hand it's a cinch to trade into BTC.Why don't you become a bitcoin exchanger yourself? I suggested a way for BrBoy to operate and earn some money earlier in this thread but he said it was a bad idea without explaining why. You might consider it for yourself. Exchangers are needed everywhere. Now is a good time to get involved. You yelled at me and attempted to boss me around. Now you say you have no idea? Did you just forget that or what?You consistently fail to answer the questions I put to you, yet I don't yell or get bossy about that failing.This all stems from the fact that you can't accept the truth about the owners of the government directing the police against alternate currencies. Perhaps some lessons on critical thinking are overdue? > Show me where the fuck I said that you did.Right here;>> recall you supporting a ban of illegal trades in this forumAnyway, you have already won the wishy washy word wanking award. I know that changing the subject is classic wanking, and you really do have a flair for it, but it's not necessary because you are already the undisputed champion twister.> Explain how this does not show that you are willing to compromise your principles?No. You deserve none. Anyone can use a dictionary. Anything more I can say would only be repeating myself.It is my principle to not advocate banning anything.Damn, there goes that repeating myself again. That's precisely why I never vote in these polls. For BitterTea to declare that I did vote is annoying however. You win the wishy washy word-wanking award. See there? Stated in plain English? The first line of my post? Here, lets quote that yet again, with bold this time:> In principle I don't advocate for banning anything, however I have serious concerns about advertising contraband on this forum.It's my PRINCIPLE. How much more rock solid can I state that?Do you have any principles? Do you just waver on the breeze? On the whim of fashion? Do you stand fast on any issue?Do you even understand what the word means? > I think you just lost a possible customer.Oh, that's just so typical of the TV audience. You actually believe that's your decision to make. Consumerist clowns like you need a case study. Ever heard of ING bank? It's popular in places where men are mostly responsible for their actions, where the population is not all soy addled followers of fashion. Anyway, they annually identify the 10% or so of their account holders who cost them the most in support issues and just FIRE THEM.Sorry, you are too stupid to bank here. Go cost our competition. Thanks!That concept is just so foreign to you isn't it? The idea that a business would decline to service you - you just can't get you head around that can you?Wah wah! I am the consumer - I am always right - it says so on my TV. You have to do as I tell you. I am the consumer wah wah!These are not the people I do business with. Frankly, they have no business to do anyway.  Don't put words in my mouth. Read the post again if you are unsure; http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3535.msg51193#msg51193My concern is that certain clowns, who blab nonstop about privacy and security can't recognise what is a secret or how to keep one. Bozos who are so self centered that it never even dawns on their dim mindscape that their actions put their intended cashiers in jeopardy. And you SHOULD NOT attempt to tell me what to do. I am not your fucking secretary.Back in the old days people had to travel to libraries and wait for information to come by mail. You can JUST GOOGLE IT.There is so much written on exchangers being harassed and jailed and even killed you could fill an entire library. Disregarding what I have said because you simply don't want to believe it indicates an immature thought process. Do YOUR OWN HOMEWORK.
Nice to see you here Roberto. I wrote you a great long post but decided against it because I was getting to esoteric matter that is not suited to a public board.Best wishes,ShanePS are you aware of this? Argh.If you use monies, you are under contract with the issuer.Paypal is not a digital currency, it is a payment processor, a carrier of fiat money.Any trades of bitcoin for fiat money puts the parties subject to that contract.The SS will kick in the door and arrest anyone that their owners tell them to arrest. Private currencies undermine their owner's carefully crafted illusion of monopoly in money creation. Money problems and control issues are not a new thing. Digital currencies are not a new thing. Persecutions and prosecutions of facilitators of private money is not a new thing.I wish you kids would take some time to study the history. What you think is fair or equitable has no parallel in reality. This is a power struggle and the enemy owns your government and directs it's police. They own the drug trade, arms trade, public relations, gambling and other vice. They are not elected. If they catch you in their house using your own home-made poker chips, they will jail or kill your ass. By it's nature, exchange in or out of fiat money puts the exchanger clearly in the house.Back to the subject at hand; What is up with LR? I am in contact with the founders of LR, whom I have known and done business with since before the creation of LR in '02, and have a relationship with someone on the inside who just came back to Canada from Costa Rica. I am assured that there is no bank charter contract pending and that the increased KYC is only for the protection of customers against crackers and lost passwords. Do I believe this? No, I do not. The owners of the governments have a long history of slow incrementalism toward collectivist totality. Today LR want you to verify that you have used your registered (slave) name. Who knows when, but sometime soon I predict that they will want to verify addresses. Then they will attempt to bring users under statutes that will turn LR into another payment processor. The gun held to the head of the trustee will remain unseen, but you can be sure it exists. For every stick there is a corresponding carrot. In this case the promise of charter.On the other hand, there is no reason to panic. LR is not going to become a carrier of fiat anytime soon. After watching a half dozen previous systems fall to the tyranny, I have developed a good sense of timing my exit. Until LR starts freezing accounts pending presentation of gov issued (slave) ID, I'm not going to worry.LR's primary exchanger just came to me with the offer of zero cost in. I predict that we will see out exchanges get more expensive and in exchanges might pay a premium, but I don't see the jackboots grabbing the loot quite yet.Use it as it was intended - a communication vector, not a savings account.  You have your trust issues backwad methinks.Why would a bitcoin seller trust you and your reversible MoneyBookers? I'll bet if you did the same post about a Nigerian scammer, the bitfags posting here would shrill and stamp and call you racist.lol @ bitfags Note how the OP never fails to preclude the word "scammer" with the word "Russian". George Jung long ago discovered that piles of rat gnawed stinky green paper was difficult to trade into anything of value outside of the excited states.Yellow metal carries easily, resists rodent damage and is readily traded into luxury cars and fast women anywhere in the world. In principle I don't advocate for banning anything, however I have serious concerns about advertising contraband on this forum.By doing so, you paint a target on the exchangers.Too few of you understand what exchangers have already been through. It was police action over gambling that caused every exchanger in the USA to quit or flee. What is the FBI and RCMP going to do now that some of you have openly advertised sale of drugs by mail? Gambling got exchange people imprisoned, exiled and even murdered. What is police reaction going to be now, offering illegal drugs for sale and naming exchangers in the same posts?In the past few weeks I've noticed links to illicit offers in my referrer logs. In all my years of working as cashier to the internet I've never seen such blatant disregard for the principles of discretion. The men who run the bitcoin markets and the exchange services are not anonymous ghosts. We are real people in meat space with reams of law to obey, ID documents, bank accounts, offices and licenses. We can very easily be tapped by the lawmen. Do you jokers really think exchangers will work for you when you have such little regard for their liberty? Shut the hell up already. You can't convert Paypal for anything resembling cash. Not for anything remotely liquid.Trading bitcoin in and out of LR is easy, cheap and quick.Read again post I made above. Why not?I don't understand your logic. Does BoA have branches in all states? Is there one near you? What about Wells Fargo? Citibank?At one time many of the states had laws prohibiting branch banking, or branches with out of state head offices. At one time a banker could not make a loan to anyone more than one day's return journey on horseback distant!The laws have changed and the bank scene has evolved.Which US bank has the most branches in the most places? People already can automatically swap BTC in or out of LR  with low fees and no minimum, auction style at Mt. Gox or instantly at NG. That functionality has been in use for over a year already.Bank wires have to be large enough to overcome the hefty flat fee. LR works fine for small spends, even for micropayments.  Probably that particular exchange operator was not in a buying mood that day. Another exchanger would offer you more.This crazy unstable exchange rate has made bitcoin more of a stock market game than a good money for commerce. It's difficult to set prices or plan ahead when it's changing so rapidly.Coffee4Bitcoin can charge a fair price today, but by the time it is delivered the customer feels he has paid too much. I expect any product that can't be delivered immediately might produce these negative feelings.The opposite has also happened, where a day or a week later, the BTC I collected was worth less than I paid for the coffee. The intrinsic value of bitcoin is in it's unique utility. That utility is adversely affected by wild price changes. And if we are going to stand for that, we might as well just stick to using credit cards. Which brings us back to the worry that LR is becoming a bank. EUREKA! It works! I have one more bitcoin!The defense against Paypal chargebacks is to not use Paypal at all. Paypal only works when the receiver trusts the spender. As a consumer protection feature, Paypal allows buyers to back out of trade and charge back their purchase. Users might cry that they did not get what they paid for, or they may claim their account was cracked or phished. Paypal will take the money back from the receiver.As a seller, it's easy to trust someone who is buying a service that can't easily be resold, such as a subscription.  With something liquid, the classic example being the mail order laptop, it's harder to trust the spender. What is to stop him from charging back after the hardware is shipped? In the case of trading Paypal for cash money, like bitcoin, it's very hard to trust the spender. Nothing is more liquid than digital currency. It belongs to the bearer, as does cash. It's easily traded into anything you can imagine. It's liquidity is very attractive to phishers and scammers. There is a whole army of thieves who understand this and will steal from you Quip. This is an old problem and has been addressed so very often by every digital currency in use, past and present.When you start verifying and validating and ID ing and KYC ing and AML ing and on and on, you completely undo the benefit that the digital currency delivers. It's no longer private. Privacy is the necessity that did mother this invention. It's no longer cheap. All that checking and validating and getting to know someone is time consuming and expensive. In the end, you will be wrong about some users and you will be the only one to pay for those errors.Now you are an exchanger; you are effectively upgrading the hardness of your users' money. The buck stops with you. You are the firewall against fraud. Good luck and best wishes. Sounds like "plunge protection team" lies. In the near future, nothing is going to go down against the USD, even dogshit is going up against the USD. Silver is currently even more undervalued than gold.Silver might go down against RE, but I doubt it. Might go down against gold, but I doubt that too.I'll bet you all the silver I own that reality will unfold exactly opposite to this forecast.  Cash deposit to USA bank account. link2voiptalksugarnanaimogoldYou know, businesses are not often judged solely by websites.What bout Mt Gox? BTCex?Are you some sort of site critic? What are your credentials? That's what I figured, but Raulo says no. > Correction. The first is minted in 1370=1991/2 AD. The other is 1367=1988/9 AD. According to my numismatics books, only brass coins were struck in those years. Well, no. I can't know what to offer you. Nice.Maybe this is correct;Minted in 1979, called "Bahaar-e Azaadi" or "Bahar-e Azadi"if so, the gold content;8.136g * 21.6 Kt (90%) 7.3224g au * $43.8664 $321.21 USD / 0.9291 = 345.72 BTC ea.plus a premium for being a sweet coin.
A bank solicits deposits and makes loans at interest. Mt Gox is a financial services business (FSB).  Since these definitions come from France, I will assume they are also used there. FATF is Groupe d'action financière (GAFI) Generally, this "authority" claims that FSBs who transmit money must be licensed. I can argue that exchangers don't transmit money, and be correct, but the opposition has proven themselves to be motivated to something other than justice.  I know I shouldn't make jokes but you can't overlook the irony. Egypt is the birthplace of the big scam that is the globalists most formidable psy-weapon, terrorism. Sayid Qatib had his concerns about Western decline solidified by beatings and torture at the hands of the CIA (MOSSAD) in Egypt. He was eventually hanged for refusing to recant, but not until he started a rage called the Muslim Brotherhood that has been pwnd by that same spookworld  ever since.Need agents provocateur for a bit o' the ol' hegelian dialectic? The right buttons and how to push them to get a bloody riot to frighten the TV audience? An embassy blown up live on TV? or maybe even worse? Terrorists: US tax dollars at work!Egypt was proving ground for false flag terrorism back to the Lavon affair. There is a great long history of dirty tricks played out on the world stage at the expense of the innocent victims. Unpunished war crimes of the worst sort, and so many!I recall a good documentary, surprising how it got to the public airwaves, called "The Power of Nightmares". I can't say much more in public, but this I can;Bank wires are not the solution. Those online poker cashiers were busted through bank wires of USD. Being outside the US does not solve the problem because for the past 4 years or so, all wires in US funds are diverted through a US (NYC) "corespondent bank" who spies out your deals and charges the victim $15. Panama is the worst. They actually use USD as national currency and are therefore totally under the thumb of the "owners", the Federal Reserve. Not only would you have to be outside the US, none of your wires could carry USD.Perfect Money is not perfect. They are currently melting down and selectively scamming their stakeholders.HD-Money has taken the only logical approach and is unregistered, and unattached to any legal fiction or person - a pirate corp. If the privateers board her, the killing will be swift and the booty will be carted off to feed the beast but the jackboots are stymied as to where the treasure is buried and they can't finger anyone for the rubber hose treatment. Guess all you like. Nobody is going to admit he is pushing the buttons and hiding the booty. It might work.As for LR, the founders decided to not admit ownership after being jailed in NYC. Since then it's been a mystery. There is some sort of corp reggy to enable the banking, but that's surely a trustee. And no davout, for the nth time, Mt Gox is not a bank. Check a dictionary. If Jed had a charter to create money, especially in this bailout climate, he wouldn't bother with petty little bitcoin. (Let me know Jed because I'd like a bailout loan too).And that is the rumour about LR, that they contracted a charter under under the Costa Rican gov.BTW, most CR corps bank in Panama. You know, the country that got INVADED by the US over bank deposits. some more jargon for googlers; financial services business (FSB) financial action task force (FATF) Financial Intel Center (FINCEN) financial tracking agency (FINTRAC) mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) Inside the USA?

In a fair debate, no other argument could prevail. These adults are encouraging pre-pubescent children to sex. It's criminal. There are lots of examples of real lectures to children on this inappropriate subject and even more disinformation if you care to look for it. Imagine the outrage if someone tried to organise a discussion on the importance of family. It's not a new phenomenon. Those with an agenda to conquer know this behavior has been component in the downfall of all civilisations. The goal of this interference is not to validate themselves or to widen their potential for contact. Such motives might entice those on the front line, but the enablers, those who place the funding and do the organising, for them the goal is the tearing down of civilisation. Sexual interference with children is just one of many prongs in their arsenal.An example of the depth of power. Recently the Dire Straights song, "Money for Nothing" was banned from radio in Canada. It's a 25 year old pop classic that uses the word "faggot" (got his own jet airplane!).http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/christie-blatchford/talk-about-money-for-nothing/article1871151/At any time, including the after school and the drive home times, you can turn on the radio to hear the most vile words in the English language, hatefully barked out, expressing and aggrandizing misogyny, race hatred, violence and criminal behavior. These songs are not banned. These songs are showcased and even promoted to children. Same people, same agenda.And on environmental poison; We have known for three generations that fluoride makes people docile and easier to control. It hardens the pineal gland and dulls the intuition. Fluoride is a good thing if you want to control a camp full of criminals or political prisoners. It's not good for your teeth. It's a toxic waste from the production of aluminum that is slowly snuffing out the spirit of people who drink water laced with it.http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2886269353175462948#Another organised vector for disseminating associated materials, light metals, sprayed from aircraft.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf0khstYDLAAnd there are the "estrogen mimickers". Soy milk, bisphenol-A and a host of other natural and man made chemicals that can bend gender in animals and people. We have known for 75 years that bisphenol-A mimics the effects of female hormone.

Somehow some group managed to get this stuff into food and water containers and we have been sucking it up from our baby bottles and bean cans ever since. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-first-to-declare-bisphenol-a-toxic/article1755272/Unfortunately it's too late for many boys who will never grow up to be men.

Why does a group of people plot to bring down civilisation? They want to own the whole world. It's simple really. They are willing to break it if necessary in their quest for total unopposed domination.This is nothing new. Lenin describes it well. The revolutionary must destroy the establishment before a new order can come to power.Miscegenation robs people of a heritage. Without their ancestors to ground them to their purpose they float loose and are easily manipulated. Without heritage, they make perfect minions for the NWO.Nation is antipathy to internationalists. Nation shares direction and determination. Strong nation cannot be defeated or shackled by totalitarianism. Consider Afghanistan, the cohesion, the national unity of the people is what has kept them fighting for almost 3000 years. It's their common bond that drives and determines them. They can't be defeated as long as they remember who they are and celebrate the glories of their forefathers.Nation is constructed of community and community is constructed of families. It is the families that are under attack to facilitate the breaking down and corroding of society, thus allowing the coming of the new age of tyranny. Then the despot will rule a morass of desperate stupidity from ivory towers and mankind will fall into another dark age. Or worse.And to understand how it's not unfeasible for a small group to influence the whole world, consider the formulas of Ed Bernays.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcYBSXgtmKQ Reminds me of the anarchic bliss delivered to Mossadegh by Kermit Roosevelt to relieve the Persians of their democracy. Tyrants quiver with anticipation. All this has been hashed over and long since sorted out.e-gold debuted in '96. Since then a great network of cashiers has been developed.People regularly move large sums through established escrow services and exchangers. For example, WebMoney is a many many thousands of times larger than bitcoin but has the exact same fundamental security issues.There is no problem to send a bank wire, or deposit cash at the counter. There are several other secure value communication vectors, some slow, some cheap, others not. Credit cards and Paypal do NOT work.Hawala is well integrated into digital currency and settlement of huge values is trivial through bullion banks such as Anglo Far East. There are several other non-reversible currencies, well matured and well trusted that can be traded instantly for bitcoin without risk.You guys don't realize this has all been done before and the solutions have been long tested. The pitfalls and the scams are the same as they have always been. Sure, the peer to peer nature of bitcoin is novel, but the channels to liquidity are exactly the same as all the other non-reversing digital currencies.e-Bullion offered the crypto hardware to protect user accounts almost 10 years ago. e-gold could be spent through a cell phone almost 15 years ago. The concept of internet money is not new. Bitcoin was developed from this body of knowledge. It's a progression rather than a completely new invention.It's only now that the major exchangers are starting to pick up bitcoin. For example GoldNow is about 12 years running, Nanaimo Gold is over 7. There are dozens more major internet cashiers that might yet pick up bitcoin. But that does not matter when you can safely trade any of these non-reversible digital currencies instantly in or out of bitcoin.So your chosen exchanger does not support bitcoin? Buy some Pex or LR and trade that in and out of bitcoin. Once you have real on-line cash, it's no big deal to trade it for another flavour. I understand your struggle and respect your courage. Stop the NWO. Preserve the blood and soil. Protect the diversity of God's creation.Find 50 BTC donation in your purse. I'll take 30 - should pack up to less than 50 grams. See your PM for details. Actually, it was his reference to $3 USD a day that prompted me to say that. Simple people think that money is valuable and equate the lack thereof with poverty. They look at those with money as somehow being responsible for their own deprivations. The perfect tool for a would-be tyrant. There is obviously an organised agenda. I see people wearing Che t-shirts while the radio is playing a song about being a "teen-ages anarchist". You talk to them about their politics and you are likely to hear the same old proletariat complaints with a hip new varnish.It's Madison avenue tactics and that does not come cheap.If you want a glimpse into the truth, find out who paid to rent the bus they pulled up in. You can't "sign" anything online and elected German officials owe nothing to those not their own constituents.Smoke another one. 0And in true proletariat delusion you think this poverty is caused by a lack of money.You might join an organisation of anarchists (otherwise known as Marxist-Leninists), destroy the government, eat the rich then sink back into the mire of sub-humanity that is the natural state of miscegeny. Mexico is one of the richest places on Earth. You have fertile soil, clement weather, abundant seas, a wide variety of minerals within easy reach, easy living and natural beauty.It's much easier to point the finger of blame for failing to live right than it is to look in the mirror for the cause. > you'd be rewarded with bitcoins for your hard work.You are asking people to consider trading their labour for bitcoin; how can you call that bitcoin "free"? I have discovered that posters who use the word free seldom mean what they say. Good thing that only one in twenty internet users is of that nationality.Obama? Isn't he the silly bunt that told the US Americans to stop using so many IPs because he was running out them?My my my. Japanese children blow IPV6 kisses your way mr. smart guy. The promotion of miscegenation and the homosexual agenda and other moral corrosives, along with widespread poisoning by flouride and phyto-estrogens is a calculated assault committed by the master racists.The result is partially illustrated here;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBhersb5l40&feature=relatedConsider the quality of the people who lived in the USA only three generations ago.I remember my grandfather grousing about the world going to hell. I was lead to believe that was a complaint typically made by old men. Since then I have seen the foundation of civilisation reduced to a rot far worse than my grandfather could imagine. Obviously there was a time when civilisation was improving, not desolving.This was not a natural progression, it has been a calculated plan. Some say an ancient plan, other say the conspiracy was hatch about 100 years ago.This 4+ hr documentary was produced in Nanaimo by a filmaker who prefers I don't mention her name online;http://www.google.ca/search?q=ring+of+power&tbo=p&tbs=vid%3A1&source=vgc&hl=en&aq=fI think you will find it enlightening. I don't completely agree with Ruppert on every point, but his book, "Crossing the Rubicon", is a real eye-opener.Mike was a narc with the LAPD and his family are a bunch of CIA/NSA spooks. He was involved with Gary Webb's expose of the US gov traitors coke peddling and the Iran-Contra drugs for arms scandal.Crossing the Rubicon was published in Nanaimo, home of real men with big thoughts. I once asked Mike why he did not publish in the USA. His answer I'm sure you can all guess.http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Rubicon-Decline-American-Empire/dp/0865715408His recent movie is kinda weak though. The sniveling is so unmanly. Gotta avoid those plastic lined food cans Mike. The exchanger needs to know that the bank account belongs to the person who placed the order. To avoid this snooping and delay, send your bank wire in person from your bank, not by online method.The exchanger may have made this requirement in his promise of performance to his national representative of the global police, FATF.Since cashing out a phished account through a third party can be considered obscuring the origin of proceeds of crime, the crime being the fraud, his MSB licensing authority has required him to find a way to stop such structuring. Making the sender show his ID to match the name on the account is an effective way to stymie this crime.If you want to remain private in your dealings with exchangers, do all the fraud prevention yourself. In this case, sending the wire in person assures the receiver that you are the true owner of the account. That can't be a serious question.
Who "we"? The USA? Those slaves need liberate themselves first methinks.You missed mention of these two thwarted US aggressions on Canada.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B12FA355D1A728DDDAA0A94D9415B818CF1D3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_boundary_disputeThe war of 1812 was actually about the corrupted Bank of England forcing it's will upon the USA. I wonder if anyone has added up the number of dead resulting from fights over who creates the money. Must be approaching a billion people driven to kill each other for the power of debt based banking.Anyone remember the Canada - Spain war? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbot_WarAnyway, Canada has never lost a war. That can't be said about the USA. Perhaps this guy has the right idea;http://www.howtovanish.com/2010/12/do-you-need-to-sue-a-tsa-agent/Bill Rounds is a Bitcoin user.Maybe we should all be wearing spy-cams when boarding planes.http://www.bitcoingadgets.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1_4&products_id=30 Outstanding! You clearly have a comprehension problem. The goal is to disassociate our commerce from the Federal Reserve. You do all you can to make Bitcoin an extension of the US dollar. Talk about unclear on the concept.You publicize a business that operates in only one country as "global" while on the same page describe a truly global service as "local".I criticize your lack of public decency and your airing of private issues in public and you fail to understand that too.My observation has nothing to do with "minorities". It has nothing to do with what year this is nor who I chose to marry.It's your lack of moral decency and inappropriate public airing of your private junk and the association with my work that troubles me.Decent people keep their junk in the closet; they don't define themselves by their peccadillos nor do they parade their embarrassing abnormalities for all to see.I imagine all the people who punched your name into Google and got goatse'd after hearing that lame interview you gave on radio. You do not speak for me. Read the other thread (linked above) where he insinuated that I have deceived him and tells a lie about my not answering his emails. Then observe again (this thread) where he lies about when he sent the letter.Until his letter was delivered, his contract was with Canada Post, not me. In fact, it's his deal with Canada Post until I cash the money order. That's what he paid Canada Post $6 for. Bugging me daily by email and telephone without regard to his own calendar is childish enough, but when he went public and accused me of foul play I invoked my right of association.How deluded is someone who hold the receiver responsible for the mail he sends? (mail in this case that was delivered on time) I am perfectly within my right to decline to entertain him further.I have said all there is to say on this subject. Nanaimo Gold service is long established and rock solid. Impatient children and their tiny trades are welcome only to the point where they feel entitled to bad mouth me in public by telling lies. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2649.0This trade was settled Jan 06 23:00 PST > on Dec 29 2010Your postmark date is Jan 01. The imprinted date on the money order is Jan 30, yet somehow you mailed it before you bought it.I routinely ignore impatient punters who can't wait a week for their mail to be delivered. What else would be logical?You are NOT a paying customer. I do Bitcoin trade for FREE. You paid me NOTHING.I don't want your scandal, impatience or sense of entitlement. Go away.------------Bitcoin is a new digital currency that works in new ways, but the need to trade people in and out digital currency is not new. Many of the problems and frustration that the "bitcoin community" are currently concerning themselves with are actually old problems shown to a new group. -----------Nanaimo Gold is one of the longest running digital currency exchange services. Currently I support Liberty Reserve, HD-Money, Pecunix, c-gold, Bitcoin, cash by mail, Western Union, MoneyGram, Canada Post money orders and other means tailored to specific needs. Rates vary from 0 to 6.9%, depending upon the trade. Advice on streamlining payments, avoiding fraud and reducing fees is free of charge.Much of the work is automatic, or as close to automatic as the currency issuers allow. Nanaimo Gold customers initiate trades from many countries on all continents (except Antarctica!) I have longstanding relationships with many other digital currency traders around the globe who have access to different currencies and banking regimes. Nanaimo Gold is a member of the Global Digital Currency Association since 2005.  OK, I have identified you now.Since you posted that letter, you have sent 2 emails from the contact form, not "three times with the contact page on both sites".You lie in public and I'm calling you on that.You posted a letter to me on Jan 01 arriving Jan 06. The trade was settled Jan 06.What are you complaining about?Why are you complaining in public? Oops! Spelling error!Two e's in Coffee!;-) Yes, both domains are the same service.I can't identify you from this posting so I can't say for sure. Let us know if the issue is resolved. > Sending "cash in the mail" is something I won't do: there is no chance for my mail to cross the ocean, I Think.Why is that? OK, that's fixed. True enough. But consider that he does not know that, and we can't know where he got his PP.talkinrock is not being personally insulted here. Chances are that his $11 PP is OK and chances are he would not mess around. But as a business policy, PP can't be acceptable for trade into cash. No. Fuck sakes. Just start at the top and read this thread again. Not only does the receiver have to trust you not to screw around, he has to trust that you know the PP is good and that you are not just a unwitting link in a chain of theft. That $11 PP you want to spend might be hot before you received it yourself. 45 days from now, everyone who touched that $11 might have their account frozen. You can't know, it's not about your "rep".Paypal is not a suitable vector for currency exchange. It works only for illiquids such as subscriptions.The safety that PP brags about is all buyer protection and the friendly Nigerians know exactly how to screw you over with that policy.You know my face is blue, but understand; all this shit has been hashed over for so long already. It's always the same old crap. e-gold debuted in '97 - this issue is not new. Paypal does not work for this task. The end. People can claim to be "hacked", to complain that they did not authorize the spend. Since there is no signed paper contract, the bank will claw the spend back and leave the receiver with no avenue to arbitration.You need to understand that thieves are attracted to liquid assets. Nothing is more liquid than cash. If you are trading out cash, you better be settled with nothing less than cash.Services and continuing business relationships are served well enough by reversible spend vectors because those are items a thief cannot run off with. You can take a cheque from a stranger for a magazine subscription, but you better not sell laptops like that.Nothing is more liquid than digital currency. I said Paypal sucks and is totally inappropriate as a vector for currency exchange. You can trade your Alertpay for Liberty Reserve;AlertExchanger.com Erachange.com Goldexpay.com Exchangeap.comLiberty Reserve can be traded for Bitcoins at Mt Gox or Nanaimo GoldAlertPay sucks because they try to babysit their customers and do reverse spends on occasion. Few exchangers accept it anymore because of the delays and freezes. Liberty Reserve is a much better digital currency. e-mail money transfers can be charged back.I once helped a young fellow in New Brunswick start up an exchange service, M@ple Money dot ca. I warned him about accepting payments online.He was defrauded out of existence in only 5 weeks through EMT chargebacks. I would like to see you succeed but years of bad experiences have made me very skeptical of any currency trades using soft money.Your Paypal account is tied to a bank account and your gov issued ID, your real name, you home addresss and all your other contact vectors are on file for the pwnd police forces to access at any time.You cash out a gaming winner and you have commited a felony in USA. But I expect you will get broken by the fraudsters before then.BTW, the owners of the US gov are known to organize fraud and dos attacks and other crimes when that is easier than lying in court. You are facing a very dirty enemy.  This is why I don't think you know the risks.Make us a list of all the US based digital currency exchangers. You might try repatriating foreign banknotes.If you are able to locally acquire paper money from a country where exists a digital currency exchange service, you could mail the paper back to it's home country to trade for BTC or LR. That way you will avoid fees and possibly even profit from the experience.Also, you might find a digital currency exchanger in Brazil who will accept your real deposited to his bank account in trade for LR that you can then trade for BTC from Mt. Gox or nanaimogold.com.I can't recommend an exchanger in Brazil, but there certainly must be several in such a large and modern country. I will make inquiry on your behalf.Perhaps you can start you own exchange service in Brazil. I encourage you.You could take your real to Western Union and send it to me for trade into Bitcoin. Unfortunately, WU is very expensive.Those are your options, as I see it.best wishes Frankly, for a Paypal or other reversible transaction to be safe, the receiver must trust the spender. Not just to be a straight shooter, but also to understand the risk of chained freezes that occur when stolen funds are passed to a third party.The OP concerned primarily with the receiver being trustworthy clearly indicates that he does not understand this and could be unwittingly passing stolen funds. $11 is only a small amount, but any amount of stolen PP is enough to get accounts frozen and create huge hassles for those involved.
The word "international" is not a synonym for non-USA. International means cross-border.A payment can be international, but an account cannot be. For example, when a US American buys a bitcoin from a Chilean, the transaction is international but that does not make the US American's account international.US Americans are the only people who make this mistake, and frankly, it's only one of the myriad ways they make themselves look stupid. So, in the interest of protecting your image, I suggest you correct the terminology on your site.More important than that, I don't expect you will be able to succeed in this endeavor. Unfortunately soft money spoils hard money and the internet reaches out to millions of immoral people who relish a chance to steal. Paypal account verification will not protect you from chargeback liars and phished accounts. Observe what happened to Mt Gox in November.You might be new to currency exchange and unfamiliar with the risks. Aside form being robbed by liars or having your funds frozen by Paypal for month or years, other dangers await your being noticed.I suggest you look into the cases of the US based digital currency exchangers who have been defrauded out of their business, robbed by the owners of the US government, accused and convicted on trumped up charges, in prison, in hiding, or in exile.The banksters stole the US government and now direct the many federal police agencies. They strenuously resist privately issued money because it spoils their carefully crafted illusion of monopoly. They use the tacit agreement created by their target's use of their property, the fiat money, as legal basis for directing the pwnd police against their rivals, no matter how small they might be. Paypal is not a digital currency, it is a payment processor carrying the property of the issuing governments. Paypal is therefore under the thumb of those who defrauded the citizens out of their democracies.Currently the best ways to get into Bitcoin are to either trade product or service in the market, or to trade fiat for Liberty Reserve to take to Mt Gox. Forget using soft fiat, such as credit cards or Paypal. Use only non-reversible vectors for transmission of fiat. Bitcoingateway only works in the US. I predict that it won't for long though.Bitcoin is easy to buy in Canada. There are 2 cash by mail services that support multiple currencies. There is also an old established e-currency exchanger who accepts payment by a multiple of means including instant trades from other e-currencies or cash deposit at any RBC branch. Same day service is available via a multitude of payment vectors.The issues of fraud in digital currency exchange were addressed and largely solved when e-gold was first hatched back in '97. Simply; don't expect to trade soft money for hard. The world harbours many liars and thieves. A promise to pay from a stranger can't be trusted. Pay for cash with cash and all is well. I agree with your assessment of hotmail. Important here is that the test email I sent _did_ get through.False accusation of crime is slanderous and shameful.  It's true that the notification of PM by email on this board is broken. I did some experiments that any one of us can duplicate.Privacy Shark, as a service, is much older than Bitcoin and much older than this forum. To expect support through this board seems rather silly.It's pretty sad when people forget their morality because they can hide from civil responsibility behind their computers. You try accusing someone of a crime IRL and you had better be able to back it up or face consequences. All I can do is refuse to trade with you Joe, but if you were in my town and tried this shit with me, you would be punished for your slander.In the interests of fairness and accuracy, I second the motion to have this thread re-titled.

Almost any sort of money is preferable to USD right now. Sounds like you need some mental floss.It's true that the btc traders can see their own influence because the market is so very tiny.A recent joke was about the fat amoebae in the tiny droplet who dreamed of being a big fish in a little pond.Fortunately there is no apparently malicious intent. A lot of people have put a lot of effort into this solution and none of us want to break it.The OP clearly does not know what bitcoin is and, even so, made his post in a denigrating manner. I imagine there is an ad hoc think tank calculating the destruction of Bitcoin right now. Possibly your tax dollars at work. >  2) The servers are located in HostNoc datacentersAny reason why you evaded the question of where the server is located? An ounce of gold?A pound of coffee?A long distance telephone call? I did test that crazy email address and it worked. I got a reply in about 12 hrs. How about a virt? If so, how much?Where are your servers?What OS?PHP?MySQL?ssh?What about the people who don't have a Zip code?cheers! HmmmObjectivist, but without the chain smoking.;-) Guns don't kill people.I kill people.;-) Considering the political shitstorm currently blowing, I'm surprised there are not more trolls seeding FUD on this forum. I did mean the email. It looks like the address has been hashed. At any rate, it's weird and maybe not working correctly. Crypto hashes are. "Stop payment" is good for 180 days before it is dropped. Any cheque 180 days old will fail to clear as it has gone "stale dated". There is no danger.Once a cheque has cleared the "automated clearing house" it is very rarely disputed. Both banks have to be in agreement for any action to be taken. A counterfeit is about the only time that could happen.BTW, for those readers who are not proficient in English, I properly use quotation marks to indicate others words repeated. Try plugging the above quoted terms into a search engine for more detail on the meaning of the phrases. 
It worked fine for me. Fast too. coffee4bitcoin.com was working within an hour or so.One thing I did notice that might be the cause of a problem. I sent an email to that crazy address of theirs and hotmail converted all the upper case chars to lowercase.  Go ahead. It's a free country.You never hear that one anymore. Why would I explain this to a smart ass for free? If I billed you would you be less rude?How do you think people place bets from afar? What do the punters use? They use cash. Green Dot, Paysafe Cards, WebMoney, LR, WU, bank wires, moneygram, money orders, post office transfers etc etc etcAll paid for with cash. No promises or borrowed money.If you are charging a low fee for something that a thief can't resell, then perhaps you can trust the spender's Paypal. Do you understand why what you sell is important in deciding if you can trust your customers? From what you describe, I think you might be OK, but you can't expect an exchanger to accept you at your word unless he trusts you. Such is the devil that is soft money.You might get an exchanger to periodically cash you out through his bank account if you were willing to guarantee against chargebacks by leaving a deposit. Maybe you should negotiate the fee rather than just arbitrarily offering "A small percent of money would be your fee".Paypal is not the only popular payment system. Certainly much more money is transferred by wires. by cheques, by WU etc - lots of services are bigger than Paypal. Oh, I thought you said librarian. That's not a good idea. Paypal is horrified by privately issued digital currency and even forbid such trades in their ToS. You are asking people to put themselves at risk of fraud and offing only a few percent?The few days you speak of is actually 45. If the Paypal was purchased with borrowed money, such as with an Amex card, clawbacks can happen up to 180 days later.The basic rule with Paypal is that you can safely take payments only from spenders you can trust. You can't treat PP payments like cash payments. PP is not money, it is the promise of money.To discuss the risks and the possibility that this might work would require knowing what sort of trade you are doing. If you are settling with anything liquid, anything that can be readily resold, the risk of taking PP from a stranger is very high indeed and therefore needs a very high markup.Your offer sounds like a setup to be scammed. If you want to deal with an unverified public, you must accept cash only. Paul and narrator Bob Bossin both live in Nanaimo. I have not met Paul but do know Bob personally and can go knock on his door any time.I suspect these men are put off by promoters of Sodom. We don't ingest phytoestrogens or BPA here.You know, most people don't care if you are gay, straight or even zoo as long as you close your bedroom door before you fuck. Wearing your gonads out on your shirtsleeve is bound to put off normal people regardless of your "orientation". Promotion of perversion is just that, and normal people are repulsed by those who do it.As far as I can tell, the biggest obstacle to the acceptance of bitcoin is the dirty reputation of our self appointed cheerleader.

Find something else to be proud of.That's about the only thing I admire about anarchy - it does not interfere with Darwinism or run counter to the principle of survival of the fittest like the current "pay monkeys to breed" program currently dragging humanity down to the lowest common denominator. Oh sure. Anarchy is short-sighted and immature. Consider "Area F" of Nanaimo has no building code or official community plan. They have an asphalt plant in a residential area and a sawmill next door to the elementary school.I'm thinking of starting a dogfish rendering plant in the mobile home park. Maybe I'll buy the bridge over to that part of town and demand tribute in song from all who want to cross.Go Anarchists Go!

The list is far from complete as only 5 of 45 American countries are listed.And I must disagree with you. It's an extremely specific project. In no way could it be described as diverse. LOL Yeah, good luck with that. I've always said, the more exchangers the better! The more access to other currencies, both private and evil regime, the better the trade can flow. Readers should not assume that competition exists - at least not yet!I've got a bit of an issue where some smart guys are making orders, then waiting to see if the price goes up or down before deciding whether or not to honor their pledge. I have been warning them that if their letters are mailed more than a day after the deal was made, I will use price history against post mark to calculate a fresher exchange rate.Hey, fair is fair. I see you have implemented the deposit idea like Kitco does on their online metal sales. Let me know what ratio of buyers can chose that option. I thought of doing that too but I assumed that too few buyers would actually have the btc for the deposit. Let me know if I'm wrong.I see I have to change my pricing structure now too. Since you are charging for the service, I will no longer offer it for free as I have been doing. I will match your fee structure exactly.Do you intend to start publishing your trade volumes like Mt Gox and btcex do? I have been just manually adding up all the trades at the end of every day. Need to figure out a way to better automate that.

After all, they are the enemy and the reason we had to invent Bitcoin in the first place.I used to sell a lot of these;http://lynncoins.com/1gramjohnsonmatthey.jpgThey look nice and were cheap, only ~$3 premium back then. My wife had rings and necklaces made up that were pretty cool.There are lots of other options though. There are three gold coin mints in Nanaimo. It's no big deal to have custom short runs produced.It's not cheap though.Why not Maples? Sure, no problem. Maples shipped within Canada or USA. BTC accepted.
Currently 2 LBS for 167 BTCIt's no secret how the price is determined. The Mt.

There is no problem with the packaging. Capulin has been shipping this coffee packed thus for many years. Readers can see the packaging in photos on the coffee4bitcoin web page or the main Capulin site. I already asked you if the packaging was breeched and you ignored my question. The Capulin name and logo I added to the bitcoin4coffee page after proving that we could accept bitcoin. Nanaimo Gold and Capulin coffee have been associated for many years, a fact long known to the digital currency and cryptographic communities.If you continue to think you have a problem I insist that you take photos of the damage because the shipments are insured for that.sheesh Bitcoin is not exempt from the machinations of the banksters supporting the illusion that they have monopoly over the creation of money. no agenda made a joke. I laughed.No comment on how this reporter has tried to mislead us in classic word-wanker fork-tongued style?To me that's the only thing about this story worth commenting on - the reporter lying to us. I'm going to drop a lot of names, it's up to the reader to fill in the details, but it's almost all there online for you to find.I'm going to break this down into bite sized pieces in a process that will take me quite a while. There is a lot of politics involved and certainly the majority of readers will be angered and try to find fault. Such is the nature of the delusion.The digital currency story begins almost 15 years ago but first we are going to need some background.Now, very few people have the right mental gearing to understand what money is and where it comes from. Everyone will tell you that he is one of those few. Somebody must be wrong. Don't feel bad if you can't answer those questions correctly. You are in the majority. People use it, brood over it, worry, chase, regret it and in the end hope to have two pennies left for the ferryman. They mostly do that  without ever knowing where it comes from or understanding how value is attached to it.That horrible commie John Maynard Keynes made one statment that bears repeating here; "The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose."The root of all evil is the debt based monetary system. Keynes was no stranger to evil in both his professional and private lives.Money is loaned into existence and sold at a profit. The balance is in bonds - bonds are the chains that tie the slave to the wheel. When loans are paid off, money is extinguished.Because money, as most people recognise it, is all debt, and because it is lent at interest, there can NEVER BE ENOUGH TO PAY DOWN ALL DEBT. There is no possible way for nations to get out of debt once into it because all the national money added together only equals the principle of the debt. The interest cannot be paid, even if we gathered up all the money and gave it back. Understand that what gives money value is the output of human labour applied to the resources of the world. The money is written against our own value, is backed by nothing more, and is created by lending it into existence. The lenders are actually making us pay them, as nations and as individuals, for their recognising our own inherent value.Great work if you can get it!What Keynes, and others before and after him recognised was that, once in debt, the borrower is at the mercy of the moneylender. The nations of the West have been sucked into this morass and the democracies have been thus subverted. The governments of the West have been operating at a perpetual deficit. It's become normal that they must go to the lenders to operate. The relationship has become one where the lender is the master, and the elected leaders are subservient.Money is not power. It is nothing without the value of the bonded humans and their valuable world. The great deception causes people to chase after money like a donkey chasing a carrot on a stick. In this way the people are directed and controlled. It now takes almost half a man's valuable output to pay the interest on the debt that his government borrowed him into. He only has the other half of his work time to make his living in. Indentured and life bonded slaves at least had a tacit agreement with their master for basic human needs. In today's slavery we don't get even that. Elected governments are undermined and directed by their owners, the internationalist commercial lenders. Democracy is stagecraft and a sham.So, in this way, hidden puppeteers control the policies and the armed forces that the citizens support though their labours.You need to understand this background so that you can understand that not everyone works for the good of man. And the governments that you thought you elected are actually working for the real power brokers, and not in your interest at all.OK, you might think, this is all pretty simple stuff, but it's not the majority of people who understand this. The next time you hear someone blame some government elected under this deception, imagine an angry audience throwing rotten fruit at actors on a stage. The script writer, the producer and the director are not catching the flack. When the next show starts, the actors may change, but the guy selling the tickets is still the same scoundrel he was during the last performance.In the next installment I will try to illustrate the many ways money can work and the many ways value can be marked or stored. Once you have an understanding of why the internationalist money lenders can't allow their monopoly on money creation to be shown for the illusion that it really is, you will understand the motivation for their crimes.Those crimes are being committed now and Bitcoin is certainly not exempt. You can register the cards with any info you like. Just tell the merchant the same story. Yeah, wars are fought to secure environment, and blamed on religion.It's all about the loot, and God takes the rap. How many readers interpreted that piece to say that Paypal got DoSsed?Look closer;> a DDoS assault on a PayPal website.> denial of service attacks will also come into play with an assault against the ThePayPalblog.com.Paypals' BLOG is getting the treatment.Thanks for the weasel-tale John Leyden. I'll be sure to remember you in my yellow file. Our little discussion to change the world is nowONE WHOLE YEAR OLD!https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?action=mlist;sort=registered;start=0CONGRATULATIONS! Why would a customer borrow money under contract to pay for an intermediary money to pay to a vendor to sell into cash when he is standing in the doorway. Simply hand the man cash money.Please stop the public association of Bitcoin with crime. Who's side are you on anyway? Hi Mark,  Glad you could make it. No hard feelings I hope. I have a proposition for you that would allow us to settle on the closure of open2exchange. I know that's getting to be a long time ago, but it would be better to settle than to write off. Are you amenable to discussion?  I hope you are well after your ordeal. The way I feel today, I worry that my turn is coming soon.   I rarely miss an issue of your rag.cheers!Shane Seat belt laws are not designed to protect people, they are designed to give police a blanket excuse to intimidate. If the police were directed by their masters to actually protect the citizens, why are the police more responsible for violence and murder than any other organised group?Anti-smoking laws (and anti-drink driving laws) are not designed to protect people, they are designed to kill the public houses and restaurants where people talk to each other about the issues of concern. It is far safer for the tyrants to have everyone at home watching TV. All revolutions in the history on my race have started in the beer halls.Forced immunisation might have started with good intention but that has been subverted. Now it's just another method of conditioning the masses to do as they are told, to make the impression that the government (that is owned by the secret wire pullers) owns the people and not the other way around. Consider that if the programs were truly for our benefit, why are people often poisoned? Why did the recent bullshit flu epidemic kill almost nobody but the vaccine killed thousands, including one of my own dear friends. Forced vaccinations is the "killer app". I predict that someday after everyone is lined up for some required injection, the whole mass of them will either die, become sterile or homosexual. Oops - sorry! Genocide in a syringe. Whenever a man accepts the carrots, he sets himself up for the stick.If you were truly dedicated to being free you would not be seeking "employment" but you would be making your living without tax and social contracts with the state.It's not easy to get free and stay free. Take heart that you are young and already understanding this when so many men never figure it out in their whole lifetime. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/wikileaks-reveals-ugly-truth-about-iran-appeasers/story-fn59niix-1225966020409 Unless you have been to Tehran, you are getting your information from the controlled media, owned by the same banksters that foment the wars.I advice you to be more skeptical. Current price is 2 LBS for 190 BTCI'm just relaxing with a nice cup of light roast prepared by espresso and floated on hot water - americano style. No need for sugar. It's already mild and sweet.One of you fellows expressed some concern that his dark roast beans arrived wet. That's not water, it's the natural coffee oil and the source, when emulsified, of the creme - that's the yummy brown foam.It is normal for high quality dark roast beans to be oily like that. It's a good thing, not a bad thing.*SLURP* Anyone want to bet on how long it will be before Jed is in jail or in exile?There are only a few of us posters to this forum who know the history of privately issued currencies. Most of you guys never had anything to do with this scene before July, 2010.I think it's time we tried to educate the rest of you to the very real and present dangers. I don't want to see anymore good men hounded, jailed or assassinated.I have friends in prison and even in their graves for doing less to irk the banksters than Jed is doing now and in ignorance you guys are pushing him into more trouble.The banksters will do any crime to protect the illusion of monopoly on the creation of money. Try joining the Pecunix developers list. Yes, the world is not a reflection of New York City. Many people seek mail order service just to avoid the danger of associating with the park darkies.Bruce might find it interesting to look into "the cartoon network". Using VoIP in hotel rooms, customer databases, bicycle couriers, custom packaging, their own trucking and customs brokers, these guys peddled weed in Manhattan for years before the cops got wise. One Quebecois fellow, Cusson, is still in jail, the first man ever convicted under new laws as operating a continuing criminal enterprise.Interesting to note; he was undone by his sloppy cell phone habits.But as I said above, Manhattan in no way is an example of the rest of the world. OK then - You got a deal!I need a $100 moneypak
No, you're asking for a 17% premium. That's far too much. Anyone else in USA want to buy some bitcoins with cash at your local drugstore? Yes, true. Full automation is possible. Maybe you just need to ask. This cracks me up;Whatever you do, don't blurt out the ugly truth! Double plus good!*Japanese schoolgirls blow kisses to Denis* valued at $100 USD purchased in the USA.Will settle with BTC at 0.2550 Can someone in the US help me out with this experiment? Oh, while I am ranting away about dumfuk syndrome, I want to rail on some web authors. Here are some fun facts to help get you mind unbound.1) Only one country in the world calls their postal codes "zip".2) only 2 countries in the world use a 5 digit numeric format.3) together these two countries account for less than 5% of the people in the world.So, when you make a web form that insists on a "zip" code being 5 numbers long, you have broken your form to 95% of the world.To those who think this is unimportant I say, if you wanted to author for the USA-wide-web, you should have made that left turn at Albuquerque, Bugs, because this here is the WORLD wide web. Sometimes envelopes get jammed in the line. Once they are torn open, the inspector has to approve the re-packing. That can take months.The key operators make mistakes. Did you know there is a small town in Kansas called Canada? lol I've seen stuff returned for no good reason at all, months later. Very mysterious.On more than one occasion I've had very late mail delivered with cash hanging out or visible in the clear re-packing used by the inspectors after the automated line has chewed up a letter.People sometimes wrap cash up in lumps that will jam the line. Auto mail must be able to roll around a wheel 15 cm in diameter.In Canada and USA the sender can pay for "tray sorting", which is done manually, by affixing double postage. Two stamp mail can therefore have bumps or odd shapes and weigh up to 50 grams.The mail systems of the Western countries are incredibly reliable with England and Italy being exceptions. (The Royal Mail is fixing their problem and Italy north has always been good).In contrast, some national postal systems are worse than a joke. In fact, one I heard recently goes like this, "How do they dispose of toxic waste in Zimbabwe?"A: Put it in the mail.By far and away the biggest problem I see in the mails is the dumfuk syndrome. Many people have become so stupid they can't properly address a letter anymore. Pecunix is the best digital currency system. Sidd has always supported PGP and the slightly annoying "PIK" validation system is immune to keylogger trojans. Full automation is possible and the staff are ever vigilant for new scams.Even if Bitcoin goes where we want it to, Pecunix will always be a better store of wealth. We need different kinds of money for different reasons.You can't directly compare Liberty Reserve with Paxum. LR is a digital currency and Paxum is a payment processor. Paxum is a vector for the currency called USD - a national fiat. Liberty Reserve is a privately issued currency, and although it is 'value pegged' to the USD, it is not USD. The legal implication is important to our purpose. I like to explain it this way;You cannot deposit a LR$ to your bank account and you cannot deposit a USD$ to your Liberty Reserve account.When we trade using fiat money, we are contracting with the issuing state. I would rather contract with my friends in Costa Rica than with the evil empire in Washington. This tacit agreement has been a weak point in online payment system and the only ones who can survive are the bitches like Paypal who suck the USD (Uncle Sam Dick).Dirty corrupt systems attract dirty corrupt (mis)users. You really can't compare LR to USD without understanding this important distinction.And then there is Pecunix which is golden! Missing mail is rare indeed. More often is misdirected mail that is delivered or returned very late.Don't give up on it yet. I can't say it for fear of invoking a demon. When I hear the "L" word I tend to cover my ears and loudly chant LA-LA-LA-LA-LAlemur4bitcoin.com - lemurs for all! Gee Mike, do you have to use the "L" word? ;-)Are you familiar with 1MDC? It was an anonymising system for use with e-gold. Basically it's a ledger on top of a ledger. Trades conducted by 1MDC users became invisible to e-gold because they were trading within the same e-gold account, tracked by a separate ledger.Mybitcoin accomplishes much the same thing for bitcoin.Mybitcoin users can trade amongst themselves and the trades never show on the bitcoin network because they are tracked on a separate book.It was I who coined the term "blister" to describe this shared account, or book on book concept.A system to obscure trades (blister) from the Liberty Reserve accounts ledger is HDMoney.ShanePS: about the "L" word. L is defined as structuring a financial transaction to obscure the origin of proceeds of crime. It's not "L" if it's not proceeds of crime. In the federation gone feral, winning a game is now a crime. Fortunately not all humans are subject to that feral fed. So, "L" becomes a matter of what state the winner is subject to - or not. ;-) Yeah. Democracy has degenerated into stagecraft. Voting just grants this sham my assent.  Fascism is government by big business. The "bleak future", "riots", "martial law" stuff are the lies spread by the controlled media. People are fooled mostly because the liars fail to talk about the distinction between wartime and peacetime. They illustrate the organisation of their opposing ideology with wartime images. The power of the press belonging to the owner of the press.Have you ever been shown images of a fascist nation in peacetime? My point was only that the word has lost it's meaning and is now just used as a synonym for bad. I think that was done deliberately by an organised group.Anyway, not to digress to far, I think the advice given the OP to find a landlord who does not do a credit check is best advise. I baited you guys with my one-liner about having multiple persons and got no bites. I meant to suggest using alternate ID.  What we are seeing is the result of stopping the Paypal fraud. We don't have that crowd of scammers bidding stolen money against each other any longer.The volumes at all 3 cash auctions are low because folks are hording, hoping for some meteoric rise. We are loosing sight of the objective, being distracted by this fun game we have created.We need to keep focused on implementing acceptance as far and wide as possible so that btc becomes a better vector to communicate value. Do us this favour; when you are studying and "playing" the market, devote a tiny slice of your wet CPU to thinking about how to improve bitcoin acceptance.Last night I tried to buy a case of beer to be delivered in a distant city with bitcoin. The deal failed but I'll make it work soon and be the first bitcoin user, that I know of, to do such a trade.;-) Or just piss someone off who has the buttons to push and be the object of his dirty trick. By definition a "bank" accepts deposits and makes loans at interest.If an institute does not write loans, it's not a bank, it's a financial services business (FSB).On the internet we call those services "exchangers" and there are already dozens of them.If you only want to save your money somewhere safe, we have several trusted bullion banks that are designed to work on-line.I think this thread is another example of how the language has been warped by the propagandists to hide the truth. It's like CMHC but far more corrupt (imagine that!). One reason the WTC offices were blown up was to hide the evidence of a massive swindle.As for the word, "facist", the controlled media has been lying to the US people for so long that not one in a hundred could tell you the definition of the word.To them it's just become a synonym for bad. I see. Coffee 4 Bitcoin accepts only bitcoin.  Not the smartest marketing, but there you go.You know, I've never seen dry process coffee for sale in any store. That's not to say that it never happens, but not in my experience.Coffee is the #2 valued commodity behind oil. Amazing. The first time I heard that I too was skeptical. Coffee really is big business. It's so much less labour to rot the flesh off the beans in water, then pressure wash. To dry process, the cherries have to be sun dried, then beat on and winnowed to remove the dried fruit. I suppose that is why we never see dry process in stores. The price would scare most people away.Still, by far and away the most expensive process for harvesting coffee is the use of small cat like animals called civets. The animals eat the cherries and shit out the beans. Workers collect the beans and hopefully wash them before roasting. Mmmm mmmm good. The stuff costs like $400 a pound! Good news for cat poop coffee fans on a budget, someone has invented an artificial cat intestine and hopes to market pseudo-cat-poop-coffee, presumable for less, but there's nothing like the real thing according to aficionados. Your person is yours to command. No reason to limit yourself to only one. You don't like Coffee 4 Bitcoin?
The goal of this project is to create a better vector for the transmission of value - better money.We need this better money to conduct our commerce. To trade and create wealth.Do not horde the bitcoins. Spend them. The have no inherent value, their value is in their utility. To not spend them removes that value.If you want to horde money with no inherent value, there are lots of bullshit national currencies. If you want to save up and invest in your future, use gold.Accept the bitcoins for business. Spend the bitcoins for business. We need an economy, not some pretend commodity trading game. One group is trying to build a market and another group is trying to play a market.Different leagues indeed. Yah, coffee is best fresh. Specifically, it is best about one week after roasting. For that first week after roasting, the beans out-gas and the aroma/flavour is not fully developed.You can see little pressure relief devices on gourmet coffee bags. That allows the shipper to pack the beans as soon as they are cool. Gas pressure can escape if needed and the seal remains intact to preserve the freshness.For best results only grind as much beans as you intend to use immediately. Purists say 15 minutes is too long to let ground coffee wait. The cheapo grinders with spinning blades are not good. You want your coffee grounds to be of even size. By the time you get even size with this grinder, it's dust! That won't espress properly or plugs up a paper filter.A burr grinder is the way to grind coffee. Most new ones are electric powered. If you spot an old hand cranked grinder for cheap, and it's not worn out, you might grab it. People want those.Coffee4Bitcoin is roasted in small batches and shipped out asap. The roastery is in USA and the delivery carrier is USPS. There is a tax collector at my door!Just a sec! I'm getting my boots on! Ahhh - It's a Jimmy Wales song.Jimmy wants your soul! The current price is 2 LBS for 172 BTCIt's interesting to note how far the price has fallen from the initial offering at 400 BTC.I just want to point out that this deflation has nothing to do with coffee commodity prices and is entirely to do with the increasing value of Bitcoin. I was just joking with a forum member about the price of c4b as an "economic indicator".Another thing I'd like to point out about the price; I make nothing on this. This coffee is super-premium and therefore expensive because it is produced entirely by hand in the jungle under the native trees without any chemicals. It is delivered by expedited post to almost anywhere in the world. The price includes all. The shipping, handling, taxes etc.It costs about twice as much as coffee bought from the local grocery store but is easily twice as yummy. I'm surprised you guys aren't jumping onto this. Do I need graphics on the web page? lol Hey Mike!  Nice to see you drop in.Shane The more the merrier. Good luck! I don't doubt that you are correct, but so am I.

Did you just insult me? You are not competing with me - you don't even play in the same league.ALL credit cards can be charged back and in card not present transactions the merchant has no avenue to arbitration.Liqpay does what they can to prevent fraud but no system is perfect. They DO get chargebacks and they DO clawback when they can and close accounts when they cannot.PrivatBank is not issuing the cards being charged and they do not make policy for the many card issuers in this world. Well sure, but then those people want to pay for the purchase cards with their Visa. lol Any soft money based on a credit card transaction can be reversed.Liqpay does get chargebacks and they do claw back from those stealer-munkees.You guys cause me to shake my head. This bitcoin project is designed to address the privacy and fraud problems of tele-commerce. You guys seem to want to thwart that by inviting strangers to check your credit and soliciting money with strings attached.It's been this same old story since we started e-gold back in 98. There is one particular nationality of people who just can't seem to understand the difference between cash and credit. OK. Enjoy! http://www.coffee4bitcoin.com/Commercial messageA very special coffee picked in the rain forest of Western Mexico, roasted in Arizona and shipped out by mail.The big difference with this coffee is in the processing. These cherries never get wet, not like commercial scale operations that soak the cherries and de-pulp the beans with pressure water. These cherries are sun dried first to preserve the flavorful oils and caffeine. The pulp is then mechanically threshed off the bean.The difference is incredible! I thought I was a coffee snob but until I tried dry processed beans, I did not know coffee from Shinola!2 lbs. for 195 BTC to your door, no extra fees. The original offer was for 400 BTC but has changed to reflect the changing bitcoin economy.You can have light, medium or dark roast. I urge you to not pass over the light. Most people have never tasted anything like it. It's naturally sweet and fruity. You are getting 2 bags, so try 2 different roasts if you like. A favourite of mine is light and dark blended half and half.Dry processing costs more due to the increased labour. For me, the higher price is justified by the superior product.The producer, a friend of mine, wants you to know that he pays his workers better than average wages, never pollutes the streams, nor cuts the forest.I guarantee your satisfaction in good time or I'll personally refund your BTC. This is the good stuff - that crisp clear mental boost that programmers crave!This friendly offer is brought to you by Shane Smith of Nanaimo Gold. http://www.coffee4bitcoin.com/ Umm, at the risk of sounding like a dick - where is this cash you are talking about?Your bank, well that's not cash - it's numbers on a screen unless you go to an ATM, Debit card? not cash - same as above. Paypal is the anti-cash - the opposite of all the good that cash is. exchange zone? - a trade forum that knows what cash is. They don't want PP anti-cash either. LR - well that's final like cash. Bitcoin is also final in that there is no reversing mechanism - refunds are only by mutual agreement.This is cash;http://www.nanaimo-gold.com/define_cash.phpSome years ago the infamous JP May published his May scale of money hardness;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Kn84W9-C1lwJ:interestingsoftware.com/mayscale.html+%22may+scale%22+money+hardness&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca(note link is to google cache and may be temporary)Now, I don't agree with some of the fine points and it does need some updating but the concept is illustrative. Money with strings attached is not money at all - it's a promise to settle. Cash is a final settlement. Unfortunately there is no cash slot on the computer. Some, hopefully most, anonymous strangers' promises to settle are good, but there are those who's promises are no good. The more liquid the trade item is, the more attractive to thieves. What is more liquid than e-currency? People expect exchangers to work on tiny commissions and then complain when they won't risk accepting Paypal.You want a solution? Take cash to Western Union or MoneyGram. Once the girl at the counter takes it, you have paid - a final settlement. No turning back.Many exchangers also accept bank wires as they are final within a few days. Cheques clear in less than a week. Money orders or cash sent by mail are often faster. What is slow is Paypal which can be stopped and reversed up to 45 days from spend. That's not cash. That's a promise only. American Express can be charged back 180 days after the spend!You can't expect that a trader could keep trading his hard e-currency for strangers' promises. He would get robbed out of business unless he pried into his customer's lives, got to know them and charged them a hefty fee for the effort spent, and to cover the risk of when he was wrong about them. This causes delays and frustrates the people who are refused. This solution has the distasteful side effect of scammers posing as exchangers and doing ID theft. So, soft money is harmful to privacy and invites fraud. Paypal has it's uses, but not for trading liquid intangible (or tangible) assets. Just for the same reason you can't fund a stock trading account with Paypal or a credit card, you can't buy internet money with Paypal or CC.Those are the core issues we are trying to address with this Bitcoin project! Privacy and fraud. I anticipate the next question - Where are the exchangers? The short answer; NOT in the USA. All the US based exchangers were driven out or underground by the laws against on-line gambling. So ya all xenophobics might have to face that fear. ;-) The obvious place to look is Canada because of the common language and closely integrated banking and postal systems. New Zealand law is kinder to exchangers and there are some asian outfits as well. There are exchangers in England and in some of the former soviet republics. Also understand that a LR dollar is not a US dollar. It is a separate currency, privately issued. It is value pegged to the USD but is not the same thing. You cannot put a LR dollar into a bank account and you can't put a USD into your LR account. You can trade a USD (or anything traded) for a LR dollar through a trading partner. Put simply, bidding up prices with stolen money is easy. The only time Paypal can work is when the receiver trusts the spender. Anonymous cash auction is not a suitable venue for a reversible payment system.LR and Pex are not reversible so the receiver cannot be robbed by the sender. That's why there has been such a gulf between the exchange rates. That gulf will tighten up as the fraud is stopped.If people are willing to accept soft money from their trusted friends in trade for hard money, that's their business - I hope they understand the risks, but I don't want soft money poisoning our cash auctions.We should do all we can to get the traditional banking system out of our business. Together with exchangers and fraud-free auctions, bitcoin has the potential to bring us closer to this goal.So, let us get to work setting up more commerce and put this behind us as a lesson learned.:-)I bid 455 BTC for your $100 LR It's astonishing to see how few people understand what is going on with Paypal in our Bitcoin markets.
