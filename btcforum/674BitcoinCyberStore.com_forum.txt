So into this! I'm not a liberty to discuss the risks of this service to me until a Terms of Service is fully developed. I've worded the OP to specifically guide you away from considering the how/whats/whys/when of this plan. I have a schedule of risks and costs that I'm working from. What I don't know is how much something like this is generally worth. From that information though, I can judge it if will be equitable to pursue establishing this kind of service. But seriously, I'd really like you to consider the fantasy that, from your perspective, no Bitcoins would ever be lost. What would it be worth on a yearly term? Pretend for a moment that you had a significant holding in Bitcoin and were interested in holding on to them for a period of one year. What value would you place on never having to worry about losing your BTC to any circumstance (malware, theft, your own incompetence, forgetfulness, natural disaster, literally - you name it)How much would that comfort and confidence be worth to you over a year's time if you held:less than 500BTC501-1000 BTC1000-10000 BTC10000+For the purposes of this exercise, pretend you had each of those amounts in BTC and that is was indeed possible to guarantee with 100% certainty you would retain your BTC of the year's period. I don't want to know anyone's BTC holding so please try and answer all 4 levels of BTC holding and what you think would be a fair rate for each. Yubikey is a USB device that acts like a standard USB keyboard. Should work automatically on any platform. From MTGOX notice:From what I understand about Yubikey, there are two modes of operation... OTP mode where the password changes all the time... and "Static" mode where a frozen OTP is output when you press/hold the button.While I'm sure the OTP mode is "locked into MTGOX", the "static mode" will work for you in other cases, as long as you append the 44 digit "frozen" string with your own easy to remember password. This is pretty close to two-factor authentication.But for $25, you can get your own yubikey (from yubico) and get the OTP mode for your own use and possibly be able to use the "almost two-factor authentication" at MTGOX.I've recently ordered 3 of them from Yubico for me and my family. I would like to suggest that the method of signing releases be changed.Currently,Â  a single file (SHA1SUMS.asc) containing hashes of the release files is clearsigned and posted with all the release files. To verify a release I've downloaded, I need to hash the file I downloaded and compare it to one in the list of hashes.I propose that your release process is changed so that each release package is gpg detach signed. This approach follows a more standard method of software release and eases validation for users or at least allows for simple automation of the validation process. To validate a download, the user would grab both the release file and the related detached signature and then run something like 'gpg --verify bitcoin-0.3.23-linux.tar.gz.gpg'.
