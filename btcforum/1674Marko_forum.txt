I have a transaction that is stuck at zero confirmations. It has been like this for days (2-3). The transaction does not show up anywhere on blockexplorer or in the active list at bitcoincharts.The app version is 3.19 on windows xp.The current idea is to kill the block chain and let it download (no idea what else to do). Has anyone ran into this before? Anyone seen this before?Code:************************EXCEPTION: NSt8ios_base7failureE       CAutoFile::read : fread failed       C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe in ProcessMessage()       ************************EXCEPTION: N5boost21thread_resource_errorE       boost::thread_resource_error       C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe in ThreadMessageHandler()Nothing specific was done to generate this. It just sat there idle (with full chain downloaded) and then this. After the error no more blocks are downloaded Someone came in with a large amount of GPU power that day. I noticed the dent in my own GPU production as well. Ok...so false alarm. Sorry to create forum spam.The motherboard i switched to had screwed up time on it. I believe the effects of this are documented. NTP never updated until i set the time reasonably close to actual. I simply didn't notice it. So, it rejected all the blocks i created because they were from the future and wasn't taking any new blocks in from the network. I only noticed this because i was doing some calculations with block count and realized it hasn't changed. I'm not sure how this is possible either. i am stunned. it was only a few hundred btc so not too bad, but still...I shut down bitcoin client, shut down windows, all good and proper. Bizarre... So, i swapped out my motherboard for a newer one. Rest of the setup stayed the same. I restart the machine, windows xp boots up, discovers the hardware, reconfigures, all is good. I start up bitcoin....all my coins are gone. Why did this happen? The total amount of bitcoins will be 21 million. Lets say i hold in my wallet 5 million bitcoins. I proceed to lose my wallet. I understand that i lose my bitcoins and am now broke. However, does that mean that the total circulation of bitcoins is now 16million? If so then, technically, the system 'leaks' bitcoins. Maybe i'm misunderstanding how this all works. Can someone shed some light? Hey all...Thanks for all the feedbackThe ssh method is great. However, all the machines are windows machines so i'd have to do an install on all of them. Better than writing a proxy app for sure though...I saw the entry from a few weeks ago about the -rpcallowip switch. I'll compile my own version if i have to. That said, i'd prefer to have an official release. Anyone have an idea when the next version would be posted? As far as the MITM attack possibility, this only presents a problem if the network i'm exposing to is not trusted. Or is there some other effect i'm missing? Hello,I'm have a client that calls getinfo over the rpc interface. Everything works fine when host=localhost.However, when trying to get bitcoin at another host i cannot.I read the wiki and it says the interface only accepts requests from 127.0.0.1. Is this still the case? Is there a setting to override this?If not, i'm probably going to have to write a 'proxy' app that i would deploy to each machine running bitcoin. Would prefer not to do this Thanks,Marko
