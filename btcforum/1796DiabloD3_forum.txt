Holy crap, we crossed 1000 pages. Learn C. This would be invaluable for you. I don't do it through email, I do it through forum PM. The forum doesn't have spam filtering. Has he announced hes no longer checking forum PMs? He has not responded to me in PM, I have several transfers that have not gone through for several weeks now. I don't know whats going on. Can someone tell me why friedcat is no longer processing AM transfers? FGPA/ASIC support is just too difficult to manage in a cross platform way in Java.cgminer was written by a good friend of mine who I introduced to Bitcoin, and I myself have switched over to cgminer. The DM kernel is available through cgminer as well, so its not a hard choice if you're still GPU mining. DiabloMiner has been discontinued, please use cgminer instead Is friedcat no longer responding to PMs?Over the past month I've sent him requests to send direct shares to other people (part of the DMC shutdown), and 2 people havent gotten there shares and he hasnt responded to 2 requests for confirmation of what shares DMC still has and if those shares indeed have been sent. I've PM'ed him to request verification of how many shares I have. It should match the number I have. I was not aware this thread existed.As I have said in the DMC thread, Yochdog did not pay out any BTC for BTCMC and I do not believe he ever intends to. I sent a request to him to pay out in time for the DMC closure, he did not. No one ever offered to buy the shares for a significant fraction of the debt. You can claim I'm stealing them, but I do not expect to ever see Yochdog pay out on this.I made an exception for AM redeeming for pascal257 as he missed the announcement and had a small number of DMC shares. He received his shares on Nov 6th, or several days before he started this thread. He talked to me on IRC and didn't realize that he received the shares as friedcat does not verify transfers.As for the final 2,789 shares, 2,324 of them are owned by two people who have not responded to the final notice. I wish mods would quit unlocking this thread. I've reported EskimoBob and iCEBREAKER for trolling.DMC is closed, do not unlock this thread. Diablo Mining Company is now closed. Any shares not redeemed before November 1st are now void. Do to how high difficulty is now, no GPU is profitable anymore. Your GPU is too old to support OpenCL. BitFunder has announced the following:What this means for Diablo Mining Company:The SEC has gone after BitFunder (ab)using the legal process.The SEC will go after all domestic and foreign Bitcoin stock markets that do business with Americans or American companies.DMC is from America.The majority of DMC shareholders are from America.SEC rules generally prohibit foreign investors unless you jump through hoops.DMC will no longer be allowed to trade on BitFunder.DMC will no longer be able to pay dividends or participate in any form of share buyback.Due to the fact that the SEC is trying to obliterate any Bitcoin startups by whatever means necessary, and that DMC has far exceeded its goal to payback investors, this marks the end of share buyback.It is unlikely that Yochdog or Namworld will pay anything they owe to DMC. If anyone wants to buy their debt from me, they are welcome make an offer on a significant fraction of what is owed, however I believe it is unlikely anyone will. If this offer is completed before November 1st, and BitFunder hasn't shut down and hasn't delisted DMC, it will be paid out to the remaining shareholders.As per the shareholder contract, DMC is now closing and liquidating.The last 3,947 shares can still be traded 11:1 for ASICMINER shares until BitFunder shuts down or delists DMC or before November 1st. Anything remaining will be used to resolve DMC's debt.Between 158% and 183% of the original investment has been repaid.Although DMC has failed at its original goals, I wish everyone else luck.---456 DMC traded for 42 AM, 3491 DMC and 388 AM left44 DMC traded for 4 AM, 3447 DMC and 384 AM left143 DMC traded for 13 AM, 3304 DMC and 371 AM left38 DMC traded for 4 AM, 3266 DMC and 367 AM left91 DMC traded for 8 AM, 3175 DMC and 359 AM left95 DMC traded for 9 AM, 3080 DMC and 350 AM left143 DMC traded for 13 AM, 2937 DMC and 337 AM left21 DMC traded for 2 AM, 2916 DMC and 335 AM left46 DMC traded for 4 AM, 2870 DMC and 331 AM left53 DMC traded for 5 AM, 2817 DMC and 326 AM left28 DMC traded for 3 AM, 2789 DMC and 323 AM left Active shares: 3,947Assets held:106 BTC-MINING1000 BTCMC430 ASICMINERDividends:19.81 BTC from ASICMINERProgress:1691 to 1966 BTC paid into DMC over 20909 shares1015 BTC returned for 9,330 shares (0.108 each)8.95 BTC returned for 186 shares (0.048 each)54.57 BTC returned for 620 shares  (0.087 each)18.93 BTC returned for 98 shares (0.193 each)638 BTC returned for 3,501 shares (0.182 each) (AM trade, 2 BTC a share)73.30 BTC returned for 163 shares (0.449 each)255 BTC returned for 558 shares (0.456 each) (AM trade, 5 BTC a share)68.66 BTC returned for 152 shares (0.451 each)650.65 BTC returned for 1,863 shares (0.349 each) (AM trade, 3.85 BTC a share)11.25 BTC returned for 58 shares (0.193 each) (AM trade, 2.25 BTC a share)31.41 BTC returned for 75 shares (0.418 each)19.99 BTC returned for 81 shares (0.246 each)252.79 BTC dividends paidOriginal investment repaid, 1132.50 BTC to 1407.50 BTC (57.60% to 83.23%) profit, 18.87% of shares left.

No. Use cgminer instead. To all those saying "the biggest problem with AM right now is the price has dropped", you need to learn stock ownership 101 basics: if you think a stock is worth owning and the price has dropped, it merely has gone on sale, go buy more. Thats like saying he drove Portland ME to Washington DC. People do this rather often in shitty cars. No. It was what was invested into BTC-MINING but never given to amazingrando. Namworld has been holding onto it for awhile in hopes it could be useful, so he decided to just pay it out instead. Didn't expect this: BTC-MINING paid a dividend: 1.06212424 1,863 DMC traded for 169 AM, current AM price is 3.85 BTC (650.65 total). Greed. Probably before October of this year.

Sorry everyone, I'm running a bit behind this month, I'm working on it now. If you end up liquidating, that'd be a shame. But I'll support you if thats what you decide to do. Does anyone know the number of blades and sticks shipped thus far? Do what I do: look at the fandom of something. Do you absolutely hate and despise them? If so, there is an extremely high chance of you not liking the source material.Case in point, the Tea Party: a group of people who collect welfare and food stamps, do not regularly hold or have ever held a job, complain about government interference into, well, government services (such as the aforementioned welfare and food stamps and including but not limited to the FDA, the public highway infrastructure, higher and lower education, OSHA, local police and fire, DoD, DoE, HUD, the treasury, commerce, or the USDA), and somehow miss the concept that Ayn Rand believed that all of these services should be provided using a free market system, and that the public would choose the best ones (using some magic unexplained method handwaved away using weasel words like "common sense") and that taxes inherently were evil and that if such a system would be implemented, they would quite literally starve to death because the concept of having a job is beyond them. Why, to deal with the eventual headache of trying to read any given Ayn Rand bullshit? I love how troll that is. It ended up being a brilliant move that made quite a lot of money. I prefer this. 500 pages, amazing. And exactly 1 page of useful information. Best troll Ive seen in this thread for awhile. I believe they disabled OpenCL on Radeon 4000 series because it is incomplete and a tad loopy.It doesn't really matter however, Radeon 4000 series is too slow to profitably mine with, and faster GPUs are slowly being priced out of market as well. Yes.
What I meant to say is I'm running for President on the Republican ticket."Except the buyback begun before GLBSE went under, not after. "There. This is what I meant to say.Rule #634: Do not post on forums shortly after getting out of bed. Don't mind EskimoBob, hes the thread's troll. No, but a few people on IRC are laughing at you, so I guess you have that going for you. Sorry, typo, I meant before, not after. Except the buy back begun before GLBSE went under, not before. So, good job there exposing the untruths of the muslim terrorist DMC founder there  Lemme terrorist fist jab you.11 DMC to 1 AM. Its basically this. The shareholders, the few of you that are left, are split into two camps: 1) they want to trade in your DMC shares for AM shares, but the DMC/AM price ratio isn't favorable enough yet, and 2) they want to hang on to the end because they were an early investor.We have crossed into profitability, so the amount of BTC that has been paid out finally exceeds what went in. 100% of the dividends this month, and until the end of DMC, have been and will be used for share buyback. Either way, shareholders get 100% of the dividends, the question just is how they are split.Using 100% on share buyback doubles the speed of the buyback on dividends alone, and will end this much sooner. If we continue at the rate of approximately 500 shares per month (combined buyback and AM trades) it should take about 13 months. Without AM trades about 42 months, or three and a half years.Everyone who is going to trade for AM, please consider doing it this month. The sooner I get this done, the sooner I can focus on post-DMC 1.0 ventures. Because its still part of the buy back effort. 20909 is the maximum of shares ever issued, thus the correct number. You try to manipulate numbers harder than a Fox News anchor. 558 DMC traded for 51 AM, current AM share price 5.0 BTC (woah wtf, srsly? when did this become a thing?) Which GPU? It sounds like its a driver bug, but it may also be a GPU that can't mine and the driver isn't handling it right (also a driver bug, just a different driver bug). Also, which driver? Not quite. 99% of startups fail in the first year too, we just dont get to hear about 10% of them, they implode early enough. Bitcoin for some reason attracts that missing 9% strongly. Already PM'ed you that. Just waiting on you now, PM to friedcat waiting for me to press send. No dividends are being issued for June. All of it was used to buy back shares. It may have well been from your ask, but BF doesn't list order ownership. You can transfer real AM shares into PT shares, but you'll have to do that on your own. I received your PM. 690 shares of DMC will get you 63 shares of AM.After you transfer the shares to me on BF, PM me the email address and BTC address you want Friedcat to have. Never re-created on Bitfunder, were bought back on GLBSE.

No, however yochdog already did before I could stop him. So, DMC gets screwed by BFL no matter what I do. I'm no longer a mod. Theymos didn't like the fact I was trying to expose the BFL problem to a wider audience. Its in the lower hundreds of BTC iirc. I agree on this. Weexchange just makes it harder to use BF, for no added functionality. Its not a they, just Yochdog. If you want further information, ask in the BTCMC thread, and do so nicely. This, basically. BTCMC is one of the companies we contracted with to fulfill the mining part of the DMC plan until we could get our own gear up in running in the datacenter. Yochdog, the owner of BTCMC and majority shareholder, suspended dividends for ASIC purchasing. BTCMC was traded on GLBSE before GLBSE crashed. Yes, BTCMC is a mining company. No dividends are being paid as per shareholder vote. If someone could gather 2500 DMC, it would be an equivalent price while AM continues to hover around 2.5 BTC.What someone should do is just start a BTCMC passthrough and buy the shares from me to do it with. I've set aside a year to deal with the share buyback so DMC can go private and reboot.I haven't decided if I'm going to do an auction. I mean, if someone said they wanted to drop 550 BTC on it, I'd sell it without even going the route of an auction. Yes, this month I'm paying full dividends since we've gotten over 2500 shares back due to AM trades, I don't need to buy any DMC shares back. Half dividends will continue next month. Dividend: 14.19315684 BTC for 7174 shares Try using one of those AMD driver cleaners and reinstall the drivers from scratch and DO NOT INSTALL THE SDK ON TOP OF IT, use the runtime included in the driver installer. Driver bug, go report it to AMD. Your only choice, for now, is to restart DM when that happens. Paid out another dividend, 24.66748009 for 0.00343845 per share over 7174 shares. That error happens when people download DM from git but forget to build it. I'm not sure why you're seeing it, however, the script is supposed to be downloading the binary zip. Don't bother with the wiki, no one updates that page. Follow the README instead: do not install the SDK, use the runtime that comes with the driver. The math is closer to 4500 shares of DMC according to the valuation that the BTCMC is worth something crowd is using. Get ahold of that many, and I'd trade.
Well, wtf, I said 110, 130 on IRC, and every time I do everyone says Im wrong its 90 and 110. INTERNET, MAKE UP YOUR MIND. 90 iirc Yes, he will allow me to sell them, but only to a single owner. Its not like friedcat whos happy to handle it however it needs to be. I have not posted the DMC 2.0 plan yet. Not until the plan is finished, fully vetted by people in the industry that I trust, and the company is registered. I will tell you that the plan includes not loaning the money to outside entities, not even near-sure bets like AM, I just can't take the risk, the Bitcoin community is still too risky to invest in (and yes, before you ask, my opinion has shifted greatly on this after what happened).I agree something needs to be done about BTCMC, but nothing can be done until BTCMC pays a dividend so I can figure out what the shares are actually worth to DMC. Unless, however, someone right now offers 0.50 BTC a share for the entire lot; I don't think the shareholders that think the shares are worth something would go for any less.However, if you trade your DMC shares for AM shares, you have no right to the BTCMC shares. If you're that worried about BTCMC value, then don't trade in. I'm not forcing anyone to do it right now until I can figure out a good way of dealing with this that everyone is happy with. A total of 7.64874425 BTC has been issued in dividends to shareholders early for 7174 shares (figure does not included nebulus' and DeLorean's share of that, but they have been paid too), and I have asked friedcat to do the AM transfer for those two.Everyone else can resume sending me DMC shares in exchange for AM shares. Update: I am going to pay out the 8.35823326 BTC we got for 754 shares of ASICMINER out in full to 7174 shares of DMC, including to nebulus and DeLorean because I didn't get their transfers done in time. After I transfer AM shares to those two, we'll be down to 681 AM.Everyone else, don't send me DMC shares until I process the dividend. No, but he said his lawyer was familiar with SEC law as well.Despite what you may think, not everybody in the US can afford to a lawyer. Its going to cost upwards of $100k to do all the legal work to open DMC 2.0 and be able to accept investors. nefario was the one that said his lawyer said it was okay for a company to issue shares before it was legally registered. Its neither legal, nor is issuing shares after registering your company legal without going through SEC hoops. So, yes, nefario doomed DMC from the start.Now, I could be like everyone else and just default and walk away since none of you have a legal claim you can use in court, but I'm not that kind of guy. However, I don't want DMC to continue on and on and effect DMC 2.0. The sooner all shares are settled the better. There are two share holders out of the 54 that own more than 1000 shares each, and combined you two own 49% of DMC. Please introduce yourselves to the other shareholders if you don't mind. Also, while I'm giving out statistics, only 12 of you have over 100 shares. You mean AM, and yes, I've stopped the clock. I seriously suggest if you look how startups are invested. They frequently do not finish paying off what they owe for a significant period of time and frequently often the time they become profitable.May has not paid a dividend yet, so no, no shares have been bought back for May yet. That will happen later this month. Im pretty sure Ukyo is aware that this forum has trolls. You do realize any funds received for the sale of BTCMC would be paid out as dividends, right? Er, yes, I screwed up the math. Its been a long day on the phone with various people, oh well.I don't mind rounding up to the next whole AM share for people trading in enough of them, thats fine. You don't have to be insulting about it, however.So, until I figure out what to do with these BTCMC shares (yochdog said he'll allow me to auction them off, but only to a single party), I'll stop the 60 day clock. Ahh, that makes it a tad more problematic. Ukyo is already aware of my wishes to end DMC. Now that yochdog will allow transference of shares, I am going to consider auctioning them off. Really? So if I go run an auction selling the shares, thats totally fine with you? I'm sorry they dragged you over here.1) Oops, thought it was 50k. My bad.2) Yes, you do. No one was disputing this.3) I do not think BFL will deliver in a timescale that will not see the combined effort of Avalon and ASICMINER make BFL units not worth even a fraction of what everyone paid for them.4) Yes, but they will still not pay for themselves and will likely pay very little to DMC. Times 1000 for per share? What are you on? Seriously, it looks like fun. Wow, you've dragged your trolling into this thread too?
So based on 10k shares of BTCMC, per DMC share600 / 10000 = 0.06 BTC per DMC share4 a day / 10000 = 0.00004  BTC a day per DMC share23 upgrade eligible BFL singles / 10000 = 0.0023 of one BFL single per DMC share 2) I am not assigning a value to BTCMC. I do not believe BFL can ship the units in time to make a difference and will be not worth the money yochdog paid for them (assuming they do arrive), and the money that is lost (ie, most of it) was lost in the Bitcoinica scam and most likely will never be returned. BTCMC does own GPUs, but because they have custom heatsinks to be rackmounted with high output fans, yochdog cannot find a buyer (even for non-mining users) and most likely will be thrown out or sold for what little scrap value they have.3) Over 90% of the trading volume since I listed it is me buying shares back.4) A stake of 0 is still 0, unfortunately. And as I said above, I do not believe BFL has what it takes to deliver in time. Again, you prove you can't do math. 1) 405.34 to 680.34 BTC were still owed as of the end of April. Using a 1.1 BTC value per ASICMINER share and 246 ASICMINER shares have already been traded (our largest shareholder took choice A), an additional 270.60 BTC has been paid back. At minimum 123 and at maximum 373 shares of ASICMINER clears what was originally invested into DMC. There are still 382 ASICMINER shares, worth 420.20 BTC, left. There was between 1691 and 1966 BTC invested into DMC. That is between a 21% and 25% return on investment.tl;dr: You made a profit, and you will continue to make a profit with ASICMINER shares.2) I was participating in a buyback because I was hoping there could be a smooth transition from DMC 1.0 to 2.0, and there cannot be one. nefario gave out a lot of bad advice saying that he got it from his lawyer. I do not believe he had a lawyer, and I believe he acted in bad faith. We collectively pay the penalty for that.3) I believe BTCMC has been a failure because yochdog relied on BFL units that may never arrived, and if they do they may not turn a profit by the time they arrive. There is no equity, the assets BTCMC holds are worthless (again, if they exist at all, BFL has not sufficiently proved they have the capacity to produce units), and BTCMC is not currently being traded.4 and 5) This entire thing isn't fair, the whole 9 yards. DMC was supposed to be a company that would show off the strengths of Bitcoin, and thanks to nefario it cannot get there from here. You are getting a better deal out of it, you now can own ASICMINER shares directly and reap all of the dividend instead of half.Also, this has been a common request to put the deal back on the table now that ASICMINER is not starting a trading platform and relying on the passthrus instead. You have been outvoted by the majority of shareholders on this one.  If I intend to also accept USD for investment then there are various rules and regulations I must follow. Unfortunately, theres no way around that. Feel free to run for Congress to change that, though. My hands are otherwise completely tied. So far 246 shares out of 1000 of ASICMINER are gone. Not cheaper. Right now, ASICMINER is worth around 1.1 BTC. Which makes, by raw assets, DMC worth 0.1 BTC per share. I am offering a 0.5 BTC credit if you convert to DMC 2.0 bonds when the time comes, or 5 times more. If you think I'm offering a bad deal either way, sell your DMC shares on the open market to someone doing choice A or B.BTCMC has no value. Yochdog says he ordered BFL units and has not been paying dividends and is not traded anywhere and you can't sell it like you can AM shares.BTC-Mining has no value. AmazingRando still has not paid Namworld what he owes and most likely never will.If there is any value in these, this will be retained for DMC 2.0, but as I said, I believe they have zero value.Continued operation of DMC 1.0 makes no sense. We can not get to where we want to go from here. So either take an offering of your share of ASICMINER, or pledge your support of DMC 2.0, thats your only two options. In 60 days, DMC will no longer be honoring shares that have not taken either choice A or choice B. There are several users who have NOT claimed their shares on BitFunder, in 60 days from this date if you have not claimed them and traded them for ASICMINER or been added to the list for conversion into DMC 2.0 bonds, they will no longer be valid.Choice A: 11 shares of DMC for 1 share of ASICMINER, whole integer amounts only.Friedcat hasn't put ASICMINER shares onto an exchange because of the passthrus, and I think everyone is tired of waiting.If you intend to take advantage of this offer, use https://bitfunder.com/transactions and send a multiple of 11 DMC shares to Diablo-D3, and then PM on the forum and give me the email and Bitcoin address you want friedcat to use.Choice B: Trade 1.0 shares in for 2.0 bondsThe exact wording for the bond has not been worked out yet, but the offer will be for a zero-coupon original issue discount 5 or 10 year callable bond, or in English, it will not pay dividends and will be sold for less than the face value and you will get paid back in 5 or 10 years unless they are paid back in full at an earlier time at the company's choosing.The bonds will earn an equivalent of 15% APY, 20% APY if paid in BTC or DMC share trades.15% APY for 5 years: $100 -> $201.1415% APY for 10 years: $100 -> $404.5620% APY for 5 years: $100 -> $248.8320% APY for 10 years: $100 -> $619.17Due to the massive fluctuation of BTC prices and the finer details of US Federal law, bonds will be denominated in USD. However, I will still accept payment for the bonds in BTC, and at the maturity date any bonds paid in BTC or DMC shares will be paid in BTC according to the market price of BTC on that date.I will be offering a credit of 0.5 BTC per share of DMC towards a DMC 2.0 bond.If you intend to take advantage of this offer, please PM me so I can add you to the list of people who are interested. If, at any time in the future you wish to take choice A instead, even after the 60 day period, you may do so. Yes. And I think your question is if you can turn 1.0 shares into 2.0 bonds, and yes, I'll be offering that.The plan for 2.0 is basically to disrupt the cloud computing market and eat Amazon and Rackspace's lunch. The whole thing can be done better and cheaper, and I intend on DMC 2.0 being the company to pull it off. But as I said, the official plan and announcement isn't ready yet. You're missing most of the story. A long time ago, DMC was listed on GLBSE, which was owned by a guy named nefario. nefario decided one day to just completely fuck over the entire Bitcoin community and shut down GLBSE without warning and also attempted to steal assets and funds, with DMC taking the brunt of this attack and surviving.The DMC plan was to own a privately owned facility to house mining hardware and sell space as a data center. Thanks to nefario's actions, a lot of investors in the Bitcoin community left and never returned. I am not accepting new investors for the existing version of DMC at this time and will not be issuing new shares.DMC 2.0 will be issuing original issue discount zero discount bonds issued by a registered C-Corp in the US.Also, ASICMINER is not issuing new shares either. The only way to get a hold of them is either buy them privately from people who already own them, buy shares through a pass through (theres two out there), or invest in a company that also holds ASICMINER shares. Typo, 1000 shares of ASICMINER.  This is the correct answer.DMC owns 1000 shares of ASICMINER, I had personally held an additional 371 shares (which I sold near the middle of last month) which I was giving the dividends for those to DMC shareholders.BTC-Mining nor BTCMC is paying dividends for the time being. BTC-Mining (ran by Namworld) loaned it's money to a guy named AmazingRando who was bulk buying BFL units, but AmazingRando ragequit and took not only BTC-Mining's money but a few other people's as well; Namworld is trying to do something about it but he hasn't made much headway yet. If Namworld can't get the money back, the shares are worth nothing.As for BTCMC has suspended dividends until their BFL units arrive. BTCMC is not currently trading anywhere, it was trading on GLBSE but GLBSE shut down. It is unknown what the shares are worth if BFL does not ship as BTCMC's current asset holdings are almost entirely GPUs.DMC is currently in the process of buying back as many shares as possible or consolidating into as few shareholders as possible to move on to DMC 2.0 (which has not been officially announced yet as I'm still trying to pull together whats needed for this). There, I've added a sha1http://adterrasperaspera.com/DiabloMiner.ziphttp://adterrasperaspera.com/DiabloMiner.zip.sha1 Ahh, I never actually looked at the program, I assumed it was some non-interpreted binary.If I add a .sha1 file along side the zip download, could you add whats needed to to automatically download DM with curl/wget? I don't have a problem with it, I just wish MacCompiler had talked with me to make it automatically download and update it's copy of DM instead of packaging it inside, or at least released the source so other people could hack that functionality into it. What are you considering selling those AM shares for? Yes, I promised to buy back DMC shares, and I have used half of dividends every month to do so. Thats not the SDK, thats the runtime that you're SUPPOSED to install. Always use the one that comes with the driver. When I get around to adding it. GPUs do not benefit from stratum. DiabloMiner does not support FPGAs or ASICs yet.
Thats not really a big issue for GPUs.

Hurray! The forums are back! Maybe I can do dividends now. Sounds like a driver bug. What Radeon do you have? Should be 1.666 for epic lulz. For PSU you probably want the NXZT Hale 90. Its really a Superflower OEM enterprise-grade PSU that has a beefed up fan. Its the only PSU on the market thats any good anymore, now that OCZ bought PC Power and fucked up all their products (I miss the original Silencer).BTW, as for amperage per pin on various connectors, you want to read this: http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/connectors.html It was a bug in Avalon's fork of cgminer, which Avalon refused to fix.forrest, the guy who wrote p2pool, ended up fixing it on his end which isn't an appropriate way of fixing it. Avalon users mine on p2pool fine now. If thats what he did, he needs to be scammer tagged immediately. You should consider p2pool instead of solo. Your traffic stays local like solo, but your variance is decreased like it would be on a pool. Just get a normal PSU and buy molex splitters and cut the 12v wire off the split ends (leave the 5v safely attached). Its without S&H factored in, the rest was already paid for. Approximately 0.006445 per share, or 6.445 BTC per thousand shares. Yeah, and imagine what'll happen when like 100 of the USB ones get auctioned. Did that bid for 53 make it?  Less than 5 minutes left. Ten minutes left. Bid 50 if you want to guarantee ownership. Half hour left We're probably going to see this cross 50 BTC. Bid harder guys. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwI_nG1IbWg
I'm thinking about it. 2 hours to go! We may actually end up in the 60s this time. I'd be nice if it was re-forked from the 0.8.1 codebase so we can use leveldb. I wouldn't mind paying a little more in shipping to get one. It saves me the time of having to build something to hold these. [05:14:31] <gribble> The expected generation output, at 10000.0 Mhps, given difficulty of 8974296.01489, is 0.560385478255 BTC per day and 0.0233493949273 BTC per hour. Less than 10 hours to go, how exciting.So those racks are for ten boards? I may consider further bidding on a set of ten if I get a rack to go with it. Its not hard to wire these if its just a screw terminal. Buy a standard PSU, cut the 12v wires off a molex (leave the 5v attached to the plug so they dont get in the way). I don't want to use my entire DMC 2.0 reserve on this. I mean, unless there are investors willing to pay up front for corporate bonds I can't sign from the c-corp yet. I'm going to be extra mean.8 * 32. I miscounted the number of ethernet ports I have available between the switches I have. 6 @ 32 No, and theres been too many important bug fixes since then. OpenCL 1.2 is supported by all hardware except Radeon 4xxx series GPUs. Upgrade your drivers, or if you're on OSX, upgrade to 10.8. 16 @ 29 I'd like to see this as an IRC bot, to be honest. Does anyone remember what the original IPO price was? 18 @ 26 I wonder how many projects publicly announce Devcoin donation addresses.DiabloMiner does: https://github.com/Diablo-D3/DiabloMiner/  Auction has ended. No one bid, someone privately bought them. And I don't blame him. Took me a long while to get over the anger before I relisted DMC.
if anyone has NOT gotten their payout from ASICMINER's dividend yesterday, contact friedcat immediately. 12 million * 250 satoshis = 30 BTC, or slightly above the starting bid. Most Devcoins exchange hands through auctions like this or just direct sales than through Vircurex. Its used as a currency to fund FOSS and large scale projects. Google Devcoin. They're worth quite a lot more than that.

I'm looking forward to another blade auction, to be honest. See what I said to josh. Thats currently the only way to verify share ownership unless you ask friedcat yourself (and he already replied in this thread shares have been transfered). friedcat sends a tx before the weekly dividend that contains the number of shares you own in satoshis. He'll probably PM me back and then I can repeat it in this thread. Yes. It'll happen before next week's dividend. i'll send the info before I go to bed. And we're done. 4 minutes left. Less than a half hour left. caoxg wins.

I verify this as correct. I'll be drawing up the addresses and confirmed payment amounts in a second.

BTW, you've been outbid on the ASICMINER blades.

Hes busy setting up more hardware in the farm, but the transfer should happen before next dividends.Since I'm a founding member of the community and a mod of the forum, I think that sidesteps the need for the overhead of GPG signed contracts and escrow (if anything, people often come to me to handle their escrows).

It should be DiabloMiner-windows -u loginforproxy -p passwordforproxy -o localhost -r portforproxyIve never used whatever mining proxy you're using, so I suspect you're setting that up wrong. Go ask the author of that. P2Pool doesn't work that way. The stale counter in miners are completely useless on P2Pool I'm not sure I understand what you're asking then. You connect to a mining proxy like you connect to a pool. You use the same command line arguments. Those are mostly useless. These require port power, so you need 1A of 5v per port. I think I'll just buy a 21ghash board if those come available. Mining proxy != proxy.Connect to a mining proxy like you would a pool normally. -x host:port<:username:password> Open a window. There is something wrong with Cointron's pool software. Either bring it up with them, or switch to p2pool. I agree with this. However, the entire batch needs to be bid at once, we can't do multiple bids because people will just try to game that. Instead, say, if theres 100 units, we bid on all 100, and allow people to build on multiple units concurrently (ie, "2 units at 5 btc each"). Switch to p2pool. No fees, and it moots the issue of stratum (p2pool supports it, but all traffic is local anyways). It doesn't support stratum yet. Also, building cgminer from source isn't difficult unless you're on OSX. Your comparison made zero sense. Miners are measured in mhash/watt and mhash/tco. Whats the point of being flat out faster in raw numbers if you can't afford to "drive your Ferrari". Usagi, you do realize what you're trying to do to bakewell is no different than what nefario tried to do to DMC, right?Pursue things legally, and since this none of you have a legal contract with Ian, there is not much you can do legally. Consider this a learning experience and move on.
Its not slower. Devices are not measured in MH/s, they are measured in MH/s per watt.That device uses 2.5 watts. A GPU that does 300 mhash uses 125-150 watts. The reason GPUs are becoming unprofitable is not because they are slow, but because cost of power usage exceeds the value of the coins. Maybe, maybe not. Litecoin doesn't seem like its taking off. DM does not do litecoin. And I think you meant scrypt (pronounced ess crypt). The large scale boards that friedcat has has something like 24 or 36 chips on them, and Bitcoin is already going to cross $100 again. Read what I wrote carefully again. I'm not interested in buying a few hundred of these, but instead a complete full sized board. I hope thats not going to be the only one you're selling. I'd like to buy one of the full scale boards you've been racking. Even if I have to pay all 36 BTC I have to buy one. I don't understand your question. Well, you'd use rolled cores n this. So you potentially have hundreds of cores on this chip. I guess it depends entirely on how well they hash to see if they're worth the money. Bitcoins are not yet recognized hy the law as existing. No court will handle a case involving Bitcoins, otherwise Namworld would have already tried to recover the stolen money from AmazingRando. Update: Finally added a real README, no other changes Yolocoin said that, not me, he was quoting out of a legal dictionary.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=114442.msg1286663#msg1286663 DM is very flexible with the jSON it accepts. I suspect bitcoinpool.com is sending invalid work. DM does not yet support work without the midstate yet (its on the todo list but I've been busy with other things lately) so that could be the issue.Use a different pool in the meantime, such as p2pool. Approximately two and a half watermelons. Unless you're a datacenter that does 48v DC, which is even more efficient than the usual 208v three phase. Selling the shovels is ALWAYS the most profitable. Given we're at $145, theres no dividends for this month either? I'd happily trade that if he spent the rest of his life in jail over multiple counts of securities fraud over this. I'd be worth it, every dime. And Bitcoin as a whole has reached another milestone, we've hit $100

Oh, I completely agree. the company I'm trying to startup is focusing directly on customers like friedcat. Its very not easy, and its a somewhat niche market (many would be customers couldn't even afford to fill a rack). Cooling, electrical availability, and security. Also, most apartment complexes forbid commercial use.Lets take Avalon as an example, the numbers should be similar to ASICMINER boards due to similar tech.A 3 module Avalon would need 600w to do 66gh. 600w on 120v is 5 amps. You can put 3 of these on a standard NEMA 5-15 120v line, or 15 amps to run 198gh. This is equivalent to 8 amps on Euro 230v, so you could plug 6 of these on a single circuit if you're using an appropriate 230v/30a circuit. This is also approximately 9 watts per gh.This also means you need about 2050 BTU/hr cooling per unit. Home air conditioning units are usually low efficiency and non-redundant, and are often sold in 9000 or 12000 BTU sizes and are not meant to run 24/7. A 9000 BTU unit could service 3 units and could wear out during the course of a really hot summer. A 9000 BTU air conditioner could use 600 or more watts.So, for every 3 units, you're using 1800 + 600w, or 20a on 120v, or to round up to the least common multiple between 15 and 20, 12 units would take 60a. 60a would be 4 circuits, or probably all an average apartment in the US has that isn't dedicated to water heater, heat/cooling, oven, or fridge.In the US, an apartment, even a small one in a unpopulated area, could go for $1000-1500/mo. For that, you're getting no building security, having to pay for your own cooling, having to staff your own on site techs, for 12 units that do 792GH.Instead, he could do business with a DC that handles high compute density customers, and pay $2000-2500/mo per rack, get 4 120v 20a circuits, security, redundant cooling, and on site techs as part of the cost, and given 9 watts per gh, and given 9600w per rack, you'd end up with about 1067gh or approximately 12 4 module Avalons or 16 3 module Avalons.Given the shape of the Avalon case is approximately 4U and using 4 module Avalons you can put 1584gh physically into a single rack, given the 80a 120v budget, 1056gh, leaving 24U empty or 1/3rd of the rack or 2U in between each unit. friedcat, exactly how much GH is currently operating atm? No, it switches on failure. AM dividends are, DMC dividends are monthly. Today is only the 27th. Run DM with -d and see which GPU is giving errors. One might actually have gone faulty. Also, are both fans functioning correctly? And are they both consistently under 85f? Sounds like theres something radically wrong with your hardware. Take the video cards completely out, clean the heatsinks, and then firmly reinsert them and make the PCI-E power plugs are inserted firmly and correctly. This is what I was going to suggest to you. Its the only way to really handle this problem. I'm aware cgminer can overclock automatically, but I don't think thats the right solution. The 371 shares remain my property, but the dividends from those are spent towards the buyback and DMC dividends 50/50. If you're pricing DMC by dividend, you count all 1371 shares; if you're pricing by asset value, you count 1000 shares. No, I actually calculated it wrong. I calculated the buyback using the 1000 shares DMC owns, but not in addition to the 371 I'm using the dividends from to speed the DMC repair effort, but paid DMC dividends from the entire 1371. Its supposed to be 50/50, but I buy shares over time as prices fluctuate. What you claim as quarter of cash is closer to 1/8th and it was sitting on Bitfunder waiting for the order to be fulfilled, so it was still being used on buyback.The actual difference should be 1000 shares worth of dividends buy back, 1371 shares worth of dividends paid as dividends. Thats the first step to not investing in Apple. Be proud of yourself, support your local startups. Except you're implying shareholders can find better investments. I think Apple might be actually correct in this, there aren't any better investments.And yes, now that Steve Jobs is dead, Apple is slowly turning into yet another dying pointless tech company and has begun issuing dividends; although, arguably, Apple died the day people like Woz left Apple. I think you didn't read what I wrote. Apple doesn't believe there is a good investment out there, thus is sitting on the cash instead. Its better to sit on it than burn it doing dumb shit. It depends on the company. I think Apple CAN reinvest the money better, for example. Case in point, they have a lot of cash sitting around earning very little because there are no good investments, everything out there would just be a waste of capital.
Steve Jobs never believed in dividends and thought investors who chased those were idiots, and didn't want idiots investing in his company. Most of the best businessmen in history believe(d) only idiots chased dividends as well, including Warren Buffet, although its uniquely Steve Jobs that only wanted smart people investing in his company. I agree with this. This is the first company in Bitcoin history where it could have never issued dividends, and we'd be buying it based on earnings reports and asset valuations.

No one really trusts btct.co. I'd rather see it on BitFunder. You do realize BTCMC and ASICMiner dividends are funding the buy back, right? BTCMC pays dividends once a month, ASICMiner has not paid its first dividend yet. 0, 11579. Your original question implied you cared about actually getting it done. I answered your question. ASICMiner should be issuing their first dividend soon. This. Which url is the correct url for git upstream? Yes, but you have to use Bitcoin itself to sign it. No one agreed on the signature algo, so everyone else is doing it wrong and they need to switch to use Bitcoin's. If you would have signed it with bitcoin-qt or bitcoind, this wouldn't have been a problem. Read the mid-mortem report. Before nefario decided to shit all over the community, DMC was turning a profit before the mvp was completed. You're right, its a little messy because people aren't getting paid back what they originally put in because they want their money now instead of when they'd normally get it. That is their choice, however, I am not forcing them to sell their shares for less than they purchased them for.I never claimed DMC was a success. I should have accepted USD investments as well as BTC, except DMC just wasn't ready for that yet. It would have raised money much faster and we could be already on our way to accept customers. DMC 2.0 probably will accept USD investments as well.Also, I do agree that I shouldn't have listened to early shareholders and sold IPO shares at less than 1.0. At the time, their arguments sounded like a good idea, however none of them had any actual business expertise and I should have realized it was a bad idea. I want to believe they had their hearts in the right place, though.  Except I never changed it into an ETF. I was using mining bonds to fulfill the mining part of the plan until the datacenter was constructed and mining equipment could be placed into it. At no time was the datacenter taken off the table.DMC 2.0 is going to continue pursuing the original plan. This is partly why no one takes you seriously.Lets say I have 3 shares. I sell 1 share for 10 lollipops. With permission of the first shareholder, I sell the next share for 5, and the next for 2. I have a total of 17. According to your math, I have instantly lost 13 lollipops, even though they never actually existed.I then hand back 10, 5, and 2 lollipops to the original investors, respectively. I have handed back a total of 17 lollipops, the original number I was handed.You're the guy with 6 who thinks he should get more than he originally put in, even though neither the guy with 10 or the guy with 2 are getting more than they put in. You've refused to list a sell order on the exchange for that price, and you also have demanded to get ahead in line. Shares will be bought back according to what price they are being sold at. You threw a hissy fit on IRC because you think you should get preferential treatment over other shareholders.You have tried to claim that 1.00 (the IPO price) to 0.03 (the floor during the nefario incident) means I lost 97% of the money put into DMC. Since virtually all shares were never even sold at full IPO price due to trading, this claim is false. The mid-mortem I wrote up above details approximately how much was put in, how much was paid out, and approximately how much the assets are valued. When DMC finally buys back all the shares, we will most likely break even. If the minimum of 1691 BTC went in, 1105 + 90 BTC have been paid out, and our assets are at least worth 496 BTC, we break even. If the maximum of 1966 BTC went in, 1105 + 90 BTC have been paid out, and our assets are worth at least 771 BTC, we break even.I want to make sure the remaining shareholders get as much out of these assets as possible. Neither ASICMINER nor BTCMC can be sold yet, and Namworld is still fighting amazingrando on BTC-MINING so that might not be a complete loss. The people who bought at full price fit into two categories. 1) They believe the original plan is sound and want to invest in DMC 2.0, 2) They didn't agree with the discount plan and sold out early in the 0.90s.GLBSE motions didn't work right yet at that time, so this was an informal motion. Almost all the original shareholders I personally knew on IRC, so it was easy to get done.
Since nefario refused to ever release the purchase or trade logs or make them available to me, and I never kept fully detailed records, I'm going to try to reconstruct how much was put into DMC, and how much was already paid back. Without exact records, I can only approximate this the best I can.What was soldAbout 50 shares were sold at the full 1 BTC price. At the suggestions of the community and existing shareholders, and with permission with the shareholders, I started trading bonds for shares at a discount.The first discount was 1/3rd off, slowly moving down to 2/3rds as bond prices decreased faster than I decreased the discount relative to mhash/bond valuation. Although we tripled our dividend income, the value of DMC shares dropped to around 0.50 due to the bond market collapsing under the care of nefario.The next approximately 3000 shares where part of the original discount program, the first 250 sharers were sold around between 0.50 each, the next 1000 were traded in from between 0.40 and 0.50, the last 1750 were traded in from between 0.30 and 0.40. This totals between 1050 BTC and 1325 BTC.(Side note: During the nefario incident, DMC held about 1543 BTC in assets (detailed in the open letter to nefario ordering him to unlock DMC's account), and had already paid out 80 BTC dividends. This means I increased the original investment 18% to 48%).The final 17.9k were all trade-ins from ASICMINER, which were traded in at approximately 0.033 each, all traded in at the time ASICMINER was still IPOing at 0.10 before it took off to 0.15+ before GLBSE collapsed. This accounts to 591 BTC.Approximately between 1691 and 1966 BTC were invested into DMC.What has been paid backAt peak, we had sold 20,909 shares (out of 1,000,000). IPO was 2% finished before GLBSE collapsed. We currently have 11,579 shares still active, 9,330 shares have been purchased back.After nefario unlocked DMC's GLBSE account, the money from Obsi closing OBSI.ABMO (having bought back the 9290 shares of that back at 0.10 each, and paid about 12 BTC in dividends per week for about 6 weeks while the account was locked) totaled about 1001 BTC.BTCMC paid about 11 BTC per month, so about 11 BTC, during that time, and BTC-MINING paid about 0.5 per week, so about 3 BTC. About 1015 BTC was paid out to buy back 9,330 shares.Given about 1691 to 1966 BTC were paid into DMC and about 1015 BTC have been paid back plus 90 BTC in dividends, between 586 and 861 BTC are still owed.What DMC currently holdsGiven current BTC prices of $26 USD, and BTCMC's asset value at between 1027 (BFL and Bitcoinica fully lost) and 2083 (BFL and Bitcoinica fully recovered), and BTCMC having 10,000 shares outstanding1000 ASICMINER, valued at between 0.40 and 1.00, is worth between 400 and 1000 BTC.106 BTC-MINING, valued at 0.04, is worth 4 BTC.1000 BTCMC, valued at between 0.1027 and 0.2083, is worth between 103 and 208 BTC.DMC has approximately between 507 and 1212 BTC in assets. I'm going to keep a list of trade offers. ASICMINER prices could peak above 1 BTC, so this is a great deal. I think goat just wants to exit the whole Bitcoin investment thing and sell off all his assets. It'd be a good idea to stop distracting friedcat while hes busy setting up the farm. Trolls like you keep trying to push that agenda, why bother? nefario in the end admitted what he did and closed GLBSE before the UK equivalent of the SEC could catch him and before anyone could sue him or press charges. I have never screwed my shareholders. You claim I've lost thousands of BTC? Somewhere between 1500-2000 BTC was originally invested into DMC, I've paid back around 750-1000 BTC, and I haven't stopped yet. Most investors have made a profit, not a loss.Those ASICMINER shares may be worth as much as 750 BTC, so even if the other two assets are a complete loss (thanks Bitcoinica, BFL, and amazingrando), DMC ends up at least breaking even. This is why I'm willing to trade in 11 DMC for 1 ASICMINER, it pays back whos left. No, but I'll do it for 88. The shares are cheap on Bitfunder, get them while you still can. What I do with my own money is my own business. If I want to buy ASICMINER for my own ownership separate from DMC's ownership, I can.Because that is the contract DMC agreed to with the shareholders.I've reconsidered your request for the trade. I'll trade 11 DMC for 1 ASICMINER, and I'll offer this to any shareholder. Priority will be number of shares traded. Trade will happen when the ASICMINER exchange comes online, so everyone has until then to figure out what they're going to do. Requests for trade must be made in public.I had wanted to shut down the company, but the outpouring of support from he community after it came to light what nefario did to not only DMC but all Bitcoin investors changed my mind. I really do want DMC to succeed, but the only way to do this is to clean up the mess and start over, doing everything by the book. The first step to this is buying back all the shares. Clearly, update it. Although, either way, it leads to the same thing: I'm outbid at 0.33. And now I'm outbid at 0.36. Wow, quite the hostile tone there.Yes, its my own personal money I am using to buy ASICMINER shares.No, simply handing the BTC over to shareholders would not really fix the problem nefario made. Most shareholders are not willing to sell at that low of a bid and I would need to be able to buy ALL outstanding shares at that price to make it worthwhile. I also think that this is unfair to shareholders to even go down this route.DMC is not, nor has ever, been in a death spiral. The DMC IPO never finished, and thanks to nefario's antics, it won't be in its current form. The only reason I'm buying back shares is because I want to issue corporate bonds who's contracts are backed by a real registered with the government company that pays taxes and everything. I want DMC to continue in a completely legal way, and not let nefario's bullshit undermine the company.You call them soon-to-be-ex-shareholders, yet many of them have shown interest in continuing DMC and buying into those corporate bonds. Your claim that there is "ongoing risk of exposure to me and my willingness to do the right thing" is a strange claim. I always have been doing the right thing, even when everyone else isn't. If he doesn't pay, put them back up for auction in a new thread, I'll bid on them if I have any money left. Aaaaand hes now outbid everyone. Yes, but the side effect of altering the terms of the auction is anyone would have the right to reject the new terms and remove their bids as long as they did not bid after this rule change (thus implicitly accepting the new terms). Although, I don't think this will be a problem, they will soon be outbid anyhow. p2pool shares have to be generated as valid. If friedcat would leave p2pool and mine blocks that harm Bitcoin, we'd just change the hash algo out from under him thus rendering the entire farm useless. Yes, but it would also prevent friedcat from becoming a threat in a 51% situation since he does not control the output. p2pool has made monolithic pools obsolete, and I don't understand why anyone would be silly enough to ever use anything but p2pool. Update bid to 200 @ 0.36 Its Poisson. Time to up my bid to 300 @ 0.33 then. I wonder if we'll get to 100 pages before friedcat returns to the thread to update us. And I shouldn't be listed twice. I'm only bidding on 300 shares. My current bid is 300 @ 0.31. In general, what you said is true. However, ASICMINER will not solo mine, and will split hashing power across multiple pools (although I wish friedcat would just go 100% on p2pool and remove the problem of pool owners abusing the privileged of AISCMINER mining on their pool).
qft 300 * 0.31 I suggested this idea about 2 years ago. A GPS-like network that repeats the entire chain ad infinium. Problem is, it is very hard to get the license for the downlink frequencies we'd be interested in, and it would cost in excess of a quarter of a million USD per launch. Unless I did my math wrong, that adds up to 5800. Somebody needs to be rejected to the outbid list. I think you mean Avalon. Its not worth it to get in on Batch #3 unless they cut the price in half and/or double the performance. That leaves 66.51 left. Also, who did you pre-order the ASICs with? Please don't say BFL.If you preordered with BFL, combined with the Bitcoinica loss, we're out $26k. Check the auctions forum, theres at least two open auctions for asicminer shares, including one guy selling 5000 in blocks of 100. Quoted for preservation. As much as I want to see BFL actually ship ASICs, I just don't see that happening. I find it funny that asicminer will have its entire hashing power online before Avalon customers do. I thought Avalon had beaten asicminer, but I guess not. Hurray. 0.3 300 @ 0.30 600 * 0.41 647 * 0.38 Feh, minimum increment.696 @ 0.36 696 @ 0.355 Very soon. Maybe next week. 696 * 0.34 696 @ 0.32 Update: Believe it or not, I made it faster.
friedcat, you are fucking awesome. Except they claim they have a lawyer and a lawyer has advised them through this process. No lawyer would ever advise them to break the law. I think that meets the requirement of considering this as intentional. Yes, over time. The half of income that originally was going to be spent on growing and maintaining the company is now being spent on buying back shares, the other half of income being paid out as dividends as per contract.Actually, it depends on what US law thinks. My interpretation of law is what BFL is doing is illegal. If my interpretation is wrong and they can legally call these pre-orders by customers instead of investments by investors, then they are still violating the law by taking pre-order money before shipment. If its not a scam, then what is it? These conditions do not go away just because they ship and the government can still go after them, including halting shipments of product and destroying them or refusing them entry into the US. I'm not sure how you get to 12%. That would require 24% of the ASICMINER shares to be unsold and withdrawn from sale. I imagine ASICMINER"s parent company owns the unsold amount in addition to the other 50% of the profits. Because it never happened. I already paid back half of what investors already invested. What Puppet (aka nefario's puppet) is not saying is nefario tried to steal DMC's assets by putting up a fake shareholder vote to remove me as CEO of the company, which nefario was then outvoted 9 to 1, keeping me as the CEO.I suspect nefario also knew many farms were selling mining bonds that were not backed by any hardware, all the while claiming he investigated all companies to make sure they were legit. Many people trusted him, and many people were burned by his actions.To claim I only had 5 minutes of fame is pretty lame. I continually contribute to the Bitcoin community as often as I can, and I've been here since the beginning. I claim BFL is a scam because they continually call investors 'customers' and investments 'pre-orders', it does not make a difference if they ship or not.By their claims, they were the first to start working on AISCs (a year before anyone else), yet they have not shipped a product. I am not the only person on this forums who believes there is a low chance of them EVER shipping.Oh, and by the way, DMC is an investor of ASICMINER. Pagodabox is their CDN. I can confirm DMC's receipt of the dividend. He paid out 15 BTC, or about one month's worth. Its too late to pay it as a dividend for Jan (Feb 1st), so Feb (March 1st) should see a 7.5 BTC dividend. Holy shit, a religious flamewar about Thelema on a financial forum. Now I can ascend to the great beyond and take my place among the Gods with no regrets. Yeah, the only people who can be considered as legit as possible is jgarzik, gmaxwell, me, gavin, and if satoshi ever returns to us in mortal form, him. And the Bitcoin Foundation also got one, and a lot of these names also appear on the Foundation's board.I believe Avalon is legit, and sans the FAILURE TO HANDLE THE SECOND BATCH PURCHASING ROUND CORRECTLY (WAAAARGH), I'm really happy for them. We lost out again.I had about 240 BTC of my own money to grab 3 Avalon units. Avalon botched the launch, and apparently they're now sold out even though no one could order any units and there have been no confirmed orders. On top of that, Walletbit stole 2.2 BTC as a "fee" to deposit money, even though this seems to be listed nowhere.I'm seriously considering scammer threads for both of them. Further up in the thread friedcat said hes going to be mining on multiple pools to sidestep the issue. IMO, he should just deploy p2pool and just mine on that, 100%. It gets even better. The chips may in fact be able to be clocked much higher than they planned for. So we could be looking at doubling the current hashrate overnight if we're lucky (pre-Avalon, anyways). Hey yochdog, please do an assets statement on Feb 1st. I'd like to know where we stand on the ASICs fund. No, don't get me wrong, I'd actually like to know how much BTC has been saved up thus far. Should be enough for a couple Avalon rigs.Edit: I asked yochdog to do a statement Feb 1st. I'm estimating BTCMC should have in the neighborhood of 2000 BTC, which at $20 BTC prices and $1500 second run Avalon prices, that should be at least 26 Avalons, or at 66gh each, at least 1700 gh. No, the BTCMC guy passed a motion to suspend dividends to save up money to buy ASIC gear. Since he owns a majority of the shares in BTCMC, he can pass the motion unilaterally. I have not seen an indication that he has squandered the money. He now has an opportunity to buy ASICs now that Avalon has proven themselves and is gearing up for a second batch.I do agree that it'd be nice if he kept continuing producing reports, but even I slacked off on those when GLBSE went bust. Whats the point in doing them if you have no dividends generated and you couldn't distribute them even if you wanted to and theres no new information to disseminate?I plan on buying them back as cash comes in, but do the timing in a way that prevents some investors from gaming it to make it unfair to other investors. I'd like to buy them all back today, but that won't happen. The sooner I buy these back, the sooner I can start on DMC 2.0, and thats probably more than a year away. Its best to just ignore the trolls. Hes mining with it right now. Unless you managed to buy ALL 11579 DMC shares to trade for all the ASICMINER, I wouldn't consider the trade.Yeah, it seems BTC-MINING and BTCMC didn't turn out the way I hoped. ASICMINER dividends will be split 50/50 as per the contract, half will be paid as dividends to DMC, the other half will be used to buy back DMC.By the way, Amazingrando has come out of hiding and is talking to the guy who owns BTC-MINING, so I'm hoping something good comes out of this. Im glad for Avalon, I really am. It must be a hard thing not to take the BTC and run to the Gayman Islands like BFL, Bitcoinica, and the rest did.
To those inquiring about me selling 1000 shares for 1000 BTC, I think I'm going to wait until friedcat opens his exchange. It'll make things much easier that way. Thats how he does it. I also own my share of DMC. Officially, DMC. I own no assets personally of any kind, the Warren Buffet way. I'll sell the 1000 I have for 1 BTC each. I think that is a fair deal. It ends up not being an issue. BFL won't ship yet (or possibly ever), bASIC failed to launch, Avalon is in the process of shipping but no one has gotten shipping numbers yet (and most likely won't get the product in their hands until the first week of Feb), so as long as we start mining before or at the same time Avalon customers get their gear, we're fine. 1/2) I must have missed the update where he said the second half was already finished and hes already ordered the second batch5) He hasn't said it, but its still an issue if things take too long or something goes wrong.7) One week from now is February. Now, yes, I hope they start mining this week, but I think it'll end up being the first week of Feb. Yes.Stuff starts shutting down and priority jobs are completed before the beginning of the Chinese New Year, and once the Chinese New Year starts, everything is completely shut down and everyone goes home. Hopefully, the finished boards are already in friedcat's hands BEFORE the 10th, otherwise we might be in for a longer wait. The hold up, right now, is the Chinese New Year, and possibly, your inability to read.friedcat has already said in this thread:1) The first batch was split in half just in case there were errors in the chip design, and the first half of the first batch has been completed, the rest of the first batch has only been manufactured half way and...2) friedcat has given his go ahead to the chip fab to complete them3) friedcat has tested a sample of the chips, and they passed testing with flying colors, and may even be able to be clocked much higher than originally engineered for, due to how well they came out4) the half of the first batch has been sent to the board assembler to be surface mounted with the rest of the components5) the Chinese New Year means nothing gets done6) he has already chosen and mostly prepared the location the mining rigs will be setup7) the first boards should be completed and sent to friedcat and begin mining in the first or second week of February  Troll much? friedcat has already made it clear hes setting up a private exchange to handle all of his assets, including MOORE and ASICMINER. He no longer trusts any exchange enough to handle his assets. friedcat won't recognize the sale anyhow. Just wait until the exchange is up and running. Yeah, this. It still pisses me off how BFL abused all of their investors by calling them customers and called their investments preorders. Between BFL and bASIC, a lot of bullshit has gone on that ASICMINER and Avalon and the entire Bitcoin community could have done without. So the completed boards should be back early Feb? I don't know, but I think someone recorded a lot of the assets before the shutdown. Shares sold to date: 11,579Dividends paid out today: 9.99997177 BTCDividends per share paid out today: 0.00086363 BTCDividends paid out for all time: 90.38740546 BTCDividends paid out for all time per share:  0.0272217863171353 BTCAssets held:106 BTC-MINING1000 BTCMC1000 ASICMINERAs per the motion passed on August 17th, the dividends for August (paid September 1st), September (paid October 1st), and October (paid November 1st) were recycled be recycled to increase NAV. The only months eligible for dividends for this period are November (paid Dec 1st) and December (paid Jan 1st). Because GLBSE shut down at the beginning of October, no assets that pay dividends owned by DMC have been able to pay dividends. Before the GLBSE shutdown, BTCMC voted to suspend dividends to save up for ASICs, and has not paid any dividends during this period. ASICMINER has not yet begun paying dividends. BTC-MINING has not yet paid dividends owed.As part of a promotion by BitFunder, former GLBSE assets were paid 10BTC to relist on Bitfunder. I have paid this out as a dividend for the month of December. Yes. I'm going to do an interim report in a bit. All three of you are on the final list. You should have gotten emails by now. If this isn't the case, tell me so I can bug Ukto. Whats your email? You might not be on the final asset list. Everyone who has shares should have gotten an email from Bitfunder on how to setup their accounts and claim their shares.I've also issued the 10 BTC from the Bitfunder promotion as a dividend to shareholders. Except friedcat was just going to run his own just for asicminer. That heatsink is a waste of money. Its clearly a high performance one, but you never waste copper on the fins on a heatpipe assembly, it doesn't improve the performance. Plus, the base isn't nickel plated. Even if I needed a low profile heatsink like that, thats not the one I'd be buying.Plus, friedcat couldn't easily tile those closely due to the overlap of the heatpipe assembly, and the airflow is down facing on those thus also hard to use in small assemblies. Its easier to blow air across the board than straight into it. BFL keeps making this design mistake.
Yeah, but if the chips remain stable at high clock rates while driving the voltage up, it'll need much better cooling. Also, its cheaper and saner to just use one large heatsink thats mounted on the board instead of placing the entire load on the chip itself. Thermal pads aren't magically bad here, though. They have high end ones that conduct as much heat as shitty paste and only slightly less than high end paste (that no OEM ever uses, they always use the shitty paste on GPUs, or shitty pads on CPU HSFs).These chips are probably sane at higher core voltages than what friedcat has announced (1.2v), but the problem is heat output. High end thermal pads would still work well here because the chips simply don't get hot enough to warrant paste (and like I said, OEMs don't even use high end paste, even ASUS's ultra expensive premium GPUs with the triple wide coolers use generic paste, which is kind of a shame).AlCu alloy heatsinks (light like Al, heat conductive like Cu, half as expensive as pure Cu) they use in low profile rackmount servers would probably work well here. Saying I used BFL as a base of measurement is slander. I forgot about the case and the PSU, so don't get your jimmies rustled. Update: When I modularized the code, I forgot to readd the code that sends the miner back to the first pool every hour. Now it does. So, I got the final list from nefario.It now says there was 11648 shares in the wild including the 69 I owned. Its still short of the 11909 I last saw, but the total on that list adds up to the full 1 million shares (it also lists the unsold shares as well). I will assume this list is accurate.I'm going to be handing this list over to Ukto to get the shares redistributed. Hrm, if they're aiming for 66gh per unit, and each chip does 0.75gh, its approximately 88 chips per unit. Packaging and testing cost is, what, another 50 cents per? And completing the product (PCB manuf, mounting components on PCB, etc) is another, say, ~$120 per unit? Thats only a 5x markup from the sales price, how are they staying in business? =/ I came. See, this is what I've been trying to tell you, and you said it more concisely than I have.Please, pony up the evidence.I want to believe BFL is real and not a long con. I want to believe that the ASICs are real and are coming real soon now and are going to work as well as everyone has hoped. I want to believe BFL just didnt run off with a million dollars in BTC. I want to believe BFL treats their customers LIKE customers instead of using them as a cheap source of venture capital and all these victims are really hoodwinked investors.I'm not the bad guy here, even if you want to paint me as such.  Or hell, just hire a prostitute and spend some "quality time" with her. Or him, if thats his thing. And remember, the points don't matter. THEN CORRECT HIM WITH YOUR OWN FACTS. This is why people laugh at you to your face, you just go around saying people are wrong without offering opposing view points. To be fair, Apple never had a RDF. Steve Jobs did. RIP Steve Jobs. Update: Force OSX to do -w 64 by default, improve -56 test Whoever has the oldest Bitcoin transaction wins. I made that joke earlier. You and I both know thats not how it works. There, I sent the 5 BTC. Now you can't claim I don't pay people that I owe. I think last time I asked was before you ragequit IRC for over a month. Then provide the valid information. BFL, as a joke, stopped being funny months ago. We're all sitting here waiting for the punchline. You never gave me an address to send the 5 BTC to. I asked repeatedly for it.
He only has to confirm with me what the email address is. I will process all the claims no matter what, but I find it very strange he won't confirm what the email he used for the claims process is. Given what is status quo around these parts, I just don't want usagi to scam his shareholders. You're about to see some serious (bull)shit. What, you've never seen time travel before? If he did, I'm not aware of it. I bought back half the shares out there, I don't know who owned them. Its possible I wiped him out, but I can't find any of his former threads to see if he actually told his shareholders or not. I've been looking over my claim reports for DMC from nefario.... and there are no email addresses that match "bmf", "nyan", or "tsukino.ca". There is also 320 shares unaccounted for, which is a magnitude less than what usagi claimed BMF and NYAN held. Yes, but whats the 13k number? Is this the total space of the whole building?  Probably some deal from the cert issuer and that was cheapest Looks like a scam. Those are all stock photos of well known PC cases with their name crudly photoshopped on. Yeah I dont get how that works either.  Says 6000SF is avail, largest space is 6000SF, smallest space is 4800SF and office space is 4800SF (so I'm assuming this only has 2 spaces). Is he only renting some of the space? Does that happen in shit like this? Yeah, I'll agree with this. Even if you're the single and only employee, and its not a retail location, you MUST comply with every fucking law, or they will nail your ass.Seriously, the amount of stupidity in this thread is amazing. I gave one one the 8th. I'm still waiting on the last shares to be claimed.Although, there is one up side, I grabbed one of Bitfunder's 10btc slots which will be equally divided among shares. I'm not going to read this entire thread.In short: giga is suing nefario, nefario is trying to "punish" giga for being sued by not having the data or the money over.Can nefario get double scammer tagged? With #3, from what friedcat has said in this thread, this is what seems to be going on: the chips are now out of the fab, are being packaged and tested, and soon as thats done they will be shipped to friedcat or another company to be inserted onto boards (he hasn't said whos manning the solder gun on this yet, or if he did, I missed it). He hasn't said whos manufacturing the boards (this should be easier to do than with FPGAs, btw) or if they're done yet or not.The packaging, shipping to next location to be board mounted and have the assembled product QCed, and then being shipped to wherever friedcat has chosen to set these up for mining, can all be done concurrently depending on how the companies handle it.Also, from what I understand, soon as mining has produced enough money for a second and possibly third run of ASICs, thats going to happen too.I think that somewhat answers your question. I don't get why everyones getting so hyped up about a 51% attack.All the 51% attack does is allow extremely limited double spending attacks (and only double spending from the point of view of non-bitcoin transactions, ie, a currency exchange or a physical inventory-based vendor). The attacker cannot forge fake transactions.51% doesn't mean what most people think it means. If the network rate is 25TH, then the attacker must have OVER 25TH to perform the attack. With the current batch of chips that friedcat ordered, he won't have enough to even come close.What we really need to be worried about, as a community, is why the other ASIC vendors allowed ASICMINER to become >51%. If BFL and Avalon and bASIC all ship what they said they'd ship, ASICMINER would be less than a quarter of the new network. https://i.imgur.com/4CIWY.jpgSlandering is not an appropriate way to advertise a product. FUCK YEAH! Just saying, if the government wants to bone you over trivial shit, they will. There was a CEO that got slammed by the SEC for a Facebook message, I forget which company though. I haven't laughed this hard all week. Thanks man. I'm going to mention the 10btc in the DMC thread to see if I can get the last 320 shares to finally claim with GLBSE
Except nefario claimed he thoroughly vetted every asset on GLBSE, and did nothing when one or more mining companies flooded the market with shares not backed by assets and managed to collapse the market.In addition, around 2k was invested in DMC, and I've already paid half of that back and bought back half the shares before the collapse of GLBSE.The most you can claim is DMC lost half its value (the other half of the shares I have not repurchased yet), but then it'd still be nefario's fault because he closed GLBSE and fucked every asset issuer on there including the ones DMC invested in. DMC got screwed by nefario, is what happened. I noticed this wasn't mentioned in the thread yet. DMC is moving to BitFunder. We're not missing out on anything unless you want to sell your shares. Update: Forcefully disconnect HTTP on any errorShould fix issues with some pools not properly killing the connection and spamming errors until DM restart. He removed the ASISCMiner text, which as it currently stands, they will end up being the only ASIC vendor shipping in 2012 as long as everything continues on schedule. Luke-Jr is afraid that he is going to lose his large investment in BFL, and doesn't understand he has already lost it because BFL seems to have no plans to ship the products their investors have paid for.So, yes, he is shilling for BFL, and I don't see why you're attacking ASICMiner either. They plan on selling to outside customers while also operating a small farm on behalf of investors. I think you're confused on what ASICMiner is actually doing. Look at the entire changelog. He removed ASICMINER completely from the wiki. Yes. Might take a year or more. This is my interpretation of US and EU consumer protection laws as well. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130795.0 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130795.0 Luke-Jr has been caught editing the Bitcoin wiki to favor BFL and remove at least one of their competitors. No, because ASICs, just like any other miner, will be looking for diff 1 candidates (ie, H == 0). Bitcoin JSONRPC doesn't do TCP, and UDP isn't recommended for reliability reasons. Existing miners don't have issues with TCP because we keep the connection open over long periods. Plus, even if you don't, each mining box itself (no matter how many chips are on it) would have one controller. Modern machines can handle a million TCP connections concurrently without breaking (usually its the software handling the connections that fails to scale long before any OS's given kernel breaks).I don't recommend machines implement their own miner though: leave it to the experts like me and ck. DMC takes slot #1. There are now 4 left  With Ethernet, the miners would just be emulating the miner interface itself (ie, directly connect to bitcoind). Are you retarded, or just trolling? Enough with the goddamned BFL threads! Please let me buy the first completed unit. Even if you don't sell any of the other units and keep them all for the shareholder farm, let me buy the first one.1) I want to get it working on DiabloMiner.2) I can prove to the rest of the Bitcoin community that it really does exist and everyone can quit with the bullshit on the forums. I hope not. Cigars should always be lit with wood matches, otherwise it ruins the flavor.
Update: I didn't fix issue #48. Everyone who was getting -56 errors, update to this release and tell me the number Code:Spurious CL_INVALID_GLOBAL_OFFSET error says after it. At least the -56 error won't halt DM anymore. I'd like to see it listed on Bitfunder instead. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Earlier Phinnaeus Gage doxed the BFL people. This post has been reported several times. I have decided to not delete the post. I think BFL is at the very least lying to people and at the very most trying to scam people, otherwise they would have shipped the product already.If you think I'm wrong and the post should be deleted, take it up with theymos. If you don't want unsavory characters like Phinnaeus Gage to dox you, then don't fuck investors. Ooh! Ooh! I know what that is! Its a Pentium! No, the 98% figure was true up to about a few years ago. Now its Taiwan and South Korea, both countries being in the shadow of China (and Taiwan even still calls itself the Republic of China, rejecting the Communist revolution). I simply forgot about the newer Korean fabs.GloFo AFAIK doesn't take jobs this small, but I could be wrong. And a lot of their fab power is in Singapore, which is still within the sphere of the Chinese tech sector's influence.Now, don't get me wrong, I'd love these chips to be fabbed in the US. Like, NatSemi still has a fab in Portland Maine, which is like 5 hours away from me, but I don't they think they take contract jobs (and I don't think they offer a node size small enough at that location, but they do at ). But look at the rest of friedcat's competitiors: its all TSMC (China, Taiwan), UMC (Taiwan, Singapore), or SMIC (China).Friedcat needs to produce these at a fab that can do this with sufficient quality and still be cheap, as does everyone else. If doing it in the US or EU increases the cost even 10-15%, then this makes it that much harder to profit. I forgot about the Korean memory fabs. Its still the same thing in the end.As for your list, yes, I'm aware of it. I have it in my bookmarks just for chip origin research purposes. Problem is, the list does not include how many chips the fabs produce every year. For example, TI's fab do not produce a lot of non-TI chips, and TI's most popular chips (which are not complex things like ARM SoCs) are often not fabbed at TI.And yes, Freescale is still largely US, which is great. Samsung also does a lot more than just memory, also.Now, given the kinds of fabs we need for this kind of project.... TI and Freescale and Samsung can't help us. Virtually all of those really are in China/Taiwan/Korea, although I think I remember ArtForz saying there was one in Mexico thats popular but the quality is worse than Chinese fabs. Well, stuff being made in China really is an issue. Its not about racism or nationalism. I, and most of the rest of the people living in my country, don't care where its made. Most of us don't even care that its a modern form of slave labor (I don't include myself in that group, however). I was just backing up the Toyota will survive nuclear war sentiment.That said, over 90% of chips fabricated are done so in China or Taiwan. 98% of all memory is done in Taiwan. Pretty much the only chips that aren't fabbed in China or Taiwan are either high performance CPUs (Intel, AMD, IBM, etc) and/or rad-hard milspec "its a matter of natsec" chips.It doesn't matter how racist or nationalistic you are, you can't change the fact that China is the technology industry. It is not worth bringing up the fact friedcat has fabbed his chips in China because there really is nowhere else to do so. Erm, except Toyota is the only major car manufacturer in the US. Ford, Chrysler, and GM do manufacture a few cars in the US but ship them over to Europe; the ones sold in the US are all Chinese made and Mexican assembled.Toyotas will not fucking die. Ask Top Gear. Update: Fixed issue #48, fixed possible overflow in outputBuffer Yeah, I don't know what you're paying in kwh either. If its like half as much as everyone else, you can keep mining twice as long (where difficulty is now a unit of time) So when are you going to start selling off the GPU hardware? IMO you should already be selling off the worst hardware, 5830s and such, not sure what you actually have in your farm, do you have a list somewhere? A PGP key only used once. I'm letting the market price that out. It worked for the first half of the shares I bought, so it should work well for the second half. Hey all.Nefario, after stalling for two months, has finally sent me the shareholder lists.According to his list, there are 11589 DMC shares still in the wild, my last count before GLBSE was shutdown was 11909. So, theres 320 that have not been claimed out there in the wild. If you have not submitted a claim, please do so.Oh, and btw, the asset list is still:106 BTC-MINING1000 BTCMC1000 ASICMINERNeither BTC-MINING nor BTCMC have been able to pay back dividends to any shareholders, and both are planning on liquidating and paying that out at some future time. ASICMINER is still hoping to get their hardware before the Chinese New Year and is planning on opening their own exchange just for their assets if necessary. I think I am going to relist DMC on Bitfunder and continue the buyback as I was. Bitfunder is Ukto's exchange, so it should remain stable and sane until at least after the buyback has been completed.Before the shutdown I bought back around half the shares, and I should be able to buy back all of the rest within a year.After that, I want to try relaunching DMC. I think the plan is sound and can work, as long as I don't have the stone of Nefario around my neck dragging me down. But this can't happen until these shares have all been bought back.I'm considering issuing zero coupon non-callable corporate bonds as a registered company, a real legal entity. No more shares, no more dividends, and a maturity time of 5 or 10 years. They will be issued as PGP signed serial numbered documents using a single use PGP key that will be locked in a safe afterwards, thus preventing any possibility of forgeries. The OID will be on the order of equiv to 5% APY.I think the Bitcoin investment community is still ready for a $5-10 million dollar project to come and put Bitcoin on the map. I still think DMC is that project. I know a lot of other people think DMC is still worth pursuing. No, BFL has more experience in making highly efficient popcorn poppers. The highest it goes is 1000. You're better off just killing DiabloMiner while you game. Update: Fixed -g -g is ignored on any pool that explicitly sets expire time or uses longpoll, which is basically every pool. That said, -g should not be broken.Edit: Derp, I broke it because I forgot to change all occurrences of a constant. Never mind my question. Line 264 is the code that handles the parsing for -g.Although, yes, this is technically a bug: what is your command line, because I bet its not right. Time to shit or get off the pot.Post URLs quoting the exact parts of mainland Chinese law that prove your case, otherwise go find some other thread to troll.
Luke, continued trolling can earn you a ban on the forums. Are you sure you really want that? "IT POPS POPCORN!" -- Satoru Iwata, President of Nintendo of Japan Strange. What pool is this? Dear Thread,Shut the hell up or so God help me I will turn this car around.Signed, your favorite angry neighborhood bastard mod I agree with this analysis. I know what I forgot to get at the store! More popcorn! Shit! Luke, what did I tell you about trolling on the forum? Typically at a fab you have multiple customers having their orders processed simultaneously. Some stages of the process do not require immediate processing after the previous stage, some stages can be processed in parallel.Also, some customers pay for faster service and cut ahead of you in line. As far as I can tell, Friedcat is basically saying his order is getting more processing time than it was previously because its nearing completion and there are no high priority jobs ahead of him. Yeah, but ngzhang is just a single guy who isn't doing this as a business or as his job... it may turn into a job in the future, but this is still a side thing for him. Hes willing to license his designs to whoever asks for a small fee (although I don't think he can relicense the SHA256 IP core hes using for Avalon, so you'd still buy the ASICs from him but fab your own boards however you want).Its not about US vs China, its about greed. BFL wants to become a legitimate company so hard that they're pissing off all their potential customers, but with ngzhang, people are throwing money at him because hes proven several times hes legit and delivers and has that whole "its done when its done and not a moment sooner" mentality. Only the ability. A lot of the code was not meant to be modularized, so that was a large PITA. Yeah, killed one of the best jokes the video game industry ever produced. Ironically, it became one of the worst jokes shortly after. Delete your DiabloMiner directory and unpack the zip again, or if you're building from source delete everything in target and run mvn package again. Its already been decided. BFL has failed to produce any SC units at all, and still claim they're coming; they have clearly failed and are in default of their obligations to their investors. As the contract/policy for this insurance stated they must produce these units by the end of Oct 31st and they did not: the fail insurance will pay out.The problem is nefario (owner of GLBSE) refuses to release the shareholder lists to asset issuers, so I can't payout until he does.The entire pool was 38.732 BTC, so the final payout will be 0.00125 BTC per share of fail. I LOVE BOOBIES-- Signed, The Male League to Promote Boobies, 301st Tit Watching Corps No point in using a more expensive controller for the ASIC plus have more limited room and power availability.Easier to just build large scale 2 or 4U boxes dedicated to the task. Seriously? We're going there? Hey friedcat, if you give me one of these, I'll make sure DiabloMiner supports it. It would, but because heat and (lack of) voltage (to prevent more heat, causing stability issues) would become much more apparent on more complex designs. Spartan 6s just make the problem seem a magnitude or two worse than it is. Yes, its just like unrolling loop iterations, but in hardware. You have timing problems because you have one clock pulse per hash and everything needs to arrive into their stages at the right time; if you have traces that are too long or too short then stuff doesn't function correctly or you need to waste more silicon trying to properly synchronize data.It is much easier to just keep data exactly where it needs to be and iteratively process it. I know this is a partial list, but I'm not on it.
Hrm, if friedcat sent me one to keep, I'd get DiabloMiner working with it I bet.  I think you're suggesting that unrolled cores are the answer. They aren't. You run into timing problems, and you also pay for that silicon to be produced no matter how sparse or packed it is. The best option seems to be iterative rolled up cores that take ~110 cycles to do a nonce, but you have ~100 times more cores.Plus, it increases yields as the controller hardware can just test which cores work and ignore known broken ones (ie, intentionally binning parts ala modern GPU design). The problem is there is no useful USB solution for Java. Its not that I don't want to support FPGA/ASIC, its just that I'm so fresh Oracle can suck my nuts. Update: I've modularized the network and device code, so future non-GPU support and future non-SHA256 chains could be supported; also a few bug fixes have slid in as well. ASICs will drive difficulty up so high that GPUs will no longer be profitable Update: Updated dependencies to newest versions. Will there be any way to purchase units using ASICMINER shares? Yeah, I'm the developer of DiabloMiner and one of the first 100 Bitcoin users. Well, I finally decided to get my devcoins.    "balance" : 81873877.00000000,Or, around 175 BTC. Anyone who says FOSS doesn't pay is wrong. pastebin.com is down. I think devcoin should use other pastebins as mirrors as well, just to prevent this from happening again. Since friedcat is probably busy, I can partially fill in for the GLBSE side.nefario still is not complying with requests for shareholder information and, independently, he may or may not be facing prison time for violating financial laws in the UK. Everyone wants his head on a stick, next to pirate's and zhoutong's.Other than that, I expect friedcat is still waiting for his shipment of canned kickass from China. Inaba doesn't qualify to be called a shill: its public hes a BFL employee. BFL is the only company that can afford shills, using all that investor money to do it. Prove you're not a BFL shill by providing an order receipt from a major BFL alternative.The irony here is Theymos could consider what you just said a threat of legal action against himself and preemptively sue you.EDIT: Damn, he got banned. Try a NXZT Hale 90 1000. You can pull 2000w from it for 3 months before it pops (although I seriously do NOT recommend this) See? There it is again. 's does not make plural, it makes possessive. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.If you intended to be taken seriously, I think your subject should have been: "Are ASICs a scam?" That isn't true, btw. eBay also fucks the buyers by allowing sellers who are known to peddle fraud continue to do so; they merely close the seller account, and the seller is free to open another one over and over since they don't ban the actual person even though they claim they do.eBay is bad for everyone, imo. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Enough with the trolling. I'm tired of seeing thread reports for this thread. Next step is I talk to theymos about banning all the BFL shills. I answered your question the first time you asked it.
You should use whichever kernel gets you the best speed. Though, in 3-6 months, I don't think its going to matter. Its already a mess, the question is how big of one is it. Heh, then if GLBSE pays DMC, oh, 10k BTC, that should cover the damages and we wouldn't need to go to court. Jesus Christ.Fine. He gets it for your reason and Theymos's reason both.Someone lock this thread already. So when does goat get a scammer tag for defending nefario? Thats no different than me trusting nefario because Ive known him for like two years, and then his actions destroyed DMC. Not saying your guy will, but watch out. I don't agree with this analysis. Can you confirm that you have DMC's claim of 1000 asicminer on your list? Ahh. 3.3%? HEH LETS GIVE THEYMOS 3.3% OF A SCAMMER TAG, HURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROkay, I think thats out of my system now. Sorry if I wasn't clear: I said Theymos lost the vote. Theymos started the vote because nefario wouldn't listen to the board, the rest of the board decided to keep nefario, Theymos ragequit the board.I don't see why Theymos should actually get a scammer tag, he did everything possible to remove nefario, nefario refused to either leave or stop fucking up, so Theymos washed his hands of it and waved to the Bitanic as it left dock for its maiden voyage. ~23%. Theymos also initiated a vote to remove nefario as CEO, and was outvoted. He then tried to sell his shares in the company because he refused to invest in a company that the CEO refused to listen to the board. Should work fine then. Sounds like coinlab has a bug in their pool software. The API key is in the URL. The URL in SSL _is_ encrypted, but SSL is not 100% secure and there are known attacks against it (although, implementation specific ones). The problem is, if you're using the API keys non-locally (such as on a vps or a dedi), you have a gaping security hole. I'm not comfortable with how GLBSE implemented API keys. API keys are not secure. Yeah, I cant figure out what they do either. If they're offering non-Bitcoin stuff, obviously DM wont support it. Guess username and password, 2fa cannot be done over the API, and there is no read only API. What is coinlab? The situation is complex because all of our assets held are ON glbse. The most important of the two are BTCMC and ASICMINER, and yochdog and friedcat are both trying to figure out how to fix it for their shareholders.An even bigger problem is I need to sell my BTCMC stake, and without GLBSE I can't. That would have provided enough money to buy back around 2/3rds of the shares still out there, the rest could have been mopped up with the upcoming ASICMINER dividends.I think if you look up "nothing has gone right" in the dictionary, DMC will be the example given. So now it all becomes clear.In the end, DMC gets scammed, stolen from, victimized, and now I can't even safely shut it down. No, simply because nefario clearly was not involving the board. He did not follow their orders, he did not communicate with them, and now no one knows why the site is down.I don't blame Theymos for selling his share in GLBSE, its a sinking ship.
nefario apparently has admitted the SEC has already contacted him about Pirate, although I'm not sure if he as done so publicly.Its not that mining went down in value, its that there is more than one case where people "proved" they had mining hardware with lots of photos, and then they either just keep printing bonds for hardware that didn't exist at cheap prices (way below both their IPO price and the current market price) to go invest the money in either Pirate or simply just pocket it and pyramid pay it out until they could buy ASIC hardware cheap (so they end up with both the money (having spent a tiny fraction of it on the ASIC hardware) and then a large part of the AISC output because they didn't issue 100% of the ASIC in bonds, only half or less).The mining part of the market collapsed because of these people. Even on bond issuers that were legit and didn't abuse investors, their prices went down because people were willing to sell the bonds they bought at half what they paid for them because they could buy the same hash power at half of what they threw those bonds out for (so they lost half their investment value but doubled their dividends). I was able to triple the mhash DMC held because of people throwing their bonds out, but the prices crashed so hard that I would have had to increase it 5x or 6x to not lose value. zapeta claimed I didn't do enough due diligence, but there is only so much due diligence you can do with people you've never met. You can claim nefario did do enough to protect investors on his end, and maybe its true, but its not what I believe. Although GLBSE may not be coming back at all (which a lot of people in #bitcoin-assets think), maybe going forwards nefario can force bond issuers to hand over a large sum of BTC for collateral and also put a lock on the number of shares they can issue (as to not exceed the actual hardware) and also require frequent timestamped photos of the hardware. This would have been enough to prevent a lot of the bond issuer abuse. A software update for the launch of GLBSE 3.0 is plausible.... just so is the SEC extraditing him from the UK to stand trial in the US. People on IRC. Yeah, it sees nefario took it down. He claims software update, I wonder if the SEC just arrested him and took the site down. I'm announcing the end of Diablo Mining Company.Although DMC was started to show the world that Bitcoin is ready for large scale business, the actions of several people in our community has proven we're just not ready for this yet.nefario misrepresented his asset vetting process, he misrepresented the legality of GLBSE as a stock exchange, and he misrepresented his ownership of GLBSE. The SEC is now investigating nefario and GLBSE for fraud for his actions over supporting the Pirate scam. Many people have repeatedly requested a scammer tag for nefario and a URL filter for GLBSE links, and this may come to pass because of his actions.Pretty much everything on GLBSE except for maybe 5 assets have proven to be either scams or badly managed, and DMC invested in some of this on good faith and the belief nefario knew what he was doing and had properly vetted them before allowing them on GLBSE. nefario has cost not only the Bitcoin investment community a unique opportunity, but he has tarnished the name of Bitcoin itself.Although I could just reopen DMC on another exchange, nefario's actions has also damaged the DMC name and enticed trolls to attack anyone who DMC has invested in, anyone who has invested in DMC, or anyone even associated with me. Forum drama is not profitable.I am going to put a bid wall up at 0.0666 as money comes in, it will be first come first serve. If you want out before I finish liquidating assets at the very end, I suggest you sell into that wall now. It may take several months to buy everything back. GCN is your hardware, 79xx. GCN does not have that instruction, AMD's OpenCL compiler does the proper thing. Unless you're abusing the X-Is-P2Pool header, there is a timeout. Most pools do not follow the HTTP spec, so there is no way for DM to detect the difference between a malfunctioning pool and a malfunctioning user.Plus, no one should EVER run multiple instances of DM.If the user has added multiple pools, DM will just go to the next pool after a few failed attempts. This assumes ASICs even exist, btw. Although I have my money behind ASICMINER on this one, there is still a chance ALL the ASIC companies are scams. Or we can have a public transparent management board that takes over all decision making from Nefario and serves as our equivalent to the SEC, one that smickles has a permanent position on it, and by permanent I mean we're kidnapping him and chaining him up in the basement. Happy dividend day, Yochdog! Today is the first, the report is going to be late.The short version is:106 BTC-MINING * 0.975 = 103.35 BTC1000 BTCMC * 0.590 = 590.00 BTC1000 ASICMINER * 0.112 = 112 BTC0.572 BTC uninvested805.922 total.11909 shares trading. I think this is the most important thing here. Asset issuers pay 16BTC up front, and every shareholder pays trading fees, to make this service continue functioning.GLBSE has no policy to deal with moving assets off the exchange, and it badly needs one. Imagine if NASDAQ decided to just suddenly delist Facebook with no warning: the SEC would be so far up NASDAQ's ass, they could collectively taste shoe leather. Most important math ever. Based on Nefario's actions with both DMC and Goat's assets, I think maybe it it really is time for nefario to get a scammer tag. Sales are now closed.Final tally:30,903 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail7,829 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.SuccessWe will know in one month if BFL succeeds or not. I think its up to nefario on this one. If he ends up just closing GLBSE and shafting asset creators and shareholders, then its game over. I'm not avoiding the question, you just didn't make clear thats what your question was.To be honest, with our current government, EVERYTHING might be a problem and be illegal in the future. Congress has repeatedly voted against small business owners (the same businesses that employ 60% of this country) and do everything possible to stop innovation and entrepreneurship especially when it comes to technology.I can't hide in fear because Congress is going to come and take my business away on a whip, if I do that, they win. I don't hold any Goat assets, so what hes talking about doesn't apply to me I think.
I was quoting that more for the whole "nefario was fired from intersango" part than the "Americans are fucked" part. I'm crossquoting this from the TYGRR delisting thread Actually, GLBSE is fucked up. When you use the interface to buy back shares, it shows it as a large dividend. 1MHS and ABMO were also delisted this way as well. I have no reason to believe Obsi won't also delist his final asset, HRPT, correctly as well. He has no interest in screwing people, he was just tired of nefario's bullshit. We need a historical chart for https://glbse.com/api/quantity_trading/TICKERGOESHERE Well, if people are stupid enough to be selling it below IPO price, I can't blame him for buying it back at low prices. This seems to be a troll thread.OBSI sold 1MHS shares for 0.10 and bought them back for 0.10, and he also sold ABMO shares for 0.10 and bought them back for 0.10, and he is also in the process of buying back all of HRPT for IPO price.So, if hes such the scammer you claim he is, why is he buying them back at all? Nefario was trolled into believing I was stealing from DMC instead of actually looking at my account and noticing Ive never withdrawn BTC from my DMC subaccount. My GLBSE account has finally been unlocked.DI.BFLSC sales end October 1st, so if you're going to buy in, buy in now.27,403 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail7,829 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Success Most of them were purchased at below 0.07. 0.10. Some other guy is buying them past that, dunno who. Actually, smickles wants to have DMC as his first customer of his accounting firm. Problem is, he won't have shop setup until after the first, so we might have to suffer through my horrible monthly reports one last time. Current DMC holdings:106 BTC-MINING1000 BTCMC1000 ASICMINER86.97 BTCTotal valuation: 835.50 BTC12773 shares outstanding 20909 before the buyout, 12773 after. There is still a standing order for the last ~2000. Except Obsi bought back ABMO back at full IPO price, and is also (or already has) shut down the rest of his assets at no loss to the shareholders. Obsi quit because he didn't like how nefario handled DMC. He believed somehow I was stealing funds from DMC, at least, this is what he said. Problem with that is, he can look right at my account and see if I've withdrawn BTC or not. nefario emailed me and said my account is now unlocked and also the one guy that he found that would do the audit backed out.So, after an almost month long trip, we're exactly back to where we originally were.Also, ABMO has shut down and has paid out a final dividend of 0.1 per share. Its sad to see Obsi go, but nefario's actions chased him off.Current DMC holdings:54 BTC-MINING951 BTCMC949.53 BTC. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Luke, what did I tell you about trolling the noobs? Cut it out before one of the admins decide to either scammer/troll tag you or ban you. Jesus. Those VRMs AMD uses are usually safe up to 120c for 24/7 usage (the same way GPUs are safe up to 85c for 24/7 usage), hes really trashing them. Also 90% fan? More like dead fan. I think consumer/prosumer/enthusiast watercooling is pointless. That said, there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have a full block on there that covers everything: gpu, memory, and VRMs. If there are any chips exposed at all and they dont have normal air cooled heatsinks with a fan blowing on them, you have a problem. Unless your card has a really retarded heatsink setup, 74c is fine, I wasn't having issues until I was >80c for 8 hours at a whack.
Wow, I wonder if your VRMs are overheating. My 7970 sometimes overheats to the point that the machine hangs on boot at 1125 on really hot days, so maybe thats what happened with you. Yes, but right now we have an entirely different problem to deal with. Dunno if anyone thats subscribed to the DMC thread reads the rest of the Securities forum, but nefario not only has failed to unlock my account so I can run DMC, but hes also chased goat off GLBSE and is threatening the same to other assets.The control of GLBSE needs to be turned over to an impartial board that treats asset issuers fairly, and until this happens I'm not sure exactly what I can do in the short term. I'm still going to fight for DMC however I can, but as I see it, nefario has hostages: my shareholders. Etching isn't done by hand. This is an entirely automated process. Features on these chips are thinner than a human hair. Its _kind of_ similar to etching a plate, but its really difficult. Its not as slow as you think once the wafers are actually being processed, its the whole lead up to that part of the process that takes time.From the end of tape out to slapping the chips on circuit boards is about a 3 month process for most people on small runs on large node sizes (>=65nm) depending on the fab. As long as friedcat gets these all done before the Chinese New Year, we're fine. The hardest step once you have the design finished is "tape out", where they produce the lithography mask for chip production. This takes awhile and must be triple checked by both friedcat's people and the fab. Then, he has to wait about a month for his slot in the queue at the fab to come up, then the fab produces the chips and then (optionally) shoves them in a package (the metal or plastic thing with pins sticking out that you call a chip; the actual circuit is inside of that). Now you're just trolling. The GLBSE software does not produce a complete csv, and nefario has yet to unlock my account. I asked nefario to ask smickles to be one of the three auditors, but he didn't do so.I'll probably ask smickles to do it someday, but not now. I just want my account back before nefario costs us even more dividends. nefario backed out on the audit because he couldn't find enough people who knew what they were doing to do it. Your math is extremely faulty. A sockpuppet claiming I have sockpuppets? Oh the irony.As mentioned several times in this thread, nefario locked my account... so how could I vote for myself (using all 40 shares of mine) if my account is locked? You make no sense. "Times"? People can only vote once, and nefario decided that I wouldn't be allowed to vote even though I am also a shareholder.All of the assets held have been posted already.And claiming no one values ABMO is not an accurate statement. ABMO's IPO has not finished yet, thus there is no demand to produce bids. Except you misunderstood. I use the lowest ask instead of the highest bid. I didn't say what I'm asking for it. The market still sets the price, and until nefario fixes market liquidity, thats the only way to price assets that doesn't involve half the assets on the market being priced at zero. Look at the final outcome of motion 127: the shareholders are not and never were upset. This is something nefario did to... do... something. I mean, he claims he wasn't planning on running off with the DMC assets and fuck DMC shareholder; so what was he actually trying to achieve? Whatever it was, it wasn't in the best interest of DMC shareholders or the community at large. This is why even nefario calls you a troll.Due to GLBSE's habitual lack of good (or sometimes any) bids across almost every asset, people use asks instead of bids to measure book value. I traded ASICMINER into OBSI.ABMO for 1:2 ABMO shares which....1: Provided ABMO with half the ASICMINER shares it has, which....2: Combined with the trade of OBSI.1MHS, DMC is around 50% of ABMO, and....3: Obsi also traded his own ASICMINER into ABMO and purchased a few more which is the other half of ABMO's ASICMINER shares, which...4: Means DMC's half of ABMO is now backed by around the same number of ASICMINER shares it traded into ABMO, which....5: Means we get paid not only the original ASICMINER dividends we would have had anyhow, ...6: We get paid dividends now on ABMO's existing ABMO hardware and....7: Future dividends on BFL SC upgrades are also ours and...8: ASICMINER at the time was around 0.10, two shares of ABMO at the time were 0.20, thus we doubled the book value of the investment, and...9: This insulates from the risk of ASICMINER somewhat.tl;dr: We doubled book value of the asset, added short term profits, possibly doubled long term profits (maybe even tripled), and became nearly majority owner in ABMO. Motion 127 is now closed.Voted Yea:4775Voted Nay:10141Nefario failed to gain his needed 66% of the votes to pass his motion. I remain CEO. I said no because we need accountants that are well known and have good standings in the community, plus have to be agreed on by me, nefario, and the shareholders.No one knows your wife, and you certainly don't have a good standing in the community that she can borrow. Today is the 23rd. Time flies.Everyone who hasn't voted no on the motion, please go do that now.https://glbse.com/vote/view/127 Seems usagi forgot to inform this thread.nefario has pushed the date for motion 127 to the 23rd. The original date (18th?) already passed, and he pushed it back to the 23rd in the final hours of the vote. Only nefario knows what the final tally was.In addition, nefario has been unable to get two other people audit DMC's records, and refuses to name the one person doing it. What I do know, that one person he did get is not smickles, the community's only accountant. Since nefario refuses to name the auditor ahead of time, shareholders do not get to vote on the confirmation Also, I've spoken with smickles, hes very interested in taking DMC on as his first client with his new accounting firm, although because hes in the middle of moving, the September report on Oct 1st will either be done by him and be late or be done by me for the last time and be on time. Most != high current. Here in the US we have "lamp cord" which is just enough to run a lamp or some other low wattage device, and high current devices use lower gauge (== thicker) wiring. I think its 14 AWG for low wattage, 12 AWG for higher current, and 10 AWG for 20amp or 208v or 240v (dryers, ovens, etc), but I might be wrong.BTW, a lot of devices are using universal IEC 60320 plugs on the device side: C5 and C7 (2.5a, grounded and ungrounded respectively) are common on laptops, DVD players, some LCD monitors, etc; C13 (15a) is the plug thats on computer power supplies, and C19 (20a) is the enterprise high amp version of C13.1800w is as high as you can go for temporary usage in the US (there are toasters and blenders and electric water kettles this high). Everything else seems to max out at 1400, and you don't see quality computer PSU's above 1200w. 1000-1100w continuous usage/1200w peak, is low enough that you can plug two into a 120v 20a line for rack mounting. I've never seen 20a installed anywhere here in the US unless it was specifically requested... unless everyone has been installing 20a circuits and not installing the 20a plugs with the T shaped blade (NEMA 5-20) to go with them.
Euro 230v seems to be 20a sockets the same as the average American home has 120v 15a. I knew I should I have bought that giant red USB button they had on ThinkGeek. qft. Its not that I refused, I would have loved to have been the technical cofounder of this and let someone else take on the full time job of Chief Ego Officer, but the community simply doesn't have such people, and there have been wildly successful businesses that have been ran by technical solo founders.The community is going to have to figure out how to run a successful company, but destroying DMC in the name of greed isn't going to help things.  See, I said it was a red herring, and you just demonstrated why. Don't worry, I fell for this early on too.Let me repeat something, the electricity costs USD no matter what. If electricity is our largest operating cost, it doesn't matter if it costs thousands of dollars or dozens of Bitcoins... if I can cut that the whole way down to 1/5th of it, we save thousands, or we save dozens. That operating cost doesn't go away because we calculated the math in a different currency.BTC prices since its inception have been rather random. Without an actual economy to back Bitcoin, it will continue to be unstable. Your example of BTC doubling is just as possible as BTC halving. We pay electricity in dollars, hell, we pay every cost in dollars, it simply doesn't matter what the price of BTC is now or what it will be in the future, we must pay those costs. Yes, that does not include maintenance costs.Dragging BTC/USD exchange prices into this is a red herring. It doesn't matter what the price of BTC is because the power company charges us in USD. Power usage is the largest operating cost of a data center, more so than anything else by a huge margin, and this operating cost can only be measured in USD.Solar power, as I demonstrated, can reduce this operational cost by up to 1/5th. Let me repeat what I just said: our largest operational cost, a smart investment early on can reduce this to 1/5th. This is an economically driven decision, and it is not a tiny return on investment whatsoever.Insurance cannot be applied solely to the solar panels, such insurance would apply to everything, and would be a separate operational cost, thus obviously not included here in these calculations.Additionally, small scale solar panel installations are surprisingly low maintenance if they don't have sun trackers (no moving parts). Maintenance will obviously only cost a fraction of what we paid for the panels no matter how difficult the maintenance is. Nefario just got done explaining on IRC that the audit is already in process.

Not only do you not get to vote on who the auditors will be, nefario will not even say who they are. The report may not even be released until AFTER the vote. He also refused to answer the question if smickles would be allowed to be one of the auditors (one of the few people I trust to fairly look at corporate financials).What gives, nefario? You claim I haven't been transparent enough, and you turn around and do worse? Here in Maine, since I moved here 23 years ago, power prices per kwh have doubled while my kwh monthly usage has decreased. My entire bill is not kwh, so my overall bill hasn't doubled; but compared to USD inflation, USD has not inflated that quickly (only 85%).I've done some of the calculations for solar earlier in the thread and in the op: it costs about $700 per 1kw of panel installed which produces 1200kwh actual per year in Maine. According to the EPA's Electric Power Monthly report*, commercial electricity is 10.76 cents a kwh, industrial 7.49 cents a kwh; these are retail prices include distribution/transmission overhead (for example, I pay 0.071 per kwh from the supplier, 0.068 per kwh for the distribution, 0.023 for the transmission, for a total of 0.162 cents per kwh for residential, which is actually a tad higher than the EPA's report). Maine pays net energy billing for facilities 660kw or less with a rolling 12 month window, plus I can resell power back to them at wholesale rates (a little less than than the 0.071 cents/kwh from the supplier in my above example) for anything over that.Now, that cap is 660kw not 660kwh. As in, I could install 660kw panels of panels and generate 792Mwh a year of power and pay effectively $0** to Bangor Hydro, our local power company, for the first 792Mwh of usage of the year.792Mwh would cost me (assuming a commercial rate instead of industrial, I'm not sure what the minimum is to get into industrial) $85,219. 660kw of panels would cost $462,000 to install, or only a little under 6 years at current rates. These panels will last about 30 years give or take, so at today's rates that is $2.556 million dollars of electricity for an up front cost of $462,000, or about 5.5 times cheaper power. The same numbers for industrial are $1.779 million, or 3.8x cheaper.To further run the numbers, 792Mwh a year, 22kw per rack maximum usage including cooling, that is 4 racks fully loaded at 24/7 max power usage, or about 8-16 loaded more conventionally.Edit: $700 per 1kw does not include single/multi-axis tracking systems. Here in Maine they tend to not be worth it, although because panels are getting smaller/energy densities are getting higher, they may be worth it in the future.* http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_06_a** not sure how the taxes work here, but thats around 4% of the bill Ask your parents what they used to pay for electricity before you were born. It was much lower than what they pay now.The prices are only going to continue going up, and there is no indication this will stop. The market is already heavily regulated and power companies are operated as state sponsored legal monopolies.Its been part of the plan since the beginning. If you don't like it, then don't invest. Where? There would be at least as much space for two or three dozen racks, and we'd be aiming at high density computing.Not all racks are created equal, many data centers are equipped to handle only 2 to 4 kw of gear in a rack, we'd be at 25-30kw of gear per rack. People are paying $20-30k/mo per rack space for high density computing, were as a sparsely populated rack 2kw would only go for $1k/mo, sometimes less if you find a really good deal.Now, if I can get a suitable building cheaply and can be renovated for our needs? That could be a lot more than just three dozen racks. Thats not true. Even here in Maine, (at today's power prices) solar panels will last around 30 years and hit ROI in 15 through resale at retail electricity prices alone; commercial and industrial power prices are still higher than retail, so if we consume most of are electricity that way the ROI is higher.Now, see where I said "at today's power prices"? Prices will only go up. We can pay an upfront price now in a large lump sum, or we can pay several times that over the next 30 years. You call it substitution of cost, I call it massive reduction in cost. The largest cost of a data center is power, which I've dealt with in two ways.The first is obviously the green power, the second is the fact that we are so north and that are summers are so mild that we won't need 24/7/365 HVAC. I've done preliminary cost analysis on a water chilled in row cooling system using a larger than needed water tower for external heat exchange plus large scale air economization, we'll use a lot less power than, say, building it in MD/DC/VA or SoCA/AZ/NM/TX like a lot of DCs are being built, even if you account for better solar coverage than Maine. Anyone see this?http://gigaom.com/cleantech/behold-apples-massive-solar-farm-from-the-sky-photos/That is Apple's solar farm powered data center facility. They have one, so why can't Bitcoin? I brought this up earlier, but no one cared. A lot of people traded assets with DMC, a lot of people probably do not want their names released.Even if you blank all their names out, it gives an improper view of what really happened. Let the motion be later. It all depends on nefario here.If the current motion passes no, then I remain as CEO, and the plan continues.If the current motion pass yes, the assets will have to be written off and replaced, then that sets the plan back about a year, and we need to make other arrangements to pay shareholders. I'm hostile towards anyone who is trying to harm shareholders. If nefario wins, then not only does DMC lose, but so does every single asset on GLBSE. DMC can be successful no matter what nefario does, but even if DMC is successful this doesn't mean shareholders are unharmed.As I said before, if nefario succeeds, then shareholders cannot be paid dividends because I will not send one more BTC to GLBSE and nefario will refuse to release a list of shareholders and their number of shares. You think I'm not showing my shareholders what they need? They need a leader who will protect their interest in the company, they need a leader who will follow the plan and not destroy the wealth of assets that has been built to make this plan happen.Why do you think I've been in talks with building business relationships not only with other major Bitcoin companies, but also with companies in the ISP industry? Because I believe in the plan. It is financially sound, and it can be the thing Bitcoin needs to show the world we're serious about what we're doing. We can do this. Except I never mismanaged it. I may have not always been able to turn a profit, but I haven't mismanaged it. a) Nope.b) Lost? Not quite. Get screwed on fixed mhash bonds? Yes, I will admit that was not one of my finer moments.c) Withholding? No. Withholding the good news until the ink is dry? Yes. Plus, it has no monetary value until we have customers.d) Largest? Nope. Second largest? Possibly. What you and nefario both have said do not make your case look good, he has clearly said he will look for a new CEO, and you "warned" me that if I didn't do what you said something would happen in the near future. Is it just a coincidence such a thing happened? The text you quoted is NOT in the contract. I have not violated the contract as stated on GLBSE.I do have a responsibility to my shareholders to act in their interest: investing in assets that I believe will massively appreciate in value over the coming months is acting in their interest. Just because asicminer and abmo are both worth around 0.10 BTC now doesn't that their combined value and dividends paid cannot be ten times that or more over the next year.This is how investing works: you buy at the bottom, you sell at the top.
I also want that text added to DMC's contract to prevent future interference from non-shareholders. Not a bug. I put 0 in that field, and nefario agreed to that, as did every shareholder. To make sure everyone sees nefario's motionhttps://glbse.com/vote/view/127Click NO if you believe that I should remain CEO of Diablo Mining Company. You forgot the part where nefario signed off on this contract when I opened the IPO to begin with, and every investor agreed to this contract when they invested. So whats the Fifth Amendment for? Guilty until proven innocent. I wasn't aware GLBSE was hosted in Soviet Russia. DiabloMiner won't switch if the pool is still up. As long as your pool never goes down, you don't have an issue.-p first,xxx works for most peopleDiabloMiner will never support fpga or asic mining unless someone makes raw USB access not suck in Java. If you want that, use cgminer, it's essentially DiabloMiner ported to C. How have I breached the contract? Just saying "because I said so" or "because nefario said so" doesn't make it true. How did I breach the contract?Also, I refuse to release the records because I do not have permission from every person I've traded with to release said information. Just because they traded with me does not mean their privacy should be violated because nefario wants to exceed his authority. DiabloMiner switches pools after about 15 seconds or immediately if connection is refused.100 minutes was chosen because it is optimal as it is the average length of downtime spent on unplanned maintenance inside of a data center.Pools that don't use passwords allow anything in the password field. Wrong asset and 0% to pass means already passed. I object to a puppet account uninspiringly named puppet who has less than 100 posts and is not even a month old and frequently trolls in threads elsewhere on the forum. I object to nefario trying to destroy DMC based on rumors and without shareholder approval. I would not pay out until October 31st, I would only halt share sales. The same goes for if BFL shipped today, share sales also halt. I have never claimed to have a personal portfolio. I only have one account. I only own shares in DMC. When I said I put all the money I have into DMC, I wasn't kidding. Several shareholders have already asked for the motion to keep me to be put up now, nefario refuses to do this. Why expect nefario to do anything else? Not at all. I am going ahead with the dedicated server and cloud service sales if I can. The plan was structured in a way that if any single revenue stream is damaged, the company survives through the others.No BTC from DMC has gone into the web hosting service project, and until this is up and running and people could order services, I was not going to mention it officially to shareholders. usagi, rapeghost, and several others were aware of it unofficially.The dedi side of the sales could easily be a 2-3 BTC profit (half of that going to shareholders) per customer.  15-20 customers could double dividends, and I think the market could be several times bigger than that. I invested them in companies that I believe can return the most value. I believe our investment in ABMO and ASICMINER is sound. Although the fixed mhash bond fiasco wiped out some of our money, this does not change the end goal, it just means we will take a little longer to get there.I believe in DMC, and I've invested my own money into this alongside everyone else's because I believe. I will continue trying to make this a reality no matter what hardship occurs, this is what it means to believe in something. When I talked to Obsi yesterday, he sure as hell didn't believe you've made up your differences.  You told me you didn't want to take DMC's asset management on because I held OBSI.ABMO.So are you saying you misspoke or that I am remembering it wrong? If that wasn't your reason, why did you tell me that, and what was your real reason? I believe my shareholders have a right to know. The only thing I will agree to is scammer tags for all of nefario's and usagi's forum accounts.Unless nefario backs down and apologizes to DMC's shareholders, there is nothing for the shareholders to move forwards to. The money is gone forever. Even if the shareholders vote to retain me as CEO, nefario will just change the motion to say otherwise and liquidate the assets at any price he sees fit.If shareholders believe in the DMC plan and wish to see it completed, then they will do everything possible to make nefario return the stolen assets. Voting on the motion isn't enough.
You admitted in privmsg on IRC about a week or two ago that if I didn't do exactly what you said that you'd do something, although you wouldn't say what. I thought you were just drunk or high, so I ignored it.Now I know why you were trying to stall negotiations of you taking over asset management for DMC, you were already planning this entire thing with nefario. You claimed it was because you didn't like the fact I owned half of OBSI.ABMO (which you later said, in public*, Obsi was a scammer on #bitcoin-assets, and Obsi is a well respected member of this community).Where does the bullshit end? Are you going to claim BTC-Mining and Yochdog are scammers too? Or friedcat? Anyone who I've ever invested in? Where does it end?* Shares were to be stop being sold the second it becomes October 1st. If BFL were to announce they failed before then, sales would have been halted as well.Because of nefario, if BFL were to announce their failure, I cannot halt sales.First we had zhou tong, then we had pirate, now we have nefario. Does this shit ever end? Yet I personally told you months ago on IRC that the PPTs should be shut down, and you did nothing, yet DMC continues to turn a profit for shareholders and you lock my account? Thats insane.Yet you refuse to open this fake motion of yours and are already conspiring to put usagi in as the new CEO against shareholder wishes? You have already irreparably harmed the company: the only one that needs to be investigated is you.You have cost the Bitcoin investing community a chance to show the outside world that we're ready for major investors. This may have been our only chance to do so. You blew it because of your greed.If anyone out there still has DMC shares, I suggest you sell them for whatever you can sell them for, you're unlikely to ever see your investment returned unless nefario, like pirate and bitcoinica, returns it. Please note: nefario has locked my GLBSE account and most likely stolen the backing money of the insurance fund. Until this is resolved, do not buy any more shares of DI.BFLSC. As I said in my response to nefario, I am announcing ahead of time that DMC will be dealing with the data center part of the plan top down instead of bottom up, and we will begin selling dedicated server and cloud services soon.There is nothing to include on the report yet, and no BTC has been transfered out of GLBSE to support the dedi/cloud service sales. Everything involved with this is coming out of my own pocket.Accusing me of theft is no different than saying "I know what you are, but what am I?" like a child in kindergarten; shilling for nefario is not going to help his case. I swapped shares for other companies on a ~1BTC to 1BTC basis. Do not confuse this with when I sold fixed mhash bonds at a loss to prevent bond issuers from further destroying DMC's asset value by turning fixed mhash bonds into their own personal ponzi schemes.nefario continues to refuse to investigate bond issuers. He has not suspended trading. People are free to buy and sell DMC. What he has done is locked my GLBSE account, thus preventing me from managing DMC assets and paying dividends. What I want to see is how nefario is going to steal other assets that belong to DMC. Is he going to call up companies we do business with and demand that they play along with this farce and hand stuff over? GLBSE is not a law enforcement agency and has no authority to do this. I do not maintain a personal portfolio. The only shares of anything on GLBSE I own is DMC itself. But notice it went back into the company. It did not go into my pocket.If nefario does decide to go ahead with the asset theft, I lose my money along with everyone else. I have made zero profit from DMC. Even the dividends from my own shares, which I purchased with my own money, have only gone back into the company to buy more shares. DMC did not have the money to purchase them, and usagi wanted to swap them at the then current rate. If I am right about their true value, then by the time DMC could afford to buy that many they would have already gone up in value. In other words, instead of trading a few thousand shares of DMC for tens of thousands of BTCs worth of assets and dividends, we would have a tiny fraction of that and no dividends to show for it. I swapped shares based on current or future value. 1 BTC for 1 BTC. No such swap happened. What I did swap was a 10:1 swap for ASICMINER he held because I believe ASICMINER is worth more than 0.1 in the long run, maybe over 10 BTC including dividends. I have since traded my Obsi.1mhs for 1:1 ABMO and ASICMINER for 2:1 ABMO to become owner of half of ABMO while retaining most of the future ASICMINER profit.As for GLBSE assets, I have already provided an up to date list. As for non-GLBSE assets, I have already announced the dedi/cloud deal.About, oh, two months ago many of the fixed mhash bond issuers decided to issue more bonds selling into their bid walls knowing that they would make hundreds or maybe thousands of BTC.... in a pyramid schemey sort of way, they would continue paying dividends out of this new money and buy an ASIC rig to cover future dividends at a fraction of what they sold the bonds for. In the end, they still keep most of the BTC they scooped up out of the bid wall. They plunged fixed mhash bonds from the 0.30s down to the 0.10s.Although I doubled the number of mhash that backed DMC shares during this time, I realized what they were doing and sold or traded my 1mh bonds away as fast as possible. Instead of a 3000 BTC loss (the majority of what we held was fixed mh bonds from many issuers), it was 1000 BTC loss.The only person before this post who I have spoken with about this is usagi, and he thinks I am correct. I have not requested scammer tags for any fixed mhash bond issuer because I do not have sufficient proof of this to make it stick. To make it clear, Obsi was not one of these crooked issuers. He purchased back Obsi.1mhs at IPO price then reissued it at a fraction of that to prevent bondholder losses. We are not looking to sell ABMO. The current ask is 0.1. Nefario does not represent Diablo Mining Company nor our shareholders. We are not considering the sale of BTCMC anytime soon. No, this is misinformation being spread by nefario. I do not have other GLBSE accounts, and he has also locked my own private shares I have purchased with my own money thus I cannot vote. Nefario has just announced that he has misappropriated almost 1600 BTC in assets from Diablo Mining Company claiming that shareholders have said I have violated my contract with all of you. The good news is, he cannot remove me as founder of Diablo Mining Company, nor misappropriate assets or sources of income not held at GLBSE.I officially request Nefario unlock the Diablo Mining Company account and also return any misappropriated assets. Nefario does not represent Diablo Mining company nor any shareholders of Diablo Mining Company. Diablo Mining Company has hired GLBSE to act as an exchange and broker for Diablo Mining Company shareholders.Diablo Mining Company currently holds on GLBSE:54 BTC-MINING, currently valued 53.78 BTC951 BTCMC, currently valued 561.08 BTC9290 OBSI.ABMO, currently valued 929.00 BTCFrom this 1543.86 BTC in assets. BTCMC pays approximately 15 BTC a month, ABMO pays a little over 10 BTC a week, BTC-MINING pays a half a BTC a week. I expect any dividends issued by assets held by Diablo Mining Company to also be returned. Diablo Mining Company has been in negotiations with CPA to insure shareholder assets both on and off GLBSE and with Nyan for continued asset management for the assets on GLBSE. As part of these negotiations, I have agreed to reverse the motion on the cessation of dividends for three months and pay the dividends for August 2012. Nefario's actions have delayed these negotiations. As of this time, I cannot login into Diablo Mining Company's GLBSE account. Even if I could, I cannot verify who owns shares of this company or how many they hold, Nefario refuses to release this information to me. Until Nefario releases this repeatedly requested information, I cannot pay dividends to shareholders. Dividends generated from non-GLBSE assets and sales will be held until Diablo Mining Company can reliably transfer them to shareholders.I have worked hard to make sure this company succeeds in our mission. Diablo Mining Company, since it's inception, has had a three part plan: profit from Bitcoin mining, focus on the high density computing and data warehousing market through building our own data center, and invest heavily in renewable green energy to offset our own usage and also sell it back to the grid. In this, I would like to make an announcement, and I wish I could make this announcement under better circumstances: Diablo Mining Company shall soon be offering dedicated server and cloud hosting, beginning our work on the second part of our plan. Although the data center part of the plan was originally written to be "bottom up" instead of "top down" to enter the market, this shall put us closer to our goal.I promise that I will do everything possible to force Nefario to return the assets, but in the event that this does not happen, Diablo Mining Company will continue moving forwards. I know I have the support of the community and my shareholders on this, and I'd like to thank you all for that.Edit: And yes, I am giving Nefario a chance to fix this. He made a mistake, and unlike some people, I am giving him a chance. If he does not return the assets, I will be requesting that theymos add a scammer tag to all of his forum accounts. I am not making this request for a few days as to give Nefario ample chance to apologize to DMC shareholders. Well, since Pirate decided not to pay out his final week....  This is why no one takes you seriously. Why would I steal 50 BTC from DMC when I could legitimately make tens of thousands of BTC a year as my normal salary once DMC is generating enough to afford me as an employee? You make no sense.
Interesting. I'd recommend every OSX user upgrade to Mountain Lion, but GPU mining is kinda dead anyhow now that ASIC is going to blow difficulty up in the next 3-4 months. Sans a small trade with Obsi for more ABMO, market conditions changing accounts for most of that. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Enough about GLBSE. Go take it up in the GLBSE thread. Yes, and as of now DMC's assets are worth 1407.74 BTC and shares outstanding count is unchanged. Thats a 154.58 BTC difference. Problem is three fold. First, 2FA enabled does not require 2FA for every action, you have to click ALL the boxes to do this. Second, there is no 2FA option for buying/selling, only transferring assets between GLBSE accounts and withdrawing BTC and password changing and logging in, thus flash crashes using your assets is still possible. Third, GLBSE can (but doesn't) set cookies for session only, which means closing the browser clears the session cookies, but you should manually log out anyhow so this is the least problematic of the three.I have brought this up with nefario before, he has not fixed it yet. Nowhere. Assets were purchased, the market value of the assets plummeted due to market factors. Asking the same question over and over is not going to get a different answer. No, I'm saying you continue to troll this thread. You must have a reason for it, and I think that reason is you're trying to make money from DMC somehow. I think you deserve a scammer tag for your effort. Thank you for admitting you've been trolling potential investors away. So, what was your angle? You were going to buy a lot of DMC when it went cheap? Thats pretty dirty, dude.If anyone needs a scammer tag, its you. The majority of shares are held by two people. Neither of them are having problems with how I do business. So, exactly, where do you think you're going with this? If "us" includes you and EskimoBob? Yes. This thread is for people who think Bitcoin and DMC are worth our time, not people who think trolling is the best thing since sliced bread. You're cluttering up the thread with your bullshit, go start an anti-DMC thread if you think trolling DMC is the best use of your time. You lost me. I would like to remind people that my nick is Diablo-D3, it has nothing to do with the game, it predates Blizzard Entertainment, Co, it has been in use since 1991, and I don't particularly care for the game series. Except thats bullshit. Miners like DiabloMiner use 3 works concurrently per GPU. There is no reason to think you cannot do the same per ASIC. Wasn't me. I'm not planning on doing buyback during the three month dividend suspension, but this isn't set in stone. This is the line you're looking for: Thats another problem: GLBSE does not email you when you have new GLBSE mail. Nor does GLBSE let you mail a list of people, nor does GLBSE even tell me who my shareholders are.Right now, the only way to get up to date information about DMC is to set this thread to notify and have Bitcointalk email you on thread notify, or to sit in #bitcoin-assets on Freenode.You and I are not the only people who wish there was a better system. If Wall Street was like GLBSE, Wall Street would have collapsed under its own weight by now. I think you've confused two things. I require approximately 100 mhash in other people's assets to trade for 1 DMC now. This does not state there is 100 mhash per share. I've repeatedly asked nefario to have GLBSE email users when a motion to vote on is available, and he hasn't added it yet. The only way to find out is to go to the motions page (linked in the nav bar at the top) to see if any are open. Its kind of shitty. The motion was public and half of eligible shares voted almost unanimously to suspend dividends. This was public and advertised.

The bond trading chart is available at http://caspar.adterrasperaspera.com/dmc/trade/There has been a 2.3x increase of mhash per share and a 16x increase of total mhash since last month.The motion to suspend dividend payouts for 3 months was passed. Unless another motion is passed to continue the suspension of dividends, the next dividend payment will be December 1st for the month of November. I am not going to publicly state the information I know, but I can tell you this: that isn't an issue. The contract does not say it is a mining company, it only structures the pay out of profits as dividends. Currently, all of our profits are from our investments in other GLBSE assets, this will not be true in the future.As for BTCMC, lemme go write the report. Nefario seems to be very busy in real life and is out of his country, so he might not be heard from for a few days. Happy dividend day!Running late today, yochdog? Rougly 2500 BTC have been invested. The assets are worth roughly half that now.DMC is not a mining fund or a mining bond, it is a long term investment project. Individual mhash are now worth about 0.003 BTC each, where they were worth about 0.35 when I started DMC. That is a 116x drop in value. DMC has not dropped 116x in share price, it has only dropped about 15x.Now, either you go the p4man/eskimobob route and claim either I have control over GLBSE pricing of other people's assets (which I don't, and that would be absurd), or you can accept that I'm trying to make the best of a bad situation. This is a short term problem, and this does not effect DMC's long term plans. No, I didn't say withhold information, I said recycle dividends.The information is still going to released on the original dividend cycle: not until BTCMC pays on the first. BTCMC pays once a month and happens to pay on the same day I pay. Thats almost as fast as what a 5870 should be without bfi_int, so OSX is slowly catching up to the real world. You missed it.As for the numbers, the report is coming out later today. I misspoke, it should be about 1275 at current market panic prices. DMC holds almost 2000 BTC worth of assets. Whats your point? You missed the motion that was passed on this issue? I got the same crap too from the same user.232 new messages.Nefario, do me a favor and fix my inbox. I hate to break it to you, but thats sorta how business investments work. There is no overnight get quick rich quick scheme, you can only get rich slowly.Look at Bitcoinica, a get rich quick scheme, it imploded and the owner ran off with 50k BTC (worth a quarter of a million at the time, prices have gone up since then). Now, look at Pirate, he ran off with 40k BTC worth almost half a million at today's prices. Now look at me, now look back at Pirate. Pirate isn't me, but with Old Spice he could be a real investment like me. Quick, hes doing that thing people hate, now look back at me: I'm on a horse. The section you quoted about the hardware: DMC is pursuing technology that gives the best performance per dollar: our largest holding is in ASICMINER, the rest of our holdings are upgrading their BFL hardware to SC singles and rigs. We may not host any of it ourselves yet, but it does not negate the existence of the investments.Potential investors are lead to believe that DMC will complete the plan. DMC will complete the plan. Due to the unfortunately slow pace of the market post-Bitcoinica, most of the funding that DMC would have received is gone, and it most likely will never return to the market. If I was incompetent as you seem to claim, I would not be pursuing future plans after the first generation build out, nor would I be pursuing alternate ways of completing the plan as written.Green power is a future revenue stream. You seem to think once we install a quarter of a million dollars worth of solar panels and/or wind turbines, we're done? Nope. We keep building. Same with the data center: back when the plan was written, being the biggest single miner in the world would take half a dozen to a dozen racks full of gear, but now it only takes one. Our small data center would have at least two or three dozen racks, the rest of them will obviously be leased out for high density computing customers, thus also becoming a future revenue stream.Because ASIC is now a real thing, mining itself is quickly becoming far less profitable than it was when the plan was originally drawn up. Mining is still important to the plan, but the plan was always three pronged; the other two prongs are just now much more prominent than they originally were.I will continue to do everything in my power to maintain shareholder value in DMC. DMC is not a bond to begin with, it is a share. It is also not purely mining, the plan itself includes green energy production and sales and data center space leasing, neither of which are mining. Yes, DMC invests in other companies through there shares and bonds. Those companies use a mixture of GPU and FPGA and soon to be ASIC. I have not sold bonds for much lower than 1 BTC, trades have been focused on what I valued the assets being traded in as.Yes, I bought back some shares in August.ASICMiner is a share, not a bond. Please read the ASICMiner prospectus on further details on how thats going to work; I trust friedcat will make good on his word no matter if ASICMiner's ASICs worked as planned or not. NAV is reported once a month, and has been since the beginning. You're the only one here calling them fixed. ASICMINER is not a fixed mining bond. No, I approximate mh. This is the number people currently care about to compare the mining assets DMC holds. I've explained this multiple times in the thread already. The market is falling apart because ASICMiner is the new religious deity of the week. The investments haven't gone anywhere, the market no longer values anything involved with mining at all at such a high value.I'll release the full report tomorrow, but the short of it is theres 20909 shares out and we hold 134920 mhash in assets, giving us 6.452 mhash per share. That means over 16x more mhash total and 2.2x more mhash per share. This does not include BTCMC's payment for this month either. Nope, not doing weekly reports.
It can ONLY if 2fa is enabled for everything as the attacker cannot guess the 2fa sequence. GLBSE does not yet offer 2fa for everything, just almost everything. You should always use the newest Catalyst and not install an SDK on top. You're also talking a 1% change, thats the margin of error of measurement from different Catalyst versions. The bug is in the proxy, most proxies screw up "long poll" type connections, but you usually see it only in ajax webapps. You can ignore the error, but I suggest you don't use a proxy. I've asked this feature from nefario repeatedly for DMC, but it hasn't materialized yet. Maybe if both DMC and ASICMiner asks? You want a told you so? If a website has 2FA of any kind, USE IT. PERIOD. DOUBLY SO IF IT IS A FINANCIAL WEBSITE LIKE GLBSE.I have no clue why the fuck people think this is optional. I've asked nefario to mandate it to use GLBSE, but he gets all bitchy about it. Banks frequently do it (especially in Europe), so why not GLBSE? Just fucking do it. Yes, but ASIC production costs dollars not BTC. If BTC were to drop to, say, $1 right now, ASICMINER would be up shits creek. I voted yes on the measure with DMC's shares to make sure ASICMINER succeeds.BTW, Friedcat? Hurry up with the BTC sales so we can get this shit in gear. I don't want to have to vote yes on another motion to deal with BTC price drops. Actually, I'm interested in this. Lets say BTCMC has the money to upgrade all the BFL hardware, and BFL isn't lying about specs. What will the mh/share be after upgrade? Delicious free mhash, om nom nom nom. This. "." is always in your path in Windows. Use cmd.exe Its a command line app. I never said it was a bond.Nope, this is what ASICMINER is paying on it.0.15 is 4% of 1? notsureifserious.jpgIf you're going to troll, you're going to have to work harder than this. 25,185 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail7,428 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Success EskimoBob seems to have been AFK for an entire week and missed out on the ASICMINER IPO at 30mh for 0.10 (or 0.03 a mh). Lets catch him up, shall we?If you value mh at lowest ask (which is what I do and most everyone else does due to highest bid not being reliable due to the giant spreads and bids often being wiped out by large panic sales), EVERYONE who had fixed mh or non-upgrading assets lost value 5x overnight.So, we started at the 1 BTC IPO price, then the market massively devalued mh due to BTC going from $5s to a final peak of $15.40, driving down per mh prices down so DMC was worth in the 0.50s before I could catch up fast enough, and now ASICMINER drove it down another 5x on top of that the instant they IPO'ed.If we're valuing mh at 0.03, and on the 19th (after Obsi pays me my last OBSI.1MHS dividend and I trade him for OBSI.ABMO) DMC will be 5mh/share, DMC is, by that calculation, worth at least 0.15 a share.Thus, I have initiated a plan backed by a shareholder majority to increase the NAV over the next 3 months by eating dividends. I do not promise anything due to how volatile mh prices are, but if we stay around 0.03/mh, we could be back to looking at >0.50 again. Its not full, and I don't think its even a month. AFAIK they don't exist. GLBSE does not contain such data long term. Very few (less than 100) of these shares were ever purchased at 1 BTC. Most were traded for. It didn't evaporate anywhere. It never existed. And now I don't have to worry about those 5113 shares of OBSI.1MHS, Obsi has put up a motion for OBSI.ABMO to convert my OBSI.1MHS to 5113 shares of OBSI.ABMO, which I am valuing at 7mh each due to Obsi's planned BFL upgrade. Nether of us think the motion will fail.This upgrade will bring mh/share up to 5 mh/share. Fixed mh bonds in our possession represent 5 ghash out of 73. BTC-MINING, BTCMC, and ASICMINER already represent what you have suggested.
The motion to suspend dividends for three months has passed.8253 shares voted yea.914 shares voted nay.The dividends for August (paid September 1st), September (paid October 1st), and October (paid November 1st) will be recycled to increase NAV.Unless another motion to continue further suspension of dividends passes, the next dividend will be December 1st for November. Total shares: 20709BTC-Mining (370 mhash): 10 (3700 mhash)BTCMC (6 mhash): 951 (5706 mhash)OBSI.1MHS (1 mhash): 5113 (5113 mhash)ASICMINER (30 mhash): 1980 (59400 mhash)Total mhash: 73919 mhashApproximately 3.569 mhash per share They should be frustrated, but not at me. asicminer came in and basically obliterated the market. DMC sits in a good position to end up with a large chunk of the market because of what asicminer did.We need to take advantage of this. 25mh is the new 1 mh. New (and our first) motion:https://glbse.com/vote/view/104Diablo Mining Company wishes to suspend dividend payment for a maximum of 3 months until net asset value has been sufficiently restored. Vote yes if you want to restore NAV, vote no if you want to continue dividend payments. You must vote in the next 24 hours.Edit: Bitcoin Mining Fund and Nyancat Financial have voted yes on this motion, thus 7k out of 20.5k shares have voted yes. Unless another 10.6k vote no, the motion will most likely pass. Well, thats an interesting question.In a couple minutes I'm putting up a motion up for vote on if we should end dividends until NAV has been sufficiently repaired (3 month maximum, we can vote on it again then). The market is giving us some great deals that we should not pass up.The largest shareholder in DMC has already said he will vote yes with his shares, so unless there is a large vote against it, I'm just going to assume right now the vote is yes with a large margin.So, assuming that the vote will indeed be yes, the next 3 months will pay zero dividend, but will accelerate in mhash/share greatly. If I play my cards right, we could be looking at 25 or more mh/share at the end of these 3 months. Not near infinite. There is 200k, and thats all there ever will be unless there is large majority vote by shareholders to issue more.The ratio is based on the near term projected growth. Due to asicminer destroying the bond market and setting a new high water mark in mh per btc, DMC has jumped to 15mh per share for trade.I have not thought it is unwise to buy them back, I just haven't done it yet. Yeah, but will we have one in 2013? We might skip October altogether. Hey all.My VPS is down at the moment, so there goes the trade chart until Enzu is done their LA migration. However, I'm changing the trade requirement from 3.5 mhash to 15 mhash. That means 15:1 for all the 1 mhash bonds, and 1:2 for asicminer.Price per mhash on GLBSE is crashing, so might as well trade to me while you still can. I'm probably going to continue progressing the trade requirement 1 mhash per month from now on, so you have 16 days until the next increase. Okay, 6. Still, thats better than the 5 I've been writing them down as. Oh man.Lets say its 60 ghash even, and on August 1st you paid out on 3764 shares.60000 / 3764 = 15.94 mhash. Did I fail at math somewhere along the way? Luke, let me remind you: I'm a mod. Reporting my own comment to me is not an effective way of protesting my relationship with your mother. I'm not sure why you're complaining, its purely business. Look, if you're going to keep this shit up, I and con BOTH will DMCA your existence itself (yes, we will send a DMCA to your mother's womb, the one you presumably slithered out of) if you even think about misrepresenting the copyright or the license of code contained within cgminer. You need to post equivalent mhash based on today's difficulty. People only think in mhash. Either people who think BFL will succeed, or people who need to insure their non-BFL assets. 24,680 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail6,390 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Success yochdog, do me a favor: when you do the monthly dividends report, also list the equivalent mhash at that day's difficulty since you do fixed dividend output. For such a big holding of DMC's, I want to keep the mhash equivalent accurate.Also, when is the full 0.05 dividend starting to be paid? Thats pretty close. Make sure you're using the same -v and -w options, though. Exact same? No. cgminer doesn't use the same exact accounting math, so they might quibble over that last mhash or two. Its close enough to use cgminer as a rough kernel benchmark. There isn't one. It can crash on any call (although, statistically, it will most likely be the kernel execution ones due to the fact they use the most time).The driver fails to restart the GPU properly during high stress conditions (ie, mining for hours). I should be able to run an OpenCL app, have the GPU crash, and have the OpenCL app continue running fine (scrambled results for one kernel execution is acceptable). Inaccuracy in measurement as far as I can tell, theres no way to fix it.
Since it started. You may think its higher than your hash ever has been, but its more accurate than a short term meter. 15 seconds and forever. Things will be back on track when Bitcoin prices stop being insane. We just crossed $10, so that might be a month or two. I sometimes trade one bond for another if I can get more hash cheaper that way. DMC shares themselves happened to become cheaper than other bonds, so I bought a large number of them back.mhash/share went up, however. Okay, you can claim that. Its a free country. A lot of people do not agree with you, however.No, not mining. Data center space, the market is growing faster than companies can supply it.Im saying its not free power.[/quote]Good, because its not. If I produce more power than I use, it has a negative operational cost; that is not the same as free.Yet the same would happen if I purchased the hardware: it would depreciate in value.Also, much of what DMC owns already has an ASIC upgrade path. I don't really think he makes valid points. All he does is continually remark that Bitcoin cannot build a data center, or that its somehow impossible to enter a market that badly needs more competition, or that solar power is not profitable, or other things that aren't true.Mining bonds aren't losers because they continue to pay out. Leaving the money simply sit means those profits are lost forever, and it also locks us out of future investors because no one is going to invest in something on GLBSE that doesn't pay dividend; worse, instead of investing in DMC, people may throw their money at Pirate or BFL instead because they don't know any better. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.People keep reporting you. You have your own thread to evangelize your troll fork in, go do it in there; otherwise, fuck off. Did you not read the plan? This was outlined completely already. I never said I am cutting mining out, I said if mining is not our only source of income and not a majority source of income. Difficulty goes up 2x. People pay over half a million dollars a month to lease my racks.Difficulty goes up 100x. People STILL pay over half a million dollars a month to lease my racks.So, whats the problem?

It will not be impacted. What I just did was disclose a flaw in the plan: the plan is much more profitable than I originally realized. Oops. Yes, and if I ever need that in Europe I will be sure to take you up on that deal. However, it is still cheaper in the long run to do it my way for now: we can pipe power directly from the green energy farm to the DC off grid (without diminishing our capacity to power the DC using the grid or sell power from the farm on the grid).Your deal still does not beat $0 (or negative if we're selling power to the grid more often than not), although I have to admit, its very nice, makes me wish I had a room full of blade servers that needed a new home. 22,510 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail3,837 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Success Hey yochdog, happy dividend day!  Thats the funny thing. I happen to think the same thing: mining is now a dead end, especially if BFL delivers what they promised, doubly so if they do it on time.Before the BFL announcement, but after I announced DMC's IPO is now open, I realized that for a company named "Diablo Mining Company", its kind of funny that profits from mining will probably end up being 25% or less.Using existing Spartan 6 hardware in rack mountable arrangements, a 51% attack on the current network could be done in 4 or 5 racks. Our data center could end up having enough room for 2 or 3 dozen racks... and racks geared for 25-30kw cooling per rack including the 5+ 20a 120v circuits you need to power that much hardware could easily go for $15-20k/mo each.A dozen racks would be pulling in $180-240k/mo. If we mine 2TH of coin every month at today's difficulty and sell them for $10 that ends of being $300k/mo and the difficulty is only going to keep increasing. If BFL fails to deliver, difficulty still can double by this time next year, and if they do deliver, it may go up 100x by this time next year; but those dozen racks will keep pulling in $180k-240k/mo and we'll probably have two or three dozen racks.Like I said, Diablo Mining Company is the first of its kind for the Bitcoin world: we'll be making money off of real things people pay actual dollars for, and this can only increase Bitcoin prices. If they don't think the data center is possible, then they shouldn't be investing. No, I don't mean "shouldn't be investing with DMC", I mean they shouldn't be investing at all. Bitcoin is an experimental currency with an experimental economy that has global reach, Diablo Mining Company has a rather straight forward and tame plan compared to what Bitcoin was invented to do, and Bitcoin succeeded in doing it, I think. We, the community, made it succeed.Bitcoin itself carries much more risk than DMC does. If you're here using Bitcoin, if you're here and part of the community, then you've already decided for yourself that the risk is worth taking. I see no reason for anyone not to invest in DMC if they believe in Bitcoin.We need a company that is grown out of the Bitcoin community, one that involves itself in real world things. Most of whats on the GLBSE is either mining companies, investment funds, or pass-through funds; there is not one single company on the GLBSE that is doing something like DMC, and there needs to be.We need companies that do "boring things". Green energy production is not exciting to the average person. Warehoused computing is not exciting to the average person. Yet, both of these are billion dollar industries that employ hundreds of thousands of people worldwide if not millions.We need companies that do these boring things and go out and tell people that they are proud to be Bitcoin Grown. I envision that Diablo Mining Company will be the first of many Bitcoin Grown companies. Companies like mine will be the emissaries to the big industries out there, and we will spread the word of Bitcoin to them.When (not if) DMC succeeds, the price of Bitcoin could easily double as venture capitalists, small business owners, and startup founders flood into the market to become part of this economic revolution. The Bitcoin community made Bitcoin a success, and I think we can continue making Bitcoin a success over and over and over again. We can't stop now. This.Also, many tech startup companies operate at a loss (mostly through asset depreciation) for the first two years of their existence. What DMC is going through is not unusual. The issuer can force me to sell through buyback, but that effectively removes those bonds off of GLBSE forever. They also cannot selectively target mine for buyback. If the market has 850 ghash, and 100 are recalled, all that does is shrink the market to 750 and make it easier for DMC to grow faster. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Go FUD on some other forum, your kind isn't welcome here. Define "appropriately". Once a month I release a list of all of our assets and their current market value. Investors are free to use this information to make decisions about their investments. It can't get any more "on the books" than this.
Why would I want to sell them? The only time I've sold them is to swap them for more mhash with another one (which I ended up basically doubling our mhash during the GLBSE crash). Owning the majority of mhash on GLBSE is conductive to the goals of DMC, even after the plan is completed.Theres about 850 ghash out there on GLBSE, and last month's numbers put us at 11 and a half of it. If DMC owned half of that 850, I could finish the plan on the output of the bond/share dividends alone. But what does "way under water" mean? Many of these I sold as GLBSE crashed just to buy others at a net mhash gain. As long as these bonds continue to pay out x mhash of dividends over y time period, they continue to be worth x mhash. Because they are no longer worth z BTC is a meaningless observation.That'd be like saying the Kindle Fire sitting on my desk is under water because the Nexus 7 just came out for the same price. It still does exactly what it did before the Nexus 7 came out, the Nexus 7 coming out does not diminish the Kindle Fire in any way.People are not buying DMC for the mining power: selling power back to the grid and leasing high density compute oriented rack space is far more profitable in the long run. I am 100% transparent with my investors. Every month I publish a list of our assets and their current market value. So, yes, my investors already did figure out whats going on: GLBSE crashing and making bonds cheaper only helps DMC in the long run.Also, I think you need to look up the definition of "toxic asset": these assets will become toxic when they stop paying out as per contract. They are not toxic or even in trouble, it is a contract for x mhash, and I am continuing to get the x mhash as per the contract. As a reminder, dividend day is coming soon. Be sure to have any share purchases done before August 1st. 21,975 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail3,837 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Success I think you missed something, its right there at the end: "Shares will be issued at a price of one thousandth (1/1000) of one BTC." GLBSE is both the exchange and the broker. "Companies" are issued the original stock, and then we sell it. DI.BFLSC will stop issuing shares October 1st or when BFL ships, whichever comes first.Combined value is both Fail and Succeed added together. Right now we're at around 4000:21000 Succeed/Fail, so if Succeed to pay out right now, not only would Succeed get what they paid for the almost 4000 shares back, they'd get around 21000/4000 for each share on top of that.Share value is fixed at 1/1000th of a BTC (although nothing stops people from reselling their shares at a lesser value to others).Shares outstanding is not listed on GLBSE anywhere, its inside the API unfortunately.https://glbse.com/api/quantity_trading/DI.BFLSC.SUCCEEDhttps://glbse.com/api/quantity_trading/DI.BFLSC.FAIL At least post the Avenue Q performance.

A few miners out there are ponying up money to buy these new BFL ASIC units, but a lot instead either think BFL will fail to ship or will not ship what they promised.To help smooth out the financial difficulties of either BFL shipping or not shipping, I am now providing insurance to protect those who are still on the fence or intend on never buying BFL.Official thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92244.0This thread is locked to reduce pro-BFL trolls from drowning out legitimate miners. 3036 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail2500 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Success iirc that works too. Not all people do or can use Titanium Backup. Congratulations. 2813 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Fail2500 shares sold of DI.BFLSC.Success Diablo Insurance is now for sale! nefario finally pressed the on button. Heh, DiabloMiner fixes this by just watching for the X-Is-P2Pool header.  On what grounds? You're now harassing three different members of the community. You have a problem with the contract as listed on GLBSE? Take it up with nefario. ... or I can just flag your account for moderation by the admins.BTCMC and Yochdog have done nothing wrong as far as I can tell, nefario just refuses to fix the oversight in the GLBSE software. Go try to get free money out of someone else, its not happening here. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Nefario has a forum account, he can speak for himself. Huh, thats weird. cgminer uses pretty similar code to what I do. Yes, 23, 1, and 1 would be considered successful. It would also be like 1/8th of the network all by itself.BFL can manufacture shipping labels, but they'd have to be valid ones that have working tracking numbers and have actually been delivered somewhere. Plus, they still need to produce the 25 units to go with the labels.If there is any doubt about the validity of any individual pieces of evidence, they simply won't be used. If BFL has actually shipped units for real, I really doubt there will be a lack of evidence.For example: if Giga or Yochdog say "Hey Diablo, we got our units", then any evidence they pony up will most likely be the real thing. If some random person with a brand new forum account and is clearly a sockpuppet says they got 25 units, well, we're going to need more evidence. Nope, DMC is going to own 16 BTC of Succeed, it needs to insure against the outcome of BFL not being a long con. Photos of units and photos of UPS/Fedex/USPS labels uncensored provided by forum goers will be more than enough to prove this. If they ship before October 31st, I imagine there will be more than enough evidence for DI.BFLSC.Success to win. Insurance is gambling with statistics. Life insurance, for example, is where you gamble that the owner of the insurance will pay in more money (pre-investment) than is paid out on the policy at the time of death (post-investment). Yes, this is what I wrote. No one else seems to have had any other interpretation.  Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Cool it. What does me providing an insurance product have to do with me being a moderator? If I never became moderator, I would have still done it... and the reason I was made moderator was because I wrote DiabloMiner. Should I step down from developing DiabloMiner because I do a lot for the community? You don't make any sense. I didn't.This is an insurance product that will pay out either in the situation that BFL ships 25 units, or that they do not ship 25 units, depending on which insurance you buy.
That WOULD explain a lot of problems. DI.BFLSC.FailDI.BFLSC.SucceedButterfly Labs has recently advertised three new products in their BitForce SC line, a 3.5 gigahash/sec USB powered unit named "Jalapeño", a 40 gigahash/sec unit named "SC Single", and a 1 terahash/sec unit named "SC Mini Rig", all to be delivered in October 2012.In the event that Butterfly Labs fails to deliver at least a sum total of twenty-five (25) units composed of all three products offered described exactly as above to customers by the end of October 31st 2012, shares of DI.BFLSC.Fail will be repurchased at combined value of DI.BFLSC.Fail and DI.BFLSC.Succeed divided by the number of DI.BFLSC.Fail shares sold minus a 1% fee. Shares of DI.BFLSC.Succeed will be repurchased at a price of 0.00 BTC.In the event that Butterfly Labs does succeed to deliver a sum total of twenty-five (25) units composed of all three products offered described exactly as above to customers by the end of October 31st 2012, shares of DI.BFLSC.Succeed will be repurchased at a combined value of DI.BFLSC.Fail and DI.BFLSC.Succeed divided by the number of DI.BFLSC.Succeed shares sold minus a 1% fee. Shares of DI.BFLSC.Fail will be repurchased at a price of 0.00 BTC.The final repurchase price in either outcome depends on the number of shares sold of both DI.BFLSC.Succeed and DI.BFLSC.Fail combined by October 1st. Shares will be issued at a price of one thousandth (1/1000) of one BTC. Works for me. Surprised it took so long. Okay, so, the forum had V7 and K7 pricing a magnitude wrong (thanks guys), so what is the cheapest way of getting SASICS? Power usage isn't an issue if we go 65 or 90nm, and BFL is going 90 or 130nm on "real" ASIC (which has yet to be proven).I think the ideal device would be an FPGA that it just all slices, no DSP slices, no high speed serial, no large gobs of memory, etc, and on top of that offers SASIC migration.Does any company offer that, no matter the node size? This is not a speculation thread. DMC's ban on BFL hardware is based on what they have already done, not what they will do. Except there is no speculation here. DMC will not buy BFL hardware. I do not care if they deliver exactly what they promised, they already burned that bridge. This is purely based on their current and past actions, and has nothing to do with what they will or will not deliver. BFL still refuses to quote power usage figures, and they're probably in the realm of 28nm or SASIC anyhow. Most likely BFL will miss the October date.Lets say the Virtex 7 is 13x more usable slices and can be clocked 2x what Spartan 6s are stable at, thats around 7.2ghash. I think someone on the forums said they'd cost about $1000 each, so we're looking at, say, a $1200 product price. Thats only 4x more expensive per mh.Rolling this as a SASIC could drop the price even more and also increase the stable clock speed 3-4x over Spartan 6s, or 10.8 - 14.4 ghash for, say, a $1000 product. Thats in the same ballpark as what BFL is claiming. I do not maintain separate forum accounts, as that is a form of sockpuppeting. If I want to do mod actions, you will clearly see me doing mod actions. I have not used my mod powers to promote DMC.People will use anything they can get their hands on to troll with, including attacking someone based on how much of their time they donate to a community. I haven't seen it stickied, so I'm not lying about anything. BFL has not stated the power consumption of their SC minirigs, and their chips might be 130 or 90mm fab, while Virtex 7 is 28nm.Even if Virtex 7s or Kintex 7s cost 3x more per mhash to what BFL claims theirs do, so what? At least the vendors of existing Spartan 6 products actually have shown to be committed to their relationship with the Bitcoin community, and these will be most likely the ones that are making Kintex/Virtex 7 products. Its not what they did to me, its what they did to everyone else. They expect us to act like normal consumers, yet they ask for 100% of the money up front. Either treat people like the investors they are, or learn how to run a business. DMC refusing to do business with BFL over poor customer service concerns is trolling? Back in my day we called that good business sense. Have a screenshot? Because I haven't seen it stickied, and it is currently not sticky. I didn't, and I don't see it stickied right now. This thread is not stickied.I am not posting this with my mod hat on, I'm posting it with my DMC hat on. Unlike some people, I can keep my duties in the Bitcoin community separate without conflict of interest. I do not have a personal agenda or vendetta. The original Diablo Mining Company plan was to buy BFL hardware. It is BFL that talked themselves out of a sale with their unprofessional behavior, I have no control over what they do or do not do. This thread is not stickied, although I'd like to see GLBSE companies stickied in the securities sub-forum. I have not stickied this thread.BFL has ultimately refused to speak with their investors (ie, everyone who preordered a BFL SC rig), so it is BFL that has refused to be diplomatic about this.
See my previous response, 28nm FPGAs will take the wind out of BFL if they aren't careful. This plan was discussed with some of my largest shareholders. They agree.Also, this post is not stickied. Not at all. Butterfly Labs has yet to prove their BitForce SC products exist and are what they claim they are. Also, using Virtex 7 XC7V2000Ts over Spartan 6s could lead to a 23x increase of performance per chip, which really takes the wind out of BFL's ASICs.28nm FPGAs may make it to the Bitcoin market before SCs ship in October 2013. A lot of people are questioning Butterfly Labs' commitment to the Bitcoin community, and a lot of people are even coming right out and calling it a scam or a long con or the end of Bitcoin.I cannot help but agree with these people.Without a second vendor producing hardware just as efficient and cheap as Butterfly Labs claims their new Bitforce SC hardware is, I do not believe Butterfly Labs is being completely honest with potential customers.Because of how Butterfly Labs has handled customer relations, Diablo Mining Company will never purchase Butterfly Labs hardware. We will pursue high-efficiency FPGA and ASIC hardware from alternate vendors only.Diablo Mining Company will be the largest Bitcoin startup in the world, and we will do it without the help of Butterfly Labs.Diablo Mining Company main thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.0Diablo Mining Company on the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange (GLBSE): https://glbse.com/asset/view/DMC A lot of people are questioning Butterfly Labs' commitment to the Bitcoin community, and a lot of people are even coming right out and calling it a scam or a long con or the end of Bitcoin.I cannot help but agree with these people.Without a second vendor producing hardware just as efficient and cheap as Butterfly Labs claims their new Bitforce SC hardware is, I do not believe Butterfly Labs is being completely honest with potential customers.Because of how Butterfly Labs has handled customer relations, Diablo Mining Company will never purchase Butterfly Labs hardware.

Well, I can't fire a mentally handicapped person, I'd get sued! If I had an employee on the books and he didn't do this when he could have, I would fire him. People need to speak up when other people are potentially being stupid. Take what I paid total this month and double it. I think this is where I finish up this train of thought by saying 28nm running a Fury-like or TML-like firmware would be about half as dollar efficient as what BFL claims, and probably just as dollar efficient as what BFL will actually deliver. And, although yohan probably doesn't want to talk about upcoming products, I believe Enterpoint is already working on a 28nm board. I honestly don't believe they have ASICs. Its not that ASICs aren't possible, but it is going to be very expensive, very difficult, and a lead up time almost as long as Bitcoin itself has been popular (~2 years).That said, cgminer offers the DiabloMiner kernel and is basically a port of DiabloMiner to C, and it already offers FPGA support and a few GPU features that I don't intend on backporting to DiabloMiner while its still written in Java. This has already been discussed. If I can find a building that suits my needs, I will acquire that instead. Nope. Ever think about investing in Diablo Mining Company, a startup that intends on bringing datacenter space and green power generation to Bitcoin; we would welcome a large investment. Like a baus. Facilities, plural, still costs money. The DC I'm looking at building (either flat out, or buying a small warehouse no one wants anymore) is going to be around 100 square feet, or room enough for a dozen racks or so.Also, its not like it wasn't business-hostile to begin with. We (me, investors, the Bitcoin community at large) all went into Bitcoin 3 years ago knowing the outside world there is business-hostile. This isn't really anything new. That said, GLBSE is panicing because Bitcoin prices are going up., thus the prices of all assets are going down.The contingency plan is to continue, well, as planned. I don't think even if the entire world tried to stop Bitcoin, it could. No matter how much Congress tries to stop entrepreneurs like me from helping local economies and paying taxes and improving the quality of life of the citizens of this country, they can never stop us.The contingency plan is me flipping Congress the bird and continuing to be more awesome than they can ever imagine. Yawn, if you're going to troll, try harder. Yup, you're missing things. Don't worry, it happens to even the best of us. BTCMC split shares 10x, and thus the dividend was also split.

Wait until I do the monthly report. It should come out sometime today. Well, that share trade table is completely automatic, written in Perl.  And I also already wrote a script to calculate dividends semi-automatically, also written in Perl. So, whats one more? Dividend day is tomorrow. I'm going to post it right after BTCMC posts theirs. That is the exact opposite of automatic. When the market is busy, I may make buys and sells several times a day just to take advantage of the deals that pop up. It would take like 5 lines of perl to do this automatically. I could automate it with perl, but I won't until nefario adds a read only private API. I'm not comfortable with enabling the API as long as I can't set any state changing commands to disabled. Have a ballpark range? I want to put something there, since Giga is the biggest mining company on GLBSE Just fix BTCMC's contract.  Thats an unusually strict definition of SMT. Issuing instructions from more than one thread at a time to fill load requirements over multiple ALUs is not a requirement to be SMT. I know what SMT is, and it only describes one core doing multiple threads simultaniously. It doesn't describe how, coarse or not. T1s, Intel P4s, Intel i*s with HT, Bulldozers, and Radeons can all be described as SMT. They just don't all do it the same way.As for T1s doing it on block, this is what Sun advertised it as. I'm not surprised their marketing department got it slightly wrong, so I'll let you have that one. Which is clearly not true. Updated op to reflect results so far.BTW, if everyone can say what their estimated mh/share will be after upgrade, that'd be nice too. I wasn't arguing coarse vs fine. I was just arguing on who does what.Niagaras really do switch on block, but the newer ones might just switch every cycle now that they have a FP unit per core instead of per socket.Radeons switch every VLIW clause (which can be up to 128 instructions long) due to the unique register layout.AMD is SMT if you look at it that way, but I look at it much finer grained than SMT: not only do you get SMT, but instructions are scheduled to run on the next free ALU. Fine grained "switch every cycle" would waste resources as ALUs would have no work to run most of the time.Intel Hyperthreading switches on block on P4s, and I think on i*s that have it they switched to every cycle.I mean, what I'm trying to say is, all modern high performance archs use the same set of tricks, but its at what level do they exploit them. Its rumored that POWER in the future (9? 10?) will just be something like 64 threads piping into one core, where that one core has like 128 int ALUs and a similar number of FPUs, which is probably the future of non-lockstep highly parallel programming. Its only hyperthreaded? Thats kinda pointless altogether. No, SHA3, whichever candidate ends up winning. Thats almost the same trick. Ultrasparc T[1-4]s and newer IBM POWERs have multiple thread decoders, and switch to the next on anything that would block execution. AMD Bulldozers do the same, but have a semi-unified scheduler that schedules the next instruction (from one of two already decoded streams) onto the next ALU (2 threads -> 4 integer ALUs and 2 FP ALUs).Radeons, however, don't switch on block. They automatically assume there is memory latency and results won't be available for four pipeline executions later. It makes the hardware simpler and easier to design compilers for. I suspect Knights Corner is more like a Radeon than a Niagara in this case. Its just non-obvious. I'm against the split, but it should be FPGA/ASIC, custom is too vague Hey, what is Nasty's mh/share and total ghash atm? Yeah, but I suspect thats the Radeon trick: have a pipeline 4 issue deep, so memory latency is effectively hid. It probably cant switch on demand. I'm trying to build a list of whos upgrading and whos not.I know BTCMC, Gigamining, and BTC-Mining are, and BFLS/BFLS.RIG are going to upgrade their units.

Yes, and all of DMC's holdings of BTCMC are apparently post-split. Well, not all news is bad today. Diablo Mining Company has now passed 11 Ghash, and we're also 57 shares short of 4000 shares sold. Yup. I guess over the next month I'm going to dump the BTCMC holdings I have. Well, the real problem is, they want to be able to boot existing x86 code on it. Not merely run, but boot.I'm thinking they're this: Atom-like cores, dual issue, in order execution, no x87 FPU, and a 512 bit SIMD unit that does both integer and fp, 32?kb of L1, and a small amount of L2.Now, given that sounds shitty, but if I can run normal threads on those instead of lockstep thread clusters and the SIMD units support booleans (512 of them at a time) or chars (64 at a time), this could actually end up with surprisingly fast mining. Yes, that one, where he is no longer going to honor the contract he agreed to on GLBSE. Well, this is fun. BTCMC is not going to honor the .125 BTC/mo dividend in the contract. This estimate is now wrong, and is probably going to be around 27 to 35 BTC total dividend, or less than half. Thanks Yochdog. Superscalar is not hyperthreading. FPGA. I don't believe BFL will be shipping ASIC this year, if ever. Has BFL given a delivery date for yours? Will you be paying dividends on BFLS.RIG? Of course it isnt. NVidia totally botched the 580, they'll never catch up to AMD at this rate. I dont get this binned GHZ edition shit. Mines a ref design factory overclocked to 1010mhz, and I got it like 4 months ago. It happy cranks away at 1125mhz at stock volts. That seems about right. On DiabloMiner on my 7970 at 1125 I get 675. I agree with this assessment.  Explains why the rum is gone. Ask theymos. Well, HW layout is still actually the same, its just that the DC->DC VRMs are in the PSU housing instead of the modules (which also may not be outputting 12v, some I've seen output 24v for high wattage situations). Its kinda shitty when you realize that although your 12v is redundant, your 5v and 3.3v isn't. I'm proud of him too.ALL HAIL GIGA! KING OF THE MINERS! To be fair, thats how all high efficiency PSUs work now. AC->DC 12v, DC->DC 12v->whatever for everything else. Wait until the first, I don't want to spoil it for anyone who isn't in the know.
Hey JWU42, have you considered replacing YABMC with a fixed dividend bond instead of per mh? It would go a long way to stabilize GLBSE's wild fluctuations, and clearly you can grow your farm fast enough to keep up. Hey Giga, have you considered replacing Gigamining with a fixed dividend bond instead of per mh? It would go a long way to stabilize GLBSE's wild fluctuations, and clearly you can grow your farm fast enough to keep up. Hey amazingrando, have you considered replacing Bitbond with a fixed dividend bond instead of per mh? It would go a long way to stabilize GLBSE's wild fluctuations, and clearly you can grow your farm fast enough to keep up. Many of the bonds are sold at a fixed mh value. They are worth exactly that, no more, no less. There is only one fixed dividend bond on the market and thats BTCMC, as far as I know. Please keep trolling in this thread to a minimum. Trolling is bad no matter what thread you put it in. Companies should remain professional. Hey man, I can't yell at *** for trolling Enterpoint and then let you guys troll them, even if ***'s offerings are less than, well, existent. I really doubt they're doing that, it would add too much complexity to the memory controllers. So, yes, find a 7970 photo, count the memory chips, and post the number in here. Actually, it might run x86 code unmodified. That just isn't the best way to performance on those machines. ECC on external RAM like that is done by adding more chips. If these were DIMMs, you'd have DIMMs with 9 chips instead of 8.The easy way to figure this out is if someone finds a picture of the ref board naked and count the chips. No it doesn't. What GCN did was add ECC to all internal on-die memory (caches, local stores, etc), but the only cards AMD has that have ECC GDDR5 are FirePro/FireStream cards, and although they're normal GCN chips, they're not referred to as such. Im already well aware of how they designed that. Its more butchered than Atom. But from what I've heard, Phi isn't nearly as bad. They both want branch/loop happy highly parallel computation. The Radeon's biggest "problem" (and I'm using the term loosely) is that wavefronts are ran in lockstep: both sides of a branch are the same length, even if it requires inserting no-ops, and loops that have lengths that are set at runtime (instead of static/compile time set) are just as nasty.CPUs, otoh, can't do highly parallel calculations because of all the hardware dedicated dealing with branching, branch prediction, cache prediction, etc etc etc takes up a lot of room, produces a lot of heat, and uses a lot of power. I wonder how much stuff Intel removed to put 50 cores on a card. Yeah, what I described is clearly Step 3 or later. Intel also seems to have finally sold a "step 3" type of device in the Phi, depending on what it actually can do. Our second dividend and first full month dividend is quickly approaching.Estimated total dividends: 75.52 to 83.00 BTCEstimated per share dividend: 0.028495 to 0.031827 BTC AMD's Fusion is a product of years of research. AMD "demo'ed" an all HyperTransport Radeon about a year after they bought ATI, and they've also been showing off prototype Fusions that don't just have Radeon pipes on-die* but usable from the x86 interface side, although what "usable" means is still up in the air, but if they've managed to use them as the backend for SIMD instructions (ie, no more dedicated FPU units, and the x86 instruction scheduler issues as many ops as it can in parallel (instead of just, say, 2 per core), instead 512 Radeon ALUs across the entire CPU) this could mean a huge goddamned increase in FP performance without needing a dedicated HAL API like OpenCL.* On-die Fusion Radeons don't have a Radeon memory controller and natively speak HyperTransport. The up side is, they have direct access to system memory as a native processor and can access stuff directly out of on-die cache: this means you have basically zero wait time to send stuff to the GPU for processing and you have zero cost cache coherency. Yeah, but no one has an easy to read chart for that. Theres a Google spreadsheet out there, but its nigh unreadable. What he really wants to do is buy out DMC. No one trusts their specs or delivery dates. 28nm also may completely crush it. Don't bother bringing that up. No one trusts BFL.
You're welcome to outvote me in the motion. A quad Spartan 6 board that has enough amps to run Tricone Mining's firmware. Seems to be the cheapest Spartan 6 solution per mh. They're a British company that specializes in custom computation gear, but the Cairnsmore is the first Bitcoin-related product they've made.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78239.0BFL also made fools of themselves by trolling them.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=88363.0 See four posts up. Enterpoint now, 28nm later, and BFL has probably lied about their SC minirig and its closer to 500gh for $60k so 22nm FPGAs should start rolling out about the time they come out with their SC gear. I own 783 shares, I've voted no. Yeah, but you gotta worry, BFL might be lying out their ass. And if they aren't, thats a year and a half away. I say grow your farm with Enterpoint hardware until 28nm FPGAs come out at the end of this year. Battery powered bluetooth micro-keyboard. They make them. DMC will probably end up buying from... well... anybody but BFL. And this is why Theymos won't let me be an admin. I would have banned him and requested that Smart1985 file a police report and send me a copy. Single slot, double wide. Technically you'd want a material that conducts zero heat so it is properly vented out of the case and not leaked into it. Plastic isn't entirely appropriate, but its cheap. Metal isn't appropriate. You do realize thats an air channel, right? Then why don't they? Subbed, especially after BFL's stunt. Cache isn't the issue, really. But if it still can perform just as well on highly branchy code, I might have a use for one of those. 50 normal cores? And 22nm trigate fab, so its probably some derivative of Sandy Bridge (but with Failabee-like ring busses). I wonder what sort of onboard memory it as and if its considered local memory and normally addressable. So what is it, exactly? We don't need one YET. But such an eventuality is being planned for. Take it up with Theymos. 6% is very high. It sounds like your -f/-I is too high/low. ASIC goes in here too.
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=88363For those wondering where the posts on the Enterpoint thread went. I split, stickied and locked it.This is how BFL will do their penance.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=88363.0 Woah woah woah. Just a reminder to the BFL corporation, we, the Bitcoin community, do not tolerate shenanigans like this. I don't know where you are, I don't know what you want. If you are looking for customers, I can tell you I don't have money... but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. No, but showing off DMC's high efficiency green computing side is really worth it imo. Not only are we using our own green power, but we're going to be using high efficiency computing combined with high efficiency cooling. Other companies will be green with envy. Successful troll is successful.Seriously, what boyfriend would hand $6200 USD to their girlfriend in a form that isn't an engagement ring, not that there are any women on the Internet. Or ones that like Gurren Lagann. So Obsi, how much has FutureFund invested in DMC, which is going to be investing heavily in a green power generation infrastructure, and sounds like the kind of thing this fund is interested in? Sounds like you need prime numbers. My kernel is optimized for 2.6 and up. It won't perform as well on anything earlier. Boot to safe mode, remove as much of the driver as you can, reboot, install 12.4 and do NOT install the SDK on top. Use the OpenCL runtime that comes with 12.4. This might fix your problem. Wait, have you by any chance ever installed SDK 2.1 on your machines? Thats the problem. I already reverted the changes that I thought was causing that. This is something else, and March's version should ALSO suffer from it. Until then, go use cgminer with my kernel. Install it manually. 12.4 is already out  Your drivers on both are quite outdated. Like I said, I can't reproduce it. What hardware, and what version of the driver? Yup. It happens more often than you think. This so called bug is not reproducible on any machine or hardware combination I have access to. So, either it is a driver bug or it is a bug with the pool.  Have you tried a different more mainstream pool instead, such as p2pool? Strange. Try reinstalling Windows from scratch and trying again. Its the right link, but it is updated periodically. I last updated it June 13th. PR isn't the issue. usagi has continually hounded me on IRC over something I really have no control over. If people want to panic sell, thats their problem, and I'm happy to clean up on all the other shares/bonds also dropping like a rock. If usagi doesn't like the fact I'm trying to optimize DMC's holdings to increase investor profit, thats also not something I have any control over.As it stands, people are valuing DMC like a mining stock, and there is no formula to convert non-mining assets to mhash. I imagine when we get the green energy farm online, no one will have to worry about DMC stock price again. I'm not sure why you keep claiming you lost 50% of your investment. Market prices for everything on GLBSE are panic low because of the BFL announcement. I don't know why you don't see this as an opportunity to just buy more at a much cheaper price.
I never said I was going to sell my assets at 0.19 or 0.15. I said even if I were to do something I will never do and sell my assets at 0.190/mh and assuming BFL isn't lying about their specs, I could end up with 200 ghash in SC Singles. Problem is, a) I would never do that, b) I don't trust BFL.So, there, I proved you wrong. That was easy. I'm not sure I like a troll owning 26% of my company. That should have already been fixed. Make sure you're on the absolute newest version. That'd be interesting. I forgot about the carbon offset market. Well, the guy who runs BMF has been basically character assassinating my plan on IRC (plan assassinating?) because he thinks "small" scale (as in, less than hundreds of mw and up) power generation (green or not) is not cost effective and cannot turn a profit.The thing is, I actually want to roll that out first BEFORE the DC, it seems to be just so much more profitable and easier to scale. I don't believe BFL's offerings. That is just impossible, they would have had needed access to a 28nm fab somewhere. I'm going to also have to chime in here. If you're shipping cgminer, you're also shipping the DiabloMiner kernel, which is also GPL3. Please comply with the GPL. itym winpwnds I own 658 of BTC-Mining atm. Update: Hardened the JSON parser a little more When are you going to verify on GLBSE, also, why aren't you in #bitcoin-assets on Freenode? When is next dividend?

He says "members of DMC". Apparently I'm a cloned army of women.Seriously, why didn't anyone tell me?! I could be off having lesbian sex with myself! The first of every month. Yeah, thats just designed wrong. It should be front -> back with cases no longer than 29", and a multiple of them needs to be no wider than 19" but as close as possible. L/R airflow? No, but its also a sin to let the money sit. Lets say I would have bought that 5 ghash straight out in harcdware... that would have taken 3-9 months to get here, yet I've already paid the first dividend 15 days in this way. I think its a win win situation. Same goes for GPUs. AMD says their chips will happily run at 100c+, but me and everyone else has been using 85c as the maximum safe 24/7 mining temp. OBSI.1MHS is now the newest bond to be added to the bond trade chart.http://caspar.adterrasperaspera.com/dmc/trade/ Actually, thats the funny thing. Computers can work in humidity that is too dry or too wet for us to be comfortable. There are these things called economizers that exist to pass filtered air into the building instead of running the air conditioner to do the same thing. You can also have economizers for water cooled setups, and use cooling towers to cool the water over long term periods (the math here, from what I can tell, with a cooling tower + external pump efficiency of EER 14, cooling 3 gallons/minute 10 degrees lower is equivalent to 1 ton).Getting too dry doesn't seem to be an issue in Maine, even in the winter. We have now crossed the 5 ghash line. At this rate, we should be past 10 ghash before the end of July.
I've just added new stocks/bonds to the swap list: PIMP, BTCMC, SYNERGY, MOORE, and MERGEDMINING Yes, and then I drive up in a flatbed truck and cart a multimillion dollar container off. Nothx. You have to build them. No one is currently selling an all in one unit that handles this. This is expensive and requires knowhow, but see the above post about the self-water cooled enclosed racks that Liebert makes, which may be an equivalent solution. So, not only did we cross 2000 shares sold today, we crossed the 4.5 ghash line.Fuck yeah. Something like that, but APC doesn't seem to offer a "heat chimney" type of solution (its the other half of cold aisle containment).I want a partially closed loop solution. Cold aisle containment + heat chimney, and heavy use of economizers most of the time.However, I think there might be another solution: http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Products/PrecisionCooling/HighDensityModularCooling/Water-Based/Pages/LiebertXDK-W.aspxIts a water cooled enclosed rack. I know I'm not fond of water cooling in data centers, but the entire product family looks rather interesting. It basically means we can scale cooling per rack, and for customers other than mining customers it would manage cooling based on their load individually. They have a 25kW model that, effectively, I could put the entire mining company in two racks. This is why I was planning for basically 4 racks of my own in the data center, and the racks won't be packed full.And yes, I have more plans. The plan listed is just phase 1, and it must be completed before I consider anything else in full. I don't want to waste money by buying too small, and who the hell is going to build a tiny hut in the middle of nowhere with a single rack in it.I don't need all $1m to start building the DC, I just need enough to keep it from financially collapsing. Depending on how BTC prices continue, we could be looking at building the solar farm first THEN the DC, I consider this an acceptable outcome.I have been considering effectively building a container storage facility, however it just doesn't seem to be worth it yet, not enough hardware. Its easier to build, say, four walls of rebar reinforced concrete with extra sound proofing measures and fill it with a bunch of locked security racks and just renting out the excess space.What I think is interesting about containers is, literally, people could just ship them in already loaded and I just have to park them in the facility. Small customers wouldn't, but the Amazons and Netflixes and whatnot would easily consider it. Although, at that point, I'd probably have to pull my corner of the Internet to me and thats pretty expensive.Containers make it a lot easier to do airflow containment, but it requires a lot of custom tooling. For what we need now, its just too much. However, a bunch of racks doing hot aisle/cold aisle with cold aisle containment and high airflow in the hot aisle would do just as well.Several manufacturers have complete containment rack solutions that prevent hot air circulation in the rack and forces it out into the hot aisle, so for now, I think this is what I'm going to pursue.Edit: Actually, I wanna ask our resident experts on something. Is there a complete solution to do both ducted hot air and cold aisle containment that is worth looking at? I know they exist and a lot of the high density DCs are starting to use them. Yeah hes that guy. I didnt know Trane did enterprise/industrial stuff. I knew Mitsubishi and Siemens did, but I somehow missed seeing their DC-centric models when I was wandering around.See if you can ask someone what the typical cost per ton is, I bet its higher than I originally planned out by like 30%. I've asked for ballpark quotes pretending to be a customer but very few have responded. Today is certainly a red letter day.We have sold our 2000th share. What I was looking at was for continuous operation, but I didn't see anything specifically for a datacenter.Oh God, do want. But if I'm going to buy it, I'm going to buy brand new stuff. I'm weird like that.

Well, the plan was for 50kw of hardware, not 100kw. I'm running the numbers for 100kw for farther in the future. 50kw would be modular purely out of the fact I'd end up buying 20 ton units, which seems to be the largest size for most of the commercial AC manufacturers.And you have the floor space about right. 24 by 24 would give me about 4 feet between between each of 4 racks in a single room and the walls. The entire DC itself could easily be fitting in the footprint of 40 by 40 if I stick with the hardware in the plan.The reason I've set aside $150k isn't for the DC entirely, I need quite a lot of land for the green power end of the plan. Well, I budgeted for 40 tons. I think thats enough for 100kw of hardware, right? Okay, I updated the cooling study with new numbers. Standard AC wins, and it win even harder when factoring in green power generation. Cooling is 120% an issue in space. Get your facts right.And no, this isn't a cost benefit analysis. I need AC, and its in the $150k soft budget. I'm just trying to decide on WHICH kind of cooling I want. It just doesn't seem cost efficient to use "green" cooling if I can just generate my own power anyways.Also, before I build any of this, I would have obviously hired a company to run all the numbers for real to begin with. I'm just running these numbers here for fun, essentially. I want this company to be as green as possible, but not more green than legitimately worth it. So 1 ton == 3.5 kw. That means I need ~29 tons, or I was off by 10x. I'll have to rerun the numbers. Blergh. Although, this is why I publicly post numbers, someone always catches a mistake. The original writeup already includes the fact that air exchange from the outside can pretty much handle it most of the rest of the year. This is a worst case study.As for watercooling... you still need to dump the heat somewhere, which is almost always done using air cooling at the reservoir. Watercooling just is not suited for a DC unless you're doing large scale complete immersion tanks, which I don't thing is ready for prime time yet.Custom ANYTHING drives cost up. A couple people reported this post to me. Honestly, I can't see anything wrong with it. Don't steal resources from your employers, the rest of us will be more than happy to turn you in. Thats not what wolfram alpha thinks.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=tons%20of%20heat%20to%20kwh (Update: I had the cooling factor wrong, lets try this again)Lets get back to the subject of the green facility.Geothermal heat pumps are a combined heating/cooling system that dumps heat into the ground and take it back out in the winter (presumably for heating, although nothing stops you from just using it as a heatsink only, and dumping the heat from the system outdoors in the winter).Around here, ground temperatures 4 feet deep (approximately the frost line) peaks at 50f, or about 40 degrees below air temperature in the hottest of the summer, and drops down to 20f or about 10 degrees above air temperature in coldest of the winter.To cool the facility for the 3 hottest months of the year (July, August, September) and given 100kw (or twice what the plan calls for) for the facility and 1 ton of heat is 3.5kw, we would need 29 tons of cooling, and factoring in cooling loss/heat gain through the building itself and peak efficiency of a unit is around 3/4ths of its maximum capacity we need about 40 tons. The other 9 months can be cooled effectively using just minimally conditioned air exchange. 8 hours a day of cooling is assumed. Also, $0.10/kwh electricty is assumed.Cost of air exchange system and ducting is not included, and would be identical for any of the cases. Also, this represents the absolute worst case scenarios for each, actual cooling costs should be much less. These numbers are very rough, and probably slightly wrong.EER: Energy Efficiency Ratio, or the efficiency of the system at 95f outside temp and 80f inside temp.EER to kW/h per ton: 12000 BTU/h / EER / 1000Standard air conditioningLarge scale high efficiency (13 EER) commercial air conditioning is about $800-1000 and 930 watts per ton.  For the three months of summer, that would be about 670 kwh per ton, or about $67.00.Total cost of ownership for 10 years per ton is $1570, or $62800 for 40 tons.Vertical closed loop, horizontal closed loop, horizontal closed slinky loopA typical vertical closed loop geothermal pump drilled 125-250 feet down (250-500 feet of pipe) would sink one ton to two tons of heat. It costs about $3 per foot for the complete cost of drilling and piping, or $750 per ton.A typical horizontal closed loop geothermal pump is done using 6 foot deep ditches with solid copper coils to distribute the heat. 150 foot long 3 foot wide installations of coils (about 600 feet of copper coil) with 3 feet in between them, and can sink 1 ton of heat. Installation cost is about $1500 per ton. A typical slinky loop geothermal pump is done using 4-6 foot deep ditches with slinky loops to distribute the heat. 1000 feet of loop sinks 1.5 tons of heat, and are put in ditches 150 foot long and 3 foot wide (or about 1.5x more per surface square foot than copper coils), with 3 feet in between ditches. It costs about $1300 per ton.The pump costs about $900 per ton, but efficiency goes up to at least 21 EER, so 572 watts and about 411 kwh per ton for the three months of summer, or about $41.10.Total cost of ownership for 10 years per ton for vertical is $2061, or $82440 for 40 tonsTotal cost of ownership for 10 years per ton for horizontal is $2606, $112440 for 40 tonsTotal cost of ownership for 10 years per ton for slinky is $2611, $104440 for 40 tonsI'm not going to consider closed loop geothermal pumps because they tend to form leaks around pipe joints and leak all their refrigerant away, especially in northern regions that get significantly cold.Evaporative coolingAt least one company makes an evaporative cooler that does not humidify the air and runs at 40+ EER and uses about 300w per ton and costs about $1200 per ton. That'd be about 216 kwh for the 3 months of summer, or $21.60.Total cost of ownership for 10 years per ton is $1416, or $56640 for 40 tons.However, evaporative cooling does not perform well in humid weather, and although Maine doesn't get like, say, Florida does, its enough to decrease the efficiency of the systems.So who wins?Surprisingly, standard AC, assuming any of these numbers are realistic. Even over the whole green battle, I can just install more solar/wind to compensate.Now, since we're already installing solar and/or wind, heres the numbers for standard AC with solar, assuming the cost of 670 kwh of solar (spread out over the whole year, using 1200kwh per 1kw of panel) is $391:Total cost of ownership for 10 years per ton is $1291, or $51640.Now, as I stated above, this would be for 100kw, or twice what we need. I specifically ran the numbers for such in the case we start renting out excess space (which I really want to do). If I want to meet the $150k soft estimate, the building and land is going to have to cost around $100k.
Since we're posting tables of information: http://caspar.adterrasperaspera.com/dmc/trade/ Huh. Thats not the worst idea I've heard today.Although, as a counter, GLBSE has turned into crowdfunding central lately. I think I need some sort of transnational popcorn manufacturing business.Edit: I don't think he meant to say I'm the largest, just that I will be the largest. At 1+ thash, that really is true, unless its a stealth farm, I'm not aware of anyone larger. I hope a list of boards that have enough current are listed. Its hard to buy new boards if you don't know which ones are insufficient. I've added Red Star Mining (RSM) to the swap list. Depends entirely on the game, but unlikely. Try -f 120 or -f 180 or -f 240. Ive added the sizes of the companies to the trade script.Using those numbers, we're bigger than 007, ABM, JAH, and FPGA.CONTRACT, but not JLP-BMD. Yeah, but you're limited to 150w total across the entire motherboard. Same reason you're boned if you try more than two 5970/6990/7990 and aren't using powered risers. With the way the minirig is assembled, they couldn't make it that way with backplanes anyhow, it'd require actual cables.A PCI-E-based board dedicated to mining would essentially just be an existing two or four Spartan 6 board with a serial to USB chip plugged into a USB to PCI-E host chip and all power supplied off a PCI-E 6 pin plug fabbed on a standard PCI-E board shape. Backplanes are expensive. Reusing SATA is the cheapest industrial internal connection by far. Its cheaper than using DB9 serial connections as well.As for you being unable to afford it... well, thats the way it is. These parts cost money. There is no cheap solution. re SATA plugs: they're just reusing an industry standard connector. It has enough pins to run serial over, so its fine. External 4x SATA/SAS has often been ran over Infiniband connectors because its cheaper and higher quality than using eSATA, and I've seen other things reuse SATA plugs. Its not particularly a new idea.You can't reuse ASICs because they're designed specifically to ONLY for this. Thats why its an ASIC.BFL FPGAs COULD be repurposed, but BFL requires encrypted bitstreams. No, opposite. I require people to trade in more bonds to get the same number of DMC than before. So, if you had 2 bonds of 1mh each, I would trade 1 DMC to you. You now need 2 and a quarter bonds to get the same 1 DMC, and next month you will need 2 and a half bonds to get the same 1 DMC. Thats funny, I originally wrote 20, but thought that was too low for some reason. eBay, the only place you can get $600 parts for $25 just because its an enterprise part and some IT department in some company somewhere is in a protracted war against their accounting department. They also announced 1gh in 40 watts. Doesnt Altera offer Hardcopy? BFL could very well be selling ASICs.... just SASICs instead of the kind we wanted. BTW, change the title of the thread. Its no longer 245. No, they don't use Spartan 6s. Hopefully industrial/enterprise and not consumer. Industrial/enterprise PSUs were 80plus long before Antec created that silly pissing contest between them and PC Power & Cooling, and you can even get ones that are 95+% efficient if you look hard enough.In addition, Gold is only ~87% at 100% load efficient. Consumer 120v PSUs can be Platinum rated (~89% at 100%), and 230v and/or Redundant PSUs can be rated Titanium (96% at 50%, 91% at 100%). Weird, I thought that'd be exactly what it looks like. A low power board that is loaded with serial ports.
If they can deliver on their promise of a Single 2.0 that does less than 50w and is as fast or faster than existing Singles, then I'll let them slide on it. Cost isn't an issue if we can't get the average person to buy dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware and proudly display it on their desk and show it to others, no matter who manufactures it.People need skin in the game. If you can manage to eldentyrell BFL's ASIC with 28nm FPGAs... this will have come full circle. Ahh, I was interpreting that as somewhere in the ballpark for 2U/500w and 4U/1000w sized for standardized rack mounting. Maybe I missed something, but I just read the entire thread over, I didn't see any indirect mention of it. All I saw was mentions that you don't want to announce things before they're a sure thing. Is that what you meant? Because thats totally okay, its just that if you could get a Single 2.0 that has, say, 30-50w power usage (instead of 80w), people would run these 24/7 in their bedrooms due to their increased silence (less power usage == less fan) and be more apt to buy these. Hint hint. Yeah, thats brilliant.But 270mh/sec? I wonder what the amps on that is.Plus, hes going to have to make an Artix 7 or whatever core as well.

Before I was trading 2 mhash in bonds for 1 share of DMC, now it will be 2.25 mhash per 1 share of DMC. Next month I will be changing it to 2.5 mhash per 1 share of DMC.The bond trading chart is available at http://caspar.adterrasperaspera.com/dmc/trade/ Dear BFL,I am very interested in ASICs in Singles. It'd be awesome if someone from BFL answered that question.Signed, the people who aren't trolling this thread, however few we are. Because I think we have different definitions of silent. My HHE undervolted to 5 with the GPU fan shut off and all the other case fans shut off, its almost silent. The slowest AFB1212 undervolted to 5v should be dead silent and last for about 15 years. Those two consumer fans should last about 3 before they quit. Nope, I shut my computer off when I go to bed. AFB1212s will start at 5v. Driving fans at full voltage are noisy anyhow.Also, WTF, my GPU drowns out my AFB1212HHE, thats 47dBA! Also, don't trust cheap fans to have accurate noise measurements. Almost every consumer fan lies or has an unfavorable pitch to the noise.Don't say its loud until you've bought and tried one. Powerful? I don't think you realize AFB1212 comes in many different speeds.http://www.delta.com.tw/product/cp/dcfans/download/pdf/AFB/AFB120x120x38mm.pdfThe slowest is 2000 rpm, 32dbA, 71cfm and uses 1.68 watts. As for the other series, they're just as high quality, I just prefer AFBs. Are you kidding me? Delta AFB1212. There is no reason to not use industrial fans, no cheap Chinese shit. Ima puttin my mod hat on here.Don't feed the trolls, even if the troll is your competitor and you're both making lots of money. Just don't do it. Does the ASIC announcement officially include ASIC-powered Single 2.0 units? I wonder if I should trade DMC shares for popcorn. Might be more cost effective. Not true. I read this forum with a bucket full of popcorn. The oooooonly way to fly. I think the hardware subforum should get a new rule. I am going to ask all the manufacturers to make official product threads, I am going to sticky those threads, and then we, collectively, are going to feel sorry for anyone dumb enough to troll in said official product threads.What does everyone think? I'm quite serious. I'm tired of people attacking BFL for no reason, and I will just start discussing long term depopulation plans with Theymos if this continues. Its completely up to the trolls inhabiting this thread on what happens next.BFL sending me a unit for inspection and testing would prove it exists and works and isn't vaporware. Angry neighborhood bastard mod, author of DiabloMiner, founder of Diablo Mining Company, and all around Demigod of the Bitcoin community here.Hows this: BFL sends me the smallest ASIC product they make, I receive it, and then I will everyone that not only does it exist, but it works. This should end all the trolling, and if it doesn't I will happily start modding this forum until the shit ceases.This should solve all the problems. I won't be doing that overnight, obviously, and it may be quite some time before I decide to do that.
Hey guys, I was just looking at the other mining companies on GLBSE.DMC, at 3.5gh, is bigger than 007 (0.80gh), ABM (0.83gh), JAH (2.5gh), FPGA.CONTRACT (2.8gh), and JLP-BMD (3.36gh), and we're closing in on YABMC (5gh) and TYGRR.BOND-A (5gh).Fuck yeah. I'm currently offering a trade for 2 FPGA.CONTRACT for 1 DMChttp://caspar.adterrasperaspera.com/dmc/trade/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.0 I've updated the bond swap table script. It now reacts in real time over bid/ask to adjust what I'm offering. Goddamnit Apple. Why do you hate OpenCL so much. Inaba, whats the exact number of mh per bond? fizzisist, whats the approximate amount of mh per bond? I'm pretty sure. I've started PSUs up to see if they're not fried due to their owner's stupidity (hate tech support, hate hate hate) and they stayed on until I cycled the power. You only need to short it to start it up, you dont need to leave it in there while its running. I've moved the bond swap table to its own dedicated Perl script: http://caspar.adterrasperaspera.com/dmc/trade/ DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN I've added 007 to the swap list. I'm assuming you're going to be producing Singles 2.0 and trading those for Single 1.0s. Well, if its that low power, a low RPM 12v 120mm fan undervolted to 5v probably could keep chip temps in the 40Cs and be silent enough that people could sleep around it. BTW, I hope your new gear is geared to only start fans when needed for small scale installations. I'd like to see more silent gear. Fucking Deepbit Yeah except DMC could very well be the largest buyer of miner hardware, and if I don't like what BFL now is doing, I won't buy their hardware in the future no matter how cheap it is, and would do business with Bitfury and Eldentyrell instead (who, really, should be combining forces right about now). So eldentyrell eldentyrell'ed existing Spartan 6 bitstreams, then bitfury eldentyrell'ed eldentyrell, and now BFL is trying to eldentyrell bitfury.I simply don't have enough popcorn for this. Okay guys, angry neighborhood bastard mod here.Tone down the trolling. Neither BitFury nor BFL have launched their respective competing products, and I think SC might give BitFury's extra optimized Spartan 6 rigs a run for their money. Also, as the founder of the Diablo Mining Company, I am looking at both projects in interest. We need competition for mining hardware, and you two right now are each others competition. Whoever makes it past 2mh/$ first doesn't win (but doesn't lose either). To start an ATX power supply are you do is short the green wire to ground. There are readily available solutions to do that. If you're going to use multiple different connections all using SATA connectors, remember that you can buy SATA cables in different colors so people don't accidentally plug the wrong ones in when doing maintenance.
No. Its a special corollary of Murphy's Law that I don't think has a name but most people are aware of: Murphy's Law is efficient, if you're sufficiently guarded against it in one way, it'll just strike you some other way. The generic version of that is just Diablo's Rule #1: Redundancy in planning is not paranoia. I lol'd. Yeah I already saw that. I'm going to see it when I believe it. There has been several attempts at ASICs, all of them failed except for ArtForz's, and he wasn't too happy with his attempt.  I demand it has a burger called "The Diablo". It must contain bacon. Preferably, thats all it should contain. Alpacas are naaaaasty animals. They bite and spit and smell and produce entire metric tons of shit. I mean, the shit I probably can sell to a local farmer, but the rest of that? Nothx, do not want. Actually, I've considered that. Such a thing isn't off the table. However, I would probably rent it out to other mining operations. High bandwidth things like webservers and such would be inappropriate for this facility. The shareholders entrusted me the money to follow the plan. This IS the plan that we all agreed to at the start of this venture.I think we're both saying the same thing but with different contexts thus different words.The plan was designed to deal with pretty much every threat to the continued operation of the company. As I said, I am not an oracle, I cannot tell what the future is, but I can tell you with certainty that there will be situations that will be very difficult for miners. I do not know when they will happen, I do not know what they entail, but I do know what variables I can control to minimize their impact.One of the variables that I can control is that I can pay a large sum of money now to make sure that even in the worst conditions the mining hardware is never shut off. Operational efficiency is a measurement of how many dollars per time unit I get per dollars spent on operating costs: not mh per time unit, and not BTC per time unit, and not either of those per dollar spent (that is a different efficiency calculation used for evaluating TCO and not minimum operational viability, for that you look at mh/$ and damn everything else) and this is not a fixed number.If operational efficiency drops to a point that operating costs exceeds dollars produced, the hardware is shut off. This can happen no matter if I buy 28nm hardware and no matter if 28nm hardware is still the best hardware available. If I have to shut the hardware off because its too expensive to mine, then I am losing money because the hardware is off and cannot do anything to stop it.Yes, that means I am spending more money up front and spending more money on infrastructure that is not mining hardware. However, anything I can do that buys me more time to not have to shut the hardware off during adverse conditions MUST be done. If I have a chance to turn known unknowns and unknown unknowns into known knowns, then I would be a fool if I do not do it. If you want to view this whole thing as prepaying electricity to get guaranteed cheaper rates, then fine, thats what it is.Even if solar takes 10-15 years to pay off, panels are typically guaranteed for at least 20 years, and its most likely going to be 30 or more years before they start failing to the point I need to replace the entire installation. And that is just for current generation hardware: several companies are developing technology to reduce panel size (which is really the largest cost of panel manufacturing) and using manufacturing processes that are less complex and rely on fewer expensive ingredients (such as rare earth metals); next generation hardware may end up taking in the 5-10 range of payoff instead of 10-15 and use a much smaller physical space.I really want to know why we're not seeing eye to eye on this. Am I explaining this with less clarity than I intended? Was thinking more like 45nm. Either way, I'm not interested in it. If someone comes up with a cost effective ASIC solution in time then I'll buy them as first gen hardware, but I don't want to run that kind of company myself. No, not "completely played off". This isn't a bank loan. I own the panels in full on day one. There is no money further removed from the DMC bank account after day one. I exchange money I have now for money I don't have to pay in the future. I cannot predict the future: I know I have the money now and I do not know if I will still have sufficient money in the future.And yes, by my logic, if cost of electricity is your largest problem... then lower the cost of electricity until its no longer a problem. Nope. $1 million would effectively get me a SASIC solution on 65nm or a very badly designed non-SASIC solution that would perform worse. You need $10 million minimum to do ASIC right and still have to sell them with a high markup.I doubt you'd break 5mh/$, not an efficient use of the $10m. You misunderstood what I said. By trading bonds with me, you are cutting your dividend yield in half. Over the short term, you're losing money, approximately 1/3rd of your total value. Over the long term, you're profiting. The people who are flipping cannot continually flip because it will drive bond prices up to unrealistic levels. It'd only take about 500 BTC to drive all the bonds up to 1 BTC of bonds == 1 DMC share.If they want to flip a small number of shares, thats their choice, but its no way to seriously invest in DMC.There are shares sometimes for sale in the 0.60s and it just encourages the flippers to flip more. In the long term, it actually is a profitable move if you're a big DMC investor.Just figure out what your best deal is with bond prices vs shares in trade, and put a bid up for a bitcent lower than that and catch all the falling shares.Now, at the moment? I'd flip tygrr.tech, seems to be the best deal.Its funny how you disagreed, then agreed in the second paragraph.Once I own the panels, there is no continued cost of operation. Electricity is paid in dollars not bitcoins. If the dollars produced by the mining operation is less than the cost of electricity, we're sunk. Solar/wind is an insurance policy in which if I consume 100% of it... it costs me nothing to mine in adverse conditions.Lets say, for example, tomorrow, difficulty suddenly changes to 10 million. Most of the existing large scale farms will shut down, and if this 10 million becomes the norm, they will shut down FOREVER.Lets say BTC prices plummet to 50 cents, and this becomes the norm. Farms shutdown forever.Electricity prices double. Farms shutdown. Forever.DMC, however? We're still up and running as if nothing happened.This is an insurance policy that is well worth its cost. The fact it can also generate revalue is also a useful aspect. Most? Your math has much to be desired. Its about 200 shares being sold by people who think they're flipping shares by trading me bonds and selling their shares at a slight premium. They cannot effectively do this without raising bond prices (although, for now, there IS a profit to be made). Existing investors, both those who bond traded and those who bought straight out, have been buying them as fast as possible because they see it as a good deal and want to take advantage of the flippers.Currently, DMC is using the existing funds to hold hash power at existing mining companies using the bonds issued by those companies.First dividend day is on the first (or approximately half a month into operation). I'm not sure where people are getting confused here. At no point have I said I'm going off-grid. I will purchase power at night at off-peak commercial/industrial rates just because I have to for obvious reasons. This doesn't mean there is not a net profit. The Plan includes example numbers for a break even installation, which means selling excess power to the grid at daytime and effectively buying back only what I need cheaper at night.EVERYTHING has a large upfront cost. I can't think of anything in the world in any industry that doesn't. If you think DM is not producing shares correctly, start DM with -d and count the number of attempts (NOT accepts), you should get roughly 10000 attempts every 43000 ghash. If you're just talking about data storage, there are commercially available FIPS-140-2 level 3 devices that can be unlocked under Linux such as IronKey: http://www.imation.com/en-US/Mobile-Security/Mobile-Security-Products/Secure-Data/ (the S200 series is SLC, D200 is MLC, and Enterprise includes remote wipe next time its plugged in performed by the unlocking software). Cost efficiency isn't the issue. It already is efficient enough that it only takes 10-15 years to pay for itself in Maine. The problem is we have no fall back if mining becomes unprofitable: that insurance policy is a very important part of DMC, it is something we offer that no one else does; additionally, having that second revenue stream is also a very important part of DMC.If wind turbines are not feasible for first gen power gen hardware, then we do solar. Its not like we have a choice, I can't go to Walmart and buy a fridge sized fusion reactor, there isn't many choices. I am still looking at both equally. Large scale wind requires permits and licenses, and even if I had all the paperwork done right now it would take about 2 years start to finish to get the first turbine up.Solar is fine in Maine, we generate about 1200kwh/yr per 1kw of panel measured on real panels installed in Maine. There are better places in the US for the solar (areas in AZ, NM and TX can do 1600), but there are also worse areas in the continental USA and moving to AZ, NM or TX for superior solar means we're also wasting money on air conditioning and the electricity to run the air conditioning.Basically, even though I'd generate about 31% more electricity, the cost and overhead of needing air conditioning would cost much more than the 31% I'd be gaining. TINSTAAFL.http://www.ecotechnousa.com/Portals/0/Media/News/SolarMap-US.gifThat map is overly optimistic and lists Maine as ~1500 kwh/yr and those areas in AZ, NM and TX as 2100, but it illustrates the point well. I think you missed something rather important. Buying power from the power company does not involve the power company paying me for generating power. Notice the large discrepancy between what you want and how the plan was written.In addition, difficulty will only go up, electricity prices will go up, and those two in combination with prices going down we can end up in a situation where it is no longer profitable to mine. If I remove the only constant operation cost (electricity), then we can mine when everyone else can't.Green power generation is both a second revenue stream and an insurance policy.
Never use the pool hash rate. It is trying to count using an random event (share finding). Eligius comes close on the 3hr meter, but its still usually ~5-10% +/- off I lol'd Yeah, its a 2400w PSU module. Something like that really should cost $550-600. Wow, I screwed up my earlier math. Where I said we're at 0.41 mh/$? I forgot to count Bitbond as 2mh bonds, I counted them as 1mh. We're currently at 2799 mhash @ 0.46 mhash/$.That means we're already in the upper 0.40s, and should pass into the lower 0.50s within 3 months. Those kind of modules (lots of manufs make them) are typically used in either redundant PSU housings hold 2 to 4 modules, or people use them with custom wiring harnesses if they have specific wiring requirements. Wait, you're already using redundant modules for the PSU? Thats totally okay then. Theres 2 or 3 1400w or more models out there, although they all use a different incompatible interface.So you're going to sell 2U boxes initially? 500w in a 2U could be easily done. Hrm, I was wrong. Athena Power sells a 1100w non-redundant: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817338021 Molex's peripheral cable uses AMP 1-480424-0, AMP 60619-1, AMP 1-480426-0, and AMP 60620-1 for the socket housing, socket, pin housing, and pins respectively. This is rated for 13 amps. However, these are commonly wired with 18 AWG wiring. Putting 13 amps through this will melt the wiring, let alone 13 amps on every single plug in the chain. And although it has 4 pins, only one set are for 12v, the other set is for 5v.Also, I hope you're using enterprise rated PSUs. You don't need redundant, but the largest non-redundant PSUs you can typically buy are in the 850w to 900w range. Not quite the 1100w you're aiming for. They do make 600-700w 2U non-redundant PSUs though, so you can always double up.If you can get them still mining at 1.10v that would be far enough for most people, since most Spartan 6s are ran at 1.20 to 1.25v now.In the US we use 240v single phase for electric ovens and driers and electric water heaters and larger air conditioners. Its provided as two hots and a neutral, with the two hots 120v lines that have their phases 180 degrees out of phase (so peak + on one is peak - on the other). Seems that Europe uses 3 phase 400v for the same reasons.If we're limited to 4 120v 20a circuits per rack (which is what I've been told is a common limit, and you have to pay extra for the other two), and each 4U uses 9a (= 1100 watts) and we place an empty U between each (for airflow/cooling and easy maintenance reasons), thats 40u used in a 42u rack, or 8800w.You shouldn't include your chiller, because a DC provides its own cooling. So, 22 amps of 400v is 8800w. So, either your math is wrong or you misstated something, because we're coming out to the same power usage. The market isn't very efficient here, sadly. The market is not factoring in the fact that I only pay out 50% of the bond dividends, the other 50% is going into the growth fund (which is now just buying more bonds). I would have to wait like 3 months or more to get any hardware I buy... bond dividends being cycled directly back into more bond purchases for those 3 months will start rapidly catching us up. We've already gone from 0.40 mh/$ to 0.41 mh/$ after one week, we should be 0.41 -> 0.43 by the next weekly bond dividend payout.DMC shares do not represent a fixed amount of mh, bonds do. Its hard to do the comparison, so thats why I have this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg901464#msg901464 You know, I should add this to my plan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDOcLros-w0The DMC DC totally needs one of these. Srsly. I've rebalanced the bond offer and added JAH.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg901042#msg901042We're issuing our first dividends the first of June, so make sure you swap in before then. People have actually been buying up all those shares. Its mostly all people who bond swapped for a quick buck trying to flip their DMC shares to rinse and repeat. I know where most of the straight out purchased DMC shares are, and they're all sitting on them. In fact, many are quite happy to buy up a lot of those flipped shares just so they can increase their DMC holdings.Generally, most of the almost 1200 shares sold are being sat on for the long term.As for dividends, yes, I intend on paying out on those. Bonds are virtual hash power to me, its no different than buying hardware at a slight premium*. I'm treating May as a half month so we can start paying out monthly on the first. It won't be much, but it will be enough to spur more share sales as people reinvest their earnings.* Buying non-BFL hardware in small numbers is in the lower 0.60s per mh/$. After expensive residential electricity and waiting for delivery, we're in the lower 0.50s mh/$. I'm buying bonds at a premium that puts us at in the lower 0.40s mh/$ in the short term, lower 0.50s mh/$ in the longer term. It ends up evening out and it also helps people buy into DMC and rebuild their investment portfolio now that Bitcoinica is unlikely to payout what they owe. JTAG might work but I don't think you're supposed to use JTAG that way. If you can make it work and not damage the hardware, go ahead, its your product, all of us will just treat it like a black box. BTW, BFL minirigs are using SATA connectors for their serial communication between boards, and Ive seen other designs repurpose connectors SATA internally or Infiniband connectors externally.BTW re power Molex: Remember, Molex chain has a maximum of 5 amps/60 watts of 12v, and 5 amps/25 watts of 5v. That is not per plug, and a lot of chains have 3 or 4 plugs on it. PCI-E 6 is 2 amps/75 watts of 12v, PCI-E 8 is 4 amps/150w of 12v, P4 is 16 amps/192 watts of 12v, EPS12v is 32 amps/384w of 12v.If you're putting 6 or 8 FPGAs on a board inside the rig, you're going to want to be using PCI-E plugs not Molex.You're probably only going to see GPIO on ARM boards meant for embedded usage, otherwise you're looking at a custom build of a standard USB->serial controller. Raspberry Pis are like $25 and have enough power to run cgminer, so if you can get them in bulk it seems they'll do what you want.Problem is you might run out of GPIO pins because you'd need one to every controller (one per 4?).Just whatever you do, don't put USB cables in the case. They easily get disconnected during transit and sometimes just unplug themselves due to case vibration or high pressure air cooling.Wait, you're doing 325 mh per Spartan 6 SLX150? Holy crap man. Is that just back of the napkin math, or do you have a working bitstream that can do that?Still, consider some method to undervolt them. At some point within the next 2-3 years for most users, the cost of electricity will exceed the value of the coins, but undervolting will catch them up for at least another year of usage.Well, on typical hardware, you shouldn't exceed 10 amps on 120v. That gives you a 1200 watt continuous PSU. Two of those will just barely fit on an enterprise 120v 20a line in a DC and hopefully not trip it, or one will fit on a household 120v 15a line (note: household lines _suck_, never drive them at >12a 24/7). There ARE servers that require 208/240v service in DCs, usually some nearline data warehousing server that you shove 40 drives in, but a lot of DCs don't offer this or require a special order for it, and no house in America would typically have that service outside of an electric oven range or dryer socket. It doesnt effect the hashrate much, it effects the aggression. Only in badly designed miners that it greatly effects the hashrate.On my 7979 at stock speeds -f 1000 gets me about 512. At the default of -f 30 it gets me about 556. I assume the difference is much larger in Windows. -f is fps. Set it to a multiple or divisor of 60. Higher is less aggressive. Unrolled ASIC design seems to be a waste. You have a lot of dependencies, and the dependencies come in nearly identical sets (the only real difference is just shuffling the output to put it back into the next stage). Hell, unrolled GPU kernels? They're not even unrolled, they just optimize the ordering and parallelization (ie, what FGPA coders would consider a function of routing). THIS IS BITCOIN! THIS ASIC gives you maximum flexibility in the design. The biggest problem with FPGAs is the fact FPGA designs must use the DSP blocks and the BRAM for storage of the constants. Routing is still a problem on ASICs but _you_ design the routing. You no longer have to worry about routing around things on FPGAs, and you no longer have to worry about paying for hardware you'll never use (like, for example, that high speed serial IO fabric isn't cheap, or is the onboard Ethernet controller and such).ASIC has a huge upfront design cost, but if we could sell 250k ASICs (or, approximately more chips than all the FPGAs currently in use for mining put together) it would be cheaper per mhash over the next 10 years by an order of magnitude. Remember, US customers don't pay VAT, so you've probably quoted a EU price that is useless for US customers. If you can get BFL Minirig prices on Spartan 6 hardware, BFL is screwed.Someone said in another thread that the sea of hashers design will have three types of cores, ones near DSPs, one near BRAM, ones near neither.That gives people mostly what they want.Use SATA plugs for the actual connector, but normal serial over it. SATA has 7 pins and is enterprise ready. The cost of serial is the complex plug, not the actual design. You could use a very tiny FPGA for the controller on each board to interface with the serial using GPIO pins or something.No. Use something smaller and lower power to run this, not some shitty Atom board. Use a Pi or that new $50 Via x86 board http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/via-launch-a-49-android-pc-20120522/Remember, if you're overclocking these, provide some way to underclock+undervolt these to extend the life of these once diff goes too high in 3-4 years. This is a big feature that a lot of people are asking for.Also, another thing, make sure the total power usage for the box fits so an integer number of these fits on a 120v 20a  (the most common circuit in DCs, you often get two of these per rack). ~1000 watts each would be fine if you intend on putting two on a circuit.
Thats only if you get real ASIC. SASIC still screws you the same way since its just a hardwired version of the FPGA. FINALLY THEY FIXED IT! HOLY CRAP APPLE, IT ONLY TOOK TWO YEARS!Also, the issue on AMD was AMD interprets the specification differently than I do. It costs basically nothing to fix it, and on GCN its measurably nothing. Well, thats the thing. DMC is different, and I'm just holding the bonds as a way to make money not sit. Buying small scale hardware just isn't worth it, and buying hardware now that 28nm could be here in 6 months isn't worth it either. Paying the premium isn't so bad: small scale purchases plus the wait of shipping plus the cost of residential electricity, I'm going to be in the lower 0.50s of mh/$, and the bonds in the long term are going to be putting me in the upper 0.40s. Its not that big of a difference. 100 shares of Diablo Mining Company https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.0 Because it seems very unlikely now that anyone is going to get their money back, I am still offering mining bond swaps for popular bonds on GLBSE in exchange for DMC shares.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.0~2/3rds of a BTC in bonds for 1 BTC of DMC. Clearly Kluge and Cognitive both should invest in DMC  Thats pretty much my analysis of this too. Everything that can lead to faster hashing is on the table no matter how insane or ugly. I completely agree. I currently have the most optimized OpenCL kernel for GPUs out there, and the most recent version took me 2 weeks of 6-8 hour a day fiddling to get it done, after 1+ year of working on previous versions.FPGA design is about 2-3 times harder. Theres a small difference, though. There technically is enough room to fit 2 full hashes on a Spartan 6, but due to how the leftover space is arranged, it probably will never fit (so eldentyrell fit 1 and a half). However, a shitload of tiny rolled engines would easily fit into weirdly shaped unused space. I think someone did the math and said they're almost at the equiv of 2 full hashes. That wasn't the bug I was talking about. That can only be fixed by going back and time and shooting whoever invented the UNIX console: DURR HURR LETS MAKE A VIRTUAL ON SCREEN TYPEWRITER, NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW Thats an interesting hack. Thats exactly the same reason why GPUs unroll the entire thing, just so the in registers are kept in registers instead of pushed back to local or global RAM. Someone has confirmed the new build fixed it. Update: Everyone effected by the problem, try the new build. As a note, until all of this is resolved, I'm still offering bond swaps for DMC stock to help people get back on their feet with their investments.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg901042#msg901042 OTOH, that $15k entry point means nothing if they're getting that high of a mh/$. That said, for a large scale farm, a $5k box or a $15k box, there is little inbetween. Especially since they've already sold like 25 of them and no one even has one yet. Arguably they were obsolete before they even came out. BFL has been purposely finding solutions that are very cheap per mhash, not highest efficiency, and generally thats been done with hardware no one wanted anymore. So, someone please answer me: Why is there not an Achronix FPGA sitting on my desk mining at like 1 ghash on a single chip on like 10 watt? OH SHI- http://www.achronix.com/products/speedster22ihd.htmlhttp://www.achronix.com/products/speedster22ihd/hd-summary.htmlI wonder what the approximate mh/w here is. BTW, re programmable VRMs. You're right, Yohan, they're expensive.So, what about just having a jumper that we can change to swap out some of the power circuitry (resistors, etc) so that it'll lower (Spartan 6 example voltages) from 1.2 to, say, 1.0 and cut the clock rate just as much (assuming FPGAs are stable at low voltages, I have no experience with this on FPGAs, only on CPUs and GPUs).
This so much. Ye typical DC gives you two 120v 20a circuits per rack and you have to pay for more at prices that are insane (but still cheaper than residential and small business electrical prices), and from what I've seen they max out at four 120v circuits at a rack. So, if all we have is 80a of 120v, we have to make the most of it as much as possible.Given 1 units per 10a, each unit is, say, 4u big, a 42u rack will hold 8 of these units if we put 1u space between each one (which I've been told is normal for high density units so they don't cook each other) (= 5u), 8 * 10 = 80a, so we should be fine in an average DC, plus we have 2U to spare. The only thing you need to focus on is total cost of ownership per MH without lowering the product quality like BFL has. A 4U rig with boards that can be installed after purchase would get a lot of people on board: however, 4U high density implies 2000w redundant 208/240v-only PSUs, and a lot of people in the US and a lot of DCs in the US simply do not have access to that.So, maybe a 2U rig with half-height boards in a custom case that does 1200w max? As long as the density is as high as possible, you will have customers.Plus, if you make this a generic rig and sell different sorts of boards for this, you essentially have an FPGA blade server. You could sell mining boards along with non-mining boards that your non-mining customers buy, and non-mining customers could very well buy mining oriented boards to combine them with non-mining boards to handle whatever they need.Mining FPGAs, as far as I can tell, are largely just FPGA designs with high amp VRMs and no external memory chips and no high speed IO wired in. If you just need computation power without local memory or mass IO, mining boards really would be useful to you.Centralizing all your FPGA products into a single FPGA-blade design would lower the cost for all customers theoretically. I think those URLs are not the URLs you meant. Using PCI-E connectors for the backplane connector (for connector only, obviously not electrically) isn't a bad idea. But how do you plan on putting all those boards in one box and not secure them somehow so they can't be accidentally disconnected inside of the case? Well, imo, all future boards from any manufacturer of any kind needs two functions: a fan controller and enough fan headers so that it will ramp fan speed to keep constant chip temp to prevent both fan failure (running fans at 100% load is generally bad, even industrial fans often fail after 2 years) and chip failure (due to thermal cycling).... and the other function is software programmable VRM so FGPAs can be underclocked+undervolted on demand so people can keep mining as the difficulty rises thus extending the life of the hardware for another 2-3 years.The only real request I have beyond those two mandatory features is 28nm on some mining industry agreed upon FPGA (it seems everyone is leaning towards the largest artix 7). Continued 45nm usage seems to be dead, it just isn't cost effective enough. Remember Cognitive is on the DMC bond trade list. 1 DMC for 1 Cognitive. By request I've added a new bond swap: JLP-BMD DM's console code is _very_ dumb. If output is double spaced or otherwise garbled, make your terminal wider until it stops. We now have an official CoinConnect group: http://www.coinconnect.org/groups/profile/57824/diablo-mining-company eligius uses its own pool software that no other pool uses. Its very well possible that it isn't interacting well with a newer version of Jackson... but I upgraded that back in January. I wonder whats going on, it doesn't make sense. Sounds like your terminal isn't quite wide enough. Not sure if people caught this earlier, but if a Spartan 6 maxes out at 1 amp each (assuming ~250 mhash per Spartan 6 with the most optimized bitstream possible), you could power 28 Spartan 6s off a single EPS12 plug (28 amps == 336 watts), which would really reduce the wiring mess inside of such a flat case.I wouldn't be against someone selling a 16-24 FPGA board that fits in a 1U case (slightly custom or not) with 6 or so 10krpm 40mm fans in the front and comes with a chopped down 1U PSU inside of it that just has the EPS12 plug and no other wiring and autostarts without ATX green wire signal. Well, I imagine a lot of people would be interested in an ATX/EATX sized board had 16 or more FPGAs that came with copper 1U heatsinks so they could drop it into cheap 1U cases. Except I think it'd require a redesign, you couldn't just fab 4 of your quad boards on one giant board and have it still fit in the ATX/EATX specs.I'm just putting the idea out there, because there clearly is a market for things like the BFL MiniRig and I don't think the MiniRig is the right answer to the solution. I don't understand your point. BFL came up with a good idea to do interconnections inside of their MiniRig. This has nothing to do with cooling. BFL does not use straight through cooling in their MiniRig either, which is a complete engineering design failure.Putting boards in a case does not cause cooling problems as the case acts as a channel. Please do not spread FUD, and look how enterprise computers are typically designed. Try a different pool. I have not changed anything that involves pools at all as far as I know. This has been largely the removal of code, not the changing of it.As for OSX, its probably a Lion update. Quite a few Mac users have bitched that every time OSX puts a new update out, OpenCL apps get slower. And people wonder why I called Bitcoinica a bucket shop. I didnt mention BFL's cooling as a good idea. I mentioned their use of a SATA plug for the USB connection on their Minirigs. That actually IS a good idea. You can get enterprise SATA locking connectors that won't wiggle loose during transit. Cases double as air channels, really. The way most of these FPGAs are built are not meant for straight through airflow, which is kind of silly. Typical "fan down" heatsinks are fail, too much turbulence to be effective cooling. Your numbers are probably in the right ballpark. Problem is, people want to buy BFL finished products not hack together an ugly solution.I'm just trying to help Enterpoint produce a product that people will want. Something that drops right into a generic 1U case would be a pretty valuable product... I imagine even non-mining FPGA customers would be interested in it. It makes more sense, but it makes less economical sense. In the long run, I only care about cost per FPGA, and a 16x board should cost less than four 4x boards or eight 2x boards or whatever.
Wrong. These manufacturers are already building 8x and 16x boards at _less_ cost per FPGA. Manufacturing largely has a problem where the cost of manufacturing a populated board effectively costs the same no matter how big the board is. In our case, a 16 FPGA board is not going to cost significantly more to manufacture than a 4 FPGA board.Who said 64x board? I said 64 FPGAs in 4u. Thats four 16x boards in 4U.Its an unusual design and connectors love to break off of boards. Its not a good idea and it costs money. There is the exact same risk in the even of failure: some of your FPGAs stop working.Why are you so intent on essentially hacking this up like an idiot? Thats expensive to mass produce, stop that.Lets try to figure out the total cost of making these the napkin way, and a quad costs $640 to buy.My way: per 16 FPGA/1U: $2310 for a 16 FPGA board, $90 for a Norco case that fits EEB and has 5 40mm fans, $50 for a Athena Power 1U 300w PSUtotal cost per 4U: $9800 for 64 FPGAs, or $153 per FPGAif something goes wrong: I lose 16 FPGAs minimum and maximum.Your way:Impossible to calculate because you're talking nonsense. What rack mountable case is going to fit 24 inches of cards? And don't say "just make a 8 FPGA 24 inch card" or something. The reason I specifically picked PCI-sized boards is because it is cheaper to produce PCI-sized boards due to the entire industry based around making them.So, sure, lets use rainbows and unicorns and say you can fit 24 inch cards in cases that are somewhere around 23 to 31 inches deep inside without modifying the case (removing unused drive bays COSTS MONEY, changing the case design at all COSTS MONEY). And each one of those cards costs about, oh, $1220 to produce, and you can fit 7 cards in there, so thats $8540 for 56 FPGAs, plus who knows what for some controller board (lets say $100) because you just really really want one instead of just using SATA plugs like BFL did for the minirig.per 56 FPGA/4U: $8540 for 7 56 FPGA boards, $100 for a board that does nothing but route serial connections, $70 for a Norco 4U case that fits EEB and has 2 80mm fans (and we need more than that so theres even more money wasted), and $160 for a NZXT Hale 90 750.total cost per 4U:$8870 or $158 per FPGA.if something goes wrong: You lose 8 FPGAs minimum, 58 maximum.So not only do I get more density per 4U, my solution comes in cheaper. You're trying to go for a modminer "blade server" kind of design, which isn't entirely appropriate either. Lets try this instead.Lets say you use a 4U case (3U won't fit full height cards) and used full sized PCI-shaped cards and no backplane at all (power and USB/GPIO (say, using a SATA plug instead like BFL is doing) is on the end of the card like GPUs), and you put 4 FPGAs on the card. The card will have to be 107mm by 312mm (or less: many cases, even rackmount, won't fit a full length card; 6990s and 7970s are full length), so you're fitting the FPGAs in a straight line instead of a quad configuration.Now, because of the heatsink requirements, you're going to have to fit these in double thick configurations (using, I assume, pure copper 2U northbridge heatsinks and forcing airflow through them from the front of the case), so you're putting around 16 FPGAs in a case (7 case slots, 1 overlaps with the case so it needs a 1 slot bracket)Now, if you pack these in even harder using 1U northbridge heatsinks, that'd be 4*7, powered using 7 PCI-E 6/8 plugs, or 28 FPGAs in 4U.Now, my 16 FPGA in a 1U or 2U case? In 2U, thats 32 FPGA per 4U, in 1U, thats 64 FPGA per 4U. I think my idea wins. Quite a few rackmount cases will fit EATX (330x305), thats 4.18 times more area, so that could theoretically fit 16 FPGAs (assuming ATX fit 12), and it'll draw about 200 watts (assuming 4x Spartan 6 uses 50 watts with the new ~250 mhash bitstreams). You can't just fit 4x existing boards in manually because you can't fit 376x252 inside of 330x305 (and EATX is pretty cramped inside cases as it is), so they'll have to place stuff differently on a new board. Huh, thats actually bigger than miniITX which is 170x170. ATX is 305x244, which could probably fit 12 FPGAs with room to spare.Maybe one of the manufs will start making 12 FPGA boards with the four outer mount holes fit for ATX cases and power itself off a P4 (16a 12v) or EPS12v (28a 12v) plug? There isn't enough bonds, but I think the larger bonds are growing to accommodate my plans. YABMC just launched a huge expansion project, for example. I really doubt I can exchange all 200k shares this way. However, if someone wants to try, they are more than welcome. I've recently answered this for someone else, so I might as well repeat it here.Some people are viewing this premium as strictly "buy DMC for 2/3rds the cost", which is not entirely true. Up front, yes, you buy the DMC shares for that, but you give up two short term abilities: dividends (they are cut in half as per the 50% dividend/50% growth agreement in the contract), and the ability to sell (there is not a huge demand for DMC shares yet as the company is still new). If you factor in all the "lost" dividends until DMC dividends increase past what you would have originally gotten from the original bonds, it evens out in the short term.Also, there is this other issue where if they keep buying shares to sell to me, the effective premium I paid/pay on past/future shares goes down because value increase. Not that I'm complaining, mind you, it'd help everybody in the Bitcoin world if bond prices started rising.Still, theres a fair bit to go on that. If people want to go buy 1000 shares of something right now and trade me, it might not effect some of the bonds too much and still be worth it for them and still worth it for me. Sounds like the version of Bitcoin ecoinpool is running is dangerously out of date. Wow, DMC is really taking off here.We've passed the 1000 share mark, and we're not slowing down.Also, I want to mention this so it doesn't get lost in the shuffle: someone traded exactly 666 shares of BMMO in. I love it when people totally get me.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg901464#msg901464 is acting as a live tally on the asset trade. I'm not going to leave this window open forever. Once Bitcoinica's destruction stops effectively halting GLBSE and everything is flowing the way it should again, the window gets closed and everyone has to buy shares the more expensive way.Don't wait, act now, orders in the next 20 minutes get free S&H, etc etc. You know the drill. Hey Yohan, I know this may sound like a strange question, but is there any mass produced case that would fit the quad board? It looks to be roughly the same size as a PC104 board, but I doubt any of the mounting holes match. So THATS what ZipConf is. Okay. For example, mtgox makes several thousand transactions a day. I wouldn't want to manually handle that. By popular request, I've added TYGRR and TYGRRMBA Well, with any site that needs to send bitcoins back out you need whats known as a hot wallet, ie, a wallet that ONLY has enough to do day to day business... you setup your software to send excess coins to a cold wallet (offline or otherwise hidden on another machine), and message you if you need to manually transfer from cold to hot.No one has $90k worth of coins in their hot wallet. Its not a Delta AFB1212. There is no reason to EVER use non-enterprise/industrial fans in a computer.http://www.delta.com.tw/product/cp/dcfans/download/pdf/AFB/AFB120x120x38mm.pdfThey make ones that are slower/quieter than what most people are used to from Delta (although, if you're worried about noise, taking a faster than and undervolting to 5v is often superior, as is ramping voltage on chip temp; it also reduces wear greatly). No, virtually every secure server uses those concepts. This is what I do: I disable root login locally AND through ssh (local root disable is borderline security through obscurity though, you have to know the l/p of people who can su before you can cause any real damage), and I disable ssh login with passwords (key only), and I also use keys with passphrases only (so even if they steal the key from me physically, they can't use it).Installing a firewall (ie, a handful of iptables rules) is somewhat overkill, you should only be running software that can be told to listen on specific IPs (ie, listen locally only). iptables kills network performance, so only use it if you must.Running the actual httpd/db/maild/etc on a vm that itself is stored on an encrypted image is rather popular. You can boot the machine and do basic maintenance on the VM (ie, back up everything), but you can't start it or read the image unless you have the passphrase. Its basically a ghetto way of doing LOM cheaply, especially if your VM has its own IP and the host isn't masquerading for the VM. Bare metal over VPS only stops one single attack: host reading VM memory. Which, for financial things, is worth it for some people.Having your own hardware coloed instead of leasing a dedi is not going to increase security: others still have causal physical access to your rack, so you'll need to rent your own locked cage if you want to take paranoia the whole 9 yards. Ive added ABM to the swap list. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.  Due to popular request I've added FPGA.Contract and YABMC for the trade offer. A lot of people are requesting this feature, and I hope you think about this for future products: use programmable VRMs. A lot of people want to undervolt their FPGAs to increase efficiency at the end of their effective mining lives and it would increase sales over the BFL juggernaut.
Historically its the most, but I've lost ground recently to cgminer... but then again, cgminer offers my kernel as an option.  1) Yes, you specifically send it to Diablo-D3:DMC (GLBSE has a weird subaccount naming scheme) and tell me the exact date/time and amount of the transfer (GLBSE gives you those on your portfolio page under transfers out) and then I send you the DMC shares. I also need your GLBSE account name.2) I'll take Puremining, 1 DMC for 2 PUREMINING seems to be equiv to the rest. I've added it to the list. Excuse me while I run away screaming.

A lot of people have BTC tied up in that Bitcoinica clusterfuck, and many people have told me they would invest in DMC but can't because of that, but many people also have significant GLBSE holdings, so I'd like to help everyone out:http://caspar.adterrasperaspera.com/dmc/trade/This seems to be fair to the owners of those bonds and for existing shareholders. I'm willing to pay that small premium just to get (virtual) hash power up to start growing the growth fund and pay out dividends for early investors.If anyone wants to do it, talk to me on #dmc or #bitcoin-assets on Freenode or message me on the forums. GLBSE changes a fee to transfer, so remember to have a smidgen of BTC in your accounts. I was thinking something along the lines of http://thermalright.com/products/index.php?act=data&cat_id=8&id=106That could almost work, just change the orientation, it should be able to cover three of the chips (one on the left, one on the right, one on the top) and the very front one could just use a http://thermalright.com/products/index.php?act=data&cat_id=8&id=107But thats like $200 worth of heatsinks, but it also might not need fans.Edit:http://ultimatepccooling.com/thhrifxchco1.html $28http://ultimatepccooling.com/thhrifxchco.html $27So, $111 or so. Thats extra weird. I'm going to have to think about this one for a bit. It doesn't make sense you have the bug and I don't... I wonder if its hardware related, because I'm on a 7970, not a 58xx. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here:Enough with the harassment. If they launch, then they launch, THEN you can make fun of their product lineup.Until then, let them quietly build their 2U rackmountable rigs by themselves. Hint hint. It'd be nice if you could find a heatpipe-type solution so people can put quieter cooling on their rigs.Also, the URL in your sig is 404. The hash meter has a number above zero, right? I'm wondering if Windows has a driver bug that Linux doesn't, because I'm on Linux /w Catalyst 12.4 using the runtime that comes with the drivers, and I can't reproduce it. I cannot reproduce that bug. BTW, I've dropped OpenCL 1.0 support, so if you're on SDK 2.1... don't do that. DM is supposed to detect if you're on 1.0 and refuse to use those devices, too. Well, assuming I coded that test right. Update: I've moved the remaining 136 BTC into split Giga/Bitbond.I've been talking to a few people who shall remain nameless, and 28nm miner products should be coming out in the next 2-3 months, and it would basically be a waste to order 2-3 BFL singles now when 28nm could be much cheaper per mh.Current holdings: 79 shares of Gigamining @ 1.51, 179 shares of Bitbond @ 0.655Not exactly where I wanted to go with this, but its better than leaving the money sit idle. Update:235 shares sold thus far.Its going to take awhile for mining hardware to get here once, so I've bought 50btc worth of Bitbond (76 shares) and 50btc of Gigamining (33 shares) as a short term stand in. Leaves me approximately enough to buy a BFL single to evaluate BFL products. We're slightly past the 12 hour mark, and 232 sold already. I'm sorry, what? I am not anonymous. I am a forum moderator, an early adopter, and author of the DiabloMiner software. If Bitcoinica was so legitimate, why did they get "hacked"? The facts simply do not seem to add up. Hey DeadTerra, DMC is now available on GLBSE. The day everyone has been waiting for is here: You can now buy shares of DMC!https://glbse.com/asset/view/DMCHurry up before they're all gone!
You just type the numbers into the calculator. The only thing manual is peak profit, where you keep adding months to the calculator until the "Net profit first time frame" field starts going down instead of up (this is where diff+electricity prices cross from profitable into unprofitable).Those numbers don't completely apply to DMC because if we pay nothing for power prices, there is no peak profit, it just slows down over long periods of time. Theres most of your problem. Windows has a false CPU usage reading bug when programs sleep for very long times while interacting with device APIs. DiabloMiner wasn't actually using that much CPU time. Thats a trick question, right? DiabloMiner uses 1% cpu or less typically. Thats up from 200 mhash, right? I wonder how many of these boards should have been equipped with big copper heatsinks instead. Update: I forgot how awesome the OpenCL API is.Also, re: previous update, I seem to be getting 1 extra mhash on my 7970 due to these changes. Glorious 676 mhash. Update: I've dropped loops and OpenCL 1.0 support. This should not be slower for anyone, and if it is, blame your drivers. So how would this change if I used a solid copper high performance heatsink plus expensive thermal paste like AS5? I have repeatedly told people that Bitcoinica is a scam and that Bitcoinica staff should be banned from the forums.Maybe now people will actually listen. Yawn, this forum is full of trolls, you're not bringing anything unique to the table. I imagine very few people have. Are they all shills? Yeah, see, this is the argument I had with Diablo Mining Company haters.Them: MOVE TO ARIZONA/TEXAS/BUMFUCKED EGYPT, MORE SUNMe: More power and money wasted for active cooling.Them: BUT BUT BUT MAINE IS COLDMe: Thats the idea.Seriously, I will never understand some people. Subed I already ran these numbers a few days back: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg887606#msg887606 His argument doesn't make sense anyhow. I'm a high count poster, a forum mod, author of DiabloMiner, owner of Diablo Mining Company, one of the first 100 Bitcoin users, and a very big advocate of Bitcoin usage, and I have made only positive posts about BFL. In fact, unless 28nm hardware comes out and its cheaper mh/$ than BFL MiniRigs, I want those to become the backbone of DMC (which, incidentally, would make me the biggest BFL user in the world). I dunno, I know people who are running GPUs even though they're now losing money just because winter fuel costs more per BTU adjusted for mining profit. Just as a reminder, you can pre-bid on GLBSE shares before the IPO opens. Someone seems to already has a share with his name on it. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.All of you, knock it off. Yeah, thats the thing. Doing that is rather expensive and time consuming, and I'd actually rather just pay Ztex their profit margin to get their expertise on getting this done. I would be much happier if I could source these parts from multiple sources, such as half BFL half somebody else. But Ztex would have to make me one hell of a good deal for me to consider them.Plus, BTW, none of these numbers include upcoming 28nm FPGAs and theres at least 3 companies working on that. If someone can get me 28nm FPGAs at 1.64 mh/$ or better, they will suddenly find themselves on my list. Those numbers were done specifically with no bulk ordering discounts, I originally did that math for a different thread that was comparing it for small time miners. So, hey, lets do the math using that calculator, so the comparison continues to make sense, and lets compare the best bulk deal they have listed vs what we'd need:ZTEX 1.15y in 50 bulk is 850 mhash @ 38 watts for $950, 0.89 mh/$, 22.36 mh/w1.15y in 50 bulk's peak profit is at 57 months at $143.39, or a 15% profit.Now, lets say ZTEX would offer me even better bulk prices than that because I'd be buying quite a few:ZTEX 1.15y DMC Edition is 850 mhash @ 38 watts for $516, 1.64 mh/$, 22.36 mh/w1.15y DMC edition's peak profit is at 57 months at $766.93, or a 148% profit.Similarly, that new Enterpoint Cairnsmore1 would have to be sold in the low $500s for it to compete with BFL. I'm not going to speculate on that. We'll see where we are a week after the 3 day waiting period on GLBSE is up. Plans never survive contact with the enemy, but its a little early to start with the doom and gloom talk.
https://glbse.com/asset/view/DMCMy new favorite URL on the Internet. I'm not sure what you mean. The plan I think you're referring is in the op post. Probably not all 200k shares, but at least enough of them to do something with. BFL's is the same mhash for half the non-preorder price of that Enterpoint board. Thats why I say that. Heh, if it is, then why are they bothering to produce it, no one will buy it. Added. It just barely beats the BFL single, but doesn't beat BFL minirigs. The IPO has been submitted to GLBSE, but they now have a minimum wait time of 3 days. Added it. Whats the $, mh, and w for the X6500? I'd like to add it. Okay, I ended the IPO amount poll 10 hours early.25k BTC    - 48 (35.8%)50k BTC    - 23 (17.2%)100k BTC    - 31 (23.1%)250k BTC    - 11 (8.2%)500k BTC    - 4 (3%)1m BTC    - 17 (12.7%)Average comes out to 203k.

Alright, everyone back to the main thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.0Thread locked. Okay, so, I ended the poll about 10 hours early.25k BTC    - 48 (35.8%)50k BTC    - 23 (17.2%)100k BTC    - 31 (23.1%)250k BTC    - 11 (8.2%)500k BTC    - 4 (3%)1m BTC    - 17 (12.7%)Average comes out to 203k. I guess 200k isn't so bad. The ride is going to be much rougher, though.Diablo Mining Company: the $1m USD Bitcoin Startup. a) Holy shit, thats 0.2166 USD kwh. You are getting raped over there.b) Thats not quite the same as generating your own power and selling the excess to make your investors more money. I've started a channel on Freenode, #dmc I thought that was the rule of two? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg887606#msg887606Not sure if everyone has seen the profit evaluation I did on FPGAs yet. I've updated all the numbers on whos most profitable:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg887606#msg887606ATM Lancelot is the most cost effective after BFL's huge lead. Taxes will be paid no matter what. If these existing mining operations are not paying for taxes, well, I'd hate to be them when the IRS comes. Same goes with insurance, you _require_ it, period, end of story.The one thing I'm offering that the other mining operations are not offering is large scale power generation to offset operating cost and provide a secondary revenue stream.I imagine that most of these mining operations will be out of businesses in less than 4 years, while mine will still be here. Well, thats the thing, GPUs are not merely the cost of the GPU itself, you now require a mobo+cpu+mem+psu(s) per 4-6 GPUs. Even that massive 18 slot rig that everyone is drooling over, that PCI-E backplane is expensive. You have to take in the WHOLE cost of assembly. With FPGAs, all I do is plug the power in and plug the USB in, the entire farm can be ran off of one box running bitcoind.Due to this fact of the additional cost of hardware each individual slot is very expensive... which means you're stuck putting as much mh into a slot as possible, which means throwing in 7970s (but not 7990s due to the "dual gpu cards always suck for overclocking" rule).And all the currently shipping products? They're all basically equiv in mh/w (except for bfl singles that use twice as much power per mh for no good reason). Don't get me wrong, I'm trying very much not to. But the price difference per mh is just so damned big that the other solutions just priced themselves out of the market. It irks me to single source parts to no end.
If they don't have a product to sell, I can't buy it. I wish them luck, however. I''ve just updated the plan to switch from ZTEX to BFL. I updated the plan to use BFL instead of ZTEX. Much cheaper to get of the ground and reaches full profitability much faster. I just ran these numbers in another thread, this proves why I need to focus on green energy production:Using the calculator at http://bitcoinx.com/profit/index.php using 1.5m diff, $5.00 BTC prices, $0.103 per KWHBFL MiniRig is 25200 mhash @ 1250 watts for $15,295, 1.64 mh/$, 20.16 mh/wEnterpoint Cairnsmore1 is 800 mhash @ 40 watts for $640, 1.25 mh/$, 20 mh/wBFL single is 832 mhash @ 80 watts for $600, 1.38 mh/$, 10.40 mh/wLancelot is 500 mhash @ 25 watts for $500, 1 mh/$, 20 mh/wBTCFPGA ModMiner is 800 mhash @ 40 watts for $1070, 0.74 mh/$, 20 mh/wZTEX 1.15y is 850 mhash @ 38 watts for $1359, 0.62 mh/$, 22.36 mh/wFPGA Mining X6500 rev3 is 400 mhash @ 17.20 watts for $580, 0.68 mh/$, 23.25 mh/wGPU mining is 2700 mhash @ 1050 watts @ $2600 for mobo, cpu, mem, psu, 4x 7970s, 1.03 mh/$, 2.57 mh/wBFL MiniRig's peak profit is at 57 months at $22222.48, 145% returnCairnsmore1 peak profit is at 57 months at $544.26, 84% returnBFL single's peak profit is at 47 months at $490.04, 82% returnLancelot's peak profit is 57 months at $243.54, 48% returnModminer's peak profit is at 57 months at $119.61, 11% returnX6500's peak profit is at 60 months at $25.78, 4% return1.15y's peak profit is at 60 months at -$75.37, 5% lossGPU mining's peak profit is at 24 months at -$917.51, 35% loss (Moved this post to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg887606#msg887606 ) The calculator is wrong because although it uses historical conditions to predict the future, it doesn't predict a realistic window.Now, if you believe the calculator is correct:BFL's peak profit is at 47 months at $490.04.Lancelot's peak profit is 57 months at $243.54.So, yes, the BFL will provide the best deal. You make twice as much.For Lancelot to be an equiv deal, it will need to cost about $250.Now, in comparison, BTCFPGA ModMiner is 800 mhash @ 40 watts for $1070ZTEX 1.15y is 850 mhash @ 38 watts for $1359Modminer's peak profit is at 57 months at $119.611.15y's peak profit is at at 60 months at... negative $75.37. Thats right, the best you can do is lose $75.37.Oh, and GPU mining? Lets say $400 for mobo, cpu, mem, psu, $550 for 7970, 250 watts usage at 1125mhz, 675 mhash each, four 7970s: 2700 mhash @ 1050 watts for $2600 or so. Peak profit is a loss of $917.51 at 24 months.Edit:BFL MiniRig is 25200 mhash @ 1250 watts for $15,295BFL MiniRig's peak profit is at 57 months at $22222.48 Some people think they've found a source for used or unwanted chips, which is pretty sneaky^Wbusiness savvy. Small problem, BFLs use twice as much power per mhash and thus take much longer to pay themselves off, and you also have to start paying attention to cooling problems as well. AMD has published a specification for IOMMU technology in the HyperTransport architecture.[1] Intel has published a specification for IOMMU technology as Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O, abbreviated VT-d.[2] Information about the Sun IOMMU has been published in the Device Virtual Memory Access (DVMA) section of the Solaris Developer Connection.[3] The IBM Translation Control Entry (TCE) has been described in a document entitled Logical Partition Security in the IBM eServer pSeries 690.[4] The PCI-SIG has relevant work under the terms I/O Virtualization (IOV)[5] and Address Translation Services (ATS).So, are we done playing wikipedia lawyer? No. IOMMU is a industry term for it. VT-d is an implementation of IOMMU, AMD, Sun, and IBM also offer implementations of it. Yeah, but what about the secondary income stream of selling power back to the power company? A lot of Silicon Valley VC types think I should just skip mining altogether and just go for power generation, but I won't go for that, theres too much market for more large scale mining farms. Well, then you should hope I go ahead with DMC. Remember to vote in the new poll: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78919.0 Honestly, I wouldn't invest in GPUs. Go buy yourself a dummy box to run Bitcoin on (if you dont already have a 24/7 box) and buy one of the quad Spartan 6 boards, ZTEX has the 1.15y (~$1300), Enterpoint has one coming out real soon, and BTCFPGA has their Modminer (~$1,000).I'd authorize a loan for that. You'd have about 800 mhash 24/7. 5% interest would probably be enough to cover it.Edit: Actually, on second thought, why not just start your own mining company? 50% of output after electricity costs for life of hardware bond. I'd go for that. Yeah, but I'm one of those investors, and I'm like, 100 times more awesome than any generic Gamma investor.  The pins, the plug and socket, and the wiring itself must all match minimum specification. With the right parts, you could do 300 watts or more across a PCI-E 8 pin plug.... as long as it meets the minimum specification for such. As such, EPS12 plugs are also Molex MiniFit Jrs, and they happily do around 350 watts.Kind of pisses me off they didn't for for 150/300 watts for 6/8 instead of 75/150, it would have been far more useful. 6 to 2x 6 is a really bad idea and I wish China would quit shoveling this shit on us. Essentially, it tells the very dumb users out there they can plug 150w worth of stuff into something that can only safely handle 75w of gear. Those two extra grounds don't just signal that 150w is possible, they're also legitimate grounds, the 5 pins of grounds is enough together to handle that 150w of 12v.And yes, 6+2 is the same as 8, the extra two grounds are on a 2 pin plug so you can plug 8s into 6 pin sockets without a converter.Also, Coolermaster sucks. Still no 28nm FPGAs? This is why switching to 8x Spartan 6 boards that use a PCI-E 6 is superior. Many PSUs have like 6 or 8 PCI-E 6/8 plugs. The NZXT Hale90, Bitcoin's favorite PSU, has 3x 6 and 3x 8, and you can get 8->2x 6 splitters, so you're looking at 9 boards, or 675 watts, off a single NZXT Hale90 750, or about 15 ghash. More like alpha version. Does anyone even know of the Spartan 6 bitstreams even work on them? I looked through the thread, but it doesn't seem to mention anything. Oh, he works for them? I wish people would indicate what company they work for, like in their sigs or something. Still, 4 Spartan 6s, ~800mhash for $640? That sounds very wrong.
You're half right. Yes, they both have 3 12v lines, but the extra two grounds on the 8 pin plug signal that the wiring is lower gauge (ie, higher current) and that there is also sufficient grounding available. Putting 150w on a 6 pin PCI-E connector is a good way to fry shit. Both wrong. Molexes are good for 60 watts 12v and 25 watts 5v. 6 pin PCI-E is good for 75 watts 12v, and 8 pin is 150 watts. I would like to say yes, but in the end, its up to the investors. Around $1/mhash isn't expensive, thats the going rate for 45nm FPGAs. Trying to get cheaper than that usually ends with a product that won't last long. $640 for 800 mhash sounds rather impossible.That said, I'm not going to do business with someone that hasn't proven themselves to the rest of the community. Does anyone even have any of yohan's boards yet? So when is the 8x version coming out that uses a PCI-E 6 for the power plug.Edit: actually, since this is all modular, why not a 16x that uses a PCI-E 8, it would really reduce wiring overhead and other bullshit. I think I found a possible alternative to ZTEX quads herehttp://www.btcfpga.com/index.php?route=product/product&manufacturer_id=11&product_id=50Anyone try one yet? And now back to our regular scheduled vote thread. mIRC is a scam. Just use silverex's build of xchat (not xchat upstream). http://www.silverex.org/download/Put a channel on freenode, thats where the rest of the community is. That... doesn't answer all of his questions though. It raises more than it answers, really. That... was a joke, right? IRC is free! Watched the video. Does Deathbylolipop have an IRC channel anywhere? Well, hows this. Everyone wants me to do a 51% attack? Fine. Get a share majority, pass a motion. I know you anti-Bitcoin people out there have money, put it where your mouth is. A 51% attack doesn't make much sense, anyways. The server software fucked up and is now letting everyone view the results and it won't let me shut it off.The only way to fix this? A new thread.

Plus, shitty ASIC or the best SASIC designs at >=45nm is going to be pretty hard pressed to beat 28nm FPGA at mhash/$ and they'll be in the same ballpark for mhash/watt.So, given that, I'd rather be the first major ASIC customer, and although I'd love for that to be my first gen hardware, I'm not seeing it happen. Thats it. Thread locked. You were warned.
Jesus Christ, don't make me turn this thread around. Your avatar image is trollgrin.jpg. What do you expect? Alright, angry bastard mod here. Mem, shut the fuck up and stop spamming this thread. Yes, 50% is high, but a lot of potential investors have been demanding 100%, and I have refused to raise it that high.I agree with a lot of what you're saying, however, and this is what I've been trying to tell people: the survival of the company is more important than profit. As it stands, short term operating costs will be taken out of BOTH dividends and payments into the growth fund. If anything happens that requires not paying dividends that month to keep the company running, then that is what will happen.I am only interested in the long term survival of the company for the most part. DMC is not a Wall Street bank nor Enron. After the initial build out, the growth fund can be left to grow for a year or more in anticipation for ASIC or unforeseen equipment failure or damage. No, thats what a 51% attack is. Its when you're 51% of the global network. It has nothing to do with difficultly. If global hash rate is 10 thash, I need to bring 10 thash online from start to finish to perform 51% attacks. It has nothing to do with profitability, it is a statement on how the attack works.If it ever gets to the point where DMC can perform one, we stop expanding otherwise it could collapse the Bitcoin network. rjk pretty much covers it.However, ASIC are on the table. So are 28nm FPGA if they come out before ASIC do. Just because I can't buy them yet doesn't mean I wont. And if they come out before DMC is finished launching? I buy them as first gen hardware. Its just that, at the moment, those ztex quads are the best bang for our buck. In fact, if they were to make 8 FPGA boards that took nothing but a pci-e 6 for power, that'd be even better.Also, solid state hardware does last quite awhile. The fans might not last 10 years (although I intend on buying these without the ZTEX HSF and use higher air flow fans plus redundant fan setups so hardware doesn't fry if a fan fails (ie, typical HA enterprise computing overkill)), but I would be very surprised if most of the FPGAs died around the 5 year mark. I have no interest in shutting off hardware that can still mine; combined with green power generation, older hardware can keep mining when it'd be unprofitable for everyone else.Its not that I dream about self-sustainability, but our largest operating cost is electrical power. Anything that can be done to lower or eliminate that MUST be considered. No one knows if diff will suddenly shoot to 10 times what it is now, or BTC prices drop to 10 times less than they are now. It would be irresponsible of me not to plan for these outcomes even if they are unlikely.Also, its spelled "caught". Whatevers newest, which is 12.4 on Windows, 12.3 on Linix. Because, for one, DMC does not pay a fixed dividend. It pays 50% of the profits. Green power generation exists to get rid of the largest operation cost mining has: electricity.Lowering operation costs is the focus of the company. Green power is a way of doing this. Green energy is subsidized in various ways in the US, I detailed this in the 4/27 update to the plan. There is no reason why DMC can't do both mining and green energy, since green energy lowers the operating costs of the company. Yes, but from what I've seen, most don't. Most of these companies have no fiscal responsibility. Its like watching the Dot Com bubble all over again. I don't want anything to do with that.Conversion rate doesn't eat the profit, and I'm not sure why you think it would. Lets say, in the far future, the single wind turbine and a few solar panels have turned into a large scale wind farm and solar thermal + graphite storage plant... to issue dividends, Bitcoins would have to be purchased at market prices to pay them out. Ergo, Bitcoin volume increases and the trend of Bitcoin prices turn to a more upward direction than normal.I am hoping for press coverage, but it is only a perk. It is not required by the plan. It is, however, something I foresee happening as a result of a successful DMC IPO. No, there is no 51% attack here. There is a business model, its been linked to from the op post. Doing the calculations in BTC is impossible because BTC prices change too quickly. Yes, I'm well aware that collecting 1m BTC may end up with a $3 or $7 million dollar IPO instead because of this, the plan is flexible enough to deal with that. However, until I can buy property and FPGAs in Bitcoins and pay taxes in Bitcoins and go to the corner store and pay with Bitcoins, what you're saying is wishful thinking... I look forward to the day that I can, but Bitcoin isn't there yet.USD is a factor and we can't ignore that; otherwise we end up with another 10k BTC delivery pizza.If the global hash rate is 10 thash, that doesn't mean that a 51% attack is 5... it means its ANOTHER 10. And even then, its not guaranteed (ask gmaxwell sometime on the exact numbers, its pretty difficult to reliably perform the attack even with that 10 thash).That said, yes, I will purposely back off if we get close to 50% because, frankly, its insane and its bad for investors. However, increasing diff to price out most GPU users IS good for investors. Nvidia and Radeon 4xxx have already crossed the points of no return, it is only time for even the most efficient GPU setups to fall behind, even without DMC. Being aggressive for a large scale mining operation isn't a bad thing.As for GPU mining becoming unprofitable, all you're doing is calculating cost of heating into your total operating cost math. Which, don't get me wrong, thats pretty smart... for the 2-5 months your part of the world calls Winter. The other months you're turning the A/C and/or shutting mining off. That is not something a large scale mining operation should do.Diff and BTC price are not constant. Given the entire history of Bitcoin, on average, diff is going up quickly and BTC price is not significantly increasing. For DMC, or any mining operation, worst case scenarios must be planned for. Even paying for electricity at industrial rates (2 cents kwh) is a liability.Its not unprofitable either. For us, we would have two income streams. Green power would be reducing our total operating costs, whatever is left is then sold to the grid: we can't keep it, the overhead of operating a battery array would just be too expensive. The other income stream would be the mining operation itself.Coal is heavily subsidized because it is expensive to operate. We're in orbit around a gravity fed highly efficient fusion reactor that outputs more power in a second than Humanity has used in its time on Earth. Solar and Wind are the only power generation techniques that are cheap to deploy, cheap to run, and will never run dry.It would be insane not to take advantage of this any way we can. Yes, I'm aware of how wind power works. However, it is not only off shore, it also includes near shore areas. There is no way you're getting a 10MW on shore turbine, but as I've said, its not like we NEED 10MW. As long as we're tall enough, we're avoiding most of the efficiency problem. Oh, don't get me wrong, telling the truth has NEVER made friends in the history of the world. But people have repeatedly attacked my plan without any logical reasons, pointing at the rest of the GLBSE companies and say that they're better structured, and I think I have a right to defend my plan and rationally explain why those companies can never succeed over the long term.If I'm going be asking for a million BTC, I better be damned sure I have the best possible plan available, and it has to be geared for long term survival. After a discussion on #bitcoin-assets I would like to make something clear.Mining bonds and shares that have a fixed output value DO NOT WORK.I have seen bonds that pay 1mhash forever. When the hardware fails, the owner has to, essentially, go out and sell more bonds and use that to replace the failed hardware, which ends up leading to a situation that you have zero mining company growth because essentially 100% of the profits are being paid out to bond holders and the only way to grow at all is triggered by hardware failure and new bonds are greatly diluted by old bonds. This is a pyramid scheme.I've also seen companies that pay 100% company profits out as dividends. I'm going to say the same exact thing, hardware fails, zero company growth, sells new shares for more hardware, but this time, old shares don't dilute new shares, its the opposite, it screws old investors in favor of new ones and thats STILL a pyramid scheme.These models are unsustainable, and I wish people would quit requesting that I change the contract to fit these models. This is why the contract makes shares have a non-binding voting mechanism, because this is probably the first thing that would be attempted to be voted on.In addition, due to the perpetual growth model of my plan, dividend output can go up. Yes, thats right, it can go UP. Those figures in the plan? That is calculated for the original generation of hardware only. 0.21 BTC (post December) per share dividend annually means 0.21 BTC also goes to the growth fund. After two or three years, the size of the mining hardware installation can be doubled. And two or three years after that? Doubled again. If after five or six years I've managed to greatly out pace the growth of the network, then we could very easily be looking at 0.42 BTC (post December) per share (which also means people might be buying shares from the first generation of investors for twice what they were originally purchased for).There is no other company on GLBSE that has a model that can sustain continued growth, every single company will be dead in the water within two or three years. Yes, I will not deny this. I am hoping that the entire Bitcoin community will support me in my venture. We're all going to have to band together to get this one done, I think. One, the news of a $5m Bitcoin startup gracing the front page of every tech and financial news site would be worth its weight in gold; two, for those months that power generation profits exceed total operating cost I have to buy BTC to send them back out as dividends and at least some of that money is going to stay as BTC and not be converted back out; three, the aforementioned news of a $5m Bitcoin startup is going to bring a certain level of legitimacy to Bitcoin and is also going to attract more companies to bring their business here and start supporting it.I honestly do think that someone investing into DMC is going to end up with a higher profit margin than if someone just bought and held 1m BTC alone. If I didn't think that, I wouldn't have bothered placing the plan in front of the community for their input to begin with. Its not that you did the math wrong, its that your valuation of coins has remained constant. Investing looks much more attractive in inflating fiat currencies, but Bitcoin isn't a fiat currency. What people are investing in here is a very large scale mining farm whos sole purpose is to drive the cost of mining down in a way that benefits everyone going forwards.Lets say it takes them 5 years to get the investment back counting in BTC (not including any profit made from large scale green power generation exceeding overall power usage), BTC valuation might have doubled or tripled by then, partly driven by DMC. Not only that, they are guaranteeing themselves future profits which they may be unable to get themselves by mining by themselves due to residential power costs and the high cost of FPGA.In addition, the DMC shares themselves might go up greatly in value if I can swing power generation profits far enough in our favor to make it an important part of the company and not just a way to stave off ever rising power costs (but thats a very long term outlook). Dividends don't solely have to be generated by mining alone if we're already investing heavily in green power. Must be beefier ones then. They don't I don't think. Then again, thats 38 watts. I don't think I'd like 38 watts going through a barrel plug. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here.So, anyone see those new quad FPGA boards ZTEX has? 
Thats the funny thing. A geothermal heat pump array is going to lose heat into the field, the more the closer it is to the surface. If I pumped enough heat into it I could theoretically put a green house on top and capture the heat. I've updated the plan to further cover green cooling and power generation further.tl;dr: Reducing operating costs is good, alternate income sources are also good, state and federal incentive programs are good as well. I've updated the plan to further cover green cooling and power generation further.tl;dr: Reducing operating costs is good, alternate income sources are also good, state and federal incentive programs are good as well. There are Federal and State rebates for various green power setups for both residential and commercial setups. http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/pubs/incentives.htm click on MaineEfficiency Maine (our local program) will pay up to $4000 for qualifying new installations, in addition to loaning at 1% APR up to $35,000 for energy conservation setups (although I doubt that would apply to DMC since we're going as green as possible from the get go), and other program incentives.There are probably even more grants and other things depending on how this unfolds, however I have not included them in the original plan because they can disappear at any moment or the government can just refuse to pay out citing some badly interpreted rule in the process and it will cost too much to fight them in court.If I can use them, fine, if I can't, its not a huge loss. Also, a lot of programs ended before 2012 due to budget cuts and other government idiocy, so probably by the time DMC gets sorted out many of these programs will also have ended.As for BTC prices going up or down, that is just something I'll have to deal with when I get there.As for which exchange, I don't know. GLBSE is the largest exchange, and this is where I was originally going to IPO, however there is at least two other exchanges that will be opening soon that have also both shown interest in my IPO.I'm afraid GLBSE just won't be able to handle doubling or tripling its daily volume, and I know the GLBSE owner is subscribed to this thread, so it'd be nice if he chimed in on this  I voted, it said most people think probably.  Vladimir isn't trying to launch a $5m company.Also, I mostly agree with your assessment of the exchange rate of BTC to FPGAs, however that illustrates a much bigger issue than just this: this is why a lot of merchants don't want to accept BTC, because the exchange rate is too volatile. BTC is risk for a merchant that has a low profit margin, thats just the way it is; although I still support ZTEX and BFL doing sales in BTC along with USD.But yes, if BTC goes up more than I anticipate, I end up with a bigger mining farm. I agree with that assessment 100%. If BTC drops to $4.99 even though I'm holding 1/8th of all Bitcoins, the alternative I suspect would have been much worse.As for it not fitting, realize what I'm purchasing: a building and hardware to go in it: I can size how much hardware I have depending on how much money I have left. If I have more than a planned, I buy more than I planned, if I have less than I planned then I buy less than I planned. Scaling it over a magnitude more or less mostly works, but if I go down too far I end up with an empty building. I think you misunderstood. If someone handed me 1m BTC today and I tried to sell them all, this would crash the BTC market and we would never recover. If I put a safety margin in (ie, don't convert to USD below $5), then the market doesn't crash.Buying FPGAs directly in BTC means that I don't have to deal with the inefficiency of converting BTC back to USD. Since BFL and ZTEX's biggest markets are the Bitcoin community, it makes sense to ALSO accept BTC. Its up to them, however.Yes, I will never be able to sell an FPGA for what I bought it, but not because of BTC value doubling: its because of depreciation. I do not intend on selling FPGAs that still function unless they become a liability (ie, 45nm node size when 12nm is coming out to replace 28nm, or ASIC comes out, or something along these lines). Running hardware until it dies over a 5-10 year period seems to be the most cost effective.If BTC value doubles, obviously I'm no longer looking at a $5m USD plan, its a $10m USD plan. Likewise, if it plummets, I can adjust accordingly the same way. I am merely trying to find the most efficient and most fail-proof way of getting things done, my plan seems to be able to adjust to the situation the most.If someone has what they think is a better plan, please, IPO with it. I would like to see it happen. If you look at small scale operations that do less than 1 thash, then yes, what you said is true. However, adding ~4 thash of mining power when the global rate is only ~10 thash, that will cause the difficulty to spike causing a large number of GPU miners to quit.This will drive BTC value up (as they revert to buy and hold tactics) and increase the value of BTC.In addition, the news of someone trying a 1m BTC startup will drive BTC prices up as people start taking Bitcoin seriously.Also, BTC<->USD is a two way road. People can just convert their USD to BTC just so they can invest. I imagine there will be larger investors doing this just to invest in the new generation of companies that (hopefully) Diablo Mining Company is the first of. You made the case more eloquently than I could. This is exactly what I've been trying to say.This is also why I did the bulk of the calculations in USD: most of the community still thinks in fiat. I believe a large scale operation like this can increase the value of Bitcoin, otherwise I wouldn't be trying it to begin with. What people should look at is what the proper balance of "raw compute power", "future proofing", and "difficulty spiking/BTC price dropping".My plan seems to tackle all three equally, I buy a lot of power efficient raw compute power early on, half of the company profits go to increasing the size of the company (which tackles the future proofing aspect since I can just buy more efficient FPGAs or if ASICs come out, those), and green power drives the operating cost down which makes it harder for a difficulty spike or BTC price drop from wiping us out.If people think buy and hold is superior to this plan, then by all means, vote no and do what you intend to do. I don't personally think that buy and hold is the best plan available, you can't make value out of nothing. 5k is too small to deal with. I wouldn't even consider even starting until the first 100k of the funding rolled in.Its not that I'm saying go big or go home, but for this to be profitable and worthwhile for the community I have to think of the long term over the short term. Short term thinking is what got the world in trouble over the past 5 years with the banking system and such. I have to plan for every possible outcome, and one of those outcomes involves something happening to make it difficult to profit: even that I must consider a way to keep mining in the face of that.Its not easy, but I think it can be done. It will just be very expensive up front. This.If I issue multiple sets of assets, then I'm making it harder for early investors to exit, and I'm also not treating both early investors and later investors equally. It WILL cap share price to 1BTC for some time, but once that cap is gone, the share price is free to taxi to the runway and take off.I don't need all 1M BTC on day one, but I do need it eventually. Buying a building, not dealing with green power until a year or two later (again, to cut down operating costs just in case BTC prices plummet or diff spikes), and putting a single FPGA in it is in no way cost efficient, so obviously there is going to be a minimum funding level before I can do anything of value. Property in Maine is cheaper, and moving would be yet another expense that I really don't want to tack on. When you only have $5M, and every dime needs to count, then I will avoid it as long as possible. Washington and Oregon also have wetter weather which means I have to invest more in air conditioning (just to condition it, not cool it flat out for about half of the year give or take).I agree, $5M is a serious sum of cash. However, if I was an investor on this, I wouldn't care if the guy had a track record of successful startups: none of them were denominated in BTC. In fact, we have NO people like that, no one has ever tried this in the BTC community. There are no BTC startup superstars. Someone has to be first. Yes I'm aware maintenance is a large issue. This thing will become a full time job for me until the day I die. I have no problems with this.And yes, I'm aware, multi-MW turbines are extremely tall, need especial licensing, you have to fight the NIMBY crowds, etc. HOWEVER there ARE wind turbines popping up in Maine here and there. Clearly, some people DO like the idea.Or I can promise not to dip the value below $5 and split sales across all the USD exchanges by volume.Assembling the farm and keeping it running is the least of my worries. Any competent rack monkey can do this.I don't disagree with your analysis on initial cost, however.Because if everyone buys more BTC to invest in this then BTC prices go up which means its easier to sell the BTC to go invest it.I am, however, hoping I can just buy from ZTEX and BFL as a one time large purchase directly in BTC. This would solve many problems. Yes, adding hashrate DOES increase difficulty. In this case, one third.Block reward halves, but value of BTC potentially increases.Solar panel roll out would take an acre of land. Maine is not the worst part of the United States for solar. Although, I've been rolling around the idea of seeing if I can privately own a large scale wind turbine. A 5MW turbine generating at least 1.5MW on average would, oh, be about 10 times more power than we need. And I wasn't looking for solar for green reasons, I was looking for solar to be able to mine no matter what BTC is valued at. No power cost means I can mine even when BTC is 0.01.Yes, many Bitcoiners would probably not trust a nobody. I am not a nobody. I was a very early adopter, and I would like to see Bitcoin succeed.GLBSE is not the only stock exchange.And I'm not sure if I want to see investors using USD. It sort of defeats the purpose of building this company in the first place.Edit: Apparently large turbines like that, total installation cost is about $1m per MW. That really isn't that bad, we only need about 200 kw of constant power and I'd like to be selling power more than buying it to keep operating costs low. For the record, no, I wouldn't sell all million at once, that would be insane and suicide. It may take me an entire year to sell it all in the absolute worst case. Its on the op post. Left is 15 second average, right is forever average. Nope. Any step that doesn't involve minimizing the operating cost is a step in the wrong direction. I think this is a shit or get off the pot moment for Bitcoin. Either we can float startups that are small by silicon valley standards, or no one will take Bitcoin seriously.I honestly think this is the right time for Bitcoin to finally take off. A lot of us, including me, have put a lot of hard work and effort into making Bitcoin, and I think everyone would like to see that hardwork finally pay off.BTW, the implications are, by this time next week, we could be looking at Slashdot and Hacker News headlines of "Company IPOs with $5m using BTC alone". I imagine BTC prices would double or triple with the news. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78052.0Started a poll. Vote now. The plan is to issue 1 million shares (no additional shares or bonds forever, although splits might happen if/when GLBSE supports it) at 1 BTC each..Poll is set to show results after 7 days, poll will only run for 7 days.Contract: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg861305#msg861305Plan: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.msg867837#msg867837
Just unzip the binary zip and use DiabloMiner-OSX.sh, its just like using it on Linux. Can't predict difficulty, however. I've seen it swing wildly up AND down. No, I already included a disclaimer for that: I have not factored that in, and I think BTC prices will double because of it. No, I did the math wrong. Its 3.5 thash, not 13. Operating costs. Although, the fun part there, I think the federal government still has tax rebates on solar panel deployment, so taxes work both ways. (The plan has been moved to the op post) I've emailed GLBSE to see if I can get the 8BTC back. Potential investors and I are just not seeing eye to eye on this, and its a waste of time and money to try to continue. I want to make sure no one can get a stranglehold on the Bitcoin economy, but no one really seems to either think that can happen (stealth privately owned mining companies, etc), or they don't see its worth plunking the money down as a sort of insurance. Uh, no. All USD in existence is measured in the quadrillions. Our annual Federal budget is more than 2 trillion. The war in Iraq cost more than 2 trillion.The difference here is, Wall Street valuation is not based on reality, and USD is inflationary. Your comparison is rather pointless. So, Ive been thinking, that second plan where these are essentially 10 year bonds makes no sense financially. Basically, I take all the risk and get none of the reward.In fact, where I was originally going to be paying operating costs out of the growth fund, this is still making the risk all mine while I get none of the reward.So I think I'm going to change the contract before the IPO issues shares to something along the lines of operating costs come out of both sides. Since a lot of people are absolutely convinced I can't raise the 1 million BTC (which says more about their lack of faith in the Bitcoin community than anything), then there is no way I can keep operating costs low enough early on.Both I and all the investors should split the risk and reward so it is fair for both of us. I am willing to invest a lot of time into this, and, in the long run, my money. The only reason investors exist is because they either can't invest their time or they won't, but they still want some of the action, but entrepreneurs are willing to cut them in on the action in exchange for capital. Which is partly why I wish to start this mining company. I simply don't trust one of the other mining companies not to become big enough that they're a security risk. No, I said 1 million, not 10. Although, yes, it'd take 83 years.Pretend I said 5,000 shares a month, that seems more reasonable, it would take almost 17 years to sell them off if I did my math right. So I want everyone's opinion on this. I'm generating 1 million shares no matter what.Would you rather pay 1BTC for each now, and get 50% of mining output.... or pay market prices and get paid nothing for 10 years, 100% goes into growing the mining company, and I sell 1000 shares a month at market prices. After the 10 years, I pay 100% of the output minus expenses to run it? Yes, I'm aware it will take a LONG time to convert BTC into USD for much of my purpose. And yes, I'm aware how the VC process works (I know people who have gone the Silicon Valley startup route). I'm trying something new. I think it is going to be possible to crowd fund large scale business using Bitcoin without going through things like YC or Kickstarter.What I'm planning on doing is building a small scale DC just to host mining hardware, but it is going to take quite some time to get there.I'm willing to put the next 10 years of my life into this, I think Bitcoin has a future but it is going to take effort to get there. Read the contract. The shares entitles dividends of half of what the pool produces, not a fixed amount.Lets say, oh, 10 years from now, 12 or 16nm FPGAs are too expensive to hash with, I can still be running 28nm or higher processes purely on solar and be mining, effectively, for free, and not only that, I'd probably be mining most of the Bitcoins.This is a very long term investment project, and I think this is going to be the only way to keep profiting a decade from now. 1 million BTC is over $5 million dollars at current market prices. $5 million dollars is enough to, say, build out a small scale DC, install a small amount of solar* to deal with the possible future where even the most efficient FPGAs are too expensive to run.* The cost of solar is not the panels, but the batteries. If I consume all the solar power the panels produce, I don't actually NEED the batteries.Already have a thread for it here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77469.0 So, guess what I finally decided to do? I'm going to IPO my own mining company on GLBSE, ticker DMC.I'm seeking 1 million BTC to make this the largest mining company ever. Some people think I'm insane, and, who knows, I might be. But its worth a try, right? Probably solo if the farm gets as big as I want it to. Well, I imagine 1m BTC worth of people want to continue profitably mining when no one else can. If I'm wrong, this is going to be a waste of 8BTC. Yeah, but you didn't rebuild your kernel module and reboot with it. 12.1 and up use a new one, I think AMD screwed up because Catalyst usually refuses to start up with any HW accel features if the wrong kernel module is loaded, 12.1 don't follow that behavior and its confusing for users. There is nothing in the contract to actually allow acquisitions, nor am I willing to entertain offers to do so either.The only reason I have shares represent 0% of company assets as the assets, until the event of liquidation, are owned by the growth fund. Assets can be sold, replaced, decommissioned, or otherwise removed from the asset pool for any reason I deem necessary to continue profiting (such as upgrading, the hardware actually dying, switching from FPGA to ASIC, etc).And yes, that includes selling not-quite-dead hardware on eBay and putting the proceeds back into the growth fund. The contract fully lets me do that, nothing in it lets me leaking asset value out through any method under than the depreciation of the assets themselves (ie, plugging them in and turning them on).Now, you do bring up a good point, this agreement DOES allows me to purchase other mining companies and hold them as assets; but as I said, I would never entertain BEING purchased. I would rather liquidate the company than let it be purchased.tl;dr: Shares only entitle you to dividends.
Yeah. One is 2.1, ATI namespace, the other is 2.2 through 2.6, AMD namespace. Trial and error to guess which -D to use, but DM lists it on startup. DM is no longer optimized for 2.1, so you want 2.6, which means you really want Catalyst 12.3 which means do not install SDK 2.6 on top of it.Yay AMD. You have two SDKs exposed. Use -D 1,2 or 3,4 to select the right one. Currently, less than 1 GH/sec. I'm obviously building this from the ground up.There will be 1 million shares forever (I will not seek to ever create more), but I would like to get 1BTC each for them. Yes, I'm aware thats about 1/8th of currently circulating Bitcoins.

Extra space in the facility can be rented out to other mining operations or non-mining customers.The funding will be used to focus on three areas: a dedicated facility that can not only house our hardware but also have spare room to be leased out, purchasing high efficiency mining equipment, and purchasing enough green power generation to eliminate the operational overhead of electricity prices to allow the mining company to continue operating in profit-adverse situations (such as Bitcoin difficulty rapidly increasing, or Bitcoin prices rapidly dropping).The FacilityA dedicated facility will be purchased or built on un-/under-developed land located in Maine due to our cold 6 months out of the year environment and lack of natural disasters. $150k will be set aside for this purpose as a soft estimate.The HardwareDMC will pursue any technology that gives the best performance per dollar and the best returns to our investors. We will never purchase Butterfly Labs hardware.Post-Spartan 6 large scale mining hardware will be around for $16,000 for 50 ghash each, using 1200 watts each. Assuming we buy 40 units (or approximately whats left of the $1m after the purchase or construction of the facility with enough margin to maintain the construction of a green power generation system):Hardware cost: $640,000Mining power: 2000 ghashPower usage: 50,000 watts, or about 438,000 kwh a year.Operating cost: about $43,800 a year at 0.10 kwh maximum cost.At approximately 1.5m Bitcoin difficulty and Bitcoin prices north of $5, 40 units should produce about 1344 BTC a day or about $6,720 a day or about $2,452,800 a year.The Part Where We Kill Operating CostsUp here in Maine, each 1kw of solar panels costs about $700 and produces about 1200 kwh a year (with weather patterns and nighttime factored in). Large scale wind is about $1000 per kw, but takes up less room and also generates at night, and many communities in Maine are putting up wind turbines due to excellent wind conditions.To offset 438,000 kwh of usage a year, I'd need 365 kw of solar, or $255,500.Hardware cost with solar: $895500.Thats $895500 for a mining company that can operate in the most adverse conditions (ones that would bankrupt any other mining company) that can make $2.4 million a year.What does the investor get out of this?The contract will revolve around splitting revenue in half: one half goes to dividends, one half goes to covering operating costs and a growth fund.Given that, I am asking for 200k shares at 1 BTC each. Each share will pay approximately 0.05 BTC a month (calculated using 1.5m Bitcoin diff), which will drop to 0.025 BTC sometime in December due to the block reward cut.Using this math and calculating on the 0.025 BTC per share dividend alone, investors should be making a profit in less than 2 years, factoring in a doubling of difficulty as worst case.Share ContractThe revenue will be split in two parts:    1) 50% of all mining revenue will be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends (henceforth referred to as "dividends"). These dividends will be paid monthly, split evenly among all shares regardless of class or issuing date.    2) 50% will be used to invest in additional hardware, decrease the cost of mining, and/or pay for long term operating costs of the company (henceforth referred to as the "growth fund").Operating costs (electricity, repair work, unplanned maintenance, employee related costs, taxes) will taken out of the growth fund. Any operating costs that exceed the ability of the growth fund to cover will be borrowed from the dividends until covered. Dividends borrowed in this manner will be paid during future payment period(s) using the growth fund until repaid in full.    Each share represents 0% of the ownership in the company assets. In the event of liquidation, 100% of the revenue from sales of the assets and 100% of the growth fund, minus any expenses incurred from the operation or liquidation of the company will be paid to shareholders.    The operator of the company retains two special rights, regardless of the number of shares held by the operator: 1) the right to raise a motion, 2) the right to end operations and liquidate assets without motion. Any motions raised by shareholders will be considered non-binding advisory votes. Never use the .run files from AMD, even if you use it to produce .debs. It tends to badly break shit. No no no, make it sound like HAL. If we're going for classics, HAL > WOPR. Its Java, the binary is for all platforms. You downloaded from git? Unless you plan building it with Maven, download the binary zip instead. This is detailed in the op post. Dear Lord. Yeah, and now cgminer also has the kernel among the ones it supports. I think I delivered on the promise as best as possible, although I'm still looking for new ways of beating the compiler.To be fair, AMD's GCN compiler (not the same as the 5xxx/68xx/69xx compiler(s), seems to be ground up brand new) is doing a pretty good job, I haven't been able to find any useful optimizations after I did that two week brutal death march of tuning for 2.6.I think all in all, the community benefited from their investment. You asked who to report to. LKML. No, it just doesn't waste the space internally. Sounds like driver bug, did you bother to report it? I think it might be driver bug. Not many can play Dueling Banjos NetworManager is not part of Linux, just commonly used on it and part of the GNOME desktop.Most people don't bother to use it on dedirigs, they just set up the network interface manually. Virtually every miner in here runs Linux. 230 at stock vs 175 at stock. 79xx has the automatic memory voltage control, but has a limit of 150mhz lower than core. However, at, say, 1125mhz like mine is, moving memory from the stock 1375 down to 975 cuts down on GPU temps about 5c. On my 5850, which didn't have automatic memory voltage control, I had to drop the 1000mhz memory down to below 300 to get the same 5c drop. Holy crap. I just noticed that.
All FX series chips have it, none of the rest do. That includes 790FX, 890FX, and 990FX. Its really a downscaled version of their server chipset, not a member of their desktop series. IOMMU is the literal description of what that is, both Intel and AMD (plus Sun's and IBM's) are called that. All it does is allow two way remapping of hardware interrupts and device-side device memory map remapping (such as unified remaps of device->system ram and cpu->device ram).If you're going to do any virtualization of suitably complex devices, you need IOMMU. This includes, but isn't limited to, GPUs, higher end NICs (10gbit and up typically), high end RAID controllers, etc. Write a .bat file with notepad and put it in the same dir with DiabloMiner-Windows.exe, type out the entire command in it. Then just double click on the .bat file and it should work if you did it right. Run two, use -D 1 -f 120 on one, -D 2 -f 1 on the other. Keep upping the first one until your game stops lagging, you'd probably be better off just shutting the miner off when gaming. -f is best as a multiple or divisor of 60. (1, etc etc, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, etc etc) Yeah, you need to disable as many devices filling up address space blocks as possible. It might be able to get more than 4 on 32 bit Linux just by doing that, and also by putting less memory in it (but its hard to get less than 1gb DDR3 sticks that aren't crap or volted wrong as the DDR3 manufacturing process was targeting chip sizes for 1gb minimum sticks). Sounds about right, AMD quotes 175 for 7870. Open xterm, uname -a BAMT is worthless shit if it isn't  a 64 bit Debian build already. You can't even get more than 4 cards working in 32 bit Linux, sometimes only 3. #firstworldproblems http://news.softpedia.com/newsImage/Leaked-AMD-Radeon-HD-7980-Pegged-for-April-1-st-Release-2.png/ Why are you using Guiminer? Use DiabloMiner or cgminer instead. DiabloMiner has a kernel optimized for GCN.Anyhow, by my calculations, a 7870/1ghz should get about 375, at 1.1ghz about 412. Depends on the CPU arch's address space (hint: 64 bit processors, internally, do not have 64 bits of address space, its usually something like 40 or 48 bit). It also depends on how the BIOS allocates space for the PCI-E GART window, some blindly select huge address spaces no matter what the device will actually use leaving you enough room for 8-10 devices. Yeah, but when will GLBSE get driven underground because its not Tor proxied and people know who the owner is You should have done nothing else. Unless you are installing Catalyst before 12.1, do _NOT_ install the SDK. Sure, its pretty close to as fast as its going to get. You know, you wouldnt really need the double slot version. You could trim these, and then use the backplane screw that you normally use when plugging cards into real machines (which exist to do exactly that: keep it from flopping around). What about it? You might be facing different issues all at once.First, DiabloMiner does not have a version number as I don't officially release it. Just follow it via git, github, or subscribe to this thread.Second, remove -f 240. It'll make your desktop lag, but you don't need nearly as much -f to stop that, AMD drivers are much better built than Nvidia's. -f 30 or -f 60 is what most people use on AMD hardware depending on taste.Third, 290-310 seems to be about right for a 6870 at stock clocks. And try -v 2 over -v 2,1, sometimes its faster, sometimes its not for vliw5 hardware.Fourth, makes sure you're running Catalyst 12.3 WITHOUT SDK 2.6, 12.3 ships with the OpenCL runtime and its newer than whats in SDK 2.6. Why not just use enterprise PSU modules for redundant PSUs? They typically output only 12v and large amounts of it. You can get upwards of 4000w in a redundant PSU across four modules. Not entirely they aren't. Hes building a closed air channel that is as large as the cards that go in it. The only way for air to escape, if he properly built it, is through the vents in the card backplates. The worst he'll get here is a pocket of hot air right behind the heatsink, but the heatsink will still perform correctly. The airflow dynamic is no different then how the card would have operated normally.However, I suggest he removes the backplate and use zip ties on the now empty screw holes to secure the card semi-firmly. Either that, or cut the backplanes and only leave the very top screw mount and the overhang (so it balances on the beam). Huh, now that I see that coming together thats almost exactly like the rig I always wanted to build but never could afford.
Except reject rate means nothing, delta of average reject rate is what you need to pay attention to.Also, BFL's firmware is broken, they won't return shares until its done 2^32 hashes, and any attempts to force it to update on long polll dumps valid shares. BFL needs to fix their shit before they sell any more FPGAs. All of this so goddamned much. No, the guy shut down, sadly. Why? It already allows nearly unlimited pools. I think you made a different mistake, such as not providing comma separated -u and -p as well. Yeah, I think its 8332. Also, forget what I said, I forgot I removed the code that ignores port 80, it should in fact work. DiabloMiner automatically rewrites 80 to the default port to prevent user error. You can't use port 80 with DiabloMiner. Also, it will still emit the error, but it still switches to the next. Okay, look, if this shit continues I'm just going to just start _paying_ Theymos to ban people. I'm pretty sure I could get some sort of bulk deal for 1BTC a person. That is detailed in the op post: just use commas in the arguments. And you think you're not going to get banned from this forum why? Didn't Captain Jack Sparrow kill you? -g sets how often it pulls new work; however, it is completely ignored on any pool that does long poll and/or sets an expiry time. The default value of -g is whats recommended for solo miners. Some VRMs are higher quality and are around GPU temps: say, GPU temp is around 85c, VRMs could be around both 120c for older/shittier VRMs (and be within the spec for the VRMs too), and 85c for newer/less shitty VRMs. Except not all PSUs have VRMs that use coils, nor are PSUs the only thing that use VRMs. Or just hook your local git clone up to a cronjob. Try no overclocks and see if it still locks up. If it doesn't, then you overclocked too far. Either PSU sucks, wall power sucks, you're overclocking and/or undervolting too far, or GPU temp is over 85c (or less if the card is a shitty brand). 12.1 and up install the runtime, you should never install the SDK on top of Catalyst anymore.What arguments did you give DM? Which Radeon? New TVs typically use a watts or less on standby, which you exchange for instant on and less wear on the parts. Disabling standby will just kill your TV faster which is more expensive than the electricity it is "wasting".
Yes. Possibly, I'm still trying to beat the compiler here. Thats fine and all, but BFL hasn't even shipped 2nd gen yet. Because drivers suck dick. I thought it was self evident. DiabloMiner uses 3, it isn't a settable option. This is for a reason. This implies you're using the pool to measure mhash: DO NOT DO THIS. This is measured by shares submitted, which is a random event. The ONLY true measurement of mhash is the miner itself. 12.3 is now out on Linux. Seems to be half an mhash faster if at all, hard to tell. Low 675 to high 675 instead of high 674 to low 675. 555 mhash is the estimate for 7970 at 925mhz at the recommended settings of -v 1 -w 256. So you're about right. Not sure, GPU-Z should displaying actual instead of set, but I don't use Windows. On Linux, aticonfig --odgc does show the difference (Current clocks shows actual, current peak shows requested).Memory speed doesn't seem to matter with hashrate on GCN, it just drives the temp up. For me, 1125/1375 -> 1125/975 drops the temp 3-4c. Your overclock settings might be (partially) be rejected, 7970s won't let you underclock memory more than 150mhz below the core speed. Double check and make sure its actually ay 710, its probably not. Other than that, you should be getting about 630 mhash @ 1050mhz. Make sure you're using -v 1 -w 256 without -na, and that you're using 12.2 with 12.2's OpenCL runtime (its newer than what SDK 2.6 ships, do not install 2.6 on top of 12.2). Yes, and its also open source. Don't like it? Change it. I'm glad you volunteered to write the documentation, now get cracking, I expect it done by the end of the week. I am a Diablo, not a Diabolo. Don't really see the point of subdividing it that way. I mean, for one, no one mines with CPUs anymore. The only reason FPGA got split off is because it was diluting the GPU threads. This not the news that people think it is. AMD has spent about $2 million on Mesa, Gallium, and the Radeon FOSS driver, including having 2 full time employees working exclusively on FOSS.Yes, this makes AMD the best fucking company ever, but Mesa/Gallium still does not have an OpenCL solution that I can drop a miner on and get at least 90% of the performance I do with fglrx (although, give it a year or two, I'll get what I want rsn). It tarnishes the surface on some surfaces, it doesn't dissolve pads for stuff that doesn't use thermal paste, it doesn't remove oils or chemicals used in some pads and pastes, it really doesn't work right. I've had my bottles of arcticlean for years, cleaned many CPUs and GPUs (and some were so fucked up that it needed 2 or 3 treatments before it was nice and clean) and I'm still only half way through it. Thats a myth. AS5 will not damage a GPU, the parts of the GPU die that are not under a heatspreader are coated in thick epoxy to prevent thermal paste from directly touching them. I use AS5 exclusively on GPUs. That isn't DiabloMiner, thats the OSX wrapper for DiabloMiner. Don't use it, the guy who packaged that isn't updating with new versions of DiabloMiner.You're one one of those hybrid laptops, you need to use -D 1 or -D 2 to specify which one to use; yet another OSX bug, I wish Apple would actually test shit before selling it. Yeah, you should never use RCs or preview or whatever versions. Only use the standard releases, which happens to be at the moment 12.2 on both Windows and Linux. I think you mean Delta's AFB1212 series. They come in multiple speeds.http://www.delta.com.tw/product/cp/dcfans/download/pdf/AFB/AFB120x120x38mm.pdfAFB1212s are the best fans ever made, they're exclusively for industrial/enterprise high air pressure cooling. The HHE is the largest one that is available in 3 pin plug, the rest use 4 pin molexes.As for GPU cleaning: DO NOT USE SOLVENTS OR ALCOHOL.Arctic silver makes a two part cleaner, I use it exclusively.http://www.arcticsilver.com/arcticlean.htm OVER 9000!
Yeah but Linux doesn't have anything newer yet. Although, I gotta admit, I like how my 2.6-ized kernel is performing. 555 mhash at 925mhz. The troublesome part is, I'm going to have to look for new ways of optimizing this, I've tried a bunch of different things that greatly effected performance (both positively and negatively) on the old compilers for vliw5 and vliw4 and it is doing absolutely nothing on the GCN compiler (which is great, mind you, it means the GCN compiler is actually working right).I am going to be disappointed if all I get is 555 at 925. I wanted over 600. Might be very old versions of DiabloMiner, I wasn't bothering to set the UA at one point. You do realize all that is is an API specification, right? 2.6 was shipping with very beta 1.2 support. 12.2 ships with something slightly newer than 2.6. Do not install an SDK on top of 12.2 for optimum performance. So, people have been asking about where all those donations for a 7970 went, and when was I going to get my 7970.Good news: HOLY GODDAMNED SHIT IS THAT FASTBad news: I think I'm going to play Portal 2 again. And Half Life 2. And a few other things. I'll be back in a few years, I promise. Wait, hold up, does that say Paypal? Try emailing Supermicro. Dude, enterprise PSUs were 80plus a decade before Antec started the 80plus program (which indecently was to attack PC Power and Cooling, their biggest competitor.... and all PCP&C did was affix 80plus stickers to their PSUs with zero changes in design. Sadly, PCP&C was bought by OCZ, OCZ moved it to China, and all the MK II products are fucking shit).However, I was thinking about something like this: http://www.supermicro.com/products/SuperBlade/powersupply/3000 watt, seems to use standard sized redundant modules, 4 of them, 250A of 12v, 94% peak efficiency. BTW, they do make redundant PSUs that use 4 or 6 ATX-sized modules meant for 2000-4000 watt blade servers. That explains that 30ghash user on eligius.... Angry neighborhood bastard mod here. I suggest you never piss off an apex predator. Because the 5970s already did drop in price. Gamers are flooding ebay with old cards, irregardless of our little mining community. And no, the drop doesn't happen over night. I'm thinking months as in the 2-3 quarter type of outlook. They will be under $400 before 2013 rolls around. Because you're comparing apples and oranges? 7970 is the single GPU card, its selling for $599 MRSP. The 6970 sold for $599, dropped to the $350-400 range after a few months, and the 5870 sold for $400 and sold for the $300-350 range after a few months. There is no reason to think the 7970 will also not drop in price. Ahah, they left a typo in: Its 2048 shaders, not 2084. Well, seeing as in another 3-4 months, people will be able to buy 7970s for $350-400, and ye average used 5970 is around $350-400, and you're not factoring in the cost of slots (ie, switching to two 5870s, which cost of slots would be 2x for 5870s than 5970s or 7970s), so 7970s still seem to win. Except by your reasoning, a 5970 sucks because it ONLY gets 800 mhash, seeing as its a dual GPU board with two 5870s on it vs a 5870 doing 440. Also a 7970 doing 800 mhash uses far less power than a 5970 does and does not have special installation concerns (such as being a bastard that overheats, or requiring powered risers in installations of more than 2). Uh, yes. You need -na on before 12.2 due to a bug in the driver. You don't need it unless you suffer from the bug because it makes it slower. Thats not entirely true. The way most of Googles shit is ran, they use 48v DC power (which is really 36-48v), they take apart el cheapo UPSes for the 48v->48v conversion, and then they step 48 down to 12, plug the 12v rails right into the 12 line, then use a picopsu to get 5v and 3.3v for stuff that legitimately runs on those voltages.The future of computing most likely will be 12v and 3.3v only. More and more SATA devices are requiring the 3.3v rail to function.What I'd like to see, really, is a DC/DC converter block that is outside of the PSU that provides legacy connections, such as 5v/3.3v (and pass 12v straight through) for drives. So, say, 4 SATA power plugs that plugs into a 6 pin PCI-E and does the DC/DC conversion in line. Those seem to be the correct arguments, so just make sure you're on the newest build. The loss of 25 mhash seems odd. Not yet. You need to run multiple DMs at that point and use -D to select them (like, one 7970 and two 58xx? -D 1 on the first one, -D 2,3 on the second one). Using absolute newest DiabloMiner? What hardware and what arguments?
Nope, and the whole FPGA mining experience is still rather iffy. Not sure if I want to support that yet. Yup, I emailed it to myself from the future. Sure, when FPGAs can build OpenCL kernels. The only thing that pulls 3.3v and 5v are PCI-E cards and on-mobo peripherals. The VRMs for the CPU, RAM, Northbridge, and Southrbidge all pull off the P4/EPS12 plug. I've updated the algo slightly, it now fast forwards to make it stop continuing to try to predict things that already happened. Arent these just generic redundant PSU modules? Has to be done atomically, I think it can't be easily on here. >lower rack>emptyWHAT SICK MAN SENDS BABIES TO FIGHT ME*om nom nom* I was describing Apple, actually. Nope, over promise, under deliver, then jack up the price massively for the second gen product while all the people with the first gen products masturbate on their blogs with it For 35? 2 ghash is in the right ballpark =PBTW, I've been told by someone -v 2 -w 64 -na is the most optimum for OSX on that kind of hardware. Not on a 6750m you don't. Thats closer to 75-100 mhash. Dude, I remember using a fucking tape for the first time. Rocking it old school. QFT Update: Remove the previous "fixes" for 12.2 performance.I think either my testing went wrong, or 12-2-2 on Debian fixed something. -v 2,1 is still the fastest if it works right on your card, -v 4 is back to not fitting, and performance is back to where it was. There was a donation thread, but I sat on the donations until AMD decided to fix their shit. Now that they have, I'm free to finally order it. I'll tell you when I get it. Yeah, ignore the warnings, its a side effect of -na Forgot your <h1> there. OP post handles it. But shorthand is 58xx and 57xx/67xx are first gen VLIW5, 68xx are second gen VLIW5, 69xx is VLIW4, and 79xx are GCN.
Update: Improve speed on Catalyst 12.2So I have surveyed the damage that 12.2 caused. On my 5850, 393 went down to 387, I've been able to bring it up to 390 by reordering a few instructions and switching to -v 2,1 as my recommendation on VLIW5. Another interesting thing is, -v 4 now fits on VLIW5, although it is still slower than -v 2,1.As for VLIW4? Someone is going to have to run -v 2, -v 2,1 and -v 4 on there and tell me which one wins, I assume -v 2 will be the only one that works right. a) I did work on it, conquering 2.6 was the first stepb) 12.2 is now out: its slower. Goddamnit, 12.2 just came out for FGLRX and I've confirmed: ITS SLOWER, WHY IS THIS, GODDAMNIT AMD Weird. You're only using -v 1 -w 256 as args, right? See the op post. You need to also use -na. If it does, thats sure as hell not the real picture. That thing has to be much bigger. Woah dude, 65c is too low. 85c is the standard max safe temp for Radeons that aren't mobile. People have almost hit 800 mhash at full overclock potential.Still, not sure why you should be having problems. You didn't accidentally install SDK 2.6 on top of 12.2 did you? Also, which 12.2, there are several. Try the new 12.3RC release. Well, from what I've heard, on 12.2, people get about 560 at stock clocks. Has this changed? Forgot to turn -na off? Still no fglrx 12.3 We admins are dicks, but not those kind of dicks. Unless its Friday, then here comes the bourbon. It doesn't change anything outwards. The hardware itself has optimum ways of using work, and even though 4 wavefronts (64*4 = -w 256) is supposed to be always optimum if you have enough registers (at -v 2, we do, higher -vs, not so much although -v 2,1 fits on vliw5 hardware (but not vliw4)).Its just that for some reason some people are faster on -w 128, and they shouldn't be. They just are. Might as well abuse it while you can. It exists just because some really are faster. If its not for you, just choose the largest (which is 256 on any AMD hardware). You do know that is considered a criminal act by US Federal Law, right? And you do realize advocating illegal acts are against forum rules, right? Dear OSX users:Apparently OSX not only requires -w 64 to work, but it also requires -na to work as well. You only need a -u -p and edit bitcoin.conf if you intend to solo mine. I use P2Pool, but it works fine here. What arguments are you using? Because it should be -o localhost -r 9932, no -u or -p required Seriously, where is it? I waited a whole damned month. Possibly. I'm considering the idea of rewriting the entire thing in C, which makes doing what cgminer does with ADL very easy. Nope, DM can't control those yet.
Dude, you think this is bad? Try #bitcoin on freenode. And you think this was appropriate for this board, how? Aaaand theres the crossfire bug, one of two. One makes all gpus beyond the first one spew constant crap, the other makes all kernel executions run on the first GPU only. Either way, for a dual GPU setup, it cuts your actual useful hashrate in half.Seriously, mining on Windows is way more trouble than its worth. Aggregating bad experiences of others. Huh. Try the opposite: plug the xfire bridge in, and enable xfire in CCC. 12.1 and up have radically different behavior with regards to how it handles compute programs. Yes, it does. It seeks out alt chains to destroy them, like a fucking death star, all fuckin' Darth Luke, nigga. What arguments? Because if you're using -D, don't. Also, you might be getting stung by "Windows haets Crossfire" Nope, can't. Almost all the used ones on ebay are owned by insane overclocker gamer types, and have done dumb shit like throw out the stock hsf in favor of improperly installing a wc block that probably cracked the dies.Total YMMV territory. Except you cant buy 5970s, and 7990s will be dropping in about 6 months.... so buy the 5970s now, sell them, and replace them with 7990s  Well, this is interesting. It is now predicting the market is going to go down, and the market is going down.Gasp! I wonder if the Predictinator actually works. Cheap DDOS mitigation and firewall box sitting between the core router and certain customers in a DC. No one is really selling a ready made box for this task, even high end Cisco routing fabric boxes aren't suited for deep packet inspection. Although, if I was actually making a box like this, I'd use a bunch of Freescale QorIQ T4* series chips and use their own fabric provide everything and shove it in a 2U box.*The P4 chips, the octocore 1.5ghz 64bit PPC predecessor of the T4, have 2 10gbit NICs and 8 1gbit NICs, hardware DSPs/ASICs dedicated to deep packet inspection acceleration, and a routing fabric that can be used to build a communications bus between multiple SoCs; so you could easily build a box with 4 of these and be able to handle DDOS mitigation for something like 80 gbit of incoming traffic, front ending 32 1gbit client boxes (which themselves can be maxing out at 64 gbit full duplex) without blinking.That would also be about a $10k box if mass produced and sold retail. Because thats meant for 10/40/100gbit cards, which are one slot wide. I'm laughing because you actually thought it was meant for video cards. Yeah, the board is basically perfect for mass mining... also, it doesn't really matter if two or three of the slots are blocked, you can only use 16 slots (ie, 8 cards) without fucking with virtualization, the last two are wasted anyways. I'm not going to scroll through this thread to ask this questionThose two 8 pin plugs on the board, are those EPS12s or PCI-E 8s? Because if they're EPS12s (384w * 2) and they're wired to the PCI-E 12v rails, you have enough power for 5 5970s/6990s (ten slots worth, so you're still short four cards), or 18 cards of any kind (typically 25-35 watts off the slot, you have a budget of 42 watts).If those are PCI-E 8s, then thats 150w each so.... 4 5970/6990s, or 9 or 10 normal cards.I'm also assuming the computer is a low wattage model and only needs the 12v off the ATX24. Yeah, if something important like lwjgl was broken, all those goddamned minecraft players would be up in arms, and CNN would be running a piece on how Oracle is destroying small business in America, and asking the important question of "Which of the Republican candidates play Minecraft.... thats like Star Wars, right?" Please tell me you're trolling, 0.0.0.0 is the address for "broadcast to ALL the networks \o/". As long as Oracle didn't botch the release, I don't see why not. Every new major revision of the JVM should execute older bytecode fine, they have entire testing suites for this. Deepbit once went like a week without finding a block. 1 hw error after 5000 shares is fine. 20000 after 5000 isn't. -v 1 -w 256 works fine on vliw5 and vliw4 chipsets, it just doesn't have enough instruction parallel work to saturate all the ALUs for most of the cycles (-v 2 almost does, -v 2,1 does on vliw5 (but might be slower anyways) and runs out of registers on vliw4).I think Windows is just fail that you're continuing to have 100% cpu usage.
Its the variance. WHAT THE FUCK Apparently, it seems if BitcoinCharts is down when my cronjob runs, my Predictinator can't download history and then doesn't update on time. Lawlz. Huh, I wonder if its an obscure driver bug. Almost no one runs DM more than once. Try just running once instance instead, the one for the 7970 only. You shouldn't mine in the background, drivers still do not have any sort of priority system. Even setting like -f 1000 will still cause slower games and destroy your hashrate in the process.cgminer now ships with my kernel, so if you're using my kernel on cgminer (it supports several) you should still use 2.6. My old kernel on 2.1 vs my new kernel on 2.6 is basically tied for speed on VLIW5, faster vs 2.5 on VLIW5 and VLIW6, and faster on GCN. Its not. 85c is the maximum safe limit for 24/7 mining, the cards can survive up to 120c for short periods of time without damage.What arguments are you using? None and/or just -v 1 -w 256? Damned straight. What GPU temp? DM isn't written in python.You should be using 2.6 now.Hrm, dunno. It shouldn't do that. I wonder if slush screwed something up with his pool. Yeah, but we have to get past that drop first. Yeah, but that would require me to record the prediction which requires more code than I've really wanted to put in it.In addition, what would I record? Merely the next day? The whole 30 days is a complete prediction, so it may get the exact days wrong, but it'll get the general shape over the next 30 days right give or take. So, what you really want is for me to just allow you to predict the past on demand. Significant errors like that is insane.  Set stock clocks and volts and see if it still does it, if it does its a driver bug, if it doesn't, you overclocked too far. You shouldn't see more than 1 or 2 HW errors per 10k shares give or take, if it starts skyrocketing you went too far. Use -D, it counts starting 1 not 0. So most likely you want -D 1 (assuming your 7970 is listed first at startup, -D 2 otherwise).Edit: Heh, someone beat me to it  Update: Looks a little more refined. Still can't figure out why the price of BTC is rising so quickly on mtgox. Thats not the bug you think it is. Look at the source, its not an image, its SVG drawn by D3, a popular graphing toolkit.And theres no past predictions because this was the first day I ran it. Its also predicting low, high, and volume as well, the graph just doesn't draw those yet. Magically. No historical data, I don't feel like adding any sort of db features. Just, like, screenshot or something It basically does. Its split down the middle, past numbers are -30 through 0, future numbers are 0 through 30. USD on the leftOn the bottom, -30 through 0 is historical data, 0 through 30 is the prediction.
http://predictinator.adterrasperaspera.com/More work needs to be done on it, but apparently my time machine works. You cant control OpenCL on OSX, its up to Apple there.However, the error you pasted only happens when it cant connect. It has nothing to do with the rest of the miner. This isn't a miner bug, are you sure slush's pool isn't actually down? No, not yet. Yes, as long as you've modified the firmwares, you're fine. It can set the memory clock to whatever your GPU's firmware is limited to, this is usually far below the minimum displayed in CCC.It can set the voltage on any card that uses stock VRMs. Use Debian unstable, use whatever is packaged newest by Debian (do NOT use the .run installer provided by AMD), and use AMDOverdriveCtrl to control clocks and voltage. Use Linux. 15 second average, forever average Its a command line application. Either run it from the command line, or run it from a .bat file that has the args you want. Yes, just make sure you're using 12.2. Make sure you're using 12.2. DiabloMiner doesn't autodetect, the default merely happens to work best on GCN. However, no one has tried all options on 7770s yet, -v 2 and -v 4 and -v 2,1 (and 3, and 2,2 and 1,1,1 and 1,1,1,1 and so forth...) probably will be slower for you, but you're welcome to try.Also, do not use -na, 12.2 fixed this. Well, on 12.1, it seems that a 5830 at 900mhz should get 287 or so. Are your systems at home doing that, or are they doing better on 12.2? Compared to my 5850@960, that'd be 360 and 384 mhash respectively. I'm getting 393. I have hopes for 12.2, but are you sure you're using the newest version of DiabloMiner? Don't bother with it, 12.2 fixes it. Also, if you don't have -na, you're not using the newest version of DM. Catalyst didn't used to come with the SDK, it does now. That text is out of date due to the new kernel, its now 12.2 is recommended, use the SDK that comes with it. So, -na fixes it on GCN, but it incurs an estimate 13% performance loss (at least, if the ops on my 5850 are any indication).Goddamnit AMD.The score thus far:vliw5: 1% slower vs old kernel on 2.1vliw4: 3-5% faster vs old kernel on 2/42.5 gcn: 1% faster vs old on 2.6Seriously, goddamnit AMD. Update: Remove -vs, -b, add -na for no array mode, set min fps to 0.1, and make loops work better. SDK bug that I've rammed into. Haven't quite figured out why its sucking, either. Nope, its the new kernel as of the post that you quoted originally that says "Update: Committed the new kernel."Er, 1503 on -v 2? Dude, you're not using the newest copy of DM. 1503 is what the old kernel got on -v 2 on 2.6.And it explains your weird results with -v 2,1... the hash mater was broken at the time of that version for non-power of two -v, I told you the mhash meter was fine because I fixed it in above referenced commit.
Okay, I figured out how to do this on Windows. In the .bat file or in cmd.exe or whatever you use, before running DiabloMiner, do SET GPU_DUMP_DEVICE_KERNEL=3. It should cause it to dump the .isa files. But you shouldn't be using -v 4 -w 64. That is not appropriate for the new kernel on vliw5. For me, -v 2 -w 256 is fastest, -v 2,1 -w 256 is slower, -v 2 -w 128 isn't faster (but -w is very sensitive to memory timings, so -w 128 being faster for others does not surprise me). Lets say you're getting similar numbers to mine. I get 393 or so on my 5850 at 960/320, 393/960*850 is 348. You have two of those, so 696. Now, your 5870, would be 393/960*950/1440*1600 = 432. You should be getting around 1128.So yeah, 1370 seems a smidgen high. But I don't believe its a fault of the meter, something else strange is going on. 10 minutes isn't nearly enough to average that out unless you're producing 1000 shares in 10 minutes on average.-v 2,1 and 1,2 are identical, the miner sorts them for size first. The numbers displayed by my miner are accurate, I just find it strange you're getting more on -v 2,1 and I'm not. Maybe there is a bug, but I'm not triggering it here.I'm not sure if you said, but are you on Linux? If you do, do export GPU_DUMP_DEVICE_KERNEL=3 and then pastebin the .isa file that gets produced for -v 2, and then do it again for -v 2,1 (it overwrites it, so make sure you run, pastebin, run, and then pastebin). I can tell for sure if the numbers are legitimate from those. Don't use pool hash meters, they're useless. They try to guess your hashrate by counting the number of shares you submit (which is a 100% random process) and multiplying by the average hashes it takes to make a share (2^32, or over 4 billion). I've had pools read as low as 200 some and as high as over 500, and I mine at what is now 393 mhash on my 5850.It does still display SDK version, but 2.6 has a different version than the rest, it says 851.4 instead.Also, try -w 256 instead. Its probably faster. You seem to have a slight misunderstanding: I haven't updated the op for the new kernel. Also, no where in op do I recommend -v 4, I say "try the above and then try -v 4 -w 64", where the implication the above (-v 2 and -w 128 or 256) is still going to win.-v 2,1 isn't unexpected. While developing the new kernel -v 2,1 was actually winning for awhile, and now its not for me. The interesting thing is -v 2,1 actually fits in all the registers now, something that has never been done before. So, on your cards, what clock rate are they at now and what mhash are you getting? It seems the drivers currently have a nice wonderful bug. GCN results in about 30 mhash.Thanks AMD. Update: Committed the new kernel.-v 1: 803/2.1 and 883/2.6 -> 738/2.6-v 2: 1362/2.1 and 1503/2.6 -> 1380/2.6398 peak hashrate on my 5850 drops to only 394, or 1%. I think I've won. BTW, 2.1 performance is now dead. Everyone, you can now upgrade to 2.6. The bug only effects multipool users. If you're only connected to one, it doesn't effect you, and its largely cosmetic anyhow. The entire write up is in the single open ticket at github. I'll fix the bug after I finally commit this new work.Thx I think I'm actually going to take -b out. -b points at eligius, and eligius has been doing the up/down dance for awhile. I was going to switch it to ozcoin, and then then got their wallet stolen. I'm personally doing p2pool now, but that doesn't seem like a solution for -b. So, phase 2 is almost done.The best I can get out of my new kernel on 2.6 is 392 mhash, the best I got out of the old kernel on 2.1 is 398. 6 mhash to go.Now, you can ask, "But Diablo, thats 6 mhash slower!" Notice where I said 2.6 and 2.1? I was getting 360 or so on 2.6 on the old kernel. I have made 2.6 my bitch. Or used the Internet, really. Angry bastard neighborhood mod here, cut that out. WTF, why the hell would ANYONE put side holes on a rackmount box? Thats insane. Totally screws up DC airflow. DM says what your SDK is on startup. If it says AMD-APP (851.4), you're on SDK 2.6. The real question is how did he do it and not crash the card. Memory speed is largely voodoo magic. Every "best" speed I've seen that doesn't fit the 1/3rd rule (such as on 1200mhz mem) 57xx/58xx) seems to still be between 1/3rd /1200*1000 (1000mhz core == 278mhz) and 1/3rd /1000*1200 (== 400 mhz), your lower and higher settings seem to be within that margin. However, you said OpenCL 1.2 would cause this, not a future version of AMD APP. Also, the SDK does not currently have any CPU use bugs, it is inside the driver itself and it effects a minority of users. Except his problem isn't the SDK. There are two known CPU bugs, the first is SDK side and exists in 2.2 and 2.3 only. 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 do not exhibit it, and 2.2 and 2.3 exhibit it on any driver version; the other bug is in driver and exists in 11.7 through 11.11* and exhibit it with any SDK including both 2.1 and 2.6.* Depends on the user, some had it fixed in 11.9 and 11.10. There are no known instances of this bug in 12.1 and up. No, OpenCL is a specification from the Khronos Group, a non-profit industry consortium whos members include Apple, AMD, Nvidia, SGI, Oracle, id Software, Google, Intel, Mozilla, ARM, a couple major ARM fabs, and a few other companies. Khronos grew out of the old OpenGL working group when it became clear OpenGL was the first of a family of API specifications.OpenCL was first submitted to Khronos by Apple, with help from AMD, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia. 1.2 contains new features based on work by both AMD and Nvidia. Major 1.2 features include partitioning devices into sub-devices (on applicable hardware), D3D11 state support (to complement the existing GL and D3D9 state bridges), and built-in kernel support to allow calling fixed function hardware from existing kernels and to call specialized hardware optimized kernels provided by the driver.
No. 1/3rd core speed is considered the rule. So, in your case, 1000/333. Troll less kthx. Angry neighborhood bastard mod here. Cut that out. The zip is always up to date, but I haven't changed anything in the past 11 days. No, I remember recommending goat for a ban, you, not so much. Nope, I didn't post in this thread at all. I really don't give a damn about BFL either way. 1BTC to the mod that moved this thread to off-topic. Wait, thats me! Everyone give me 1BTC!  But DM does! I don't emit the extension name for it though. After much discussion with the guy from gpumax, it seems to have been a slight bug in his pool software.In other news, I found a bug in DM completely unrelated to gpumax's bug.Today was productive. In this case, I think you mean "Nope, just Java." I really doubt Java has a bug in it's http client implementation, but you're welcome to track it down. So other clients are having problems too? Ive never verified if cgminer's hw error detection works. It means your hardware or drivers may not be functioning correctly. Are you overclocking? No. Tell gpumax to fix their software, no other pool is having this issue.  Don't need external testing. The community donated enough that I can go buy a 7970 of my own now (thanks everyone!), but my 5850 testing just isn't done yet. I think after this current round of optimization hunting I'll finally switch. I thought gpumax was a scam?Edit: Apparently its not, others on the forum are just morons Done stage 1:Old kernel:-v 1 sdk 2.6 = 883 ops 13 registers, 2.1 = 803 ops 17 registers-v 2 sdk 2.6 = 1503 ops 21 registers, 2.1 = 1362 ops 21 registers2.6 is 10% slower than 2.1.New kernel:-v 1 sdk 2.6 = 886 ops 23 registers, 887 ops 21 registers-v 2 sdk 2.6 = 1395 39 registers, 2.1 = 1396 ops 36 registers2.6 is tied with 2.1.New vs old:-v 1 =~ 0% faster 2.6, 10% slower 2.1, 2.6 is 30% away from minimum target of 681 ops-v 2 =~ 8% faster 2.6, 2% slower 2.1, 2.6 is 2% away from minimum target of 1362 opsIf I committed this right now, 2.1 users could switch to 2.6 and not see a real difference in speed.Now I begin stage 2: optimum ALU clause packing and register use reduction.Edit: Somehow I got the new numbers wrong, lets try that again. Nope, that makes no sense. Its still the same compiler, and OpenCL is a generic language meant for wildly different hardware. This kernel runs on everything from x86 to ARM to Sparc to POWER and PPC to Cell SPUs to Intel GPUs (if/when Intel actually fixes their drivers) to Nvidia to even certain DSPs.A compiler is free to completely ignore the specific ordering of instructions I am using in the kernel and optimize it correctly for it's target hardware. AMD's doesn't, and takes significant hinting from the code to allow developers to influence the output. This is arguably both right and wrong, given how much code effects/is effected by bandwidth usage and latency and other things.The difference between 2.6 and 2.1 is that 2.6 is tuned differently, and 2.6 allows much more hinting from the kernel layout. The compiler could freely reorder everything safely to give full performance, its just difficult on complex hardware like this; 2.1 went farther into this than 2.6 does.I'm slightly surprised I actually need to do this, however, because AMD uses LLVM in their compiler, which is very good at SSA tree optimizations. Arguably, its rather good at what I'm doing by hand. 
This is a two stage project. I'm almost done stage 1.Old kernel:-v 1 sdk 2.6 = 883 ops 13 registers, 2.1 = 803 ops 17 registers-v 2 sdk 2.6 = 1503 ops 21 registers, 2.1 = 1362 ops 21 registers2.6 is 10% slower than 2.1.New kernel:-v 1 sdk 2.6 = 827 ops 21 registers, 828 ops 20 registers-v 2 sdk 2.6 = 1464 36 registers, 2.1 = 1402 ops 37 registers2.6 is 4% slower than 2.1.New vs old:-v 1 =~ 7% faster 2.6, 3% slower 2.1, 2.6 is 21% away from minimum target of 681 ops-v 2 =~ 3% slower 2.6, 3% slower 2.1, 2.6 is 8% away from minimum target of 1362 opsAfter looking at the ops generated in the .isa output, I'm clearly starting to force 2.6 to act more like the 2.1 results, so I seem to be getting somewhere. The hard part is going to be ordering instructions to properly saturate ALU clauses on vliw5 and GCN both. ATM -v 1, but who knows once I finish this more optimized kernel. DiabloMiner had p2pool support first :< Ahemhttps://blockchain.info/pools?timespan=4daysMuch more closer to the actual top ten I maintain. That scares the shit out of me. I am not going to GIS that. No no, you got it backwards. The Empire is about GPUs, its the silly Jedis obsessing over FPGAs. An elegant weapon for a more civilized age my ass. No no, read the orders, it says TAKE him alive, Lord Vader will have our heads if we fuck that up again I can confirm that I just put it there today. I suspect the average is since the dawn of p2pool. I've been on a 3 "day" almost interrupted hackfest trying to make SDK 2.6 suck less dick.My brain is starting to melt after 24-hours-straight sessions.Good news is: I seem to be winning, and I think I'm almost done.Bad news is: the kernel is almost unrecognizable, and its known to the state of California to cause cancer in rats.More bad news: I have no clue what its going to do to GCN. Very big circles. -5 == CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES == driver bug. They may even use lube. The "dumb" way is to have one function (in the case of an FPGA, one circuit), and rotate the variables/registers in and out of the function. You have the code compiled/circuit implemented exactly once. This would actually be superior for FPGA _if_ they had enough registers, but they don't.This is extremely slow for basically any implementation, and it also screws over the fact we essentially have 5 or more parallel ops at any given time in the way Bitcoin can optimize* the first, oh, 250 ops (depending on how certain things are implemented, of course).* In OpenCL, due to all the shortcuts calculating stuff in the host, it starts out as two unrelated chains that eventually merge. The ability to pack VLIW5 here is pretty goddamned handy, makes optimization a much easier job. Because its always been unrolling loops. Ears are unfurled, loops are unrolled. Well, its a cache update like error of some sort.... but I'm not aware of Java only on Windows actually having such a cache.As for desktop interactivity, you're screwed. Nvidia hates you, yet they want your money. Such a conundrum. Ahh, a fine afternoon in off-topic, indeed. Some level is normal, depends entirely on the card and the machine. Its not one of those kinds of bugs. Java on Windows is being retarded. Delete the DiabloMiner dir and unzip it again fresh.  Weird part is, not all Windows users are hitting it, and no one on any other OS is. -f 1, usual flags otherwise.
I don't think 7970s are going to GET faster. Its like, SDK 2.6 screws everybody over, and thats the way it rolls.WHY MUST AMD MAKE ME ANGRY, THEY WONT LIKE ME WHEN IM ANGRY, DIABLOSMASH Update: I think it got faster. Maybe. Feh, False advertising. Oh man. Thats over twice as fast as my 5850 at 960. Update: Added two models to bfi_int whitelist, fixed up loop code, added optimizations, fixed a few bugs The CPU core half of that Fusion may identify itself as Loveland, but the GPU half, the Radeon 6250, identifies itself as a Wrestler.Edit: I don't see any of the APUs named Loveland either, there is only Desna, Ontario, Zacate, Llano. Trinity, Weatherford, and Richland aren't out yet, and will use Northern Islands-based shaders (77/78/79xx) instead of Evergreen (5xxx). There is also three that were canceled, Krishna, Wichita, and Hondo.Although, it seems I need to add two more names, Palm and Sumo. Your command line is screwed up. Although, it shouldn't exception like that either. If you're using -o, you want -o api.bitcoin.cz That is not an accurate statement. We have not had to use that since SDK 2.2, this was for 2.1 only. 2.2 or later on any hardware optimizes rotate correctly.Yes, which is why I added that driver name whitelist. cgminer has also copied that whitelist as well. -D is useless unless you're turning off other cards. -w 256 is default. -v 1 is default -aa does _absolutely nothing_ and I've already renamed it to something else in a local branch.For the first time in history, no arguments are the best. I have no clue how the hell that happened. I'm not saying you're wrong, but, uh, that sounds very wrong. It'll take artforz like 5 minutes to identify it. He already owns like one of every FPGA ever. Meh, I've seen bigger. Yes, but what comes out of the wall is what is being used total. So. Something.Did I mention I hate math? Around 675, iirc their peak efficiency is above 90%. So ~610 watt at the meter is what I'd consider safe. Yes, I used a tinyurl because the newegg url is so long. No shit. Corsairs are rated at continuous wattage, and 7970s use 250w each at stock, and you shouldn't exceed 90% of that 750, and you're doing 750-790 at the wall? Holy crap dude.Go buy one of these: http://ur1.ca/7sqrz Yeah, see, thats where I'm questioning this. I mean, -v 2? sure, -v 2 is fucking magic. -v 1? hell no, even 2.6's screwed up existence, where it sits at the back of my fridge begging for me to kill it, cannot do that.CATS, DOGS, LIVING TOGETHER! OH THE HUGE MANATEE! Sorry, I'm blind. Yeah, we've been having a kernel arms war lately. What you're getting sounds in the right ballpark. Tell me what mhz you're at, because its quite entirely possible to get 464, but that sounds high for stock 880mhz. ITYM 1/3rd core clock. 300mhz is only correct if your core is 900mhz.
Oh, and do me a favor, and check if the release I just released changes this. I'm hoping thats not a bug, its too awesome. Update: Fix -aa when used with -v 1 That'd be impossible on stock clocks, I think. Either that, or my recent kernel changes have REALLY increased speed. That requires ADL, something only C apps can use unless I develop a Java wrapper for that, which isn't something I particularly want to do. However, if someone else writes one and it works and its packaged in a jar sanely, I would use it.I think we'd be all better off with a stand alone program that uses the cgminer-like code for that so ANY miner can use it. The python miners have the same issue I do, calling C functions suck.As of roadmap, I dunno. I expect main DM development is basically finished unless I produce a web UI and/or cluster control. Some people have asked for that, but I'm not sure if its worth adding. Major GCN support is about the only thing thats concrete. Oh Goddamnit. Seems to be -v 1 -w 256 -aa Update: Shorten debug status line, fix kernel for layered vectors So do I start making the Half Life 3 jokes now? (fucking gaben) Hey 7970 users, could people check if -aa is faster at all on 7970? I'm getting reports that it actually is, which would be pretty amazing if its true. Update: Fix ozco.in specific bug Update: Increased speed 0.5%, added alt array more (-aa) Looks like they really redesigned the VRM farm This thread isn't really appropriate for hardware anyhow. Moving to offtopic. :< ^ This. Remanufacturing (ie, factory recertified, certified pre-owned, factory refurbished, etc) is a difficult process, but on solid state components, if done right, you get a basically new product for cheap.Diamond is a brand I do _not_ buy, and this is just another reason I can add to my list on why I don't. Update: Improve kernel mangling parser, fix accidental disabling of BFI_INT lolwindows Weird, clear out your DM dir and redownload the zip again and try again, I think you're getting a version conflict Are you building it yourself? Do mvn clean then mvn package if you are. Update: Improved speed 0.5%
It automatically picks up all cards. Huh, I've never seen sheeting like that on any card I own. Goddamnit Diamond. Windows cmd.exe is a little weird, just type the name normally, DiabloMiner-Windows.exe, no ./. Uh, what? If you're local mining, which is implied by your use of a bitcoin.conf file, you just do -u username -p 1234 -o localhost -r 8332If you're actually intended on mining with slush's pool, -u and -p is set to whatever the pool tells you to use and then -o api.bitcoin.cz -r 8332 Not all pools support mining on port 80. Use the port the pool specifically says to use. I'm more interested in it for generic 2.6 optimization. I'm hoping I can get 2.6 running as fast as 2.5 on my 5850 and _IF_ I can get it running as fast as 2.1, I can abandon 2.1 support (but I don't see how 2.6 could get that fast) That'd be depressing if all I can get is another 2%. I'm trying to get the damned Kernel Analyzer to work in either Win in VM or in Wine, both is a no go, has to have a real running copy of the drivers, and the native Linux version locks up soon as DM calls an a CL function.Damnit AMD Been a bit busy with RL, at least the money has finally arrived from Dwolla (seriously, 5 days? wtf) Mine, the support merely makes it work, it doesn't provide any useful optimization yet. Although, ~575 mhash out of the box on a 7970 is very inspiring. Update: Improved P2Pool supportUpdate: Update to lwjgl 2.8.2, jackson 1.9.2, commons-codec 1.6 Someone with a 7970, please measure the exact length of the card. My Gigabyte Super-5850 is on a 5870 carrier and just BARELY fits, it rubs against the ass end of the harddrives. I wanna make sure a 7970 will actually fit. Ahh, he failed to mention that. LukeJr has, uses KVM on a known-to-work VT-d board. Host gets a few, guest VM gets a few. The limitation is purely of the driver, AMD could fix it to do 16 or whatever. Woah, and I said its probably possible for >600 on stock clocks. So close. 1 hw error is basically meaningless. All cards, even at stock clocks, will generate them now and then. Thats not strictly a DiabloMiner question. To mine with multiple cards under any miner under Linux, you must turn off Crossfire. Merely unplugging the bridge does not disable it, you must, as root, run aticonfig --initial -f --adapter=all and then restart X.This will disable Crossfire and make every card individually addressable by all applications. Sapphire also produces the AMD branded FirePro cards, and they also produce every 5970/6990/7990 no matter which manuf actually sells it. Saving to porn folder. I don't use Windows, but try to make it spit out a Java stack trace. I suspect its a driver bug. It is especially weird it crashes before it actually does anything. Thats the product page for that thing. It even seems to have two pci-e 6 pin plugs for powering the extra slots for larger cards.
That wont kill the cards, it'll just kill the PSU.He probably killed the fans by running them at 100%. Update: Add -dt argument for debug timer, quits after 1 min The mhash meter is combined for all cards, 15 seconds/forever, the ghash meter is the raw number of ghash done by each card, its useful to see if cards have locked up. Apparently, the Chinese love DiabloMinerhttp://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=14062839037Scroll down for screenshot Update: Switch back to 3 threads, helps double DMA chips like 69xx and 79xx Update: Added 1onevvolf's idea for shuffle() + vstore() instead of branchy array output. Use -vs to use it.Benchmarks using it on SDK 2.6, with my 5850 at 765/1000 stock, without on the left, with on the right, uint3 does not work with shuffle+vstore.Code:-w 64      -v 1       245 245-v 2       280 280-v 3       214 xxx-v 4       245 275-v 8       222 163-v 1,1     255 255-v 2,2     233 233-v 3,3     180 xxx-v 4,4     221 163-v 1,1,1   219 219-v 2,2,2   260 230-v 3,3,3   136 xxx-v 4,4,4   163 109-v 1,1,1,1 211 211-v 2,2,2,2 211 261-w 128-v 1       245 245-v 2       285 283-v 3       222 xxx-v 4       251 233-v 1,1     258 258-v 2,2     239 241-v 3,3     180 xxx-v 4,4     221 120-v 1,1,1   247 247-v 2,2,2   221 228-v 3,3,3    99 xxx-v 4,4,4   120 107-v 1,1,1,1 221 221-v 2,2,2,2 210 221-w 192-v 1       244 244-v 2       281 279-v 3       234 xxx-v 4       263 184-v 1,1     255 255-v 2,2     252 252-v 3,3     142 xxx-v 4,4     174 161-v 1,1,1   245 245-v 2,2,2   175 236-w 256-v 1       245 245-v 2       278 276-v 3       206 xxx-v 4       238 229-v 1,1     255 255-v 2,2     225 226-v 3,3     180 xxx-v 4,4     219 211-v 1,1,1   241 241-v 2,2,2   218 205-v 2 -w 128 without -a and -vs is still the fastest on SDK 2.6 at 285 mhash. In comparison, the same on SDK 2.1 does 314, and the same on SDK 2.5 does 305.Goddamnit 2.6. BTW, I figured out how to make your shuffle() trick actually work. I'll commit it in a bit. It doesn't improve it the way you hoped. Glorious, what settings? Well, before anyone had one, I said it'll probably be over 600 mhash/sec at stock speeds optimized. We're over the 500 mhash hurdle, so thats great. Well, remember, slots have a very large premium. 5970s aren't getting any faster, but the 7970 already is essentially as fast as one, and the 7990 will be twice as fast as that. Thats not the entire thing though. Nvidia uses a purely streaming setup with all their pipes (ie, its like how a CPU executes an instruction stream), AMD on GCN still has something like VLIW's VLIW clauses, but its mainly inside of the CUs now and not part of the ALUs anymore* (on VLIW5/4, it was part of the ALUs, each instruction was tagged with which ALU it ran on).As far as I can tell, the ALU design itself is rather similar (except for the end of it that plugs into the CU, thats obviously different and enhanced), the big feature they added was SIMD execution to reduce the size of the clause and decouple the CU's manhandling of the ALUs to get shit done.GCN is really a hybrid of both schools of thought, for highly complex code, AMD did really well. Mining just... isn't exactly highly complex.* As in, the compiler still choses which ALUs to use, the GCN CUs just seem to demux the VLIW-like clauses the compiler produces instead of running it as a unified VLIW arch nvidia still refuses to update their arch (which has been nearly identical since the 8000 days, zero innovation) to get good integer performance. A photo of 3 7970s in their naked and shiny glory? Let me save that to my porn folder.... I dunno, my box idles much lower than that. Hell, without my single 5850 overclocked, thats my system's max power usage. 79xx has that new ultra-idle, so that chips in crossfire past the first 1 will basically turn off, and the first chip will idle at almost as low a wattage. AMD has really done well in their green campaign. No one knows yet. 1onevvolf has a thread going that is exploring this until I get mine.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56630.0 Yeah, but you traded top speed for efficiency, which lowers efficiency in the dollar sense (ie, mhash/$). Update: I have changed how the vector argument works to better serve new and upcoming GPUs. It now uses comma separated values, and vectors up to 16 in length. It also now supports 3 length vectors as well.If you used this -> switch to this...-v 1 -> -v 1-v 2 -> -v 2-v 3 -> -v 2,1-v 4 - > -v 2,2-v 18 -> -v 1,1-v 19 -> -v 1,1,1-v 36 -> -v 4-v 40 -> -v 4,4 -D. BTW, if you want to watch individual GPU performance, use -d (for debug), it'll list a ghash meter that displays raw ghash done by each card. I just pushed a new commit. You can do vector layouts instead of the old bitmasks. So instead of -v 18, you do -v 1,1, instead of -v 36, you do -v 4, instead of -v 40, you do -v 4,4, instead of -v 4, you do -v 2,2, etc.
Power usage in Mhz is linear (ie, 500 to 1000 mhz will double power usage), but power usage in voltage is squared (using 100 watt at 1 volt? It will use about 150 watts at 1.25 volt). This. 7970 is the fastest GPGPU bar the 7990 coming out RSN. AMD hasn't misadvertised anything. I'm not going to believe that until I can prove it. Also, mining kernels are very abnormal for how kernels function, it is very much not a typical kernel. I'm glad they updated the programming guide for GCN though, its very useful for intermediate OpenCL programmers. The CPU miners are written heavily in assembly in some areas just to get maximum speed. Not better than the engineers, not even close. The problem is, theres stuff that just isn't documented on how Radeons work, and most of what I know is either ArtForz or I threw shit at the Radeon to see what would stick, and then mixed in some moon dust from there.The GCN, though? Lemons. 294 and 250 are the official AMD quoted figures for maximum draw on 5970 and 7970. Mining uses less power due to parts of the chip shutting off (texture units, etc), and I suspect GCN has superior power savings over 58xx in that area, if not, they're very similar (ie, 5970 doesn't draw 294 while mining at stock speeds, and 7970 doesn't use 250 by the same amount give or take). 5970 does 300w stock on gaming, 7970 does 250w stock on gaming.  At ~300 watts, the 7970@1225mhz is doing 716 mhash, the 5970@725 on SDK 2.5 is doing 646, 671 on magical SDK 2.1. The 5970 has the advantage of being undervolted over the rest of the 58xx family and being able to run SDK 2.1.Given that, I think AMD has produced a very impressive chip. BREAKING NEWS: I now have all the donations needed to grab that 7970, I should be ordering it within the next week give or take.The last donation was big enough to help me cover that gap, and I think this wonderful person wishes to remain anonymous due to the size of the donation. Dear lord, I have somehow traveled back in time to the 1990s! Damnit, Percival Dunwood! As a reminder, 100% fan speed is a good way to kill the fan, they were never meant to be ran that high.Don't go above 85%. Not entirely. Remember, this card will need significant optimizations, and don't apple/oranges vs 58xx if you're not using the same SDK. Nothing is going to beat 58xx on SDK 2.1, and you shouldn't expect anything that glorious ever again. Its a classic. That said, SDK 2.5 on 58xx, you lose about 4-5% give or take, dunno about 2.6, still haven't quite figured out how to best fix that. Yeah. There are some things hardwired in the driver to work around 60hz (the refresh rate of virtually every LCD monitor on DVI/HDMI/Displayport), instead of just being triggered either after the last iteration is done, or on the actual refresh rate. So, multiples and divisors of 60 seem to give higher hash rates and/or give better desktop latency. Add -f 60 or a higher number (-f should always be a divisor or multiple of 60)Same goes for you, 55 isn't a divisor or multiple of 60. -f 60, 120, etc are nicer. The output array is basically a massive hack to prevent multiple outputs from hitting each other, although the chances of getting multiple outputs is extremely low. The size of the array now is massive overkill, but it also seems to be a strangely optimum size for hardware.Now, what would give me the most benefit is some way of sorting the outputs in a single cycle so that the pair of { nonce, H } could instantly give me the best nonce, and then only evaluate that. There seems to be no way to do this (and yes, I imply reverting that one bit of math so that H == 0 is literally done at the end again, makes it much easier to sort on shit). The nonces themselves can't be sorted because its completely random, they're meaningless values essentially. Well, think of it like this. If the best you can get on a 5870 at 188 watts at stock clocks is about 380 give or take (not on SDK 2.1, of course), and the best you can get out of 7970 is a theoretical upwards of over 600 at 200 or 250 watts, and you either want to stick with a single GPU (you mine on the side), or you're at a slot premium (a bunch of mega miners at 4, 5, 6, whatever cards per box, and you have a couple boxes) and it is cost prohibitive to buy more boxes (or you ran out of power and don't want to install more circuits), 7970 still wins, especially once it starts dropping below $400.I mean, its either that, or you sell your soul to the FPGA people. FPGA just isn't right for everyone. The CPU use bug currently is a flaw of the driver, not the SDK. I currently have no issues on 11.12 combined with any SDK, yet 10.7 through 11.10 cause me problems. SDK 2.2 and 2.3, however, had an identical CPU use bug and were the fault of the SDK (2.1 didn't do it, 2.2 and 2.3 do it with any driver revision); they may be identical bugs, but the source is different than the one people suffer from now. Don't get them confused.On Windows, it is difficult to revert SDKs, on Linux it is easy. So, ymmv. Notice I said CPU not GPU. CPU mining still sucks altogether. 2.1 is still best for 58xx cards. The branching has ended up becoming the best outcome. It can evaluate those branches in parallel, and you can't easily optimize away branches for memory writes (and theres apparently like 2 or 3 good tricks to get rid of branch waste, its just none of them work on memory writes).I should look at shuffle. Your way doesn't quite work though, vstore would output H !=0 hashes, which would trigger HW error alerts (and rightfully so) in the host code, and I consider the HW error tracking important. At least, assuming I'm reading that code right, anyways.I'll go add official 8 and 16 wide support in a bit, should be useful on, say, AVX if you manually enable CPU mining in the code. SDK 2.6's cpu compiler apparently has gotten a lot better from what I've heard. BTW, they do make 240v/50hz euro Killawatts, but you might have to order it from the US. They also make 240v/60hz (double hot, like ovens and water heaters) ones and 208v ones for DC shit. Might have to look around, I love mine, its been essential for planning stuff out. Diapolo seems to be missing optimizations DiabloMiner has, and DiabloMiner works on 79xx (although in an unoptimized state). Some guy has already gotten 666 mhash out of his 7970 on it.As for the 2.6 bug, on DiabloMiner, try -v 36 -w 64 with memory at full speed, or try your normal settings with memory at full speed. It should get at least most of it back. 2.6 seems to actually be using the hardware correctly, or at least doing something that requires much tighter memory latency.Or, otoh, you can slink back to 2.1 or 2.5, the slowness is SDK related.
Wait wait wait. Are we sure uint16 is such a good idea? Last time I tried >4 (which was before 2.6, btw, I haven't tested with 2.6), it would crash in the compiler. Also, does anyone have a count on the number of registers per CU? There might not be enough registers to handle that.Also, check some of the larger -vs, -v 40 is two sets of uint4 and -v 44 does three uint4s (unlike cgminer, -v 4 does two uint2s). Just switch to DiabloMiner or cgminer already. Yeah, but whats the difference between him doing it all at once or all of us doing it all at once? Do we even know how much he got? If it was less than 10BTC, hell, that just paid for the server for a month or two. No. I already tried to abuse the texture/memory fetch units, but couldn't figure out a useful way of doing it. Its all fixed function hardware and its not particularly interesting for what we do. Although, I may go try that again, SDK 2.6 seems to be a much better compiler in some areas. That means they had no value to begin with. If BTC dropped to $0 every time I sold some, I wouldn't bother with BTC to begin with. Thats at stock clocks obviously. I don't know what the mining values will be, all the cards draw less than their full wattage at stock speeds when mining (because large parts of the chip shut off). I imagine 79xx may even get a larger efficiency boost due to this because of AMD's work on power saving, but without a killawatt test, no one knows. That implies said altcoins actually have value, of course. He could setup signed message shit for the rest of the alt chains just like he did for nmc, but the other chains simply have no value. But not to the extent that is being claimed. The way merged mining works is when I give 400 mhash to the pool, that 400 mhash goes to Bitcoin AND namecoin AND whatever else without diminishing the original 400 that went to Bitcoin. He can merge mine 9000 other alt chains, and I still get my 400 mhash worth of Bitcoin shares. 7970 is going to be 200 watts I believe, and the 5870 is 188 (both at stock watts). This is where the 7970 suddenly shines. Even if the 7970 is 250 watts, thats still a jump in efficiency. Because its too difficult to physically ship the card. There also is maybe three people in the world that would benefit from this, and one of them quit working on GPU miners altogether, and the other can probably afford to buy one straight out. Seriously, there simply is not that many people in the world that understand mining well. This. Nope, 666 now. Current total: 25.1201977 Technically there doesn't have to be. Every additional merged mined pool does not decrease the hash power used on Bitcoin. Luke merely should add the ability for users to acquire the output of the merged mining and it legitimizes it. Lets ban ALL the trolls! Why is it this is the ONLY thread on the mining subforum that gets reported to me every day? Get a life, damnit. Glorious. Well, yes, we know that now. Hindsight is 20/20, and no one expected BTC to hit $7 out of nowhere. There is two for 0.000001, both are in the current total.Thanks a lot, though. Every btc counts. I've requested that Jenkins should be banned, so it is now only a matter of time.
Jenkins, you do realize reporting posts reports them to me right?Go bug some other forum. Or, alternatively, I can have theymos ban you. Your choice. You're missing a lot. Stream processor numbers across unrelated archs are not equivalent. BTW, anyone using the donate function, update to newest. That multipool bug apparently screws up donating too, it hops to the wrong pool to donate on. +5 from tonto+0.11 from burgerThanks guys.Current total: 25.1201976.20BTC sold for around $4.755BTC sold for around $6.50 This is extremely good news. Less ugly code is always better. WTF and thats with -v 1? 79xx could be glorious if I can find the right settings.Edit: You know, I just noticed the op post said GPU threads had a viable increase beyond two. Huh. I should go see if that is worth abuse, I never got better performance beyond 2 on DM (its hardwired to 2, and was the first miner to abuse that trick). Is dat some git log?  Well, what do you call my 5850, stock 725, at 960?  For those wondering, DiabloMiner already only runs BFI_INT on cards that can do it: it will not do it on 79xx (at least, not until we can change the kernel binary, the instruction is different on GCN).I was right then, I think. I said 7970 should exceed 500 stock properly tuned, and that guy is doing it with a minor overclock. Depending on what that series ends up being, sure. AMD needs to stop with the chimera families. I liked it better when every member of the family was some variant of the main arch. 78xx is most likely going to be the existing 69xx arch fabbed at 28nm (since it was originally meant for 28nm anyhow). 69xx still doesn't beat SDK 2.1-able VLIW5. That isn't a good trade unless you can get a 6970-like card for under $150 (and then he can go buy four of them). Update: Improved error handling for argument parsing, will now quit if you do not supply enough connection parameters, or try to use 0 with -D HIS is probably okay as long as you stick with the reference designs. I'll have to agree here. Unless I hit it out of the park and find, like, some hidden single cycle "hash ALL the coins" function, I'd still use a 5970 over a 7970 especially since they're two different products... what you want is a 7990 (the dual 7970 board, matching the 6990 and the 5970), which will have a retail price of approximately $9001. Yet, but soon. We already know its going to be between $400 and $600. Donations do not happen over night. Stick with ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI, and Sapphire. The rest is second or third tier shit, especially XFX and Powercolor and Club3D. I found the exact same results on DiabloMiner a few days ago. -v 4 -w 64 seems to give almost the same results, but not quite as much. However, I did the test with underclocked RAM, not full speed. However, I still recommend 2.1 on Radeon 5xxx hardware instead of 2.5, as that gets you the full performance. There has been an actual virus that distributes miners as their payloads, and the authors of the anti-viruses are too stupid to tag the right binaries (ie, the virus instead of the otherwise legitimate payload). The same has happened to cgminer, btw. Update: Bug in multipool pool advance fixed, uncovered by return to primary. D'oh. Nice. Too bad AMD hasn't contacted me about me supporting their GCN platform yet on DiabloMiner.Seriously, AMD, send me a 7970, I will love you all night long. Wink wink.
I have added a much easier way of donating to this. I have added a donation mode to DiabloMiner, download the most recent binary and use the -b flag. thogar threw in 1 btc.Current total: 20.0101976. Spiccioli just threw in a BTC. Thanks man.Current total: 19.0101976. 7970 requires at least 11.12 and at least SDK 2.6. It looks like they used 11.11 + SDK 2.5 or similar for these tests (maybe pre-release 11.12 + 2.6?). Also, I'm pretty sure 2.6-fail is a bug and nowhere near the intended behavior, so I'm going to assume their 375 is really supposed to be 380, and their 392 on the 6970 is supposed to be 397. This would mean, completely unoptimized, the 7970 is 420.Which, really, isn't all that horrendous. 1.68 mhash/watt vs 6970s' 1.58 mhash/watt vs 5870s' 2.02 mhash/watt (or vs 2.09 on SDK 2.1). And thats unoptimized, I'm really thinking 7970s at stock can push 500 mhash which pushes us back up to 2 mhash/watt which brings us back to the glory age of 58xx cards.The problem with 58xx is *we can't buy them anymore*. Used cards off Ebay is iffy at best, and even the $599 price of a 7970 isn't all that much when you realize 5870 and 6970s were in the same ballpark ($499 and up). If I don't get enough donations for a 7970, I can always buy a 7950, and if I can't get that, I can always wait for the inevitable price drop to drop it down even more.50 btc at today's prices is still $200. 7950s may eventually drop to that, but I'm not sure if everyone wants to wait that long for support. The donation serves purely as a "does the community want this or not" thing. I use SDK 2.1, which is what is recommended to use on 5xxx hardware. If you want strict oranges to oranges numbers, 2.6 is really really bad on 5xxx. On my 5850@960 on 11.12, under 2.1 I get 400, 2.4/2.5 I get 387, under 2.6 using the same settings as 2.1 and 2.4/2.5 I get 357, and under adjusted settings for 2.6 I get 365.As usual, YMMV. Or I find an absurdly easy optimization that puts 600-700 mhash/sec on stock settings. I agree with Toms Hardware not being an authority, however, they used stock cards. What damns them is a stock 5870 can get 394 mhash/sec, theirs wasn't even close. They did not perform a useful test, and they didn't even say which miner with which settings.Also, FPGAs do not seem to be entirely worth it. There is a high buy in cost and a very low resale value. Unless your power is extremely expensive, I don't see the point of owning one unless you're going to buy a 100 or more of them at a time.Most people who mine own a single GPU, and this sits in their desktop and they sometimes game. This is where the vast majority of hash power comes from, and DiabloMiner serves people like that. The thing is, there is, what, about a thousand GPU miners who just own a single GPU and alternate between mining and gaming? If even just every other one of them donated just 1 btc to this, I wouldn't have to worry about development costs ever again. One person doesn't need to fund this, a hundred could. 150 btc is a lot to one person, but its not much to a thousand people. Rasengan added 10 btc to the effort. Thanks man.Current total: 18.0101976. Update: Added two often requested features: return to primary pool every 100 minutes when using multipool, and added a feature to automatically donate, use -b. Total is now: 8.0101976 Thanks a lot. Its the thought that matters.Total is now: 7.0101976 Update: Moved two adds to host code from kernel, made it faster. -v 4 on cgminer seems to be the same thing as -v 36 on mine. Much slower than -v 2 -w 256 on that same combination? What hardware, driver, and SDK? I tested this on 11.12 and SDK 2.6, normal options apply to everyone else. Did some performance testing:Catalyst 11.12 on Radeon 5850 at 960/320-v 2 -w 256 -f 1SDK 2.1: 400SDK 2.4: 387SDK 2.5: 387SDK 2.6: 358-v 2 -w 256 -f 1 -aSDK 2.1: 400SDK 2.4: 387SDK 2.5: 387SDK 2.6: 357So. SDK 2.6 performance is pretty low and also phatk-like arrays no longer work against the driver with the most optimum settings. Lets try everything else.-w 256-v 1: 306-v 2: 357-v 3: 325-v 4: 341-v 5: 225-v 6: 212-v 18: 318-v 19: 301-v 20: 211-v 21: 210-v 36: 238-v 40: 214-w 64-v 1: 306-v 2: 349-v 3: 340-v 4: 348-v 5: 303-v 6: 257-v 18: 313-v 19: 305-v 20: 297-v 21: 297-v 36: 365-v 40: 214-w 128-v 2: 355-v 4: 344-v 36: 326-w 192-v 2: 351-v 4: 297-v 36: 323With or without -a, the best seems to be -w 64 -v 36 for SDK 2.6. Weird. Still a fair bit slower than 2.1 and 2.4/2.5 though. Because that makes no sense. I believe I personally have invested a lot of time and energy into Bitcoin, and people serve to make a lot of money if GCN turns out to be the next ultimate mining arch after 5xxx+SDK 2.1. There are people out there who make 150btc a day and use DiabloMiner, yet I have not heard a peep from them.I don't get why I am getting so much resistance on this. People have requested optimized GCN support, and I obviously cannot provide this without having a GCN myself, nor can I afford one out of pocket. If people want this support, they will donate towards it. For them, this IS an investment. Bounties are not, and never have been, a viable way of FOSS donations. People constantly renege on bounty promises, and often had no intention of paying up to begin with. And I don't know about you, but I don't have $500 in cash laying around. I doubt most people do. Donation current count: 7.01002 out of 150
I'll have to keep that in mind, but I hope they fix the driver and/or the SDK to emit BFI for bitselect(). It would make a lot of people's lives easier, and speed up existing unoptimized code.http://forums.amd.com/devforum/messageview.cfm?catid=390&threadid=143488&highlight_key=yThat URL implies BFI will be output for bitselect() on SDK 2.6. I wonder what happened Updated: Added a whitelist to only BFI_INT patch on GPUs we know it works, should fix 79xx GCN until a better solution is discovered.Some of the 7xxx family apparently are going to be VLIW4, but I don't know the code names for these for sure yet, I'll have to add those later. No bfi_int instruction on that arch, apparently. Unless there is a useful replacement, we use the normal code path. Heh, still, we won't need it on 79xx, the existing BFI_INT code can stay. Detecting VLIW5/4 and only running bfi_int on those is simple. Plus, 2.6 is supposed to fix the bfi_int bug, although I have not tested it, but I've been told it should actually work correctly with bitselect().GCN does not end the need for manual vectorization, it just makes the helical wound uint2 vectorization we use now less optimal. Most likely DiabloMiner already has an (more) optimal vectorization already available, but without a GCN card myself, theres no way to find out. Sure, but he seems to have quit development. That, and he has already left GPU mining and has funded his own ASIC production thanks to his gigantic GPU farm, so I'm pretty sure he could afford a few dozen 7970s if he so wanted them. It took basically three people to make GPU mining what it is now. You seriously underestimate the power of a single developer. If my miner is magic, then so is cgminer. I get roughly 384 on my 5850 at 930, so that should be about 390 on a 5870 at stock 850. I don't see what the issue is. So how are they going to upload stats? Using an untuned kernel on a miner that does not work on 79xx at this time? Who is going to fix the miners so they work? Without a 79xx, it surely is not going to be me.Also, how many donations do you actually think I've gotten? Its about $30 USD total over the past year. Heh, after they got caught taking bribes from Intel to make AMD look bad back in the K6/K7 days, they appeared on my permanent shit list. I do not trust a damned thing they say, ever. Yes, the same place they magically pulled their tuned-for-79xx miner from. Yeah, but what if this thing can do 700-800 mhash/sec overclocked? Mod here, lets keep it civil. Doesn't matter since their benchmark is bogus. None of the numbers are right, and they apparently couldn't even get the miner to produce valid shares. Such rage. Read the article, they say shit like "bitmining" and "server wouldn't verify so we had to solo mine". I have no clue what they were smoking, but all I wanted was answers like which miner they used, what args they used with it, and etc etc.tl;dr: fucking mass media, how does it workEdit: Also, their testing methodology is bullshit. From my calculations, a 5870 should be around 390 mhash at stock. Interested in 79xx support? See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=55540 If the BTC community buys me a 7970, I will benchmark and tune DiabloMiner and cgminer for it. No one has released valid benchmark numbers, and I'm tired of the bullshit, and I expect everyone else is too.Send BTC to 1DbeWKCxnVCt3sRaSAmZLoboqr8pVyFzP1 and help make this happen. Update: Moved execution threads back down to 2 now that AMD has fixed the CPU usage issue, and merged patch to make DM work better on chains that have difficulty below 1 Its not a GUI app, use the command line.
I agree. Not only that, FLOPs aren't all made equal. A lot of people have done stuff like specifically state P4 flops, which has a strict conversion factor comparing something along the lines of P4s doing SSE MADs to the same instruction in integer math, etc etc etc.I like my computational power metric better: number of 5850s at stock speed. And now the thread is locked. I already locked one out of control flamefest thread in the past 24 hours, are we going for two? Angry bastard mod here.I've had multiple people report this thread. I think this is the kind of case where I tell both sides to just hire lawyers and sue, I'm locking the thread. What you're calling the current release, from my point of view, is several months old. All the changes I've made since the last release of the front end bundle has improved performance, stability, and network handling for every other user.Apple refuses to fix their OpenCL stack, so if it is slower for you then it is a bug on their side. Your same hardware running Windows or Linux would be close to twice as fast. File a bug with Apple, seriously.The more people that complain their OpenCL stack is completely broken, the better. The only thing to improve on that is quit calling Java manually. Use the DiabloMiner-OSX.sh from the DM distro itself. I wouldn't mine on a laptop or an iMac anyways, they simply do not have enough cooling, nor do they have powerful enough GPUs to make it worthwhile. This has been going on in DiabloMiner awhile, the Mac frontend just hasn't been updated in awhile.OSX has a very broken OpenCL implementation, and Apple doesn't seem to want to fix it. Although, otoh, 10.7's isn't as bad as 10.6's was. MacCompiler, how do you change worksize in your UI? I dont have a mac to test on. Known bug on 10.7, cut your worksize down to 128 or 64.Dear Apple, please stop sucking. Signed, The Internet. Yay, everyone thought you ragequit. Never heard of that pool. Try a different one. See what I wrote above. We need asynchronous LPs to solve the issue correctly. No, you're still approaching it wrong. The merged mining shouldn't generate an LP, as they are implicitly synchronous. What we need is an asynchronous LP of some kind. Trying to hackjob it in the miner isn't correct. Wrong. On LP synchronously flush all works used on that pool. If you maintain a queue of work, it should be emptied and discarded.Yes, that leads to stalled threads. Better than wasting time and electricity generating stales. Wrong, stales happen because you DONT throw the work away fast enough. Namecoin through merged mining can't generate stales. Just use DM directly. Its not hard to use. As a reminder, DiabloMiner has no problem with merged mining, so until ck fixes this you can switch. Pool dead. Locking thread.
No. If you need GPU performance, just shut the miner off when you need it. That would be... the entirety of bitcointalk.org. Friendly neighborhood mod here.Seriously? Is that what you're going with? When I was your age, I had to go barefoot through the snow 5 miles uphill both ways to troll. I thought the only thing we have to fear is fear itself? No, Deepbit's hasn't changed dramatically, the network's has. Besides, I'm just asking temporarily, I don't particularly like any pool having a crack at a 51% attack. I just listed the three largest pools with no fee. Friendly neighborhood mod here:Current network hashrate has dropped to 6Thash, with Deepbit at 3Thash I request everyone jump to another pool until either Deepbit drops below 2hash or network hashrate starts increasing again.ArsBitcoin, ABCPool and Bitcoins.lc are good targets to jump to. I have to chime in too, why Deepbit? Ars is now the largest pool without fees. Deepbit is also too big to succeed at 3 thash (or a significant fraction of the total network hashrate).Edit: Sorry, I meant HALF THE NETWORK HASHRATE. Tycho can now perform a 51% attack. Locking this thread, use the new one: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=49417.0 And that was short lived, you're back out again. NMC is now in the top ten. I've updated the top ten list.deepbit, btcguild, ars, slush, bitclockers, abcpool, mmc, btcmine, bitcoins.lc, nmcbitIt seems the ddos hit the four largest pools, and then a few of the rest. Just switch to RapidXen. Rapidxen's specialty is dealing with DDoS magnets, and they're a shitload better than Linode. Dear thread:Accuse pools of ddossing other pools again, I will start giving theymos names to ban.Signed,Mods who have better things to do than manage children Never try to use AMD's installer on a distro that provides packages. It usually just causes a mess.Your only choice is to wait for AMD to fix it, but I suggest you keep trying to report the bug.Games are probably lagging due to the CPU use bug, just turn DiabloMiner off when gaming. Sounds like you tried to download it from git and didn't run mvn package first. Use the binary zip if you don't intend on building it. Update: Improve FPS timing to handle slow devices better So I finally did a 10k share test of the new code. 10349 shares, 13 rejects, so 0.12% reject rate down from around 0.48%, testing on BTCGuild.So yeah, I think I can say my new code does what it was supposed to. Huh, 10% you say? I wonder if that could be a driver bug. Update: Try to drive the reject average further below 0.25%
To be fair, don't start quoting numbers until you've hit 10k shares. There is still too large of a statistical instability to give wrong answers.That said, anything below 0.25% is good enough  Hrm, if the timing is off (ie, for 1200 instead of 1000), it should be closer to 290 is the best. The short answer is some pools suck dick. theymos has zero problems with how I moderate this board. If you have a problem with me having a problem with the pool I use having a problem with their security in the face of recent security problems then bring the problem up with theymos, and he will probably have a problem with you. Problem? You might wish to remember who the moderator is for this part of the forum. What I said still applies. Don't include foreign elements on an SSL'ed page. Period.I shouldn't have to be teaching security 101 to pool owners. You can't change the voltage on non-ref cards that use VRMs that the driver doesn't understand how to talk to. Do not try using RBE to edit the firmware either, you can easily brick or damage a card that way. Bitch at AMD until they fix it. Then disable it. Don't compromise the SSL session with stupidity. Driver bug. That would be interesting if it was related. This is what I implied earlier. It is, in fact, possible. Just very unlikely. That was never really true. I test on many of the large pools. But if I can't reproduce it, its not a bug. Mozilla is considering pinning keys on first site access. So the only way to MITM false certs is during the first access (which makes it same to ssh's flaw on server fingerprint (aka ~/.ssh/known_hosts)).DigiNotar is a clusterfuck, regardless. The problem is you DONT need to accept the cert since its signed by a CA. Thats why this was so dangerous. All you need is someone at Tux's ISP juping the traffic and bam MITM attack and no one is the wiser. Yes, I'm aware of the kernel.org break in. This does not apply here as the kernel I am running predates the break in and I do not get my kernel source from kernel.org.Mmm delicious git. Thats assuming tx fees are not already set high enough to cover projected fraud issues. See the third post, MtGox emails you the IP that made the request on withdraws. Changed. But until me or Tux can figure out what exactly happened, the issue remains open. XSRF attacks are largely difficult to perform in many cases. The problem is I would have had to visit the attacker's website at some point inside of the same environment I use to access mtgox to allow it.
I will expand on this. If someone gains control of mtgox, the attacker can just alter logs and dbs to make it appear that users are doing it themselves with little to no evidence that the machine was broken into.Magic hardware oracles only make it harder for attackers to attack from the perspective of the user. They are also not perfect due to lack of public third party auditing. The one RSA produces and is used by secure government and corporate facilities and was recently defeated.tl;dr: It prevents attacks like keylogging, it doesn't prevent attacking mtgox itself. $60 USD worth. It was a trivial amount, I was more worried about a large scale attack, which doesn't seem to be underway. Its better to warn everyone instead of sit on the information. I'm glad I was the only one hit so far. As a supporter of Ron Paul, that is the most slanderous and insulting thing I've seen said on this message board in awhile.As it stands, there are no other people reporting account problems. I still believe I was targeted because I'm a well known face for the Bitcoin community and a developer of software that is used in conjunction with Bitcoin frequently. For reasons unrelated to this, I would like to have this citation notated. As Ive said in the past, I do not believe that they improve security. After a lengthy conversation with MagicTux, unless it does turn up that mtgox has been hacked, neither of us can figure out what happened. Its obviously not me and I didn't fall for a phishing expedition, and Im pretty sure its not on his end. His description of security on the new post-hack mtgox is pretty decent. Its not perfect, but he has gone to great lengths to prevent a repeat.Even if they dumped the password database, the passwords are sufficiently salted and hashed that it is extremely unlikely they grabbed my password first.I also do not think it is likely the recent DigiNotar or Globalsign break ins have produced SSL certs to attack mtgox with (which WOULD explain this) because mtgox uses EV certs and as far as I know none of the fake certs were for EV, but DigiNotar and Globalsign both DO issue EV certs. Although I am not ruling this out.DigiNotar knew about the break in for months, and I obviously have logged in since then.Tux has replaced the missing BTC. I notified MagicTux through his support email, and he sent back a useless form letter as a reply.I consider this a smoking gun. Nope, its really me. Hi. Having my forum account "hacked" (which theymos does not believe has happened to anyone because everyone changed their passwords too fast) cannot be related to mtgox getting hacked. I use two different passwords if the op post wasn't clear by the use of the word unique. It seems Mt Gox has been broken into again. My account was just liquidated and send to a foreign address, the IP of which seems to be in the Ukraine. I assume I was targeted because I'm a Bitcoin developer.Since I use Linux and use unique high entropy passwords, I am ruling out any nonsense like local trojans.Everyone: Clear out your accounts if you have anything in them. Please note: Eligius is intentionally disabling rollntime for DiabloMiner users and tripling reject rates in the process. Use a different pool, such as btcguild which maintains a reject rate below 0.5%.  Textbook timing bug. Phoenix has a broken mhash meter that is known to read either too high or too low. Use DiabloMiner or cgminer instead. You do realize its easy to get banned, right? Take my advice, shut the fuck up. Update: Cut network failure sleep in half, move execution threads from 2 to 3 to increase performance until AMD fixes CPU usage bug You depend on UA snooping. Just sayin.And no, the only thing you confirmed is that miners still have a very low rate of stale shares. Are you going to start blacklisting other miners because they produce stale shares too? That bug never existed and I repeatedly confirmed that the bug is in your pool.If this is your stance, I might have to end up adding code to detect eligius and force reenable it. I use eligius almost exclusively, rollntime works fine.Edit: Goddamnit luke, you broke it! Try adding -v 2 to see if it decreases HW errors.Also, newer versions of Catalyst have a CPU use bug that effects all OpenCL apps. It cannot be fixed from within the app. Sounds like a driver bug.
Those numbers might not be entirely valid then. (Some?) 1200mhz cards do not seem to have the same timing as 1000mhz cards, so 1/4th might work better. On my 5850, the peak seems to be around 1/3rd instead, and on some 5870s from what I've heard its still 1/3rd. Huh, I wonder what hes using for vectors, I assume he means uint4 = V4, etc. That graph is very interesting, it highlights the register spillover problem in the phatk design quite nicely.I also wonder what card that is. Okay so, you have a problem with that, but not that eligius.st is the Catholic Patron Saint of monies? OSX's OpenCL impl is so screwed up, its not really worth it. Plus, the frontend is not shipping with my most up to date version of DiabloMiner. Update: Make kernel arrays an option, default to off, use -a to turn on.This should help users that had a speed decrease after introducing phatk-like arrays, such as OSX and Nvidia and SDK 2.1 users. The program (the kernel) is kept loaded in graphics memory, but the compute units dump the program when it switches to something else (EVERYTHING is a program, even rendering boring 2D desktop shit). Radeons have multiple levels of graphics memory, the memory clock just controls the actual GDDR5 RAM chips (ie, the "lowest" level as far as OpenCL is concerned). Kernel arguments and constants are stored in constant RAM (which for all intents and purposes are as fast as registers), and then theres scratch RAM that belongs to the CU which can be used to backfill register overflow (which isn't controlled by the memory clock, but seems to synchronize timings in some way). There are also multiple levels of caches for the CU and the texture processing units. You have a limited number of registers, and the drivers build programs that swap unused registers in and out as needed. I use far less registers than phatk, but it also nails memory timing harder, but goes faster as a result since less registers get swapped out. It seems my response got eaten.No, it isn't a guideline. 1/3rd core clock for memory clock sits in a zone that on most Radeon 5xxxes it hits the stock memory timings correctly and incurs no speed loss for applications that don't rely on memory bandwidth.If you're too low or too high, you incur a speed loss or sometimes the card just locks up.Some kernels require better compliance with this than others.As I just said to iopq, some kernels require more than others. Try 1/3rd, it will probably bring back your missing hashes. Btw, why are your memory clocks wrong? They should be 1/3rd of your core clock's speed. Try -v 2 or -v 18. Locking this thread until people pull their heads out of their asses. The phatk technique is... to use an array. Thats it.Those arguments are loaded into constant memory, which is as fast as registers but is workgroup wide. You can't win that way. It never really was pure phatk to begin with. I tried to phatk-arize the existing kernel, but it ended up causing more work and problems than it was worth. It is still phatk-ized, but in a way that properly uses the technique (something phateus himself doesn't yet). Update: Increase speed 1.3% on SDK 2.1 and 0.2% on SDK 2.5, use Deque instead of AtomicReference for incoming new workOSX users: Test to see if the new kernel fixes things or makes it faster. Timing an LP connection out is still an error. LP is meant to be kept open until the next block appears. DiabloMiner can handle pools that lag badly during LP return, due to significant testing on Eligius when they had that problem. Good news, I can replicate the bug.Bad news, I'm busy trying to make the kernel go faster so my next patch won't be a fix for thisGood news, use -l http://username:password@pit.deepbit.net:8332/ until I fix it I am thinking a pool issue. I bet their HTTP implementation is very wrong. -D 0 isn't valid, card numbers start at 1. Tell me if that fixes it. Sorry, I'm blind. Its 329, I dunno why I didn't see that line. What command line are you giving it? Its wrong, but I should be handling that error properly. Are you sure you're using the newest version? 137 doesn't look like it can do that.
Yeah, but you also lose a ton of important fixes. Honestly? Don't mine on OSX. Even when it works, it sucks up 40% of your performance. The ghash meter just measures raw ghash produced. If it stops moving, then yes, you have a problem. FPS doesn't sound right unless you're a large -f value in the same ballpark, and the second mhash number doesn't make sense unless you own 2 or more video cards.I assume its just more OSX insanity. I am not surprised. Known 10.7 bug. Until they fix it, use -w 64. Seems to be a launch4j bug. Tell them to rebuild the binaries for universal. This will happen on any OSX that doesn't have the PPC emulator anymore (such as any 10.7 and I think some 10.6s) You seem to be the only one posting in the thread. Update: Improved error handling more, remove usage of System.exit() and blanket Exception catching, DiabloMiner now passes FindBugs Yeah, it doesn't keep track of things like that. It'll normally do a 15 second timeout, fail, and rotate to the next.It is just by virtue of it not rotating off a good pool that it will gravitate towards the more functional pools. No.Although I've been considering having it change pools after a semi-random timeout, but you risk being sent back to the unstable pool.It really doesn't matter what pool you mine on as long as you're mining, honestly. You'll eventually get the payouts, it just takes a little longer. Its by design. Anytime a pool fails to connect during a getwork, that execution thread rotates to the next pool. Which pools execution threads are set to on startup is randomly selected.The client will generally gravitate towards the most stable pool. Dude, don't be a dick. Update: Remove rollNTimeExpire variable and use refresh/1000, make LP flush all only flushes works for that pool, support X-Reject-Reason in debug output, unify json/rollNTime/fetch time cross-thread signaling in one object We all see it. Unicode fonts typically don't contain the official symbols for meth and cocaine. Update: Make roll ntime disabling even more paranoid, change LP timeout back to 10 minutes, re-add force getwork on rejected shares to the new async sendwork code Update: Improved error handling, improved roll ntime disabling support, changed LP hard timeout to 5 minutes That is just a silly script.With DiabloMiner, you just use commas with -l or -u -p -o -r, and it automatically handles it. So basically, use multipool mode on DiabloMiner. Yay, I didn't catch the error condition where the user doesn't type any pools to access. Shares generated is an essentially random value. According to statistics, you should get about 344 shares in an hour at 410 mhash. Except poclbm is generally slower than DiabloMiner.
Until Tycho adds support for X-Mining-Extensions to his Roll NTime spec, I see no reason to support this. In other words, you're giving me a reason to remove rollntime completely in DiabloMiner. Good jorb. Don't make me have to moderate this thread. Eligius sometimes has multiple pool servers  Jine, consider this an official warning. Go troll elsewhere. Update: There, I fixed the bug. And for future note, I'm going to treat all future bugs like this: If you're not using Eligius, it is not my problem. Yeah, it seems theres a bug in iongchun's code to add expire time support and I didn't catch it because I don't regularly use any pools that don't support it.For those wondering about Java, "string literal".equals(null) returns false instead of NullException.I'll roll this fix out in a bit. Wow, that is one hell of a driver bug. The error is saying -w should be 1024, but that is invalid for any Radeon manufactured. Not only that, it makes no sense.Maybe it is quoting the error backwards, try -w 64. Driver bug, go report it to Apple. Update: Support expire time in X-Roll-NTime Always .trim() input. Myself, um, dude.No pony sigs. kthx. I use Java itself to parse the URL, and its pretty flexible. The only way it'll bitch is if you made a bad typo (such as, putting , instead of . and getting yourself stuck on the multi-pool code that wraps the URL parser). -l requires an actual URL. You gave it only a domain, you probably want -o instead.Since you're with two cards, and only one card does it, it sounds like you forgot to turn crossfire off. If you're on linux, run sudo aticonfig --initial --adapter=all -f and then restart X. Holy crap dude. What is the entire arguments you're feeding it?Also, what did you try feeding it with -l? It should work fine if you're using it right. Then I should be checking for the exception, not if it is != null. I suspect user error. I use eligius fine. Java coders prefer checking against "" instead of checking length for some reason. Almost all the places I check also check for null as well.And why around 831? At no point can that be null. Palmdetroit, just because those tripleminer idiots put gigantic sig banners up doesn't mean you can. I want to ban them so much. Get an account on github and send me a merge request. Its the easiest way to send me code.
Sure, if you're on a shell that actually handles that. Windows afaik doesn't. The binary is also updated. And don't put -o -p and -u args in quotes, thats nonsensical. Other way around. I never use GET and always POST. The HTTP spec is clear on this, if you have no message body in the request its a GET, if you have no message body in the response its a PUT, if you have both its a POST. JSON-RPC does the actual request mechanism in the JSON in the request, thus it is always a POST.There is no reason to believe LP should be a GET (even though apparently poclbm and pheonix send GETs with empty message bodies expecting a JSON-RPC response, and pools actually allow this against both the HTTP and JSON-RPC specs), so it seems to be quite clear. Other than Tycho's writeup on it, nope. Its just a bad hack. You missed the entire discussion on this. The spec is incorrect if it requires GETs for a JSON-RPC request. It makes more sense to load balance to prevent a pool going down from slowing mining.It also makes it harder for deepbit lol50% situations. This. Update: Fixed race condition Update: Fix up the X-Switch-To code ... shit. I know exactly what I did too.Note to self: Don't code for a few hours, then release it.Update: Fixed the obvious bug. Update: Multiple pool support, use commas Print the responses to those requests including the HTTP status codes. The LP spec doesn't say "the LP request is not a JSON RPC request" explicitly. If it did, then, yes, I could get away with doing GET. Receiving a JSON RPC response is questionable at best in the case that this is true (although normal JSON over HTTP obviously is GETtable).I don't particularly like the idea of mixing JSON RPC and non JSON RPC in the same protocol. If the LP spec says that you don't need to send a JSON RPC request, then the LP spec is wrong. Nope, LP expects a standard JSON RPC request as far as I can tell. As will DiabloMiner Update: Further fix against broken pools ANY client that EVER uses GET for JSON RPC is wrong. Read the HTTP spec, GETs should never have message bodies. DiabloMiner follows the HTTP specification and uses POST for all requests.If you want LP to work, it must be a unique URL.Try running DM with -dd, you'll see a matching flood of LP returned messages because your server is not holding the LP request open correctly. lol? All 5xxx and 6xxx do. "" makes no sense, because then it would use the existing URL with no modifications. How would the pool server be able to tell the difference? My miner immediately starts a new LP attempt once the existing one completes. So, yes, it starts spamming because LP is not supposed to return immediately."foo" adds /foo to the end of the existing URL's path. "/foo" replaces the entire path, and then it also accepts a fully qualified URL. Other miners seem to only accept "foo" in violation of any sane interpretation of the URL RFC. Weird. The only way you can get that behavior is if slush's pool is accepting new connections but just stalling. Try a different pool.
I don't need access. OSX is not open source, so I can't fix it where it needs to be fixed, only Apple can. If you're on one, you should be. OTOH, it shouldn't be slowing it down if you dont have BFI_INT enabled Something is extremely wrong with OSX. Its saying its executing kernels, but then not, and then doesn't emit any errors.DM will wildly spin like that when kernels take zero time to execute. Problem is, the implementation MUST emit errors.I so very much hate OSX. I follow the URL RFC and the LP specification. What URL are you giving it in the LP header? Yes, you used -D 0. I swear I'm going to add an error for that.Do not use -D unless you want to exclude cards. DiabloMiner by default uses all cards. n/t You're partly understanding it correctly. Look at the math I printed, a getwork lasts 45 seconds at 100 mhash/sec. There are 2 used per GPU. On my 5850@918, that is a getwork every 12 seconds on average (they come in groups of 2 every 24 seconds). An LP only causes a getwork up to 24 seconds early.LP returns a getwork, it is reused, but that doesn't help the other threads. Thus, LP causes a getwork flush. Also, for my 5850, this also means I can only produce stales for up to 24 seconds. A terminally stuck LP thread will just cause spans of 24 seconds to be stale-happy. A block happens roughly every 8 minutes (although the network targets 10). It only effects Windows, and only some Windows users. Its similar to the SDK 2.2/2.3 bug and its caused by a broken busy loop that doesn't properly sleep. Yeah, its the lack of harm that I don't really see an issue with just making both 10. Or even 15. Extremely few blocks are past 15 from what I can tell. The worst case is the connection times out and we cause getworks early.Ahh, now, thats the magic words I was looking for I think. I should add this to both timeout and no timeout.Now, the somewhat interesting thing is, LP does not actually control when getworks happen. 100 mhash/sec causes nonce saturation in 45 seconds on a single getwork, and you have 2 getworks per GPU worked in parallel.LP locking up due to network/pool stupidity only causes higher actual stale rates because LP isn't triggering getworks early. Any shares created until post-new block getwork are stale. It stops generating stales when the new getwork triggers. Yeah, 60 minutes makes no sense. Bitcoin aims to create a new block every ten minutes. Generally, its closer to every 6 to 8. If 10 minutes have passed, and LP hasn't returned, its obvious we're most likely in a new block by now.setReadTimeout doesn't seem to do what the javadocs says it does, at least, not from what I can see in the source. I'll look at it later. Update: Anyone having problems on pools with extremely broken LP (such as connections never returning), it should be fixed now (it times out after 10 minutes instead of never). I've also upped the stack size so you shouldn't see OOM errors when the queues get overloaded (at least, it will take much longer). Also, the bug with slushpool where multiple execution threads would not be brought up properly has also been fixed. Yeah, I might make that change myself. 16 is just cutting it too thin. Ahh, weird. 2.3 should have just refused to work altogether. 2.3 does not support 68xx afaict, only 2.4. OSX's OpenCL implementation is a disaster.At any rate, the LP bug you're having doesn't make sense. It almost sounds like the pool ls intentionally not returning on LP. Look at the code yourself: if the LP either returns or errors out, it tells all the mining threads to go refresh their getworks, it then goes back to starting another LP.It almost sounds like you're mining on a pool that is down, and my miner (obviously) isn't shutting down. The only way you'd realistically run out of memory (since I tell Java to limit it to a small size) is if the sendwork queue fills up. Your mod looks almost identical to the changes I made when I unmacro'ed frankenkernel. Update: Removed a lot of dead code that the compiler should remove, and I think it might have been missing some. Nope, several mobos support tools provided by the OEM to runtime tweak settings, but only the expensive overclocker/prosumer ones. So basically SDK 2.5 is looking to be as fast as 2.1. Well, there was someone that was claiming he made DiabloMiner run a lot faster (he called it DiabloMiner II). It popped up on github and sf.net, he stripped the GPL notice and refused to distribute the source on my request, and he ran the binary he built through a bytecode obfuscater.I ended up DMCAing his shit, and he never responded. You're on a hybrid Nvidia Macbook. Due to Apple's stupidity, you have to manually select which GPU you wish to use with -D, and it can only be the one thats running, OSX won't let you use both and DM may or may not crash if you switch from AC<->Battery (or whatever swaps hybrids) due bugs in OSX's driver stack.
Update: Finished adding all the old optimizations, increase speed like 1-2%Although, I seem to be at the limit here. I went from 378 to 379 on SDK 2.1. I think I'll work on undoing more frankenkernel insanity later. You do realize every time you report a post I make, it gets reported to me since I' the mod for the mining section? I thought you would have figured that out after second time. I'm calling GimEEE a troll, and your reaction is exactly what he wanted. Thus, you're feeding the troll. If it is 6, you should be seeing about 12 in a burst.-f 1 is recommended, it'll push it up significantly.As miner per GPU, this won't fix your problem. It sounds like their patch just doesn't work right. I use a single networking thread to process all async getworks, and a single thread to process all async sendworks (ie, two threads total). If it is trying to pair stuff to TCP sessions, then it is 100% broken, and the guy that wrote the patch doesn't understand how HTTP works either. Nope, only that you seem to have 4 or 5 GPUs. Forum rule: Don't feed the trolls. I think you mean keepalive support. DiabloMiner supports keepalive, and the use of it does not effect rejections either way.It sounds like bitcoins.lc screwed something up. There is a slight problem. GimEEE is not owed any BTC from Eligius. All US server payments have been paid out as far as I know, and GimEEE has none on the EU server. He is just trolling, pure and simple. You need evidence that you're the laughing stock of the forums? LOL Yes it is possible, seeing as DiabloMiner already does this. DiabloMiner will submit a share no matter what, mere network problems will not stop it. Because it was already patched. Or use DiabloMiner which has much better networking code. No, its invalid on mining as well. My miner has a HW error counter, it only ticks up when the HW produces a hash it thinks produces H == 0, but when double checked it doesn't. I think I meant 1 per several hundred billion. Its in the chip specification somewhere, ask AMD.Bzzt, wrong. GPU hardware does not use the same manufacturing process CPU hardware typically does. GPUs are not mission critical hardware, and rare calculation errors are considered acceptable.You are correct about "incorrect" voltage, however you assume that it is incorrect at all. The professional versions of these cards run at lower clock rates and lower voltages to reduce the error rate. Consumer cards are not ran at incorrect settings, they are merely ran at settings that lead to acceptable levels of errors. I'll cut you off there. You cannot shut off error correction via OpenCL, not that there is any to actually shut off.The only thing I shut off is HW error message spamming when BFI_INT is on (because BFI_INT is a large hack and certain usages confuse the driver). HW error checking is still enabled in the miner, and the counter still ticks up. Consumer GPUs do not use ECC-enabled GDDR5. The HW errors, however, are caused by naturally unstable hardware. On normal Radeons at stock clocks and voltages, and are not overheating, have a known error rate (which is something like 1 error per several hundred million instructions), and do not have excessive (or really, any) internal checks.This is not a defect in the hardware. GPUs are for playing video games. Scientific apps that are searching for a needle in a haystack (such as what we do) double check the result. I am locking this topic.As per OpenCL specification:In other words, the hardware threads are stomping each others work and producing nonsense. Oddly, no. I do that by using two (formerly three) threads, each thread having its own queue.So, that would be 4 (formerly 6) buffers.The problem is the Radeon driver sometimes does not finish copying the buffer quickly due to system IO load (since SDK 2.1 does not support DMA, nor does 2.4 on Linux). Alternating buffer (which costs me nothing) means I can schedule the kernel execution without having to wait for the previously used buffer to unlock.So, its executing in parallel, just out strictly out of order. I already did before making my post. But hey, whatever. Either the DB got corrupted (say, per post unique IDs were not unique or other mysql sillyness), or SMF writes shitty software.Theymos's screenshot shows the forum thought I deleted 4 threads, when I deleted 1 post (another GimEEE troll post).Speaking of which, hey Theymos, why isn't he banned yet? A lot of people have asked, including me.
Stickied. Small problem is I deleted a couple posts. So, I'm thinking I accidentally tripped on database corruption.Especially since people are reporting missing threads in forum sections that I don't have mod powers on. Apparently the board has decided to eat a bunch of threads because its PHP and MySQL.Goddamnit Theymos. Because its faster on some setups. Update: Added bitless's hack.My 5850@918 on 2.1 went from 369 to 378, so a 2.4% increase. Pools and proxies that can't handle ntime being incremented by one or two need to be fixed. The proxy probably does not correctly support things DiabloMiner does, such as time incrementing and returning multiple nonces for the same getwork over short periods. It looks like the sendwork thread is being choked by the proxy.So, clearly, its a proxy bug. -v 2 -w 128 should be as fast as phatk VECTORS WORKSIZE=128 on your machine. If it isn't, then its just more proof Phoenix has a broken hash meter. Use -v 2 with either -w 128 or 256. -v 3/19 settings don't seem to be optimum anymore. Don't use -f 0. I need to add an error message for that, as far as I can tell, instead of dividing by zero, it just steadily increases the worksize to maximum of 2^32 (or about 0.1 fps give or take).Loadshare might be halfway easily to implement. Not sure. Uodate: Behold, the frankenkernel. A mix of DiabloKernel and phatk.Before this, I got 369 mhash on my 5850@918 on SDK 2.1, and 352 on 2.4 post-11.4 (thanks AMD!)Now I get 369 on 2.1 AND 2.4.AMD, you can't hide. I am coming for you. No. Update: Change execution thread count from 3 to 2. More efficient, no longer need 3 because of fully async getwork. Update: Finish async networking, now everything is async. getwork, sendwork, and LP now use 1 thread per miner instance instead of 3 per GPU.So, no matter how much Eligius lags out, it can't stop mining. Thats normal. At 300 mhash, you can see 3 nonce saturations happen every 45 seconds. If your setup is configured correctly, it will use all 3. 884 through 903 use shortcuts to do less math in the OpenCL kernel (because the math is the same for all the runs). The rest of 903 through 944 just executes the kernel, checks for errors, and then sets up a blocking buffer read.As for that warning, it indicates a driver bug. As long as it happens only once in awhile, you're fine. If you're getting a lot of HW errors, the miner is probably slowing down. Sounds like the proxy is trying to report an error message, I wish I knew what it was saying. I wish I knew what the rest of that is. What are you connecting it to?
Did I say donating it to the pool? I meant giving it to me. I vote for gimeee's mney to be taken and donated to the pool. Mod here. Why must people make threads that I just have to lock later? Theymos will have to do it. I don't mind seeing subforums for the three largest pools (the ones I have stickied atm), but I don't have the power to make them. Boards within boards within boards... And good for you. I'm the author of DiabloMiner and a forum mod and one of the earliest Bitcoin adopters.I use Eligius.   Mod here. Locking the thread because I'm tired of people reporting it frequently.Oh, and don't screw Newegg just because you had a bad Bitcoin experience, and you can take this entire conversation elsewhere. Then use a different pool. Mod here. Don't be a jackass. Troll thread detected. This thread is now locked. You can't check VRM temps on Linux, but if you're only at 70c, I doubt this is the problem.I've seen phoenix and poclbm users report the infamous bug. I originally thought it was limited to just multi-GPU users, but single GPU users get it as well.DiabloMiner's networking code never gives up. Which is great for Eligius users because the pool chokes frequently and shares fail to get delivered.I'm not aware of 11.6 fixing this, but you can always try. Probably disabled it to prevent post-mtgox bullshit. Assuming that your GPUs are not overheating (keep them 85c or below) and the VRMs are not overheating (which can happen with poor airflow, even at low GPU temps), then you're looking at a driver bug.Sadly, the driver bug would even happen if you ran pheonix/poclbm. Some people work around it by running twice as many miners at once, because it doesn't freeze both of them. Its a bad hack, but it'll work until AMD fixes their shit. Okay, this thread has gone on long enough. There are no actual posters in this thread, just trolls.I am tired of getting this thread reported to multiple times a day.It is now locked. I seem to have fixed the problems with nvidia hw errors, but not the extreme minority of AMD users that get it (which I still believe is a very obscure driver bug).-g is ignored when using LP.Grouped rejects happen on all pools no matter if they use LP or not because the client runs multiple getworks in parallel, if the pool hiccups it will hit all of them at once. If you have a monitor always plugged into the second card as well, you don't need a dummy plug. For those interested in the response, see http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=1721.msg238127#msg238127 and http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=1721.msg238559#msg238559 Moderators should not hand out bad advice like that. Only one 6xxx is 2 GPUs, the 6990 (which is the replacement for the 5970, the only 2 GPU 5xxx). DiabloMiner supports unlimited GPUs with a single instance, so no, he needs to run 1. BTW, yes, 0 accepts and 0 rejects are valid for solo mining. At the current difficulty it will take you about 14 weeks on average to find a block, which then accepts will turn to 1.Disconnect your crossfire cable if you have crossfire disabled. If you're solo mining, the only thing you need to give to DiabloMiner is -u and -p, -o and -r are already set correctly by default for local solo mining.From your description in the other thread, it almost sounds like its failing to connect to Bitcoin (which eventually will timeout) during startup.Also, are you using a dummy plug on your second GPU? With crossfire off, Windows turns cards off, even if they're in use, when there is no monitor plugged in. My math gives about 469 combined for two 6850s if you can find the right settings, but its more likely to be in the 450s because you're on SDK 2.4. A 6870 is about as fast as a 5850 at their respective stock clocks, a 6850 is about 1/3rd slower than a 6870 at their respective stock clocks, and a 5850 is about 1/4th slower than a 5870.So 450s for two overclocked 6850s is in the right ballpark if a overclocked 5870 is doing 450.
Its 15 sec average/forever avg.Also, you can set -w all you want. Most OSX users say anything but default is slower for them. Theres actually a lengthy argument about that. There is a large group of people, me included, that believe Phoenix displays hash rates about 5% too high. So, ymmv. I only recommend -f 1 for dedicated miners. For desktop users, -f 1 usually causes excessive lag. Update: Fixes to deal with pushpool bugs: Added async sendwork, obsessive LP failure retrying, and time incrementing on nonce saturation getwork failure I'm considering adding a feature to mine with multiple pools.Also, running multiple miners does not work with my miner to do fallover... my miner does not stop mining during severe error conditions like that. Increase -f, it expects a multiple or divisior of 60. Also, that 5870 can easily do >350 mhash/sec... OSX really sucks. Its not OS related, Linux users are getting it. It is also not Crossfire related, as people who turn off Crossfire and people with single GPUs are getting it.Turning off HW checking would do nothing, as a high number of errors are also causing potential pool shares to evaporate (they're getting about 3/4th as many). Like I told the guy above this post, the HW error is a pita. I'm trying to increase error reporting to catch this bug, so you're probably seeing something thats always been going on but was not sufficiently reported. You're probably suffering from the Radeon HW error bug that I can't reproduce. An extremely small number of users suffer from it, and other miners, as far as I can tell, just don't report it (which is even worse). I meant eodchop and pennytrader. -v does not work on nvidia due to driver bugs. I think BTCGuild uses pushpool, which explains why its also screwing up.But as a side note, hardware error != rejected. Do you have a high number of hardware errors or a high number of rejects? I think I'm going to talk to theymos about what we're going to do to annoying users like Veldy and pennytrader. Its not defective as much as its Nvidia. You're still well within reason. Its in the op post: install maven, download from git, run mvn package I bet you're on eligius. DiabloMiner automatically disconnects connection attempts after 15 seconds, and eligius lags so bad that DM disconnects frequently to save itself. This cannot be fixed in the miner, and its effecting mining speed because the execution threads block waiting for the connection to complete.Switch to slush's, deepbit, btcguild, or anything that doesn't use pushpoold. Once every 5-10 minutes is a little high, but I was asking more about users that are getting 5-10 a second. Theres a tiny subset of users getting this, and I want to see how widespread it is.What you have, however, OCing cards can cause it, especially when it pushes it to the edge that you'd need to overvolt too. As long as your Nvidia GPU is kept below 75c this shouldn't be a huge issue. Update: I seem to have fixed all the Nvidia problems for now. Also, connection errors on send work are no longer counted as rejects.If anyone is having a high number of hardware errors on Radeons, speak up. AMD themselves say if you want to use OpenCL and use all your cards effectively, you need to turn Crossfire off. The usual side effect of leaving it up is that all the GPUs after the first one are either stuck at 0% usage or produce absolute garbage.In Windows, you need dummy plugs to make Windows turn the card on if its not in a Crossfire pair. Feh, someone unstickied it or the forum glitched. I fixed it.
I think you misunderstood. poclbm, mine, phoenix, and cpuminer are all stickied. But hey, don't let facts get in the way of your blatant trolling. You posted extremely large images full of text and your posts were flagged for moderation.Next step is banning your account if you don't clean up your act. Ahem. I pinned the three opencl miners, cpuminer, and the 5 largest pools. If anything, people can now read the most important threads first and find them quickly. Not this shit again. I'm in ur thread, moderatin it.Don't post image spam again, andes. I edited the subject to include your current ghash rate, hope you dont mind Don't enable Crossfire when mining. Try using a newer version of Catalyst (like 11.5), you might be looking at some obscure driver bug. Hrm, try rebooting yet? The drivers might have gone nuts. What version of Catalyst? It might be too old. For one, DiabloMiner cannot CPU mine. The other thing is DiabloMiner requires X running, which isn't that huge of an issue since mining on Radeons requires X running.You can still do it headless, but start X (with, say, startx &) and then export DISPLAY=:0. All can be done from ssh.By the way, no one has tested my miner on Solaris, you would be the first. You have both installed. Don't do that. Its a different bug this time. They moved the CPU usage bug into the driver itself. It only effects SOME Windows users, but not all, and no Linux users. I've almost confirmed it, but I can't figure out where the bug is. But at least when some silly Phoenix user says "waaah Phoenix is faster than DiabloMiner" I can laugh at them while I have sexual relations with their female parental units. What you described sounded like  you OC'ed too far.Asking ahead is hard to do right and it also causes increased stale work. It fetches new work more than once a minute for most users. Also, this uses 3 different sets of work in parallel, its unlikely all 3 will block at the same time.It really isn't the issue that people claim it is, other miners suffer from it much more. Yeah i think that is exactly what it is.. Makes me wonder who though.... Thought it would be a hacker group but read that one of the main ones actually accept bitcoins for donations. Cant remember the name but it is the group currently attacking nintendo and sony.[/quote]Its not Anonymous. Infact, theres tons of Anonymous using Bitcoin from what I heard. Make sure you're using the absolutely most up to date version of the miner. mtrlt's patch screwed up dropping about 1/3rd of shares for some people. I've fixed it since then. If it crashes after 2 hours of OC, you might be OCing too far.Im surprised any of the 30s do anything reasonable at all.Most people find -v 2, 3, and 19 to be the best with some -w setting tuning it.It doesnt nonce steal because it costs nothing to get more... if you're pool mining and your network has a lot of lag this can screw stuff up, but it looks like you were solo mining, which leads me to believe low -f values on Windows are screwing over bitcoin due to Window's craptastic scheduler.Also, benchmarking on low -f values are difficult. Due to Windows' broken clock implementation, the first number (the 15 second avg) reports rather random values. The only way to stop that is to run for at least 5 minutes and use the second number (the forever average) only.Other than that, interesting table. What, seriously? Thats bad.

-D 0 isn't valid, thats why. It starts at 1, and you shouldn't be using -D anyhow unless you have a very specific reason to. I reported it to GitHub as a GPL violation. Lets see what happens. You're on one of those hybrid dual Nvidia setups. You can't force one on or the other. Use -D to force it to use the right one (starts at 1). Yes, the terminal is that.It almost sounds like the miner locked up.  Both ATI and Nvidia have fixed function hardware dedicated to tessellation. Nvidia 5xx performance on tess is about the same as Radeon 5xxx/68xx performance, which both are really inferior to 69xx performance. I did not formally learn to program, I learned how to program by doing it day in and day out for over a decade (which, honestly, is the only way to learn how to program, no college degree is magically going to make you know how to).I do not have a job that reflects my skill set. If the miner is functioning correctly, it should be at the bottom of the terminal. The hash meter is the thing that says xxxx/xxxx khash/sec.The Bitcoin client no longer mines because its pointless. Don't use -D unless you specifically want to NOT use certain GPUs in a multi-GPU setup.You will not get any additional log output unless you find a block, or there is an error of some kind. The hash meter is pretty much it. Sounds like user error. Yeah, must be. Seriously, check the code yourself, line 140 and up. No --platform. Um, platform is not a valid argument for my miner. You're not the only one to tell me of similar bugs. I have another guy who is getting tons of "this nonce was already submitted" errors on Deepbit, which makes zero sense because the nonce counter is happily rotating.It makes no sense why its triggering unless nvidia has a very broken OpenCL impl. Which, well, we know that already. The entire network once waited about 6 hours. Doesn't seem abnormal to me. 129 pages.Just sayin. What the hell is wrong with Nvidia lately. I swear to god I hit every goddamned Nvidia bug.Dear Nvidia users: BUY AMD CARDS. Sounds like your install is broken. Take it up with Ubuntu. Hrm, update to the newest one, but I don't think any of the updates effect Nvidia users.I wonder if its just yet another Nvidia driver bug. If it happens infrequently, ignore it. All hardware does now and then (maybe 1 or 2 in 1000 blocks or so). However, if it does it frequently, then your card is either overheating (no more than 75c for a Geforce), or you have it overclocked too far. You can always try -f 120 or 180 or 240. The -w 64 trick sadly only works on real nvidia drivers, not osx's own opencl implementation.
The Bitcoin client only shows its own CPU mining. I recommend you turn CPU mining off in the client, as its a waste of electricity, hardware, and time and usually slows GPU mining down too. No way man. I'm Satoshi. So is Gavin. And Luke. AND YOU. We're all Satoshi, each and every one of us. No. Intel only very recently manufactured GPUs that do OpenCL, it is limited to the new GMA HD 2000/3000 series only. GMA 2000/3000/4000 and GMA HD (aka 5000 aka HD 1000) do not support it and do not even have the hardware to support it. I can imagine higher, its not valid for most GeForces (or any Radeon for that matter). What does local work size say when you don't use -w? That is your maximum. Ahh, dunno. Your question would be better off towards the author of RPC Miner or the front end for it. You should get about 6 mhash. Try a higher -w value, Apple's OpenCL implementation is extremely buggy. Woah, that xorg.conf doesn't look right. Without -D, does it list, say, 4 Barts? Update: I think I've refixed mtrlt's mining bug. I hope.The math to calculate this, you need three things, mhash, number of shares (at least 100), and the number of minutes between the first and last shares.mhash * 60 * minutes4296 * sharesSo, for example 367 mhash, 100 shares,  18 minutes367 * 60 * 18 = 3963604296 * 100 = 429600So in this case, I was luckier than normal.If you have the bug, the share hashrate will be approximately 2/3rds of the actual hashrate. Certain combinations drive the hardware harder. If you're borderline overclocked too far, some settings could push you over.Also, -f 60 could also drive the hardware harder over -f 30, so ymmv. (And no, you don't win here, 60 is slower than 30 on Windows, and causes a more variable hashrate otherwise). 80 out of 1634 seems to be fine for an OC'ed card.Do not try to suspend the monitor during mining, Windows tries to get clever and fails.HW check errors do not effect stale shares on the pool, as they are never sent in. Each GPU uses 3 queues in three different threads and are setup in a way that can never cause this.If you do -D 2, only Barts #2 should have a load.Also for dual-head on one card but not the other, I'd carefully edit the redundant screen definitions out of xorg.conf after running that second command. 230 sounds closer to a single 6850.No, it can't accidentally label blocks coming from the wrong device. It is contributing to the hash meter.You're on Linux, so did you forget to turn off Crossfire? You need to run sudo aticonfig --initial --adapter=all -f and then restart X. You're suffering from the bug. It eats about 1/3rd of hash attempts.Although, interestingly, not using vectors doesn't trigger it.Sigh. I hate bugs. 15 second average/forever average It spits it out on startup now. Nope. Sure you have the right speed in mind? A 6870 should be doing somewhere around 270 or so at stock speeds. Using the log vonshmitt sent me, the people suffering from this bug are losing about 1/3rd shares (rejected and accepted combined).I wonder if I missed additional bugs in mtrlt's patch.Edit: double fuck, its doing it here too. *cough* Thats a dual nvidia hybrid. Only one chip is on at the same time, and it confuses the hell out of most apps because OSX is too stupid to not list chips that are powered off. Well, if the bug happens to be on the pool side (ie, pools are not properly checking hashes), then not only is that exploitable, it would be blocked by the pool software I'm writing (which checks share validity fully).If the bug IS in my miner, I would love to find out what exactly triggers it so I can fix it, but I just don't think it is. If you're on Windows, and have installed a recent version of Catalyst (11.4 and up), it installs the OpenCL runtime unless you tell it not to.What hardware do you have?
Should work properly in Linux. Like I've said to others, I believe there is either a widespread bug in how some pools operate (such as giving the wrong diff target out, or incorrectly checking hashes (such as H == 0 only instead of also G <= target)), or Pheonix is incorrectly reporting that shares have been accepted when they haven't.For me, on Deepbit, I get two or three stale shares for every 1000 give or take. Let me repeat: the Deepbit hashmeter is useless. It does not reflect anything useful. I've had it say I'm doing 500 mhash consistently for about an hour, and I do around 300.And yes, don't try to send failed hashes. Not a good idea.42 attempts producing 31 shares honestly sounds like the hardware is overheating or your machine is unstable. As long as your GPU temp is below 85c, this shouldn't happen unless the card sucks (say, Powercolor,  Diamond, non-reference XFX, etc) or your PSU can't handle the load.I cannot reproduce this bug. If you have one of the Macs with a hybrid GPU setup, OpenCL apps may not function correctly. You're on a Mac. OSX sucks about 40% of your hashing speed out because it has an inferior OpenCL implementation and can't do bfi_int on Radeons.So yeah, that sounds about right. Huh, interesting. You're getting them, yet the bug has been fixed, and I'm not aware of the bug ever showing on 2.4.BTW, bfi_int with certain combinations of vector cause false positive hw errors, but otherwise do not touch the number of shares produced. At 270 mhash, you should be able to produce 50 shares in about 14 minutes.If its the bug I'm thinking it is, then you will get 50 attempts, but not 50 shares. If its the bfi_int harmless driver bug, then you will get 50 shares, but way more than 50 attempts. Are you sure you're using the absolute newest version of my miner? mtrlt's 0.5% speed increase accidentally had a bug that would cause similar behavior to half of shares missing. I fixed it shortly afterwards.A dead giveaway of the bug is using -dd and seeing a ton of hardware check errors. Either you do not have OpenCL drivers installed, or your device does not support OpenCL. Trust me, my hashrate calculation is correct. If anything, poclbm is somewhat inaccurate and phoenix has been proven to be very inaccurate. Wait, hold up. Theres your problem. Deepbit's hash meter is 100% inaccurate and is counting a rare random event, ie, share generation. Do not use Deepbit's hash meter as a measure of performance.My miner tends to swing the randomness of share generation around harder (due to working on independent work in parallel), but otherwise has no effect on actual share generation.Also, I may consider submitting shares in a separate thread in the future, however I already run 3 mining threads per GPU and this tends to eliminate usual network lag issues. Its typically called solo mining.Yes, you have to start bitcoin either as bitcoin -server or as bitcoind. I've made requests to have this functionality put into the GUI preferences, but apparently no one has listened. Nope, my hashrate is 100% correct. The problem is, OTHER miners do NOT look for OpenCL execution errors and happily count the hashes on a failed run.If your Intenret is lagging badly, all miners, not just mine, will have strange hashrate drops because its blocking on share submission.If you think there is actually a problem, compare vs a local running bitcoind.... if it STILL has large variations in hashrate, then there is an issue.In addition to that, less than -f 15 often causes the OS clock to get jerky up to the point that the 15 second average (the first number) becomes very unreliable. In these situations, use the forever average only (the second number)... it usually becomes reliable within a minute or two.Other miners suffer from this, but try various ways of covering it up; none are as accurate as using the forever average on mine over long periods. Try cd C:\Users\Marco\Desktop\trunks\btc\DiabloMiner before running it. Set the user and pw you put in bitcoin.conf, and use localhost and 8332 A 6850 as far as I can tell should do more than 225 each.See the op post for this thread on suggested settings to try. Also, just try all the options, every combination of -v 2, 3, 18, 19, 36 and -w 64, 128, 192, 256.Also, -f 60 on Windows slows it down due to Windows sucking dick. If you intend on benchmarking, use -f 15 or lower. You want -f. It should be a multiple or divisor of 60, and some people just turn it the whole way to 1000 and don't care how many mhash they lose. There are temp reader apps for OSX out there that can read GPU temps using the GPU's built in monitor.I don't maintain the OSX frontend, so I assume you can just turn automatic startup off and delete the .app. That looks normal if your GPU is overheating. HW check errors will happen on all hardware from time to time, but driving the temp up is sure to do it.Make sure your temp is below 85c. Update: I improved SDK 2.4 performance and fixed emails in --url (use \\@ or +++++ instead of @)Also, organofcorti, I just made your chart of doom outdated. 69xx should, theoretically, perform better with the new update I just pushed. So I played around with optimum settings at different clock rates on SDK 2.4-v  -w   mhash725/1000 1  64  243 2 128  278 3 192  26318 192  28519 192  287 <-- (~= 364 @ 918)36 192  244765/1000 1  192  243 2  128  291  3  192  27718  128  30219  192  304 <-- (~= 364 @ 918)36  192  258918/1000 1  128  293 2  128  351 3  192  32918   64  36119  128  364 <--36  192  308918/305 1  256  293 2  128  350 3  128  357 <--18  128  29319  128  29336   64  343This is vs SDK 2.1 doing 367 on 918/305 using -v 2 -w 256
What settings are you using with Phoenix, and what settings did you try with DiabloMiner? Because I've repeatedly proven Phoenix, even with phatk, is damned slow. Update: Fixed the Windows shits out lots of white space on device name bug, no more 2 line log entries on Windows Or just move to Rapidxen. I haven't tried, I don't know anyone who owns brand new Intel CPUs and isn't already mining on Radeons.This leads me to believe Intel did not follow the specification.What sort of error? No, if it was getting too hot, it'd give you the "check your hardware" error. DiabloMiner does not blindly pass solutions to the pool.Rejected shares are natural, they should just never exceed 0.75% give or take. Due to poor Nvidia hardware design, going over 75c is really not recommended, especially with XFX and Powercolor boards. DiabloMiner automatically uses LP when available. I'm not aware of any bugs that can cause your described behavior. Stalling cores could very well be a "normal" driver bug. It happens to some OpenCL users (isn't just my miner, but requires multiple GPUs), and I'm not sure why. Although almost every report I've heard I think involved using aticonfig to poll temps, so it might be related.I used to have code that detected the condition, but I can't stop the threads for that GPU and it can lead to needing to reboot the machine because everything locked up if I try to "solve" it. Except more than 256 isn't valid for most Nvidia hardware (although some supports 512), and it should be a multiple of 64 anyhow. Ahh, in that case. If you're trying to use SDK 2.4, you need at least Catalyst 11.1 (preferably whatevers newest, which is 11.5b I think) You're confused at how Bitcoin works. A Bitcoin client does not have to be running for someone to pay to an address. Bitcoin would be absolutely useless if it was any other way. If Intel's implementation follows the specification, it should already work fine. You need to make sure fglrx functions correctly, and that you've ran cd /; sudo tar zxvf /path/to/AMD-APP-SDK/icd-registration.tgz and that if you're running through ssh that you've made sure X is running as your user and you exported DISPLAY=:0.My other usual advice doesn't apply to you because the SDK itself seems to be working fine. Is that the worst you can threaten? That you'll leave? Its a 1.3ghash pool. Who cares if you leave.Most likely the TX to pay you did not make it into a block, the Bitcoin daemon behind the pool will automatically retry the TX sometime after 24 hours. Its a command line program, you need to run it from inside cmd.exe Because the watts used by CPU mining exceeds that of the value of BTC produced by CPU mining. Also, the fastest mining CPU that isn't enterprise hardware is that $1000 i7 six core.... it does 25 mhash max. A 5850 outside of OSX does 285 at stock speeds. They both use, at maximum, similar watts (130 watt part vs 150). Update: Found the bug with mtrlt's changes, we're back to that 0.50% improvement and both adds moved to java. If you're using -v 2, try -v 3. If you're using -v 3, try -v 2. Update: Partially revert previous change, it doesn't work entirely right with vectors. Still moves 1 add to Java, though. Seriously, we're doing a dick size thing? I'm doing 368 mhash @ 918/305 on 1.088v, and its below 75c. And I haven't even modded the bios yet.
You should get closer to 345 or more with DiabloMiner -v 2 -w 128 (or possibly -w 192 or -w 256 if you underclock memory, some need it, some don't). Thats the problem, a) it does not NEED -D at all, it was added by request for people who want to do split mining operations or leave GPUs unused, b) it starts at 1, not 0. Whats wrong is I'm going to add an error message for -D 0, and you can't stop me. If you're on a Mac and you're using the Mac UI frontend for DiabloMiner and RPCMiner, ask in the other thread. You have a misconception on how mining works. If you are solo mining, it may take 266 mhash up to 7 weeks to find a block. Use a pool if you think 7 weeks is too long.Each hash attempt is a full attempt, you're doing 266 million of these per second. There is nothing to resume from. Deepbit's average is very inaccurate, it is just averaging out the shares you've submitted and using that to calculate a rough average based on how many hashes, on average, it takes to find a share. Since finding hashes are a random event, the meter is pointless. The only meter that works is on the miner itself.And no, you're finding shares. Shares are diff 1 blocks, and the miner cant tell the difference.Also, using above -f 30 on Windows can lead to slower mining. If you intend on benchmarking, use -f 15 or -f 1. You really want -u username -p password -o deepbit.net -p 8332And no, you don't have to setup Bitcoin to solo mine if you don't plan on it. Only time it says that specific error message is either the hardware is overheating, its insane, the drivers are insane, or the planets are aligned.Make sure your GPU is under 85c. You only need to setup bitcoind if you intend on solo mining. If you're using a pool, just use DiabloMiner-Windows.exe -u user -p password -o host -p port like normal I don't use OSX, but if that happens during normal execution, that looks a lot like a OSX bug, which doesn't surprise me at all. My 5850 is doing 368 at 918/305, and its only 75c.Time to consider modding the bios.... And higher yet with DiabloMiner. Update: Adding changes from mtrlt, makes it 0.5% faster It is a CLI app. Run cmd.exe, cd to where you put the DiabloMiner directory, and then run DiabloMiner-Windows.exe with the appropriate arguments. CPU mining, typically, costs more in electricity than what the coins are worth. It also puts excess heat in the box which could be traded for either more GPUs or a faster one, and it also puts excess load on the PSU which may shorten the life.tl;dr: don't CPU mine. Diablominer is currently the fastest on Nvidia from what I've heard. Try -w 64, and try -f 240 or -f 360 to keep the desktop interactive (although it may slow hashing down). As a reminder, phatk is still slower than DiabloMiner. Try -v 2 -w 128 or -v 3 -w 128. No. The pool is already loaning you money in a way. Be happy it doesn't charge interest. Its... written in Java. Surely Apple provides a Universal binary JVM? He said he has a 6990 too. 2.4 only.
Dont use SDK 2.3, use 2.4. Problem solved. Not only does it not need to be mining, CPU mining on machines that are also GPU mining can slow GPU mining down. Its also a waste of time, money, and electricity. Just as a side note, mine probably was the first to support https.  Dunno, I don't use OSX. ITYM use Linux. So, I rebooted to Windows, something I haven't done since Bush was President...5850@765, 11.5a (using included 2.4 runtime)-v 2 -w 128: 280 mhash-v 3 -w 128: 294 mhashphoenix BFI_INT VECTORS WORKSIZE=128 AGGRESSION=13: 284 mhashphatk same args: 294 mhash-v 3 -w 128 -f 30: 302 mhash... *ahem*. Windows, you fucking bastard. And thats vs the 300 some I get with -v 2 -w 128 on 2.1 in Linux (aka the holy grail).Basically, as far as I can tell, my default of -f 60 is letting the Windows fail leak through.So, there, I beat phatk with all of my might. Have the source for that available? Check your GPU temp, it shouldn't exceed 75c on anything mobile or anything nvidia, or 85c on non-mobile radeons 11.5 may or may not have changes in the hardware shader compiler (the thing that takes the output from the GLSL and OpenCL compilers and produces hardware-specific instructions). I'm looking forward to bitching about how its not nearly as good as 10.9-10.11. Ahh, that. That usually indicates the hardware is overheating, damaged, or the driver sucks.The two numbers are 15 sec avg/forever avg. Sounds like pool failure. Always double check using a local bitcoin installation to rule this out. Most people just do -u minerusername -p minerpassword -o hostname -r port. mtred seems to have an IRC channel. Update: Clearn up some code to cut down on String stupidity Erm, if you're connecting to someone else's pool, you don't add anything to bitcoin.conf, and you don't even need bitcoin running. Yes. Shares are diff 1 blocks, the miner can't tell the difference. The default RPC port on Bitcoin is 8332 not 8337, and if you're connecting to a remote machine you need to add rpcallowip to the bitcoin.conf. I mean that this is Java and there is a limit to how ugly code should get before its deemed unmaintainable. Plus, clever use of StringBuilder will do the same thing anyhow. I wonder if phatk only works well on specific Catalyst releases. No matter what I try, phatk scores the same as phoenix -k poclbm (which both are always slower than real poclbm and mine).If I can't make phatk run as fast as its supposed to, I can't replicate it's techniques. I assume OSX is just naming your second card wrong. However, mining in OSX isn't worth it... on Radeon 5xxxs you lose about 40% of your speed. However, it shouldn't be nearly that bad.I also suspect this cannot be fixed, OSX's OpenCL implementation is braindead.
BTW, I am not going to accept a patch containing a custom concat setup. This is not C. You need to get in the habit of using Github to push merge requests.Also, the thread pool is very important because it can keep HTTP connections open between getwork/sendworks (cutting down on network round trip). Further, I spawn 3 threads per GPU to cut down on the actual hit of blocking due to HTTP, and then on top of that, LP cuts down on needing to keep fetching work every 5 seconds (with LP it only fetches as it returns asynchronously , or when nonce saturation occurs).As for blocking on garbage collection, switching to Java 7 altogether would do a lot to improve that. Well the big problem is on 2.4 phoenix-poclbm and phatk give near identical results... and both are still slower than real poclbm on both 2.1 and 2.4. And -v 18 and 19 give interesting results on 58xx on 2.4 which beats phatk's lackluster speed.So... ymm so fucking v. Update: Added all of Dustin's suggestions, and also added a timeout for non-LP connections. Mesa and Gallium are open source projects, you can always start developing for them. I have mine stable at 918 (as far as the slider goes) on stock voltage, but I also have it under 75c, so ymmv. I did a lot of examining of phatk. I can't tell where he thinks hes saving cycles. Not only that, it runs exactly the same on SDK 2.1 and SDK 2.4 on my 5850 vs phoenix's standard kernel. Plus, if he is in fact exploiting anything, it probably isn't exploiting it as much as -v 3 -w 128 on mine on 69xx. Well, its why OpenCL was invented in the first place. Using GLSL for even generic computing tasks that don't fit the OpenGL workflow is problematic and really not worth it.I don't want to shoot down anyone's hopes, but Mesa already is growing OpenCL support for Gallium. What more could we possibly ask for? At stock 850, 2 5870 should be in the neighborhood of 740 using -v 2 -w 128 on SDK 2.1.BFI_INT adds around 10%. ArtForz has a CAL miner that is slightly faster than the CL kernel poclbm and I based ours on. Its not particularly a huge win, especially when SDK 2.5 is getting rid of CAL support.Also, I have experimented with GLSL-based miners. The lack of real integer support kills the whole thing. If you wanna use full urls, use -l http://user:password@hostname:port/Also, you should also include the donation addresses for all the miners you support with your script. I'm aware of gcj, and I do not consider something that cannot run quite a few apps, and be a shitload slower at it an actually valid Java implementation. Oh, and last time I noticed, they didn't do JNI yet, so you can't run my miner with it. You run the exe the same way as the bat. The exe does not magically read your mind on what arguments you want to use.The bat is probably running the old jar, which means, no, you're not running a new version of DiabloMiner. No. They lack the hardware design to run programs like this, plus they would be amazingly slow. Not at all. Xorg nor FDO accept donations in BTC. This is pointless. R600 cannot run compute shaders of the kind we need, R700 (Radeon 4xxx) suck at it.Also, Mesa has a prototype OpenCL compiler for Gallium targets. Your "bounty" is technically already completed before you started.If you really want to help open source, go work on that project instead. Java does not work that way. Or he can just look in DiabloMiner-Linux.sh and copypasta accordingly. You need approximately 2^33 hashes to find a block. At 75 mhash, you would complete 50 shares in roughly 45 minutes. Its pretty bad. On Radeon 5xxx, you lose about 40% of your speed, on Radeon 4xxx and Nvidia, you lose about 25%.
If it says it can't connect to Bitcoin, then its not doing any work. Also, any numbers produced on the khash meter will be wrong.The two numbers are 15 second average/forever average.The ghash meter in debug counts the raw ghash meter, used for serious miners to measure useless statistics.-f 1000 will greatly reduce mhash speed, but increase desktop interactivity. -f should be a multiple or divisor of 60, lower values increase speed but decrease desktop interactivity, higher values do the opposite. -w 64 on nvidia really cuts down on the desktop interactivity abuse (and may even increase speed), however this is due to nvidia driver bugs.As for -z, I'm surprised -z helps anywhere. Nvidia driver design must be extremely bad. -z is usually slower on AMD. Remember, -f 1 tends to screw up short term time on Windows. Run for 5 minutes and use the second number only. Also, do not use SDK 2.4 for 5xxx cards, it is inefficient. You usually connect the profiler to an already running JVM, like jvisualvm or jconsole. Dustin's patches are worth adding, but they shouldn't add even 1 mhash to it... it does, however, lead to cleaner code. I'm going to merge them and then take them to the logical next step. What I was trying to say was, there is nothing in the preferences for it, and there should be. Editing a conf file sucks, especially for Windows and OSX users.As for your 6750M, thats a Turks, which means its a VLIW4 type arch. This includes 64xx, 65xx, 66xx, 69xx, 64xxM, 66xxM, and 67xxM. A lot of VLIW4 users find -v 3 to be fastest. You're asking for the wrong thing. Bitcoin GUI should have this stuff in the preferences somewhere.You were okay right up to the point you saved it as a .rtf. As far as I know OSX does not include a UI app that can save .txt files short of opening the terminal and using nano or vim.No, if you're connecting the client to a pool, you don't even have to have bitcoin running on that machine. Forgot to cd /; sudo tar zxvf /path/to/AMD-APP-SDK-2.4/icd-registration.tgz? Nope, that too maxes out at 256. What I said was 768 simply is not valid for 5xxx hardware.Phoenix should output the error OpenCL is returning instead of covering it up.  5xxx maxes out at a worksize of 256. SDK 2.4 does't have that bug, but its quite possible Catalyst after around 11.3 still does. Someone on IRC had to go the whole way back to 10.11 + SDK 2.1 to make it stop. Don't use SDK 2.2 or 2.3, thats a known bug with them. Interesting, -v 19 seems to be faster than -v 2 on SDK 2.4. -v 2 gets me about 286, -v 19 gets me about 296 (== 280 @ 725).So, yes, jedi95, -v can make up the difference if used right.  Except comparing my kernel/poclbm (nearly identical), and phatk, all I can't see much of a difference. Also, -v DOES make a speed difference. Phoenix can't do the vector mutating I do. 69xx seems to run a fair bit faster with -v 3 over -v 2 (which is identical to what Phoenix and poclbm do). I haven't found the optimum settings for 2.4 yet. Try playing with the settings and see if you can get higher numbers. Every machine is different. Update: BFI_INT support.I now have the fastest miner known to man.On my Radeon 5850 @ 765 /w SDK 2.1Phoenix DEVICE=1 VECTORS WORKSIZE=128 BFI_INT AGGRESSION=5, 7, 11, 13, with or without FASTLOOP = 273poclbm -v -w 128 -f 60 = 292DiabloMiner -v 2 -w 128 -f 60 = 302 If you're on a pool, those are shares (aka equivalent to difficulty 1 blocks). If you're on OSX, you lose a significant amount of your GPU power. A 5670 normally would get at least 70, but OSX's OpenCL implementation is so bad, who knows.To quit the miner, just press control-c. Dont try typing the Java command out by hand, use DiabloMiner-OSX.shYou have to cd into the dir first, and then run ./DiabloMiner-OSX.sh Update:  Added multiple vector widths, -v now requires a number-v 2 is the old -v, and seems to be fastest on SDK 2.4, while -v 4 seems to be faster on SDK 2.1. I now get around 275.I probably should go implement BFI_INT soon. Update: Updated nonce saturation to do 2^32 total, added forgotten l4j.ini file, improved nonce handling for -v and/or -z
It seems LP has been shut off on Deepbit. Why? Superior Windows drivers, superior Linux drivers, 5-6x faster per watt on Bitcoin, same game or better game performance per dollar (69xx really screws over Geforce 5xx on games, especially in Crossfire vs SLI or games that use a lot of tess), plus AMD is the primary financial backer of a completely open source modern GPU driver stack and Nvidia is only unofficially threatening to sue over the same thing?Nvidia is the one that needs to get their act together. I suspect GUIMiner is out of date then. poclbm (until I add bfi_int to my miner) is the current winner, phoenix (and the projected phatk numbers, I didnt bother testing it) doesnt even come close. That only leads to working on stale shares and no way to know. LP was invented for a reason. I guess Phoenix isn't all its cracked up to be I just did some comparison to Phoenix and poclbm on my brand new 5850 @ 765 on SDK 2.1Phoenix DEVICE=1 VECTORS WORKSIZE=128 AGRESSION=7 FASTLOOP BFI_INT = 273Any combination of fastloop and agression does not pull head. 5, 7, 11, 13 with or without fastloop score around 273.Phoenix without BFI_INT = 250poclbm -v -w 128 -f 60 = 295DiabloMiner, which does not do BFI_INT yet, -v -w 128 -f 60 = 273.Assuming 250->273 shows off a representative 9.2% increase, soon as I implement BFI_INT, I should, again, have the fastest miner ever. [02:41:59] <gribble> The expected generation output, at 1200000 Khps, given current difficulty of 157426.20628986 , is 7.66704658104 BTC per day and 0.31946027421 BTC per hour.Closer to $40 per day maybe. Update: Added -v for vectors, reworked -f code (should allow -f 1000 on nvidia to work better), and disabled -z 10 by default on Radeon 5/6xxx Except all LP stuff is async in my miner. I've repeatedly tested my miner on Deepbit, and have seen nothing of the sort. Are you sure your copy of my miner is up to date? Nope, dbitcoin just refuses to follow the LP spec and is putting a full URL in where a URL fragment belongs. No no, I just think its awesome my superior miner is promoting code quality everywhere  Small problem. AFIACT re: HTTP RFC, you cannot send a message body with a GET, only with a POST. So, uh, why wouldn't I be using POST? This poll is useless, there is no option for "decimal satoshis only for all API work". It only does that on SDK 2.2, SDK 2.3, SOME Windows SDK 2.4 users (but not all), and any Nvidia user.Its a driver bug. Well, there is always Deepbit. Are you saying you're UA snooping to enable and disable LP support? Don't do that. Either that, or my pool software magically gets done tommorow. Either way, 5 is already the default, and when LP turns on it completely ignores it. -g is simply not needed. *cough* You forgot to remove -g 5 from both lines.  Hey dbitcoinChange the Windows instructions for my miner to DiabloMiner-Windows.exe -u your-login@miner-name -p miner-password -o btcmine.com -r 8332 and remove -g 5 from the Linux command line (not only is 5 the default, my miner supports LP).
Update: New Launch4J windows binary, just run DiabloMiner-Windows.exe instead of Java manually or using DiabloMiner-Windows.bat.Changed -w back to device maximum. I agree with the previous post. I might end up getting one soon, so I think I'll just wait for that. I'd be a lot easier if I just scrape up the money for a 5xxx myself. DiabloMiner development sometimes involves rebooting the machine. Repeatedly. Amongst swearing. 5850 cost has dropped enough that I can almost afford one. Disq got it right.  If you're trying to run it from git, install Maven run mvn package first. I wouldn't mind adding BFI_INT support, but I own a Radeon 4xxx. I have no way of testing it. DiabloMiner now supports long polling (after much requesting). Update: I've beefed up the error reporting, and I've also added long poll. Most people only use rpcuser, rpcpassword, and rpcallowip. Maybe one of the other arguments are screwing it up? Also, make sure you have the right IP. Try changing to 192.168.1.* temporarily and see if that fixes it (if it does, your IP is wrong or not static). Sounds like you didn't enable RPC correctly on your bitcoind. Yes, my miner refers to whatever it connects to as Bitcoin. Your -r should be 8334. My miner does not read any conf files, thats for Bitcoin itself only; which if you're connected to a pool, it doesn't matter. I hope you made a typo in your post, -p is for passwords, not -l. You need -u, -p, -o, -r (username, password, host, and port, respectively) OR give -l http://username:password@host:port/. Don't mix and match.Any user of the JSON RPC API that Bitcoin has either needs to run bitcoin.exe -server or bitcoind.exe (which automatically does -server). -daemon only makes it run in the background automatically, it doesn't enable -server implicitly.A local running Bitcoin is not required for connecting to a pool.To check if Bitcoin is accepting RPC commands run bitcoin.exe getinfo, it should return a blob of JSON with things like your balance and Bitcoin's version. Make sure you have at least 11.1, and it was installed right, and you built the kernel module and its being loaded before X starts. Your 2D and 3D acceleration is dead, and OpenCL isn't going to work either. And since you'd be on 11.1 or later, make sure you're using SDK 2.4 Why not just use DiabloMiner then? DiabloMiner already uses all GPUs available by default. Something is very wrong with your fglrx installation. Which video card do you own? Please post the entire error, then. You're supposed to start DiabloMiner in a terminal. It is not a GUI app. I only recently added it. Make sure you have the absolute newest binary. Try using somewhere between -z 0 and -z 20, you might get speed increases, you might not. I don't think OSX's impl has bitalign, so you're losing a lot of performance and there might be no way to fix it. Apple wrote their own OpenCL implementation for OSX instead of using far more optimized ones supplied by AMD or Nvidia. Using OSX means you lose about 20% of your speed right off the bat. Try toying with -z 0 in combination with -w 128.There is pretty much no way to fix this, Apple loves screwing customers. Update: I've added -z, so you can now change the size of the in kernel loop. The number is the exponent of power of two, 0 turns it off. Default is -z 10 (1024) on Radeon 5xxx/6xxx, -z 0 on everything else.
Update: I've added mtrlt's bat script for Windows. No longer do you have to run the whole Java command by hand. I don't see value in the long polling protocol. Its much easier to just use a dedicated Websockets protocol. I plan on introducing this in the future. Basically, the GPU babysitting threads go to sleep between OpenCL executions. The OS's kernel can only change threads so fast. Thus, having OpenCL executions that are shorter than the length of one timeslice means the GPU is waiting for the babysitting threads to catch up. However, as I said, the minimum kernel length is tuned to your hardware, it doesn't seem you can ever reach the timeslice length.As for -f 1 looking slower, its because at extremely long execution lengths, it tends to screw over the OS's clock in as that it jumps large periods to catch up to the real world. This is why, when using -f 1, you use the second number my miner outputs and run it for 10 minutes before you trust the number.Linux doesn't suffer this nearly as much as Windows does. It generally maxes out at your OS's kernel's scheduler's timeslice length. Generally, this is 100hz or 1000hz. Higher than -f 1000 makes no sense. Not only that, my miner has an automatic lower limit as to not send too little work to the GPU. The actual -f maximum may be much lower. That shouldn't happen. However, leaving Crossfire on could explain your lost speed. On Windows, due to stupidity on Microsoft's part, you usually need a dummy plug to make cards that don't have monitors plugged in to them turn on (this doesnt apply to Linux, nor Crossfired cards). -f controls the length of a kernel (1/n seconds, where -f 1 is a full second), and you'll only see changes at large multiples or divisors of 60 (ie, 1, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, etc).-f 1 tends to largely skew the realtime clock used by the OS. So, to test with -f 1, you need to run for about 10 minutes and only rely on the second number (pocblm does not provide a second number, so you can't accurately watch it).That said, the numbers tell me you should get about 1.2 ghash total instead of 1 (or about 17% slower). I suspect a driver bug. Make absolutely sure you've turned off Crossfire and that my miner lists 4 devices. I don't understand your question. You download the OSX binaries from the Bitcoin website, unzip them, open up Terminal, cd to the directory, and then ./bitcoin -server & exit Please note: I screwed up testing on SDK 2.4. It does fix the CPU use bug 2.2/2.3 introduced, but I get about 71 mhash/sec on my 4850 out of 76. This puts it at the same speed as 2.3, but without the CPU use.So, I am still recommending 10.9 through 10.11 + SDK 2.1 for 4xxx/5xxx mining, but I'm recommending 11.3 + SDK 2.4 for 6xxx. You can use bitcoin -server instead of bitcoind. I'm not sure if the OSX binaries build bitcoind. You shouldn't use -w 128 unless for some strange reason it is, indeed, faster than you. -w 64 is whats recommended by AMD themselves.Also, you only use mvn to build from source. If you download the binary zip, you don't (and can't) use this. Update: I removed the new constant buffer creation code in exchange for a much simpler double buffering method. This seems to a faster solution than either using single buffers or creating new ones all the time. Also, I added another error check. bitcoind is just bitcoin without the GUI, and it automatically does -server. It doesn't really matter which you run, there are miners equally in both camps. Weird. I believe you should be getting around 1200 mhash/sec with that setup. Update: Made a small modification that may increase speed for some users. Those suffering from the abnormally low khash bug may be fixed by this. Are you absolutely sure you're using SDK 2.4? Holy crap! SDK 2.4 on Catalyst 11.3 not only cures the CPU use bug in 2.2/2.3, but also is faster than 2.1.On my Radeon 48502.1 = Upper 75 mhash2.2 = Around 652.3 = Around 702.4 = Lower 76SDK 2.4 requires at least 11.1, so don't try it on earlier. Surprisingly, Intel has FINALLY joined the world the rest of us have been in for the past 2+ years. GMAHD 2000/3000 GPUS (those in the newest i5s/i7s) can run OpenCL... but the fastest ones only go about 5-10 mhash/sec, so it is is still a waste of time. Go figure. As a suggestion, don't use Catalyst 11.x or 10.12 for mining. It usually leads to abnormally low speeds for no reason. Also, you need to turn crossfire off, and just disconnecting the bridge doesn't turn it off, you need to run aticonfig --initial -f --adapter=all as root and then restart X. Leaving crossfire on can lead to incorrect results (which my miner is supposed to catch and spit out errors for). Also, you should be getting better speed with -w 64 (as this is what is recommended by AMD).You can't mine with a Geforce 7xxx, only 8xxx and up. Sounds like the cards overheated, the driver tried a GPU restart, and failed.... which GPU restarts on Linux ALWAYS fail, and theres no way to shut it off. Just leave your GPU fans at full speed. Update: Merged jwadamson's patch that gets rid of the OSX dock icon
Try -w 256, or very low values of -f like -f 1. The bug doesn't make any sense, and is clearly in the drivers, and as I've said in other posts in this thread, it also has effected some poclbm users. fps means "frames per second", its how many times the OpenCL kernel runs per second. Lower values means the kernel runs for longer, reduces overhead, but decreases desktop interactivity. Higher values means the kernel runs for less time, increases overhead, but increases desktop interactivity.Tune it until it feels right for you. The default is 60, a lot of people just say fuck it and run at 1000 Did you try starting the miner with -h?And the sweet spot is user specific. The default for -f is 60, try moving it up and down by multiple/divisors of 60 (1, 15, 30, 60, 120, etc) until you get what you want. You shouldn't be getting less. Are you sure you're doing your math right? Run with -f 1 connecting to a local, and let it run for 5-10 minutes and check the second number.If you're on Radeon hardware, you require a real X session running. You don't have to use VNC or use X for anything at all, just start your miner with DISPLAY=:0 ./DiabloMiner over ssh as the user that started X. Cerebrum, I think you've overlooked -d. It tells you lots of information, including when it submits a hash, and if the hash is accepted or not.Also, my miner double checks all solutions before submitting... if there is a hw error, it bitches very loudly without -d.And I don't believe poclbm's hash meter is correct. Mine lists two numbers, 15 second average, forever average. poclbm does not have a meter that is comparable to either. My miner is also faster because poclbm does not try to keep work queued for the hardware.In addition, since I queue multiple kernels in parallel, network activity for remote pools costs much less than it does on poclbm. -f effects it because my global run size code is more finely tuned than his. If larger -fs work, that indicates either a driver bug or a bug in the OS's scheduler.I don't intend on adding all those numbers to -d because they have no use. You have zero control over those, and they are not informative. Its a known problem with fglrx. It effects mostly Windows users, but some Linux users too.It showed up in 11.1, and 11.2 doesn't fix it, and it only effects some users, and no one can figure out the exact conditions to replicate it. Even using SDK 2.1 (for 5xxx users) with 11.1/11.2 doesn't fix it (and for some, it triggers it while switching to 2.3 fixes it).The bug also effects some polcbm users too, so its not specific to my miner.  Thats a 6850, and 6xxx requires SDK 2.3 and a new enough version of fglrx. 10.7 seems to be broken so far. Its assuming I want -Werror (if I wanted it, I would have passed it to the OpenCL compiler); two, this kernel works fine on Nvidia hardware with -w 256... however, the default is -w 64, so this should not effect anyone.And a loss of 25% sounds horrible when 10.6 already loses 25%. Update: Output Content-Type of application/json, handle errors in JSON-RPC response Update: *cough* -u/-p works again. Debian. But then again, Debian doesn't ship known-to-be-broken pre-release versions of fglrx inside of shipping distro releases. Update: Merged cdecker's patch for device selection. -D/--device takes a comma separated list You know, 90% of people having bizzaro problems are on Ubuntu. I wonder if Ubuntu is just broken beyond repair. It can work on pools, sure. A lot of people use mine with slush's. But, by default, it just connects to the local bitcoind.My miner can't CPU mine, but bitcoind can. If it has it off, then you're not doing it.Make sure you're on Catalyst 10.9 through 10.11, and are using SDK 2.1, and you haven't set -w to a strange value (such as anything above, below, or otherwise not equal to 64). I think you meant to ask this in one of the mining pool threads  Update: Support --url so you can do http://user:pass@ip:port/ Make sure you have CPU mining off. The 330m should be about as twice as fast as the 320m. Your 320m is getting around the same speed (minus the OSX sucks penalty), and the 9400 also seems to be the right speed. Make sure the laptop with the 330m is not using lots of CPU time (such as accidentally leaving CPU mining on).That said, none of these are really worth mining with. There are CPUs that mine faster than that.The two numbers are 15 second average, forever average.CU means compute unit, it has no relation to cores. Yes, all of them are used. The miner returns "Attempt found" when debug is on every time the OpenCL kernel finds a potential block where the first 32 bits are 0. This is also the same as finding a potential share in a mining pool. I am surprised, however, my miner is not complaining about hardware errors because you have Crossfire on.What hash rate are you getting? It should be over 530 on a 5970.Also, as for Ubuntu, this is why I recommend people do not use Ubuntu. Ubuntu is not Linux, it supports outside anti-Linux interests, and they do nothing to further the Linux community. Try out other distros before you say no to Linux; unlike Windows, we have choices.
On 69xx you can still use 10.11, but you need SDK 2.3 which does still seem to be stable, but it runs around 15% slower over 2.1 for mining.11.1 and 11.2 seems to suck for everybody. Its strange. 10.9 through 10.11 + sdk 2.1 remains the most reliable option for most Read the op post again. 11.1 does not run some or all OpenCL apps correctly. If it starts with 0/0, restart it until it doesn't do that. Something in the driver hoarked, and I can't fix that.As for attempts... thats not a bug. Those are supposed to happen. This is why they only show up during debug, that is normal operation. It means it found a block that the first 32 bits are 0 (aka a difficulty of 1)However, yours are all on GPU #2. This means you didn't turn off Crossfire. Since you're on Windows, owning more than one GPU for mining isn't really worth it since disabling Crossfire also disables all GPUs after the first one. I suggest you mine on Linux instead. As I've said in the DiabloMiner thread repeatedly, with 5xxx, use 10.10 or 10.11 with 2.1. All other combinations are inferior. As far as I can tell, 11.2 retains whatever 11.1 caused.11.1 on Linux included a change in the Linux kernel module API (which hasn't been done for awhile), so I suspect they really updated shit. 3xxx Radeons can't run OpenCL. You need 4xxx and up. Some of your numbers are bogus. A stock 5970 (which is less than two stock 5870 because of factory underclocking) will around 550 mhash/sec; at full 5870 clocks its closer to around 630.The current network computational power is around 261 ghash/sec.261 / 0.550 = 475 stock 5970s or 414 fully clocked ones.There is probably about 50-100 actual 5970s mining, the bulk of the rest is other Radeons, very few Nvidia users, and a bunch of CPU miner (which, although probably thousands of CPUs mining, basically add very little to the overall effort). $COMPUTE is the env variable, like $DISPLAY, that says which cards should be used for computing. SDK 2.3 officially recognizes it, but still uses $DISPLAY when its not set. I assume, eventually, all OpenCL impls on Linux will use $COMPUTE only (or use a much better system that isn't a pile of shit).I'll look at your branch in a bit. Update: Automatically strip .[0-9] from $DISPLAY and set $COMPUTE, also make work group size of 64 the default instead of the hardware default Its the /btc/btc-jrproxy.cgi part of the URL thats wrong. Why use a proxy script when you can just forward the port to what you're trying to proxy? I'll eventually add a --url argument, but I'm not adding it for abuses like that. Except that URL of yours is bad form with using RPC impls like json rpc and xml rpc. Why not just forward the port instead? There is a --port argument after all. Because you didn't turn Crossfire off. Removing the cable doesn't turn it off (and you don't need it for Crossfire anyways, it works fine without it) You have to run aticonfig --initial --adapter=all to write a working xorg.conf. Humble gave you bad advice. Also, for the record, 5970s contain an internal Crossfire bridge.Also, if your DISPLAY is not set to :0, set it to that otherwise my miner won't see all your GPUs. Why is that? Working fine for me.[/quote]Because AMD is retarded and keeps shipping these things. Use your distro packaging, they know what they are doing. You downloaded it from git and forgot to build it. Run mvn package. Update: Merged proxy patch Wait, since I implemented this in my miner, wouldn't this make me the troll? 2.1 runs fastest and doesnt have the CPU use bug. You only need 2.3 on 6xxx hardware. Yes, you need it on Linux too. 10.11 runs best on Linux and Windows.Any instructions that require using AMD's packaged version of the drivers are wrong and should never be followed. Please only use distro packaged drivers for fglrx. Update: I updated to LWJGL 2.7.1 yesterday, but some people were experiencing problems, so I rolled it back to 2.6 Nope, no flaw. But my miner drives hardware and drivers harder than m0's, so its probably tripping a bug in the driver somewhere. You're not the first person to see that happen, but it should be rare. Going the whole way back to 10.11 has solved it for the people who saw this.
Somethings very wrong with your box. If you figure out what, tell me. pmw, tryptamine, make sure both of you aren't using Catalyst 11.1. It doesn't work right. Also make sure you're using SDK 2.1. Also, for some users you absolutely need to use -w 64, the hw default (256 on ATI) doesn't like Art's kernel. Yup, unless you're on a pool, then thats a pool share. Nvidia handles -w weird. Some cards have a minimum of 32, some have 64, and there is no way to query this and there doesn't seem to be a list out there. If -w 32 is extremely slow, don't use it.And yes, -v has been removed. It doesn't increase speed on properly functioning OpenCL compilers. The only way to get that issue is if you don't have X running. Just setting DISPLAY isn't enough and using headless makes it worse. This is an unfortunate bug in Java triggered by how LWJGL works; it shouldn't happen.On ATI you need X running anyhow, on Nvidia you can run a dummy X (such as xvfb). The first meter measures whats going on now, the second meter measures the performance since the start of the miner. If you intend on benchmarking, do -f 1 and read the second meter after 15 minutes. Looping doesn't cause the 3% performance boost if thats what you're asking. I see it on my 4xxx, and looping isn't enabled on 4xxx. Looping is probably another, eh, half a percent or so. Update: Fix bug on Radeon 5xxx looping I've updated my miner to reduce share loss in pool situations. Update to newest. Update: Use multiple buckets on output to reduce lost pool sharesRoughly 3.5% of shares are lost (due to bucket cramming) on a 5870 on -f 1... its far less for slower cards or high -f values. It is now 256 times less. I can live with 0.02% lost. Except thats not what he said at all. m0's kernel ALSO runs best at -w 64 and low -f settings. -f controls kernel execution length; ANY kernel will run better with lower -f settings because there is far less time wasted on kernel setup overhead.10.12 may or may not cause issues for some people. Downgrading to 10.11 should fix them for the few people that have them. Its just a kernel switch. The kernel does not have control over what you describe, so what you describe is impossible.... if Art's miner performs badly, it will perform badly no matter the -f setting. Art's kernel DOES drive the hardware (3%) harder, so it MAY require a larger -f number to keep the same desktop interactivity, but thats about it.Also, if you are using 11.1, don't. Also, -f 30 sounds rather low for keeping your desktop interactive. Update: Changed to 15 sec avg/forever double meter, further decreased run size floor, allow very maximum nonce before saturation flush The miner, even with -f 1, tries to adjust to system activity. I use -f 1000 on my 4850 now, and it swings wildly in all sorts of directions when I'm using my computer.... this is by design. Most people want to mine while having a useful desktop. -f 1 curbs this behavior as much as possible, but obviously does not eliminate it. Connections to the miner when they lag (such as connection failures) confuses the miner. If thats a long count hash, thats completely inaccurate... it could have flatlined completely to 0. As I said to cdecker, if you're benchmarking use -f 1 Hmm, are you connecting locally or to slush's pool? Use below -f 5, my miner counts hash performance from start, instead of using a 30 second average. If you're seriously benchmarking it, use -f 1 and let it run for like 15 minutes. Run the miner with --help. The only tuning switches are -w and -f, -w changes worksize (on ATI it has to be a multiple of 64, 64 seems to be the fastest, 256 is the default; on NVidia it has to be a multiple of 32, and all values seem to work exactly alike), -f changes how long the kernel runs (FPS, the lower the value the longer it runs, -f 1 has the least overhead but also destroys desktop interactivity). Thats the problem though. There should be no reason -w 256 (the default on ATI hardware) should be THAT slower. It is slower for OpenCL kernels like the one I use in the miner, but it should be still >100.
Apparently 11.1 is a boned release. At least one person has come into #bitcoin-dev stating OpenCL performance is shittastic. Stick with 10.11 and 10.12. Cdecker, it might just be you. I'm using 10.12 + 2.1, and its working fine here, and its also working for a few other 5xxx users in #bitcoin-dev. If your -f is set too low, you might be cutting your card off at the knees. Update: I've added a mode to make a long count hash meter enable when using below -f 5, so no more 30 second average when using low -f values. Also, the run length of the kernel changes much more smoother and has a much lower minimum, so people that use higher -f values should get more responsive desktops; but people with low -f values may take longer to get up to optimum kernel length. Update: Now using ArtForz's new kernel, about a 3% increase in speed. My 4850 does about 76.6 now.Also, I fixed the slight bug where the hash meter would say absurdly high values because I accidentally queued kernels with a run length of 0. The native hardware worksize (AMD calls these wavefronts) on Radeon 5xxx is 64. Anything less than 64, or anything that isn't a multiple of 64, will run very badly (as half the pipes aren't running anything half or all the time). AMD recommends power of two (subtly implying 192 isn't worth it either).The OpenCL spec also recommends a power of two and it also implies that implementations should rotate around multiples of 64.I'm not sure what a correct value is. Some Nvidia hardware has a minimum worksize of 32 (due to it's CUDA legacy where 32 was acceptable), some seem to have one of 64. Nvidia hardware isn't nearly as parallel as AMD hardware (its 16 wide SIMD in 16 independent pipes and requires 2 batches to pipeline effectively; Radeon 5xxx is 64 wide SIMD in 4+1 units of 4 plus ALU instruction batching), so -w may not have as much power as it does on AMD hardware.So, try a bunch of values and see what they do. Worst case is 64 runs just as well as 256 or 512 does.Also, as I said earlier in this thread, higher -f values increase desktop interactivity but effectively slow hashing. -f 1 maxes out performance but makes your desktop useless. Nvidia drivers are badly designed enough that you could lose 20 mhash by not running at low -f values. See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_Hardware_Comparison 64 being the most optimal may change. And some people with smaller chips report 128 being faster. Theres no easy way to handle this.Also, 53/54xx Radeons may suffer from a driver bug. Many people report white stripes while running OpenCL apps, not just mine.Also, if it periodically hangs, your card might be too hot. Make sure it remains under 85c. Im having trouble reading that graph.... you're only using power of 2 values for -w right? 64 seems to be the fastest, 256 (== hardware max) is the default. This applies to 4xxx and 5xxx Radeons. Not sure what Nvidia does, though.And yes, higher -f values slows it slightly due to kernel setup overhead. Doing -f 1 screws your desktop performance, but it gets about 5-15% faster over -f 1000 (maximum interactivity).Also, timing is screwed on -f 1, it will often skew the timer badly for tasks that measure sub-second times (such as the miner itself, or performance benchmarks).Oh, and btw, maximum performance for a 5850 exceeds 240 mhash/sec. Oh, and as another thing, don't bother benchmarking on 2.3. Use 2.1, its a fair bit faster for miners. For those wondering, miz is not using SDK 2.1, and 2.3 may or may not require Catalyst 10.12, and he has 10.11 installed. My miner doesn't support this, and I don't think the Nvidia drivers do either. Try screwing with DISPLAY=:0.0 or :0.1 Either your CPU is very slow, you're not using SDK 2.1, or your kernel is insane and you need to turn cpufreq off (sudo cpufreq-set -g performance -c 0, repeat and increment -c for each cpu core). Update: Updated network code, blame slush Yes, you must run bitcoind, or bitcoin -server, or connect to a pool. This goes for any miner,Try using the miner with -f 180 (for ATI) or -f 1000 (for Nvidia), this usually vastly improves UI response. However, Nvidia drivers tend to be broken and even -f 1000 doesn't fix it for some people. You may also have to stop the miner altogether to play 3D games. BTW Gavin, the bot is already in #bitcoin-dev because of me. Feel free to add your shit to it.What, no ones seen my commits for DiabloMiner? :< Heads up everyone: Catalyst 10.12 may be retarded. Yup, thats the infamous LWJGL Needs X, No Matter What bug. Does it still blow up when Aero is off? It could very well just be Windows sucking, which can't be fixed. Microsoft, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, and Jesus Himself could all come together to fix it and they will surrender in disgust. -w does not control lag in that way. It also needs to be a power of 2, and depending on your card, the maximum -w is either 256 or 512. Tuning it to optimum speed is all you can do with it, it won't stop lag.I suspect nvidia drivers are terminally braindead. Make sure you're using the newest version. Also, 72 mhash > 66.  For those using my miner, please update. The whole single getwork instance work was a bust. slush is just going to have to deal with the increased traffic. It should only use 100% CPU for like 15-30 seconds, and then cut down to almost none.Hybrid is generally broken on NVidia hardware; OSX has it worse than Windows. It seems in Windows it either only recognizes the first GPU or the current one (and won't switch while running either way). I don't suggest mining on hybrid machines until the manufacturers figure it out.Also, NVidia users tend to have issues with OpenCL apps in general due to poor design in the driver. Try using -f 1000, this seems to fix the overall desktop interactivity problem, but loses performance.
Update: Reverted global getwork instance work, it was causing more problems thanit was fixing. Increased khash meter accuracy. Removed stuck executorthread code, this didn't work right and the thread eventually unsticksitself on applicable platforms anyhow. For those wondering, I replied to the bug. OSX hybrid graphics are screwing up OpenCL apps. I suggest everyone who uses my miner to upgrade to the newest version, it should fix the final issue with the pool rejecting shares. Update: Forced all accesses to a getwork instance to be synchronous, should fix final network thread problems Throwing up a dummy xvfb will indeed fix this. ATI users don't have this problem because X has to be running to use OpenCL The ELFCLASS32 bug is, unfortunately, inside the AWT code inside Java. lwjgl rams into it because it initializes AWT even if I do not open a window. They are aware of the bug; Oracle has no plans on fixing it on their end (ANY app that tries to init AWT on a system without X running will do this). Your fix isn't. Oh well.  No, but Linux runs faster. Update: Made the getwork clone from network thread method more paranoid, should help with low difficulty targets like pools and the testnet. You didn't have to rename the libs. Setting DISPLAY alone fixes this (as long as you have an X server running). For those using my miner, I've made enhancements that should increase performance with pools.It now uses a dedicated thread to manage getwork so it won't block kernel execution threads. I've also added an argument (-g/--getwork) to set the number of seconds between automatic getwork refreshes (pool users may want to increase this if they get a lot of network failures).The first change should positively effect miner performance for people on high latency connections. Update: Added dedicated getwork thread, now only gets new work once per 5 seconds instead of 3 times per gpu per 5 seconds. This should improve performance on miner pools due to remote connection latency, and it should also improve performance on setups that have many miners connecting to a single LAN bitcoind.Another update: Added -g/--getwork to change the number of seconds between getwork refresh, should help high pool latency issues, default remains 5.Another another update: the sh scripts now set an environment variable that fixes SDK 2.2 and 2.3 CPU time usage. I still recommend 2.1, but at least it doesn't go apeshit anymore. Thats a 5750, actually. 5750s do about 116 mhash/sec and are Junipers. That usually indicates a fault in the OS somewhere. Since no one gives a shit about OpenCL on OSX (not even Apple), I'm not sure what to tell you. Any other OSX users want to chime in? Except you misunderstood what I said about 2. I _already_ fully check the hash, from scratch, using the full 80 bytes of header just to make sure its correct. However, _you must also check this_ as you cannot accept user input as valid. It would take me three seconds to screw over the entire pool once it gets going.Also, re: 1. See how m0's kernel does it? He has a kernel arg named target, and the kernel does G <= target. This is exactly the same thing as doing H <= target, I would code it exactly this way. GPU hardware can check if something == 0 much faster than <=.The only reason I would add this code is if, eventually, testnet difficulty dramatically drops again and this would need to be ready before hand. Try installing the version of Catalyst that includes the the stream runtime already (downloading offers two choices, 10.12 is supposed to eliminate this and always include the runtime). H == 0 is checked for every nonce... m0's does H == 0 and G <= target in the kernel for every nonce, and pays a slight speed penalty for it. So, if I check H <= target, I will pay a similar speed penalty.Edit: Also, you have to check the full hash on your side anyhow when you submit it to your bitcoind via getwork. It will reject it if its wrong (returns false). testnet, for the time being, has been > 32 bits. Checking if H <= target (instead of H == 0 and then G <= in the host code) would slow it down.  I could add it, but it'd cause complexity that might slow it down for normal users if I do it wrong.Its faster than m0's, which is your only other option. Update: Made logging output more consistent  Update: Removed -a, it autodetects it now
lwjgl doesn't handle being headless correctly yet. So, trying to force awt headless, or running with DISPLAY unset, will cause either the error you have or the ELFCLASS32 error. lwjgl is linked against java 1.5, and my app is built against 1.6, so its not an issue of what version stuff was built with, it works with many versions of sun and openjdk.As for the Geforce bug, see the post above yours, I think I have it finally fixed, just use the beta drivers. Hey nvidia users... I just had an nvidia user on IRC confirm my miner DOES work... but you have to use the beta drivers.So, sweet, I fixed it. Go upgrade your drivers. According to that python error, no you don't have pyopencl installed. Go figure.Also, you need at least a Radeon 4xxx to use OpenCL, 3xxx isnt enough. Well, at least it failed farther into the kernel build process. This is good news. Update: I've fixed the nasty Nvidia bug. This should now work correctly on Nvidia and OSX. Everyone go try it and report back. At the moment, my miner doesn't work on Geforce until Nvidia fixes their bugs... however, in your case, its because you're using a headless version of the JDK. Install a non-headless version of the JDK.If you can figure out a good workaround for the Geforce bug (see above posts for description), feel free to send me a patch. It isn't, and you didn't download the Stream SDK, or you're not using it correctly. Its the same as the Nvidia bug (and its only by coincidence that your friend has Nvidia hardware; OSX has its own OpenCL impl). Both Nvidia and OSX do not implement that correctly. Its annoying as hell. Update: The -52 errors only happens on SDK 2.2, and now the miner ignores them since they only happen periodically. It does not happen with 2.1 and has no effect on the mining process, and I suggest you use 2.1 anyhow since it runs much faster. Hrm, good question. I saw it mentioned in one of my news feeds, but I can't find it now. The Open in OpenGL doesn't imply any sort of implementation of all. There already has been an open OpenGL impl for years, its called Mesa. Khronos (formerly known as the OpenGL Steering Committee) doesn't maintain an implementation of anything.As for Nvidia giving you that card.... they lied again. No Nvidia card is good at GPGPU for any task outside of heavily float-oriented tasks similar to the graphics rendering the card normally would be doing.Trust me, its really worth shelling out the cash for a Radeon 5xxx. Hey man, an open cross platform royalty free API is very important. Imagine gaming if all we had was D3D.... PC gaming would be dead. OpenGL is the only thing keeping it alive IMO.As for owner binaries, I don't keep those around; you can use git to pull older revisions in, but I don't recommend it because they may end up being subtly broken because I've fixed bugs since then.Until I fix Nvidia (if there is any fix at all), just buy a new video card. Geforces mine very slowly, about 3x slower per watt, and maybe 4x slower per dollar depending on the card. Go buy a Radeon 5xxx, you'll be happier. Its not the proprietary crap issue. Catalyst on Linux works fine, but obviously you need AMD hardware to use AMD drivers.FPGAs aren't worth dealing with. Due to the cost of mass producing a generic massively parallel high throughput product like Radeon 5xxx series GPUs, you need about $3k worth of FPGA hardware to keep up with a $500 5970. AMD, however, is paying several million dollars to develop an entire open source solution through the existing X/Mesa/DRI community (along with Intel).Actually, Mesa has a very early non-functional prototype that uses Gallium. I suspect in the nest 2-3 years you can run my miner on Radeon 5xxx hardware with a fully open source stack.However, as long as Nvidia continues to unofficially threaten to sue projects like Nouveau for trying to support Nvidia on the new Gallium stack, Nvidia is probably going to go bankrupt before they turn around and quit pissing off customers. As per the post immediately before yours, update to the normal 0.3.17 binary, not a m0 patched oneYou two are both suffering from the fact Nvidia has broken drivers. They do not comply with the OpenCL specification. Until either they fix it, or I figure out a workaround that doesn't involve me getting rid of defines in the kernel altogether, this can't be fixed.Go bitch at Nvidia, maybe they'll listen if more people do it. My miner has now been updated to use the new getwork. Update: Miner now works with Satoshi's getwork impl, so you don't need to patch anymore. Ask Apple. They do not comply with the specification, and they probably don't care. OSX seems to suffer from the same bug Nvidia does. Neither of them support the specification required ability to do -Dfoo=bar. Its on the todo list to make it work with satoshi's getwork impl.My client supports both host and port, see -o and -p. If you need anything else, it may be more useful to request something from satoshi as to support in the official client (which then I can support). Nvidia drivers currently have a bug that Nvidia has not fixed yet. There was already an issue open about this on the tracker.
Sigh, -s did not work as well as I had hoped, and now it is gone. There goes my 99.1% efficiency, back to 95% I go.I've updated the mhash counter code to average over 30 seconds, and I've also added executor lockup detection (which should never happen, but apparently does on really fubar machines).Fixing it to work on satoshi's getwork impl is still on my todo list.Also, for those having the lwjgl ELFCLASS32 bug on Ubuntu x86-64, I've discovered the fix: your DISPLAY is unset because you're running it headless over ssh. Do export DISPLAY=:0 before running and it should work fine now. Not yet, still gotta use m0's version instead. It would be immensely useful if you'd return if what I sent to the client actually was an actual hit. It makes it easier to debug issues in miners due to sanity checking. As a side note, do not try -s on Radeon 5xxx. It is slower, and it can also lead to random segfaults because I think I'm hitting a bug in the driver.Now, as for the gigantic hash problem is, the hash counter is increased every time a kernel is queued... if the kernel fails to queue (which I just added detection of in the build I just pushed out), it would still increase the hash counter. Now, it quits and bitches.UukGoblin on IRC found a slight tiny bug in the new code I wrote for split, so I just fixed that, it effected people not using split. This should cure some of the problems some of you were having.So, everyone upgrade and see if you're still experiencing bugs. Something is not working right here on your machine. There is no way you should be getting above 94 mhash. What do you get with mine with split not enabled?Also, yes, -s completely destroys desktop interactivity. Try using -f 240 on top of that until I commit a change to implicitly do that with -s (4xxx needs -f 120 to begin to operate normally without destroying desktop interactivity) Satoshi, please fix your implementation of getwork so it complies with m0mchill's specification Update: added Radeon 4xxx mode that splits the OpenCL kernel payload in half... use -s. I am now 99.1% efficient on Radeon 4xxx hardware. Update: You no longer have to edit the OpenCL to enable the bitalign hack for SDK 2.1 and Radeon 5xxx anymore: just start the program with -a There is a small problem, slush: I wasn't aware Ions supported OpenCL at all. -w and -v should only be used by people who know what they're doing. -w 1024 is too high for any platform I've seen, and the nvidia driver should reject it.43 ghash/sec sounds like the miner isn't running at all, which I'm not sure how my app arrived at such a point if Nvidia's drivers are written correctly... which, its Nvidia, when have they ever written anything correctly. Updated miner. As mentioned in updated op, on ATI 2.1 + 10.10 (which is slower than 10.9), using -w 64 -v 1 (not -v 2), I get almost 75 mhash on my Radeon 4850 which gives me above 95% estimated efficiency; using only 1% CPU in the miner and 0% CPU in X.Oh, and as a side note, it does not automatically detect Radeon 5xxx on SDK 2.1; for the time being, you have to edit DiabloMiner.cl in the jar, comment the first line and uncomment the second and third lines. This is not required for SDK 2.2. So, I just installed Cat 10.10... on my miner, -w 64 -v 2 is no longer optimal... -w 256 -v 1 is, and my speed is lower than it should be (about 66 mhash vs 70). So, they improved one issue (-v 2 should not have been performing better than -v 1), but got worse somewhere else. Bleh. That doesn't make any sense because it will just overwrite the entire error a second later. The error is supposed to be part of the ongoing log.Not only that, I don't know if the exception is JSON or an actual error due to how I hand the exception down, which is actually the correct behavior for designing such an app; you're trying to fix it in the wrong spot. What you really want to suggest is getting the message out of the JSON and then handing that down, which CAN be done.I'm still. however, not changing the log behavior, this is exactly the way it should work in ANY app designed like this. Thats not something that can be fixed usefully, consoles don't work that way without heavy manipulation (such as using curses). Bitcoin does not output a JSON message if it is not connected, it only says that it can't connect, and I'm not going to remove the JSON output when it DOES connect and fail because it is a useful debugging tool. Ahh, well I can't help you there. I bet OpenGL apps don't work with Remote Desktop either. Just because its not opening a window doesn't mean my miner isn't using your video card. Same way on Linux, to use OpenCL, you have to have X running. Nvidia is out of their minds then. Send a bug report to them demanding OpenCL 1.1 support. AMD has already had it for around 6 months, there is no reason why Nvidia can't. This is absurd. I suspect that their Windows driver is broken then. Nvidia is advertising OpenCL 1.1 support in these beta drivers, yet it lacks it. You should just go buy a AMD card instead, you'll get several times more mhash anyhow. Yes, but since I'm on 6, I'd have to install 5 to build jars that work on 5, and I'm not going to do that. 6 has performance increases that make it worth using (same way as 7 over 6 when 7 finally ships). There is no reason to still be using Java 5 six years after it came out. Either upgrade to 6, or build your own copy. See that Github link in the op post?  It does. That error (which only appears on Windows that specific way; on every other OS it is a less scary normal exception) means your Nvidia driver is too out of date; Nvidia is lagging on OpenCL support (I suspect they will be filing for bankruptcy in the next 2-3 years).I do not recommend using a 32-bit JVM on a 64-bit Windows. Many apps break due to poor design in Windows. That error, however, is more Nvidia-can't-code problems.
