Thanks. I'm a Windows user. Downloading GUIMiner... Any recommendations for a Bitcoin mining program? One with a point-and-click interface would be ideal, though I would be OK with a CMD one with instructions. Thanks. I usually use the disposable addresses thing in Yahoo!, but Mt Gox was one of the few sites I put my main e-mail into. I might have to try the GMail method if the spam keeps coming. Thanks for all the advice! I was on the Mt Gox e-mail list thing, and now I'm receiving spam to my main e-mail address. Any way to stop this?
