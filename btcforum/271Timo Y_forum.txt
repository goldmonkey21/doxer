It's not a scam, it's just inefficient. The reason a notary is so expensive is not because their work is difficult, but because they are liable for the validity of documents they stamp.  It's kind of an insurance for the customer.  Which won't be needed anymore for algorithm-based notaries, of course. It's easy to underestimate just how much time people need to get their head around new paradigms. Even technically-minded people find it hard to get their head around Bitcoin. Imagine how hard it is for Average Joe. This negative reaction in the comments above is natural and unsurprising. It will only evaporate after many, many repeated exposures to the technology. It would be disastrous but it would also very likely spawn new chain acceptance rules that make this type of attack at lot more difficult.  See:http://gavintech.blogspot.ch/2012/05/neutralizing-51-attack.htmlSo it would basically be a one-off.  Either bitcoin would recover or a more robust altcoin would take its place.  Either way they attacker would fail in destroying the technology. It is impossible for words to have a "clearly defined meaning".  All words have fuzzy meanings. That is how the human language works.   Any verbal argument, even if it is based on reason and logic, cannot arrive at absolutist conclusions. All conclusions are only true to a degree.  And it's not a question of finding a more precise language, or better definitions, because human thought is imprecise.  Neural networks deal in degrees and probabilities, not in mechanistic rules.  The biggest failing of libertarinism is that it treats concepts as binary which are continua in the real word. Take the concept of "force" for instance. For a libertarian, either something is forceful or it isn't.  But in reality there is a spectrum that goes something like this:  gentle persuasion ... manipulation ... thinly veiled threats ... pointing a gun to someone's head.  Libertarians say that you simply have to define force more precisely in edge cases but I say this is impossible. For a lot of practical problems, intuitive, fuzzy morality trumps mechanistic ideology by a long way.  I think the basic moral values of the two systems are similar, it's just that socialists have a different definition of "fruits of labor". When they take from the rich and give to the poor, the justification is that it never belonged to the rich in the first place. The problem with political ideologies, and that includes socialism and libertarianism, is that they base their arguments on ill-defined and messy terms and then at the end they pop out suspiciously clean and elegant conclusions. For example: What does "fruits of labor" actually mean? Labor is just another word for "doing stuff". Sure, if you do stuff it has consequences, but how do you decide which of those consequences are "fruits"?Elegant moral theories that claim to have a definite answer for every conceivable moral problem should be taken with a grain of salt. Especially if they are based on verbal arguments alone. The human language is incapable of capturing the complexities of the real world. That's why I don't do ideology.  I treat each moral problem individually, based on reason, evidence, and intuitive morality. Libertarianism is not incompatible with socialism.  It is only incompatible with coercive socialism.One of core values of socialism is that the rich have a moral obligation to redistribute some of their wealth to the poor.  However, this redistribution doesn't have to happen by coercive means. There are also non-coercive ways of achieving this: ostracism, shaming, persuasion, education, prizes, fame, social norms, "whuffie", etc  The crypto economy has the potential to formalize and automate these redistribution mechanisms (see Vitalik Buterin's SocialCoin idea), making them so effective that coercive, tax-based redistribution is no longer necessary.  Educate people to avoid exchanges without proven reserves.As long as people are aware that these exchanges are doing fractional reserve, the selling of fractional reserve bitcoins should not affect the bitcoin price. Real bitcoins will trade at a higher price than bitcoin IOUs.  What do you mean? By historical standards the price has been remarkably stable lately. The bans on cryptography export and the persecution of Phil Zimmerman in the 90s was a more aggressive impingement of free speech than the bitlicense. The constitution didn't protect us then it then and it won't protect us now. How often? Show us the data please.Oh I forgot, you don't have any data because it is almost impossible to collect data about this "industry" without doing something highly illegal. AML/KYC regulations are insanely draconian. Try to interact with any kind of business in the financial sector that is even slightly "innovative", and soon you will run into exactly the same barriers. This problem is not isolated to Bitstamp or even just Bitcoin businesses. Last year I tried to invest a paltry 300 GBP into a biotech startup via a crowdfunding initiative. My investment was blocked by the crowdfunding company because of "not passing AML/KYC checks"  Not delayed or hindered by identity checks, but outright prohibited.  The reason given was that I am suspicious because am a resident of The Netherlands and have the audacity to invest in the UK!   These are two highly developed EU countries; surely the ability to invest across them is something you would take for granted?  A that point, I felt more like I was living in Venezuela than the EU.Similar experience with Transferwise. Tried to send a relatively small amount from UK to Eurozone. Again, my transaction was frozen with no advance warning and they refused  to release my money it unless I send them sensitive info like passport scans etc. Again they cited AML/KYC compliance.  Funnily enough, when transferring a much larger amount directly from UK bank to Eurozone bank (and paying a ripoff exchange rate) no questions were asked.   Based on these experiences and others, I am actually surprised that Bitstamp isn't being more restrictive with its customers than they are being right now.As for btc-e, I find it incredible that they have managed to get away without doing AML/KYC checks in this kind of regulatory climate.   The only way that I can explain it is that there is something shady going on there.   Are you serious? A social network is already decentralized by its very nature. Facebook is not a social network.  Facebook is just a social network mediation service.  The only reason people use a centralized website for that in the 00s and 10s is because websites are easier to program and maintain and the technology of p2p applications hasn't caught up yet, especially in terms of UE.  Trolls and spammers are not an issue in a high trust environment where you get to choose who is allowed to communicate with you.  They have only become an issue for Facebook users who don't use Facebook as a social network, ie. people who have lots of strangers as Facebook friends.I would be very surprised if 20 years from now social networks are still mediated by centralized websites. Everyone is going to have their own agent that communicates with other other people's agents via standardized interfaces. The power and flexibility offered by agents is no match to a one-size-fits-all website. As for decentralization of leadership, I agree that there is no replacement for a human leader when it comes to giving a group of people vision and inspiration.  One aspect of leadership can be decentralized though: power.   Democracy is an attempt to do just  that, though it didn't quite get there because it still relies on human power custodians.  DACs could take this one step further and replace the custodians with consensus networks. Your mistake is that you are letting your emotions influence your decisions. There is nothing wrong with that when it comes to making personal choices such as choosing a career, partner, or house.  When it comes to the impersonal world of trading, this is a terrible strategy.  Emotions are predictable is that is precisely why more experienced traders are making money off of you. To be successful in the trading game, you need to be an ice cold bastard.  Few people have what it takes emotionally and the ones who don't should stay away from it. You are basically assuming that marginal utility is constant; that an extra $10 is just as valuable to Bill Gates as it is to someone begging for food on the street.For most people that is very far from the truth.  Most people won't even accept a 5% risk of their children becoming homeless even in exchange for an expected profit of 100-fold.That's what people used to say about $100.  Creating an alternative that will overtake Bitcoin is a lot harder than creating an alternative that will overtake Wikipedia (which also hasn't happened so far). There are multiple, powerful network effects at play.  Unlikely. Bitcoin is held mostly by enthusiasts and speculators at this stage. It's very high up on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  I doubt that a lot of people feel compelled to buy more BTC when their income drops.Bitcoin is a lot more like a Veblen good. The net effect of China on Bitcoin can only be positive.  True, a lot of Chinese will avoid Bitcoin because of the government's hostility towards it.  But even if just 1% of Chinese were to start using Bitcoin, that would be a huge boost for Bitcoin's user base.In China there is a lot of pent-up demand for a good store-of-value, but very limited supply.  In the long term, something has to give. China is a bit like a huge bucket submerged in water. The bucket is mostly watertight, but it does have numerous microscopic cracks where water is constantly leaking in.  The government is constantly trying to mend the cracks but new ones keep appearing.  Slowly but surely the bucket is filling. It might take decades but eventually the bucket will have the same water level as the outside world. Either bitcoin fulfills a need for you, or it doesn't. Why should it matter whether you are female or male? it is decentralized not in the sense that every node is equal but that every node has equal opportunity. A bit like the internet itself. The free market leads to a power-law type distribution of  node importance. That is an utopian ideal that goes against human nature.  The real economy simply doesn't work like that.  It hasn't worked like that ever since the invention of agriculture, and probably not even before that.If the economy worked like that, then a subsistence farmer in Africa would earn the same hourly wage as a star football player. By any objective measure, both work equally hard. So why do their hourly wages differ by a factor of 100,000?In a free market, people do not get rewarded for work.  They get rewarded for creating value.  There are many ways of creating value.  For most of them work is a necessary, but not sufficient ingredient.  But humans are very similar in their capacity and willingness to work. Even the hardest working human on the planet cannot put in more than 20 hours a day.  The crucial ingredient for creating value is not work but access to capital.   The variability in amount of work is tiny compared to the variability in access to capital. In the information economy, smart allocation of information capital is the key to getting rich. It is also the key to boosting our living standards far beyond what a more labor-oriented economy could achieve.  This is why I don't worry about tech entrepreneurs getting filthy rich.Sure it would be nice if everyone on earth had equal access to capital.  But it is in the nature of all living things, including humans, to pass capital to their offspring, and thus capital accumulates over generations.  And I don't just mean money that is inherited, I am also talking about things like social and cultural capital.Utopian cures to this "disease" have proven disastrous. Economic activity, by itself, is neither good nor bad.  What matters is the type of economic activity, not the quantity.  Economics is all about the allocation of scarce resources.  Forget about money for a moment.  A desirable economy is one that allocates resources such in a way that maximizes utility for the biggest number of people.   The optimum amount of economic activity in the right sectors is what achieves this.   Indiscriminate boosting of economic activity is almost always detrimental to this.  Money is just an auxiliary.  Resources are still allocated irrespective of whether all money is being circulated all the time.See above. This is not necessarily a bad thing. There is an optimum amount of work that makes most people most happy.  When people work more than that they become unhappier again. Maximization of work is not desirable. Maximization of happiness is.Bitcoin will only grow fast as long as it's in diffusion phase. Once established, price will be relatively stagnant like for any other established stock or commodity.Yeah, because people would rather starve than part with their precious bitcoins? Even a perfectly rational, error-free free market can fuck up, in the sense that it doesn't lead to the most optimal outcome of all possible outcomes.Markets are dumb incremental optimizers. They often fall into social traps that are locally stable.  They are good at fine tuning once the starting conditions have been set, but they are totally blind to finding the "correct" starting conditions in the first place.  They don't see the bigger picture because they are incapable of cognition and design.The situation for real markets is not as simple as that because the space of "all possible outcomes" is not static and  is itself dependent on previous outcomes. But there are a lot of cases in practice in which the above still temporarily applies.To me, market intervention is justified if the existence of a social trap is easy to prove and there is a strong consensus among participants that everyone would be better off if the trap could be escaped.  To me, things like air traffic control and other public goods are a no-brainer.  Monetary policy, not so much.  Sure, unemployment can be alleviated, but the problem is that nobody really understands the long term and unseen effects of interest rate and money supply manipulation. We are messing with a chaotic system. It might become even more unstable as a result of our intervention.  Also, there is a lack of consensus about an "optimal" rate of unemployment and so on.I don't know whether democratic government is the best Leviathan. DACs seem like a promising and less error-prone alternative.  Anyhow, a good government should not be a decision maker but merely an executioner of consensus.  Thus it is incapable of making strategic errors in the first place.
Xenophobia? More like Xenonausea.Many times I have gone out of my way to help newbies who seemed genuinely interested. But when I hear words like "Tulip" or "Ponzi" for the 10000th time, I just can't help feeling irritated and rolling my eyes. I'm only human.Now combine the above with the fact that most people on this forum are young males who have not been trained in customer service.It's hardly surprising that they are not always nice to newbies.I don't think it's a big issue. Moderate growth is our friend.  If you can't think of a strong reason of getting into bitcoin, and "bad customer service" is all it takes to scare you away, then you probably shouldn't. At least not at this stage. Bitcoin 0.x is not ready for the mainstream yet.   come back from where? from a toilet break? Yawn.  Every time the price drops, posts like these start appearing by the dozens.  Every time it rises they disappear again. If you are going to make a case for Bitcoin being a Ponzi scheme, then at least base it on arguments about Bitcoin's principle. Don't base it on Bitcoin's price.  Otherwise the discussion is just about as interesting as a discussion about the weather. This problem is entirely Apple's making though.  If Apple sold universal computing devices rather than closed platforms then it wouldn't need to worry about any of this, because it could plausibly argue that it is the users who are liable and not Apple.For example, Microsoft and Intel don't need to worry about getting sued if someone uses a Microsoft/Intel laptop to do something illegal.The demise of the the universal computing device is a threat to innovation, democracy, and diversity that goes far beyond Bitcoin, and Apple is a major contributor to this trend. This is why people should avoid Apple, not because it blocks some specific app. I don't want my "KYC documents" stored anywhere. Not even encrypted.  There is absolutely no reason for an exchange to store this type of information. If you want to verify my identity, then ask for a letter from my lawyer (if you are old fashioned) or for my government-issued digital signature. I want to see time-quantized trading, so I am certain I have no unfair disadvantage against bots with low latency connections. Here is a quote from from the website of none other than TrueCryptShouldn't the TrueCrypt designers, of all people, have a better grasp of this concept?  Actually, that XKCD comic is dangerous advice for Joe Average.  It is true only IF those words are chosen completely at random.But that is not how Joe Average would go about choosing he words. He would go something like "Horse...uhm...Cart...uuhhhm...Galloping...Away!"Or he would click on "random article" on Wikipedia 4 times.None of these methods are random enough to create secure pass phrases.Also, to resist brute force attacks by supercomputers (a realistic threat for high balance bitcoin wallets) you need something like 10-12 words and not 4.Which is not that much easier to remember than 16 characters.  I can confirm that this leak is legit!I checked the leak against some of my known trades and they match. I never disclosed this information to anyone. it won't be a crypto. there is no need for a blockchain if it is centralised. Somehow I dont believe the real Satoshi would use a phrase like "clear my name". not even in deception.  That phrase implies that the real Satoshi did something immoral. If this was the real Satoshi, he would be someone who takes great pride in associating his name with bitcoin.He would have used a phrase like "clarify things" http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/02/15/131934618/the-island-of-stone-money I would buy some. It's backed by nostalgia and has a certain zombie-like morbid charm.  Also, the name is kind of humorous, which can go a long way as DOGE has shown us.  neither the mining community nor the developers have the power to do this on their own. the majority of of users and businesses also have to be convinced to update their client. remember, a chain containing invalid transactions will be rejected even if it is the longest.since many of those users, and some miners, would oppose this out of principle, the result would almost certainly be a fork into 2 seperate bitcoins.highly undesireable. bitcoin is not property.who "owns" a bitcoin is decided by consensus and by consesus alone. nobody who acquired bitcoins ever signed a contract that promises them "ownership" after losing the ability to sign a Transaction.  Not even implicitly.  Whether they lost that ability intentionally, by accident, or by force, doesn't matter.  Ownership by protocol/consensus is the very essence of bitcoin. If ownership was determined by edict, then bitcoin would no longer be  bitcoin. In fact, then you could scrap the blockchian altogether and use a public database of edicts instead. Since people acquire bitcoins voluntarily, and since these rules are public knowledge, they cannot argue retroactively that bitcoins are property.That would be like losing in a game of poker and then suing the winner to give you back the money because you think that the rules of poker are unfair.edit: suing mtgox is a different matter because here users did enter a contract with mtgox. but that only creates obligations for mtgox, not for third party bitcoin users. Hardly. Once goxxed, always goxxed. There is no such thing as a stolen bitcoin.Bitcoin is not property.It is a ledger with a set of rules. Those rules are determined by consensus and enforced by the protocol. If you choose to take part in the game, you agree to accept the validity of the rules, and any future changes to the rules as determined by consensus.With bitcoin, the rule is unambiguous: Whoever validly signs the transaction, "owns" the bitcoin.  You cannot claim to be a legal "owner" of some bitcoin if you do not have the ability to sign (ie. knowledge of private key) because the bitcoin clients/developers/businesses never made such a promise, implicitly or explicitly, and the above rule was clear from the start.Just because around 2010 everyone started behaving as if it was property doesn't make it property.  The mtgox victims never actually owned any bitcoins. At best, they owned bitcoin IOUs. It's sad that they were misled by mtgox's marketing and that we failed to educate them better about the above.If you think this is all just theoretical musings,  remember this:Any bitcoin can be "dispropriated " by consensus.  Not by the government, not by the legal system, not by the police, but only by the protocol itself. This has already happened twice. Once after the generation bug in 2010 and once after the forking event in 2012.if bitcoin were property in any legal sense those protocol changes would have been Illegal! which would be absurd because they were commited by the very owners of that property, ie the collective of all miners and users.PS. I don't want to condone antisocial behaviour like the mtgox heists, but the solution should come from the protocol itself, eg. in the form of multisig and timelocked transaction. It should not come from wrongly treating bitcoins as property. Tl;Dr code is law average joes investing in bitcoin at this stage would do more harm than good. bitcoin isn't ready for the mainstream yet. lots of work still to be done on ergonomics, wallet security, and scalelability. its not such a bad thing that they will stay away for a couple of years because this is still a building site where people not wearing a helmet can get hurt.also, killer apps dont care about reputation. they will be used because they work, not because people are told to use them. Not a single costumer made a profit on mtgox. In fact, most made a 0.065% loss on every trade, plus deposit and withdrawal fees.If you sent $100 and withdrew $1000 that is because your asset increased in market value, not because mtgox paid you out a profit. It would have increased in value independently of mtgox.The only people who made a profit are the thieves and possibly mtgox themselves. I agree with everything you say except for one thing:These are not lessons from the mtgox collapse. They are lessons from the mybitcoin and bitomat collapses (and others) more than 2 years ago.In fact, the are lessons from basic common sense. This fanaticism is an online phenomenon. Those who shout loudest on forums don't necessarily represent the view of the majority. Talk to influential bitcoiners in real life. You will find that most of them have a sober and humble attitude. Their heart is in it, but they are aware of the risks.  Bitcoin.de and localbitcoins.com are semi-decentralized. The reason they didn't get the same volume as mtgox is that they are not attractive to day traders.  But for ordinary users they already do the job more reliably than any centralized exchange.
The very essence of bitcoin is peer to peer finance.Handing over your control of your private keys to a centralized institution goes against the very essence of bitcoin, and defies the whole point of having a blockchain.Centralized exchanges are the most fragile and non-essential part of the bitcoin ecosystem. They are a necessary evil while bootstrapping the bitcoin economy, but the sooner we stop depending on them, the better. I am not an anarcho-capitalist and I believe that centralized government has many roles to play.  Interfering in private commerce is not one of them."Money laundering" is a crime that didn't even exist 100 years ago. It was invented because the police was too lazy and incompetent to catch wealthy drug dealers. So what did the government do?  Instead of investing in better policing, they basically forced the private sector to do the police's job instead.  It is understandable why they did this.  It is easier to create regulations and offload the cost of policing to the private sector, than to spend taxpayer's money which will have to come from tax hikes or cuts in other departments. But that does not change the fact that AML regulations are horrible.  They are unjustifiable from a cost/benefit perspective.  They are a blunt tool that increases the cost of doing business across entire industries and hurts the economy. They treat honest people as "guilty until proven innocent" and are inefficient at catching the big criminals who will always find holes in the net.Not every aspect of our lives needs to be regulated.  In fact, some aspects of our private lives remain completely unregulated and the world is not falling apart because of that. I don't need to fill in a mountain of paperwork before I choose to have someone as a friend.  So why should I need to fill in a mountain of paperwork before having someone as a business partner? Both types of relationships are private and to some extent indistinguishable. Also, regulation doesn't need to be top-down.  Cryptocoins not only make it possible to avoid doing businesses with people that you deem immoral, they will also allow this process to be automated.Hopefully bitcoin and altcoins will convince governments that AML regulation has gone too far, and that there are more effective ways of catching criminals.  Sometimes laws have to adapt to new technologies, not the other way around. Yes. They just aren't widely implemented yet. See:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_2:_Escrow_and_dispute_mediationBitcoin has the added benefit that both sender and recipient can choose in advance who has the power to reverse a transaction in case of a dispute.In principle, any bitcoin transaction CAN be reversed by consensus.  Bit since this requires changing the protocol it is unlikely to ever happen for individual transactions.During the March 2013 fork event transactions were successfully reversed:https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-forkMore realistically, you could also set up a multisig transaction that requires the consensus of a "committee" of previously selected mediators. You seem to misunderstand the purpose of DACs. Their purpose is not do take away work from humans, but to take away power from humans.  That is what differentiates them from robots/AI. To achieve this, they don't even need to be exceedingly complicated (not to be confused with complex). Many organizations in the world are lead by "Monarch CEOs". These are essentially semi-skilled workers whose role is not so much making strategic decisions as acting as an authority figure who encourages unity once a decision has been made.  The problem with putting a human in this role is that power corrupts. A CEO will always be temped to use his power for their personal best interest rather than the interest of the organization. And even an honest CEO is prone to making irrational decisions because he is a slave to emotions like jealousy and pride.The big innovation here is that the CEO himself can be replaced by an algorithm that is guaranteed to act objectively and in the best interest of whatever "charter" has been hard coded into the DAC.I don't think something like fully decentralized power has ever existed. Democratic government and certain religions have attempted this, but ultimately they must always rely on some human as a power custodian. If DACs can be pulled off, they will be one of the biggest innovations in social/political organization in hundreds of years.  Buzzword or not. PS. Daniel Suarez' novel Daemon from 2006 was the first place where I saw this idea explored in detail. Highly recommended!  Good.People who don't even unterstand the basics of bitcoin should probably not invest in the first place. A large influx of naive investors, who don't get the concepts behind bitcoin and only buy because "the price is going up", could be very damaging at this stage. They are going to become panic sellers at the slightest sign of trouble, and we are going to see yet another massive crash.Growth is good but it should be gradual and organic.  It's not a currency in the same way that email is not mail and html is not text.Right now most people don't even realize that the basic "currency" function is just a small subset of things that Bitcoin can do.  Once distributed contracts take off,  things are going to get really interesting.  There is nothing even remotely comparable in existence right now. No currency, no commodity, no collectible. The biggest misconception in Bitcoin is that is fits into some historical asset class.  The truth is that is has created a whole new asset class of its own. originality: 2/10style: 3/10 There isn't much room for compression. Hashes and signatures are high entropy data. So is chess!And chess was one on the first mental "jobs" to be successfully automated.  Just because something is mentally difficult doesn't mean it's immune to automation.Why is programming so difficult and time consuming to learn? Because it requires memorizing a huge amount of very dry information, and very exact reasoning skills with a low rate of error. Those are exactly the kind of tasks that computers excel at and humans are terrible at. It is almost a miracle that the human mind can hammered into learning these tasks at all; exactness is not in our nature, we evolved to compute the world intuitively and in terms of rough estimates, not in black and white terms.   That is why good programmers, just like good chess players, are a rare commodity.  For now.But imagine that 10-20 years from now the "exact" aspect of programming can be outsourced to a machine. Imagine if you could simply tell your computer "Write me a bug free function that does X" and it spits out the code in a matter of seconds.  Of course, programming doesn't just require "left brain" skills, it also requires intuition and creativity, especially for higher level stuff like design and requirements engineering. But anyone reasonably intelligent can now become an expert programmer in a matter of months instead of years.  I am willing to bet that 90% of the work done by skilled programmers today, will be done by machines before 90% of work of janitors is done by machines. Just because a worker is less productive than a machine doesn't mean he is out of work.   All it means is that his wage is lower than the machine's "wage".   But if automation happens across the board, falling wages will happen in conjunction with falling prices, and most workers will not notice a drop in real wages, except in comparison to things that are naturally scarce such as land, energy, and bitcoin.Either that, or prices will not fall, since the "Tech Elite" will keep all the fruits of increased productivity to themselves, but in that case ordinary workers will still be able to compete in a parallel society and again not notice much of a difference.And by the way, forget about the "Tech Elite". They will be the first to suffer from falling wages, since pure knowledge jobs are the easiest to replace with software.  I think we are heading back towards a Medieval-style society where technological innovation is mainly driven by enthusiasts tinkering on open-source projects and a few geniuses sponsored by old money and rich land owners.  If I were to give career advice to a child born today, I would tell them to forget about science and engineering and become a stand up comedian, since this is the most difficult-to-automate job that I can possibly think of.   That was just his "FBI appeasement" wallet that he purposefully stored in his home and secured with a weak password. The other 450,000 coins are still safe in his brain wallet.  But now they are plausibly deniable.   Get a mortgage and pay it off slowly with your Bitcoins. Because there is nothing interesting to discover there. x86 is pretty much an open standard.In contrast, how long did it take until "unbreakable" Blu-Ray encryption was broken?...or a swarm of thousands of unpaid undergraduate students cranking the ratchet.   Not that scary. If you backup regularly, then it's a minor inconvenience.   If you don't backup regularly, then this malware is just preponing what would have happened sooner or later anyhow due to hard disk failure.  And even then you pay a much smaller price.  The Achilles heel of autonomous agents is their inability to hide the private key from parasitic hosts.  The Wiki talks about using TPM as a solution, but that is a very weak solution because TPMs can be reverse engineered (dissected in an electron microscope if need be) and simulated in a VM.  Even if the amounts of money are small, hackers are going to attempt this as a matter of honor.Agents are only going to be truly viable once homomorphic encryption has matured.  But this is still a nascent technology, so it's going to take several years before agents take off. I don't get it. What is wrong with this photo? How could this photo be used "against him"? All I can see is somewhat unflattering but otherwise utterly mundane photo. You are talking in riddles.  Here's a little rant I want to share because I think it illustrates everything that is wrong with today's AML regulations.I live in the Netherlands and I am an active user of crowdcube.com - a p2p crowd-financing site based in the UK.Crowdcube stated on their website that international investors were welcome as long as they didn't break any rules in their home country.  For 2 years, I was able to invest in various pitches without any problems.  Last month, I decided to invest 300 GBP in a UK-based biotech startup.  Then, suddendly, they decide to change the rules right in the middle of my investment and send me this email:"Anti Money Laundering"  So sending 300 GBP from the Netherlands to the UK, now automatically makes me suspected drug dealer?  Guilty until proven innocent? WTF? You don't have to be a libertarian to see that there is something seriously wrong with the system here.  If an ordinary person living in Amsterdam is prohibited from buying a handful shares in a Cambridge-based biotech startup, then what the hell is the European Union good for?  Apparently the "single market" does not apply to the small guy.Yes, I realize that this is GoCardless' individual decision, and that this does not constitute a universal cross-border investment ban, but what we are seeing here is a chilling effect of excessively complex and draconian AML regulations.  I am sure that there are many other examples of companies simply shutting out foreign investors rather than taking their chances with overzealous regulators. What makes me really angry is that the damage caused by these regulations is invisible to politicians and voters.  The biotech company will never know that they missed out on foreign investors like me.  Maybe they will fail, and the politicians will never know that this company could have created life saving treatments, had it been only able to raise more starting capital.  The jobless biochemistry graduate will never know that this could have been a great place to work for.  And so on...   So the regulations will only get worse, and the bad guys will simply route around them through the darknet.I am sad to be expelled from Crowdcube. It was a great concept. But I can take my money elsewhere. It's not like the UK economy needs it or anything.  You can't fit "tons of memory" on a single chip, not even an ASIC, since you are fundamentally constrained by transistor size.So even with an ASIC, more hashpower can only be achieved with more hardware, and not with architecture alone.  For the 10TB of memory mentioned by the OP you would need to manufacture thousands of chips, ASIC or no ASIC.Sure, an ASIC would be more efficient than a home PC, but in terms of hash per dollar invested it would perhaps only achieve a factor of 2, not a factor of 10,000 like it's the case with the SHA256 algorithm. Why is it sexist? Being at the extremes does not imply superiority, neither moral nor functional.  For example, well-balanced people tend to do better in the modern workplace than people with extreme personality traits. "Freakish" people are not better than "average" people, they are just different, that's all. No, it's equivalent to saying that most women are similar, as are most men.  The word "excuse" implies that the gender gap is something pathological that needs to be fought.  In fact, it's just a result of fewer women being interested in bitcoin than men.You know what is really sexist?  Claiming that women ought to be more interested in bitcoin, even after the fact that they have chosen not to. That is basically treating them like children who "don't know what's best for them". There is no problem.This is purely an effect of statistics.  Bitcoin is a "weird" and "extreme" technology, therefore it tends to attract people from the extreme tail end of the distribution, whether male or female.  When you look at attributes such as personality, political stance, or intelligence the distribution for women is narrower than the distribution for men.  The further away you go from the mean, the more men outnumber women.  The reason there are so few female bitcoiners is the same reason there are so few female BASE jumpers, Nobel prize winners, and serial killers.The more mainstream bitcoin becomes, the more "average" people it will attract, both male and female, and the more this effect will be diluted.
Ugh. The thought makes me shudder. Back then this forum was a more innocent place, full of dreamers discussing what at the time felt like improbable scenarios out of a William Gibson novel.  I was really taken by surprise how soon this fantasy became reality, how soon this whole bitcoin experiment became serious fucking business.  Very surreal to read this thread in retrospect.   At least it's nice to see that my predictions were right  You don't need a centralized website to do achieve what Silk Road achieved. Apart from Bitcoin and Tor, all you need is:1) A secure p2p messaging system2) A p2p identity management and rating system3) A p2p data store for storing pictures etc.4) A distributed escrow systemAll those things already exist to some extent. 1) can be achieved by Bitmessage. 2) can be achieved by a combination of Namecoin and PGP web of trust.3) can be achieved by Freenet, Bittorrent, Rapidshare etc.4) can be achieved by multisig transactions in combination with 2)Now it's only a matter of packaging those building blocks into a user friendly application. Sooner or later someone is going to do it.We have reached an age where online black markets are pretty much inevitable, so we may as well stop worrying and learn to live with them. I bet that in a few years we will hear about the first scandals involving lost or stolen government bitcoins.  Wallet security is not a trivial task for a large organizations, and government agencies have a track record of data security blunders.      One positive effect of this is that government agencies will now be forced to fully understand how bitcoin works, whether they want to or not.  That will help campaigners such as the Bitcoin Foundation in their efforts of educating governments. This version is failing to connect to Tor network through SOCKS proxy (IP: 127.0.0.1 Port:9050)Previous version worked fine. OS: Windows 7 Fees for international withdrawal were a total of about 60 USD (mtgox fee + my bank's fee).  Update: International withdrawal only took 3 business days! Home made handguns are boring. They are not that much more effective than a knife or an axe. But handguns are only the beginning.When people start to print armed helicopter drones, things are going to get interesting. Yes, I am aware of this problem. I too believe in "Trade not Aid" but that doesn't mean I need to be a fundamentalist about it. I am also against governments giving out aid, because them being governments, they tend to give it to other governments, which in poor countries are often not more than glorified criminal gangs. Giving to private charities with a local presence is a different story though.  There is nothing wrong with aid in certain situations, eg. when a real emergency is being addressed. According to ICCF Holland's website, they invest the money directly in local infrastructure like a clinic, rather than sending it indiscriminately to some dubious middleman.It's good to be skeptical, and it's true that a lot of corruption goes on, but that does not mean you should dismiss every single Africa charity by default.  Ripple CAN do this.  All you need to do is limit your trading to "full reserve" gateways who back their IOUs with a bank balance and promise withdrawal on demand.  Well yes, they are still IOUs, but it's no different to a USD balance on Mtgox or Paypal, which is technically also nothing more than an IOU. Even your proposal relies on temporary IOUs.   As long as bank transfers are not instant it will be impossible to get around using them. Cancelled my SEPA withdrawal after 35 days.  I'm giving the international withdrawal a try now. No, Ripples are even less anonymous.Anyhow, there are proposals to layer anonymity on top of bitcoin, for those who really need it. See:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Zerocoin You reach a point where you fundamentally can't make things any simpler without compromising security.  This applies to bitcoin just as much as physical possessions.When securing physical possessions, people DO put up with lots of inconvenience and complexity, so it's unrealistic to expect bitcoin to become both ultra-simple and ultra-secure.A hardware wallet that works a bit like an online banking security token is probably as simple as it gets. Even 'stupid' people have learned how to use security tokens so why can't they learn to use hardware wallets? I'm still waiting. SEPA withdrawal on 2013-04-10.Same reply from support about queued withdrawals. Selbstselektion? Count me in too! Not as long as the text is being stored steganographically. Example: If someone sends a transaction of 1.495438 BTC, there is no way of proving whether the digits after the 1 are being used to encode text. Child porn links can also be encoded into bank transactions.  Does that mean that banks are legally obliged to delete such transactions from their database, once they find out about them?Somehow I doubt it. I don't know what you mean by "acceptable".Just because the forum moderators don't delete certain posts doesn't mean that they approve of them. I don't think that the majority of users on this forum find antisemitism acceptable. There are a handful of antisemitic conspiracy theorist nutters here.  The more extreme ones have already been banned, not for "hate speech" but for trolling and repeated off-topic posting. Aren't you being a bit petty?
A 'democratic vote' doesn't have much weight in creating successful hard forks.   Even if the majority of casual users update their client to Bitcoin900M, what use is it to them if the major merchants don't accept coins from that branch?It's only the 'economic majority' that has this kind of weight.But why should major merchants and stakeholders support a protocol change that devalues their savings? Keep your bitcoins on a 2-of-2 multisig address. Keep one key on the smartphone and the other with a loved one in your home country.  As soon as you clear customs, notify your loved one to release the coins to another 1-signature address on your phone. Should it ever come down to a legal defense, you can argue that the bitcoins are not 'imported' unless both your and your loved one cross the border together. Tying bitcoins to another person and not simply another device is key.  Most judges are not tech-savvy and don't grasp concepts like cryptography and digital signatures.  However, they do grasp the concept of multiple persons having to sign an ownership transfer.  Make it easy for the judge to understand this, and the prosecution will have a hard time. 'Coins' don't really exist.  Only transactions and private keys exist.Metaphorically, you could say that coins are held simultaneously in the wallet AND the blockchain.  Bei mir hat es einmal einen Monat gedauert.  Das passiert normalerweise, wenn zu viele Kunden gleichzeitig von mtgox via Banküberweisung abheben.  Die sind einfach überfordert.Keine Angst, das Geld ist nicht weg. Außer Mtgox geht in den nächsten Wochen pleite, was ich für unwahrscheinlich halte. Java itself isn't a huge problem, as long as you only use Java applications that you trust. The problem is the Java browser plugin. Just disable it.  I do all my web browsing, pdf&word file opening, etc. from inside a Virtualbox virtual machine.  I recommend the same for all hot wallet users. Why do banks get blamed for things like "drug money laundering"?When gangsters use Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for human trafficking, it's not like Mercedes gets blamed for aiding gangsters.  Unless they knowingly sell a van for this purpose. The UK government is already doing this:In the UK you will go to jail for astronomical noise. Perhaps they meant to say painting. For one, merchants could hedge against the sudden sharp price drops that we have seen in the last months.  As soon as a lot of merchants are doing this, it would also dampen the sharp price increases, since a fraction of speculators who expect bitcoin to rise would bet against the hedgers instead of buying bitcoin.  +1The number of users needs to stabilize first before we can have stable prices.Also, we don't have a well functioning derivatives market for bitcoin. Once that is the case, adoption as a medium of exchange will explode. Either Western Union embraces cryptocurrencies or it goes bankrupt in 5-10 years.Western Union is roughly in the same position now as Blockbuster was in 10 years ago. The fact that Blockbuster failed to embrace the Internet early on, even though the warning signs were crystal clear, was their downfall. Western Union, take heed. That advantage is largely illusory. Transaction times are not faster. Only Confirmation time is faster. However, it's not the number of confirmations that matters for double spending protection. It's the cumulative difficulty of confirmations. If you decrease the time between confirmations by a factor of 4, you need 4 times as many confirmations for the same double spending security.The only situation where Litecoin offers a speed advantage is a high trust scenario where merchants only require 1 confirmation  for minimal security, and where the security provided by 1 confirmation greatly exceeds the security they require, but at the same time 0 confirmations is not secure enough.Such situations are rare.As for the slow confirmation times of zero fee transactions, Litecoin would suffer from the same problem if it had similar volumes to Bitcoin.Doesn't bother me. I think that people like Satoshi, Gavin, and Mike Hearn deserve every penny of their wealth.Litecoiners are profiting from their work.I agree, but this is both an advantage and disadvantage.  Too centralized, and mining can be corrupted by monopolies.  Too democratic, and mining can be corrupted by social engineering.  I'm not sure whether Bitcoin, Litecoin, or ppcoin strikes the right balance.  pffff, young kids these days...  I will reply with a few quotes from David J.C. MacKays book Sustainable Energy  Without the Hot Air: Am besten hier fragen:http://dot-bit.org/forum/ Sie werden nicht zentral ausgegeben. Alle XRP die jemals existieren werden, wurden durch schon durch das Protokoll ausgegeben  mehrheitlich an Opencoin. Aber nicht einmal Opencoin ist in der Lage, neue XRP zu schaffen. Die Tatsache, dass die große Mehrheit der XRP einer einzigen Firma gehört, bedeutet natürlich, dass diese Firma den Kurs sehr leicht zum Einstürzen bringen kann.  Als Investment würde ich es deshalb auch nicht empfehlen. Ich verkaufe dir gerne 300 XRP um 0,015 BTC.  20,000 XRP/BTC entspricht dem aktuellen Kurs bei Bitstamp. Wenn du mit diesem Angebot einverstanden bist, schicke bitte 0,015 BTC an meine Forums-Adresse:1E8ydXZKFLG6zHdcZoRjRT4m4AYgYYjyAi I bet that when Ripple becomes successful, Krugman will just come up with some other excuse about why it's bad, since he won't be able to use the "wasted energy" excuse.   zB hier im Forum oder bei bitcoin-otc.com

Mtgox wird diese Funktion allerdings bald einstellen. Vielleicht wird dies aber in Zukunft über Ripple auch ohne Mittelsmänner und Zeitverzögerung möglich sein. Setzt aber voraus, dass beide Börsen Ripple unterstützen. Bisher ist Bitstamp ist die einzige Börse die Ripple unterstützt. Die Angriffsfläche ist die gleiche, die Motivation von Hackern aber höher als zB beim Klauen von Paypal Guthaben.Bitcoins sind für einen Hacker mehr wert als andere Daten weil sie, im Gegensatz zu anderen Daten, praktisch mit null Risiko zu Geld gemacht werden können. Du musst davon ausgehen, dass ein Hacker mehr Energie in Bitcoin-Diebstahl stecken wird als in zB in Diebstahl von Kreditkartennummern.  Du musst auch davon ausgehen, dass eine wallet.dat auf deinem Rechner ein höheres Kaliber von Hacker anziehen wird. Hacker die sich normalerweise nicht um Privat-PCs scheren.Jemand der genug Wissen, Zeit, und Willen besitzt, kann in jeden Heim-PC eines Normalsterblichen einbrechen. Da hilft kein Firewall und Virenscanner.Die Frage ist nur ob sich so ein Dieb die Arbeit antut. Bei kleineren Beträgen wahrscheinlich nicht. Mehr als ca. 50 BTC würde ich aber auf keinen Fall auf einfach auf einer Hot Wallet liegen lassen.  Eine Offline Wallet anzulegen bedeutet zwar ein bisschen Arbeit, zahlt sich aber auf jedem Fall aus. You seem to be pretty sure of yourself, BitcoinMillionaire.Why don't you put your money where your mouth is? Take my bet to earn an easy 5-10 BTC:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1534 Because most porn sites probably would be out of business if they didn't have recurring credit card payments, and customers who are too embarrassed/apathetic/forgetful to cancel.  damit bitstamp dir ein ripple-guthaben ueberweisen kann musst du zuerst eine kreditlinie an bitstamp vergeben. Zijn Engels sprekers ook welkom?Mijn Nederlands is nog niet zeer geavanceerd. Ik kan wel het meeste begrijpen.  It's risky to keep money in exchanges instead of your own offline wallet. So it's reasonable to assume that the bitcoin rich only move larger sums into the exchanges just before selling. A spike in bitcoins days destroyed could be a sign of "old money" moving into the exchanges a couple of hours before a major dump. There is one measure that does lead price sometimes: Bitcoin days destroyed. Animal spirits are never going to go away. But if we had a well-functioning derivatives market the bubbles would be a lot more dampened.  Ja, kannst du. Der Sinn wäre zB. dass du nicht dein ganzes Vermögen auf einmal aus dem Safe holen und in Bitcoin-Qt laden musst, wenn du nur einen Bruchteil abheben willst.Hängt vom Betreiber ab, aber in der Regel weniger sicher.Sie sind was für jeden, der mehr als ca. 5 BTC spart.   foxra: Ich schlage vor, du postest die Suchanzeige auch am Englischsprachigen Marktplatz. Dort hast du eine bessere Chance jemanden zu finden der die richtigen Tools für dein Problem hat. There is Alice, the main signatory. Then there is Bob, the secondary signatory.The main signatory can spend the bitcoins at any time, with her signature alone.But if Bob wants to spend the bitcoins, he needs to make two signatures. The second signature needs to be at least 6 months after the first.  Alice continues being able to spend the bitcoins, even after Bob has made the first signature.My question: Can this be done?My reason for asking is that I think this would be a great way to handle inheritance without having to trust a third party (eg. a notary or lawyer). If it can be done, I might be willing to pay somebody to code it, depending on how complex it is. Leute, verwendet bitte nicht Dropbox sondern Wuala. Die akzeptieren schon seit 2 Jahren Bitcoin!Ich möchte hier keine Werbung machen, aber ich empfehle Wuala statt Dropbox weil Wuala deine Daten lokal verschlüsselt und nicht einmal Wuala den Key weiss.Ich sage zwar nicht dass Dropbox korrupt ist, aber man weiß nie und bei Wuala spielt das eben keine Rolle, weil man Wuala im Gegensatz zu Dropbox nicht vertrauen muss. Why does it matter WHO created bitcoin? This is an internet technology, not a fucking celebrity show.People use bitcoin because it is useful, not because of personality cult. And anyhow, bitcoin is constantly evolving. The original inventor only got it started.This is just as fallacious a saying that space exploration is a bad idea because the modern rocket was invented by a Nazi. over 9000 If you say so... I just received an email too:No more free SEPA deposits and withdrawals on bitcoin-otc  Don't even know what a Harlem Shake is, but this must be one of the most badly written articles I've ever seen published in the Guardian.  An 8-year old writing a school essay about Bitcoin could have done a better job. Wenn du eine Adresse pro Kunde verwendest, ist es leichter Buchhaltung zu führen.  Eine Standard Bitcoin-Überweisung enthält ja keine Information außer Betrag und Adresse(n).zB. wenn man eine Handelsplattform wie bitmit.net betreibt.   Aber wenn's ein gewoehnlicher E-shop ist, und du nur empfangen willst, machts es dein Leben schon um einiges leichter. 
Human beings always want an explanation for everything.  But maybe there simply isn't an explanation for the recent rise in price. Maybe it was caused by an interplay of factors so complex that it can't be reduced to a nice, simple, human-readable story. foxra:Habe dir eine Nachricht geschickt. Welchen Client benutzt du? Bitcoin-Qt?  Kannst du dich erinnern, ob dein Passwort bestimmte Regeln befolgt (zB. Wort+Zahl)? Je mehr Regeln du aufzählen kannst desto höher die Wahrscheinlichkeit dass es jemand für dich knacken kann. Kostet halt was. [also crossposted]I've taken a lot of risks in life. Most ended up in failure. Only a handful paid off.I know people who never take big risks and rarely have to deal with failure. In some ways, they have a much happier life than me. Failure hurts.Perhaps they see me as lucky because my failures are invisible to them. Very well written. But perhaps you should replace the phrase "power elite" with something more neutral. It sounds a bit too much like a tinfoil hatter in my opinion.Believe it or not, but some people in the "power elite" are actually on our side. There would be tons of freeloaders. What are freeloaders doing? They are betting that the hashrate will be above their desired value, even if they don't pledge. So why not bring them into the system and let them bet for profit?If you pledge for a certain hashrate, and the hashrate doesn't materialize, you get back your pledge + x percent profit. The profit comes from the people who pledged for the hashrate that did materialize.  A fraction of their pledge goes to the miners and another fraction is used for betting.  Hängt davon ab, wie sicher der Webshop ist.Willst du BTC nur empfangen, oder auch senden?Wenn du nur empfangen willst, ist die sicherste Methode, zB. 10.000 Bitcoin-Adressen offline zu generieren, Backups zu machen, und dann nur die Adressen in der Server-Datenbank zu speichern und an Kunden vergeben.  Der Bitcoin-Client im Server dient dann nur zu Verifizierung von Transaktionen. Er speichert keine wallets. There are situations in which it makes perfect rational sense to play satoshidice.They are rare in real life, but most of us have been in a situation like that one time or another.I'll repost an example I posted to a similar question on reddit:You are traveling in a foreign country and you oversleep your alarm clock. You only have 30 minutes to get to the airport or you will miss your flight home, and your sister's wedding, which is a few hours after your scheduled arrival. You have no cash on you, only 0.9 Bitcoins on your smartphone.There is a shortage of taxis because of a major sporting event. For the same reason, all the ATMs are empty. Still, you are lucky enough to find one of the few taxis still vacant. However, the driver doesn't accept credit cards, only cash or bitcoin. He charges 1 BTC for the trip. He is in a grumpy, take-it-or-leave it kind of mood so bargaining won't work.(1) You can either give up on the taxi, but then your chance of catching the flight is practically 0%.(2) Or you can bet the 0.9 BTC on a quick round of Satoshidice, and that will give you a 90% chance of catching the flight, and not missing your sister's wedding.Which option would you choose? 1 or 2?The worst that can happen is that you lose 0.9 BTC and miss the flight. But isn't it worth taking a chance? It's your sister's wedding after all.Having said that, I doubt that this accounts for most of the volume on satoshi dice. People are just being irrational.tl;dr expected utility != expected monetary gain These algorithms can be substituted for better algorithms in a hard fork.We already have empirical evidence that bitcoin is able to survive a hard fork as long as there is broad consensus about it. If these functions are broken, it's likely that they will be broken gradually and there will be enough time to react.How long is your investment timescale? 30 years? That will work until some ingenious hacker finds a way to get into the back door or some corrupt government employee sells all the private keys to the Russian Mafia, and then you can say goodbye to e-commerce, full stop. It's a stupid idea even for a government. False dichotomy.And no, this has nothing to do with fiat money printing.  This is because the number of users is growing.  If it had anything to do with money printing, the value of bitcoin would rise in concert with the value of other hard assets.  Der Marktplatz ist jetzt schon ein bisschen unübersichtlich.Wäre es nicht besser den Markplatz in Themen aufzuteilen wie im Englischen Forum? Was meint ihr? History doesn't matter.Gold could crash any day just like Bitcoin. There is no shortage of ideas about improving bitcoin. For example:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlisthttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/alt_ideas I was wondering, could homomorphic encryption be used to encrypt the block chain?Wouldn't it allow transactions to be verified without needing to decrypt them first? Or am I missing something?  The difference between bitcoin and and the banking system:Bitcoiners gamble with their own money. Banks gamble with your money.  A tree is a ponzi scheme.  Old branches sucker newer branches into giving them sugar. New branches can only get sugar if they sucker leaves to give it to them.  At the end of summer the whole enterpise collapses, all the leaves die, and all the sugar ends up in the big branches. You can't do a whole lot with a tulip and a most of those dotcom shares were from hyped up companies without any substance. Unlike those examples, Bitcoin does have substance.  It's like somebody just discovered a strange new precious metal that can be teleported and made invisible, and now everybody wants to get their hands on it.If this is a bubble, it will be temporary like the last one. They are safe against small crises. Eg. insured Icesave customers did get bailed out by the UK gov.
Not quite! Minethings has been accepting bitcoin since 2011:www.minethings.comAnyhow, nice to have you here! In some countries governments give people vouchers to spend on private schools, instead of spending the money on public schools.  It seems to work quite well.  We need stricter car control laws. There is no need for a cryptocoin if it's centralized.  Just store the transaction ledger in a government database and be done with it. Yeah, that made me cringe too. To be fair, it's not easy to explain the cryptography behind bitcoin in one short sentence.  He's right. Bitcoin can't be categorized as currency. It can't be categorized as anything. It's a class of its own. A singleton.  1. Wallet verschlüsseln.2. Bitcoin-Klient herunterfahren.3. Backup von wallet.dat machen.4. wallet.dat aus Bitcoin Folder entfernen.5. Klient neu starten ( erzeugt eine neue wallet.dat Datei).6. Schritte 1-5 wiederholen.7. Backups auf verschiedenen Medien speichern.8. BTC auf neue wallets überweisen. If taxing wealth is not an option anymore, governments could always impose a land tax or a "citizen tax".  So no, cryptocurrencies don't mean the end of government. Influence is not the same as control.  They made a recommendation.  The market decided in favor of them. That's it.If Linus Torvalds proposes a Kernel change, and the change gets accepted, and it ends up costing Facebook millions of dollars, can Facebook sue Linus for damages? Of course not. When your cleaning lady is telling you to invest in bitcoin, then you know it's time to cash out.   Agree.Banks are not only in the business of managing money and payments, they are also in the business of managing risk. The market for risk management isn't going to disappear because of bitcoin. Nice "bigger picture" analysis. There are a lot of bitcoin critics who say that exponential growth is always bad. I disagree.Exponential growth could signify a bubble, or it could simply signify a spurt of increased adoption. For someone who dislikes bitcoin so much he sure spends a lot of time and energy on it. Well you can start using ruthenium or iridium as a money.  Physically, there is nothing about gold and silver that makes them more suitable as a store-of-value than ruthenium or iridium.  So how come these lesser-known metals aren't used as a store-of-value?  Network effect. Gold and silver are only money because everyone thinks they are money. Same applies to Bitcoin. That's why competing alt-currencies are going to have an extremely hard time displacing Bitcoin.  I like "network currency"Joe Average doesn't associate "crypto" with cryptography. He associates it with "shady", "secretive", "underground", "cryptic" etc.I think that's why the term was removed from bitcoin.org Technically, it could be argued that bitcoins are "created" collectively by the network and simply "awarded" to the miner, or "found" by the miner, or whatever.But judges tend to care more about what's going in principle, rather than what's going on technically.  So regarding the the FinCEN statement, I think that this is the more legally pertinent question.This is how I would argue that an individual miner is not the creator of "her/his" coinbase currency units, not even in principle:*Can an individual miner decide how many coins are created? No.*Can an individual miner decide whether his/her discovered block makes it into the longest chain? No. Though this is likely, it's not guaranteed.*Can an individual miner decide whether his/her discovered block makes it into the consensus chain? No.*Are miners, individually or collectively, responsible for choosing the consensus chain? No.*Can an individual miner create currency units by solving a block but not publishing it? No.*What if a miner solves a block, but a third party publishes it? Who is the creator? The solver or the publisher?*At what moment does a "currency unit" come into existence? At the moment of the coinbase transaction? Or only 120 blocks later?*If it only comes into existence 120 blocks later, can the miner still be considered the sole "creator"?  Didn't the collective effort of other miners also contribute to "creation"?Discuss.  Theoretisches Beispiel:Ein Miner entscheidet, seine Coinbase-Transaktion von 25 BTC auf 100 BTC zu erhöhen.  Aus welchem Grund auch immer stimmt die Mehrheit der anderen Miner zu und nimmt diesen Block in die längste Kette auf.   Eine Minderheit der Miner betrachtet diese Kette aber als ungültig, und es entsteht ein Fork. Was wäre das Resultat? Welchen Fork würden die meisten Bitcoin-Händler als Bezahlung akzeptieren?  Welchen Fork würden die meisten User als Auszahlung verlangen? Den längsten Fork, oder den Fork ohne den Konsens-Bruch?Die Miner im Mehrheits-Fork würden bald herausfinden, dass kaum jemand ihre Version von Bitcoin akzeptiert, und der Wert ihrer Bitcoins würde schnell gegen Null sinken.  Dann würden sie wieder zum anderen Fork umsteigen.Dieses Bespiel zeigt, dass die Händler und Benutzer sehr wohl über die die Gültigkeit von Coinbase-Transaktionen mitentscheiden, nicht nur die Miner. Stimme zu. Aber mein Punkt ist dass Miner eben nicht für die Endmontage vom Bitcoins zuständig sind.  Die Endmontage geschieht erst durch den Netzwerk-Konsens.  Erst 120 Blöcke nach der Coinbase-Transaktion ist ein Bitcoin ein fertiges Produkt.Der Miner ist Magna, Mercedes sind wir alle.  Mein Argument gilt nicht nur technisch sondern auch prinzipiell.  Warum? Weil ein Miner keine Kontrolle darüber hat, ob ein gelöster und veröffentlichter Block tatsächlich in der Konsens-Blockkette aufgenommen wird. So steht es aber in den release notes:Ja, genau das würde passieren! Aber Bitcoin-Qt ist ohnehin nicht für Smartphones gedacht.Wenn du die gleiche Wallet am Smartphone verwenden willst, kopierst du nicht die ganze wallet Datei hinüber, sondern du exportierst die Private Key und importierst die dann im Thin Client. Miner erzeugen keine Bitcoins. Bitcoins werden kollektiv "erzeugt". Miner sichern lediglich das Netzwerk und werden dafür belohnt.  Sie bekommen frisch erzeugte Bitcoins  vom Netzwerk! Das Erzeugen vom Bitcoins ist in komplexer Prozess mit mehreren technischen Schritten.   Es kann keinen individuellen technischen Schritt zugeschrieben werden.  Die Miner sind fur einige Schritte verantwortlich, der Netzwerk-Konsens für andere.Zu behaupten, dass Miner Bitcoins erzeugen ist so, als würde man behaupten dass ein Papierfabrikant, der die Notenpresse beliefert, Euros erzeugt.
Objects called bitcoins don't even exist in the protocol, so words like "created", "found", "issued", etc. are nothing but metaphors anyhow.Metaphorically, I would agree that bitcoins are created but not by the miner alone. They are created by the collective effort of the network.As a miner, how would I prove this in court? Easy. In order to "create" bitcoins, it isn't sufficient to find and publish a block. Even then, that block could still be orphaned. "Creation" is only complete once that block has been accepted into the consensus chain. That final step of "creation" is outside my control. That's not how the legal system works. You can't get away with selling cocaine by calling it "sugar" or whatever. You can't even get away with selling cocaine by slightly modifying the molecule so it's not actually cocaine anymore, but still has some of the original effects.If they ban bitcoins (which I think is unlikely), you can be certain that they will phrase the law in such an overreaching way that ALL bitcoin-like systems are banned.However, such a law would need to be so overreaching that most tech-minded people would probably just ignore it.  A similar thing happened with overreaching laws banning cryptography back in the early days of the internet. Ein Wörterbuchattack ist sehr schwierig, weil der Bitcoin-Qt Klient mehrfach-Hashing betreibt. Die Anzahl der Runden wird auf die CPU-Leistung angepasst, so dass in der Regel jeder Versuch eine Sekunde dauert. Der Benutzer muss also eine sehr spezifische Idee haben, was sein Passwort ungefähr sein könnte.  Sonst hat er mit Brute Forcing keine Chance. Dear Saver:The Euro is an experimental currency.  Use at your own risk.  Don't invest more into the Euro than you can afford to lose. We don't want to encourage "investing,risking, and consuming" for their own sake.We don't want to discourage "hording and saving" for their own sake.We want to encourage productivity.For optimum productivity you need a balance of BOTH saving and investing/consuming. Artificial inflation distorts that balance towards malinvestment, taking stupid risks, and wasteful consumption. O RetroShare é mais resistente à censura que um fórum na www. É descentralizado como Bitcoin.Só que é um pouco difícil manter a massa crítica.http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/ This 1% GDP figure includes both the cost of friction and the cost of insurance. Effectively, most credit card payments come with a mandatory insurance and escrow service. I suspect that those kinds of features make up the bulk of the 1% figure.Bitcoin can make a huge difference to the cost of friction.  Insurance costs are harder to reduce, but even here Bitcoin can help.  By giving people choice on how much insurance they want for each individual transaction, people can eliminate insurance costs from transactions where insurance is not needed. eg. small face-to-face purchases.  More choice will also reduce the "moral hazard" behavior that credit cards encourage at the moment with their flat-rate monopoly insurance fees.   People will be more careful about using their credit card on questionable websites, etc.  This will reduce insurance costs across the board. I think that bitcoin has reached a metastable state. It's a bit like an aerogel. Permanently frozen bubbles. "Full nodes" are not needed in the sense that Bitcoin could still function without them.  However, they are beneficial to all users of Bitcoin because they make the network more resilient against certain types of attack.   That's like saying that a public park is private property of the construction company who was commissioned to build it.A block does NOT behave like a private good.  It behaves like a common good.  It needs to be stored, at a cost, by ALL miners and ALL full nodes for all eternity. Not just by the original miner. Otherwise it is completely useless to the buyer. Ok, let me be more precise:Hashrate is a public goodBlock space is common goodBoth goods are vital to bitcoin's survival and both are currently financed by the same fee.  Finding the "correct price" of those types of goods is not a trivial task.[edit:] Even less trivial for bitcoin, because in the current implementation, both prices are coupled. What is the "correct price" for hashrate might not be the "correct price" for block space and vice versa. You are aware that price discovery does not work with public goods? Sippenhaftung?[edit:] Nein, war anscheinend nur ein Fehler der Bank. Mit Bitcoin wäre aber sein Vermögen menschlichen Fehlern nicht hilflos ausgeliefert.  Mit der Ausnahme von seinen eigenen Fehlern natürlich.   One of the most hilarious non-sequiturs I've read in an article about bitcoin. They are not even bothering to finish the sentence before changing the topic by 180 degrees. The problem with tying your wealth to private keys is that non-geeks (and even some geeks) are inevitably going to lose them, or expose them by accident.Tying your wealth to your real identity would be more secure and more user friendly, but it would sacrifice privacy.I'm not sure how this could be done in bitcoin, but here is an idea:You could create a special multisig transaction that needs to have 20-of-100 signatures before you can spend it. Then you choose 100 family and friends and give each of them a private key. So before you can spend your coins, 20 of your friends need to "tell" the bitcoin system that address X really belongs to you and hasn't been compromised. Don't panic. Unconfirmed only means the transaction hasn't made it into a block yet.  In practice, this means that the recipient has received the money but has to wait for confirmation in order to spend it safely.  Sometimes it might take an hour or two for confirmation. Yeah, that's really persuasive. MPOE-PR:Irrespective of them being idiots or not, the bitcoin devs owe nothing to you.Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. If you feel strongly that something needs to be done urgently, then start a Kickstarter campaign to hire a team of "real" developers to clean up the code and write a specification. Bitcoin has fewer bugs than most professional software I've used. Centralized exchanges are only a temporary fix. Once Ripple and other p2p exchange mechanisms gain popularity, it will be impossible to enforce trading hours.  If I want to trade with a friend of a friend at 3am on Christmas eve, and there is no central authority executing our trades, who is going to stop us? 
I'm kind of glad this happened. Firstly, it's better now than 3-5 years from now. We want evolutionary pressure that gradually leads to a battle hardened Bitcoin, but we don't want extinction events.Secondly, it illustrates an important principle of Bitcoin in practice:Social convention trumps technical conventionThe implications are that even if a fatal protocol flaw is discovered in future, and even if there is a 51% attack, people will not lose their bitcoins, as long as the community reaches consensus on how to change the rules. So if I understand correctly, the secure way of doing this is as follows:1. Create transaction2. Store signed transaction in a safe place3. Store receiving wallet in a safe place4. Delete private keys for sending addresses. Or empty the whole sending wallet and delete it. If anywhere this should be solved at the protocol level, not at the social level. The bitcoin system should be completely agnostic about the intention of a transaction.  All it should be concerned about is the total cost of a transaction, both to the miners and relay nodes.If people start using patched clients to block transactions based on perceived intentions, we are going to get into a huge mess.  Players like Satoshidice are going to start obfuscating their intentions, resulting in arms race, and before long there will be collateral damage, and innocent people who's transactions look like their intention is X,Y and Z are going to have them blocked.It's going to be a bit like the old financial system. After some players misbehaved, government introduced rules like 'trading X with the intention to speculate is prohibited'.  Of course, this didn't stop traders from speculating, it just encouraged them to repackage their financial instruments to make it look like it's not speculation.  These intention-based rules only make the financial system more complex, less transparent, less fair, and less stable.  We really don't want to do the same to Bitcoin. Let's keep it simple please! The fact is, commerce is not the only kind of transaction that happens between human beings.  Just because you engage in non-commerce transactions doesn't mean you are a Marxist. In a community, a consensus would eventually emerge as to what counts as a favor. There are equilibrating forces at work:  If you refuse to do favors because you think your friends are asking for things that are 'more than a favor', two things can happen: (1) You convince your friends to be more reasonable with their requests for favors. (2) Your friends think you are anti-social and stop doing favors for you. This would make your favor credits unspendable too,  and encourage you to be more generous with your favors.The lack of fungibility of the FAV can actually be an advantage over 'objective' measures such as HRS. If you spend 1 hour mowing the lawn for your 90-year-old grandmother, you would not expect her to do the same in return. You would be happy if she made you a cup of tea in return, as would your social circle. The FAV isn't so much a currency as a way of formalizing and recording reciprocity within a group of mutual friends.  'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' works with the FAV but not with the HRS.I'm just not sure if a Ripple-like system is best suited for this. Your argument makes no sense to me.If the price fluctuations are caused by professional 'pump-and-dump teams', what would prevent those teams from spreading their pump-and-dump strategy across several decentralized exchanges, if mtgox were not available to them? Taking out a loan with the intent to file bankruptcy is fraud. Not to mention that it is unethical even from a libertarian viewpoint. If something like this happened, I would invoke Occam's Razor, as would no doubt any investor with a brain:Which is more likely?1) That a lone hacker managed to to something that hundreds of cryptographers around the world haven't managed in a decade of cryptanalysis. 2) That the private keys are leaking in some way that the victims didn't think of (eg. zero-day exploit in wireless card)3) That the whole thing is a scam. Bitcoin's rise is NOT 'inevitable'.  There is still a 30% chance of Bitcoin failing in my opinion. There are a lot of things that can still feasibly go wrong, and probably whole lot of other things that nobody has even thought of.   Note of them would kill Bitcoin completely, but they would condemn Bitcoin as a niche currency trading at single figures.    Niemand weiß ob es eine Blase ist.Auch wenn Bitcoin ein reiner Vermögens-Parkplatz bleibt, muss es nicht zwingend zur Blasenbildung kommen.  Wenn Aussteiger und Einsteiger sich im Gleichgewicht halten, kann der Kurs durchaus für immer stabil bleiben.  Aussteiger wird es immer geben. Neue Einsteiger wird es auch immer geben weil die Geburtenrate >0 ist.Siehe:http://gavinthink.blogspot.nl/2012/07/is-store-of-value-enough.html  Looks like that site has a following of 'doomsday preppers', spilled over from various peak oil forums. They are basically a religious cult and one of their dogmas is that all technology invented after 1800 is BAD and must be avoided.   Arguing with these people is as pointless as arguing with a concrete wall. Google sign-in isn't for everyone, but for small websites run by people in their spare time it can save a lot of hassle. There should be something like google sign-in for wallet management too.  At the moment, if you want to run a theft-proof bitcoin website you basically need to be a security guru.  That creates a big barrier to entry and excludes a lot of mom-and-pop web businesses from the Bitcoin economy. You don't measure it. The favor is already an irreducible "fundamental unit" in terms of which other things are measured.If you and your Ripple friend mutually agree that it is a favor, then it is a favor!  If you don't come to an agreement, then it is not a favor! Simple as that. Whether it takes 5 seconds or a whole day is irrelevant. That's not the case in Germany anymore since the Postbank was privatized.  There are reports about members of the above groups being refused bank accounts by banks.   I'm not sure what the situation is in Italy and Spain where similar cash bans have been introduced. Ah. Looks like the order has been filled already.  I no longer own molecular IUOs. That went fast! Ok, I'm intrigued by this BTC/BTC trading thing so let's have a go:  I've created an offer selling 0.01 'molecular BTC' for 0.0096 'bitstamp BTC'.  (No offense, molecular!)molecular: rpH3zuMch2GrrYX724xGWwbMGwiQ5RbSAUbitstamp: rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59BAny takers?You should see the offer if you choose bitstamp as the base currency issuer and molecular as counter currency issuer. I wonder, if other European countries follow suit and keep reducing the limit, what is going to happen to people who are unable to open a bank account (eg. foreign students, day laborers, homeless people, minors, refugees, people who have declared bankruptcy,...) ?Are they going to be criminals by default? Are they expected to live without using money? That would be appalling. If the government forces people to use banks then the least it can do is to force banks to open a bank account for anyone who asks. True. But my idea is to use the time lock as an additional security feature on top of already existing security features, such as offline wallets and multisig.Instead of using time locks that expire on a fixed date, I would suggest using 'ratchet' time locks where the expiry date can be postponed indefinitely by the owner of the address. If draconian laws were imposed on the bitcoin protocol, in violation of community consensus, the result would almost certainly be a fork.  Then there would be 2 bitcoins:  heavily regulated Bitcoin1, accepted by government-sanctioned businesses, and decentralized Bitcoin2, rejected by government-sanctioned businesses but accepted by system D businesses and dissenting users.Joe Average would probably end up using both: Bitcoin1 for paying his utility bills and Bitcoin2 for getting a haircut.If the rules got too draconian for Bitcoin1, eg. if there was a 50% tax on every Bitcoin1 transaction, people would abandon Bitcoin1 en masse, move their savings in Bitcoin2, and only use Bitcoin1 when absolutely necessary.Then government would have to start subverting Bitcoin2, causing it to fork into Bitcoin3 and Bitcoin4.  And so on. Many workplaces also prohibit inserting unapproved USB drives into your work computer because they are afraid of malware and data theft.In that case, your only option is to generate the signature on your portable device and type it into your work computer by hand.  Probably much easier just to send bitcoins from your private smartphone.  Or are workplaces jamming phones now too?  
A frozen address with time-activated release would be far more secure than an offline address. The requirement to 'keep a private key secret' makes security depend on humans, and humans are fallible.  Best to outsource security to the protocol as much as possible.I can see lots of real world scenarios where a time-locked address would be useful and an offline address isn't good enough:(1) A large 'bank' or exchange that has billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in cold storage. Even if the bank assigns multiple signatories to spend those bitcoins, they could be kidnapped and forced to disclose the private key.(2) A famous rich person who is publicly known to own a lot of bitcoins.  Again, the frozen wallet would discourage kidnappers.(3) A problem gambler who wants to keep his retirement fund safe from himself.(4) A single parent who has terminal cancer and greedy relatives, and who wants to leave his bitcoins to his 13-year old child.(5) A bitcoin enthusiast who lives under a tyrannical regime and fears that the authorities might imprison and torture him in order to obtain his bitcoins.As bitcoin gains in value and maturity, these kinds of examples are going to gain relevance.  Why should people return to silver and gold when there is a far superior alternative? Psychologically, this is an important milestone. It marks the end of the 2011 bubble and the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Bitcoin. The only difference between quantum cryptography and classical cryptography is that quantum cryptography is (allegedly) provably unbreakable and classical cryptography just hard to break.However, quantum cryptography doesn't solve the fundamental problems discussed in the OP: Knowing who to trust and hiding your private keys. I think that 'Post-Crypto' in the context of this talk doesn't mean abolishing crypto entirely, but rather to stop relying on crypto for certain tasks.Private keys are only effective if they are stored in private places, but on the internet nothing is truly private because every system has holes and leaks.  Crypto alone can't be used to create the private places that it relies on, so we need something else, like Trusted Computing, to do that job.  I think that's the gist of it.  Even better:CoVar(txfee*priority)Priority is already used by the protocol. It's defined as:priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytesGiving a higher priority transaction a bigger weight makes sense intuitively, since we already use priority as a criterion for excluding certain transactions. Strength in Numbers OK, auf meiner Trust-Liste steht jetzt, dass molecular mir 0.01 BTC schuldet, und dass ich 0.01 BTC an yossarian schulde. Mein Kontostand ist also wieder Null.Was geschieht jetzt, wenn yossarian meinen Schuldschein weiterverkauft?  Findet der irgendwann den Weg zu molecular zurück? Verschwinden dann die roten und grünen Barren auf meiner Liste oder muss ich die Schulden irgendwann manuell eintreiben/zurückbezahlen? Meine Ripple-Adresse lautet: rG8VFQPaJB2gNjx29Et1wKUJettQP1eLmkBin auch am Herumspielen. Ich habe schon 0.01 blockchainBTC gegen 0.01 rippleBTC getauscht, via Benutzer: molecular.  Wenn du Lust hast, können wir den Gegentausch versuchen und sehen was passiert.  Bin gespannt ob es funktioniert selbst wenn du nicht mit molecular verbunden bist. Satoshi's opinion would help the community to decide, not because he is more competent than the current core developers, not because he is an authority figure but because it would reassure investor confidence.People invested in bitcoin because they expected bitcoin to behave in a certain way in future.  In some cases, this expectation was based on the assumption that there is an implicit contract or consensus that the protocol is set in stone (a flawed assumption perhaps).   In other cases, this expectation was based on Satoshi's word. Satoshi's opinion matters simply because many investors/stakeholders think it matters.  To me, it looks like it is both a commercial and community project.  Is that a paradox? Not necessarily. It looks like the pre-mined pre-issued XRP are a way for the developers/founders to monetize their work.  That's fair enough in my opinion, even though they overdid it by keeping such a large share.I too would have preferred a "pure" community project, but the commercial element won't stop me from using Ripple. I'm happy that someone is working hard at making this idea happen.  At least the XRP pre-issuing is giving the developers a motivation to keep working at it.  I prefer an imperfect Ripple that actually happens in the real world than a perfect, idealistic Ripple that languishes as an idea on a mailing list for 10 years.  All this discussion about the XRP price is petty.  Speculators are gonna speculate.  There isn't much anyone can do about that in a free market, not even the Ripple founders.  Who cares if there is hoarding of XRP? Who cares if there are XRP bubbles?It terms of Ripple functionality, none of that matters. Neither does it matter that a single entity holds 80% of XRP.  That does not make them a "central bank".  Even if OpenCoin held 99% of XRP, once Ripple transitions to a community project, this will not allow them to "buy" consensus or to block certain transactions.  Maybe they can manipulate or crash the XRP market. Who cares? That will only affect people who transact in XRP, not those who transact in other currencies.  And the ability to transact in arbitrary currencies is the main selling point of Ripple. The XRP are just an auxiliary tool.  The problem I see with trusting too many people is that ripple money will seek the "path of least resistance".If you grant trust to hundreds of people, all it takes is for one of those accounts to be hacked,  and some anonymous hacker ends up owing money to you instead of the person you trust.These might be concerns for the future, but right now, we need to start somewhere. In order use/test the full functionality of Ripple I need a minimal web of trust. I don't mind losing a few bitcents just for the entertainment and educational value.The reason I am only granting BTC is that they are easy to collect both in meatspace and outside.  Ok. So far, I've granted trust to:bbitSeverianPeter LambertlebingBelkaarMelbustusgweedophelixkokojieMageantherzmeisterribuckAlexNetomoleculargrondiluI granted tiny BTC amounts for testing purposes.  I'll keep it tiny until I figure out how exactly Ripple works.I'd be very grateful if some of you reciprocated, so that I can play around with finding paths etc.Me: rG8VFQPaJB2gNjx29Et1wKUJettQP1eLmk Received ripple BTC and sent blockchain BTC! molecular: will you send me 0.01 Ripple BTC if I send you 0.01 Block Chain BTC?I am:rG8VFQPaJB2gNjx29Et1wKUJettQP1eLmk Here's mine:rG8VFQPaJB2gNjx29Et1wKUJettQP1eLmk[edit]: Trusted molecular for 0.1 BTC Nobody ever got rich through hard work alone.  Making money is all about controlling capital. Money is poorly correlated with work.  Why does a quantitative analyst earn 10 times the salary of a physics professor, even when they have similar skills, and even when a physics professor's job is 10 times more intellectually demanding? It's because the quantitative analyst controls a huge amount of capital and the physics professor almost none.  It has always been like this, but this generation is more aware of it. If you have a friend who makes easy money in finance, real estate, or whatever the next bubble is going to be, then you are going to think, why should I bother working my ass off as a teacher so that I can save $200 a month?  I want to have a good life too. Fuck the future.The fact that savers are being punished by governments and debtors rewarded aggravates the situation even more.    Then use a VPN instead of Tor.  In the age of data retention, not using a VPN for all your internet activity is like handing over your privacy on a plate.  They are not that expensive anymore and they are easy to use. There is no excuse not to! Blockchain.info only shows which IP address relayed the transaction. This is not proof that the transaction originated from that IP address.I suggest you hook up your full node to Tor. That way you will relay random transactions from the inside the Tor network, in addition to your own transactions. This will give you plausible deniability, because it will be impossible for an external observer to distinguish your transactions from random Tor users'.   We should be very careful about the hard fork, but we shouldn't be paralyzed by fear either. One could equally argue that NOT upgrading is playing with peoples' lives.  Nobody knows what's going to happen.I am still undecided on this issue, but I doubt that a conservative hard fork will trigger panic selling. Eg. increasing the limit from 1 MiB to 10 MiB, as sugessted by Peter Wuille, will bring benefits of a higher transaction rate while still allowing normal users to run a full node.  Investors understand this.   The switch doesn't need to be catastrophic. It can be announced 6 months in advance and it can be done in a way that it only happens once 99% of users have upgraded to the new client already.As for people putting their life savings into bitcoin, well, they have been repeatedly warned against this by Gavin and other community members, and you can't really blame the developers if people invest money that they can't afford to lose.
rG8VFQPaJB2gNjx29Et1wKUJettQP1eLmk Moore's Law predicts the performance of a single CPU.  In terms of bitcoin scalability, it doesn't matter how fast a single CPU  will be 10 years' form now.  Rather, the crucial measure is cost per CPU calculation.  Transistors may be reaching physical limits, but in terms of producing CPUs more cheaply (and thus in greater quantity), and in terms of energy efficiency, there are still many orders of magnitude of growth potential. There is no reason why a bitcoin node can't run on a multiprocessor machine. Technically, it's feasible. This is how it could be done: Create a non-standard "vote transaction" that sends 0 bitcoins and stores a vote in the script.  Every X blocks, the protocol mandates that the block size changes according to all vote transactions since the last change, ignoring duplicates.  Votes are weighed according to how many bitcoins are stored in the vote transactions' inputs. If the majority of users, including large bitcoin businesses, use a hard-forked client with above rules, the miners would be forced to accept them.  Yes, what is included in a block is up to miners, but whether that block gets rejected by the users' clients is NOT up to them.  So politically, it's feasible too. Why miner-voted as opposed to stakeholder-voted? Ideally there should be something like a storage fee in addition to the transaction fee. The storage fee should not go to the miners.  Ideally, it should be paid out to people who donate bandwidth, CPU and hard disk space by running a full node.  However this might not be practicable since there is no simple, objective proof-of-propagation and proof-of-storage like there is proof-of-work.  Alternatively, the storage fee could be paid to the stakeholders according to proof-of-stake, which is objective. For this to work, the only important thing is that the fee doesn't go to the miners.This would require major changes to the protocol, so it's not going to happen fast.  In the short and medium term, we need a stopgap solution. If it's dynamic, it must depend on total transaction fees paid, or difficulty, or both.  It must not depend on number of transactions or size of transactions.  I'm unhappy with either future.Intuitively, a block size limit of 1MB seems wrong, but allowing blocks of arbitrary size seems wrong too. I don't think this needs to be a dilemma. I think we can have it both ways: A network that handles thousands of transactions per section AND where a normal user can still contribute towards storing the blockchain.Whether this will require blockchain pruning, swarm nodes, storage fees, or some other solution, I don't know, but in either case it's a major project that will take years to implement.In the meantime, we need a stopgap solution, and the limit needs to be increased to some new value X. I trust the developers to decide what that X should be. Even if you don't run a full node, you can still exert you sovereignty to some extent by refusing to accept transactions that don't agree with your rules.  If you are a major bitcoin business such as Mtgox, this alone will exert considerable pressure on the rest of the community to run full nodes that agree with your rules. Am I still helping if I run Bitcoin 0.8 behind Tor (not as a hidden service)? What's with the yoga pose? Between all the people on Earth? Who would administer such a bureaucratic nightmare? Who would pay for it? How would you prevent fraud and corruption (eg. people creating multiple identities in order to claim multiple shares)? How would you achieve this without a central authority? How would deliver the bitcoins to the 1.4 Billion people on Earth who don't have electricity, let alone an internet connection?Even if this mammoth project was ever achieved, the "equal" distribution wouldn't last long.  A similar idea has been attempted after the fall of the Soviet Union.  It terms of achieving a sustained equality, it failed miserably.  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization_in_RussiaThe aim of bitcoin isn't "fairness", the aim is a resilient decentralized payment system. Whoever contributes to security gets rewarded, simple as that.  Gewiefte Daytrader sind oft in der Lage, versuchte Marktmanipulation von anderen Tradern zum eigenen Vorteil zu nutzen.Das Fehlen einer Börsenaufsicht ist also nicht zwingend ein Nachteil, zumindest nicht aus der Sicht eines Daytraders. Nice work. Amazing speed. Reindexing took only ~ 1 hour on win7x64/Intel i7-2600. Large organizations are terrible at keeping secrets. Even clever people make stupid mistakes from time to time. Even patriots defect from time to time.Relying on secrecy in order to stay ahead in security is a bad strategy.  The more experts you recruit into your research team, the higher the risk of leaks.  All it takes is one rogue employee in 100. The fewer experts you recruit, the less competitive you become compared to the worldwide open research community in academia.  Either way you lose.Also, how can the NSA be certain that the Russians or Chinese haven't independently discovered the same "secrets"? It makes much more sense for the NSA to base security on openness rather than secrecy, because openness creates predictable security. Stolen cars are difficult to hide, risky to transport, and must be dismantled by a trained mechanic before they can be sold as spare parts.Not a lot of people walk around with necklaces worth $10 Million, and the few who do are usually in the company of bodyguards.Kidnapping for ransom is high risk operation that often ends badly for the kidnapper.  Express kidnapping isn't, which is why it's so common in some Latin American countries.  A bitcoin owner is the ideal victim for express kidnappings.That's why wealthy people don't keep kilograms of gold bars inside their home. I agree that right now, it's a bit premature to worry about violent gangs coming after your bitcoins.  However, if bitcoin ever reaches prices of $1000+, the concerns of the OP are valid. Bitcoins are easier to steal than cars or jewellery, even if stored physically.Simple offline wallets alone won't be secure enough.  Additional features, such as multiple signatories and mandatory lock times for withdrawals will be required.  see:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts Whether I own $ 10 Million or 9 Million worth of bitcoin 5 years from now, makes no difference to my well being whatsoever.An extra $1000 to spend right now does make a big difference to my well being. Therefore, it's perfectly rational to sell or spend a fraction of my bitcoin savings right now, especially when there is still a 50% chance that bitcoin will be worthless in 5 years.It's called the falling marginal utility of money. If you think this is a bubble, and if you have bitcoin savings, the rational thing to do would be to sell part of your bitcoins on the way up, and buy them back once the bubble pops.That would help to dampen the bubble. By "calling yourself out" you are neither helping yourself nor the bitcoin economy. Politische Meinungsäußerungen, auch von der extremen Sorte, sind in diesem Forum erlaubt, solange niemand beschimpft, bedroht, oder arg beleidigt wird.

That is a very simplistic statement. The real world doesn't always function like a capitalist cartoon. I don't actually think that competition (from other cryptocurrencies) is healthy for bitcoin during the embryonic stage of the project.  Here is why: There is a limited number of people in the world who are able to donate their time and energy to grow the bitcoin project, AND who are believers in cryptocurrencies.   If we have several competing cryptocurrencies, some of the talented people working on bitcoin right now will be diverted to alt-currencies.  This will increase the risk of ALL cryptocurrencies failing, for example through an attack by a bitcoin enemy.We are more likely to succeed if we all pull in the same direction. Once bitcoin becomes widely adopted, by all means, bring on the competition. But right now, this community is still too small, bitcoin is still too vulnerable, to be able to afford divisiveness. How exactly would you enforce this in a decentralized project?  Force every new user to send a copy of their passport to Gavin, before they can be assigned a bitcoin address? Right now, bitcoin gives you the choice between making transactions (pseudo-)anonymously and publicly.  People have different uses for bitcoin. Some value anonymity, some value the benifits of green addresses.  How you can think that talking away that choice would make bitcoin more useful, is beyond me. There is no objective way to distinguish cybersquatting from the "legitimate" use of a domain name.  Any system that tries to prevent cybersquatting is going to need some human judge to decide whether cybersquatting is taking place or not.  Bringing back a human authority makes the system corruptible, and negates the reason that systems like bitcoin and namecoin were invented in the first place.  In other words, there is no solution for the cybersqatting "problem". It's just something a system like namecoin has to learn to live with, just like bitcoin has to learn to live with thieves who exploit the carelessness of some users and the irreversible nature of transactions.Mitigating measures have been suggested, such as introducing regular forced auctions of domain names into the protocol, but this would create other problems.  For example, the US government could simply snatch wikileaks.bit from wikileaks by bidding millions of dollars for the domain name, once it is force-auctioned.Having said that, I think that if namecoin ever becomes popular, there will be fewer idle domain names than at present, because there will be systems for cybersquatters to rent out their domain names, in effect becoming their own registrars.   There is no ecomomic incentive to keep a sought-after domain name idle.   Ich rate dir ab, Paypal fuer Bitcoins zu akzeptieren. Ich habe vor einiger Zeit Bitcoins auf Ebay verkauft, und solange ich Paypal akzeptierte hatte ich eine Menge Ärger mit Dieben, die versucht haben, via gehackten Ebay-Konten meine Bitcoins zu klauen.Am besten nur Banküberweisung akzeptieren, und verlangen, dass der Name des Bankkontos mit dem Name auf der Lieferadresse übereinstimmt.  Eine 48-Stündige Wartezeit vor Überweisung der Bitcoins ist auch eine gute Idee, weil sich die meisten Opfer von gehackten Konten in dieser Zeit melden. Niemand kann den Kurs vorhersagen. Ob es sich lohnt jetzt zu investieren hängt von deiner Risikobereitschaft ab.  Bitcoin ist immer noch eine Experimetalwährung.So ca. 500-1000 EUR "Spielgeld" würde ich persönlich als Newbie sofort investieren, aber nur wenn ich mir leisten könnte, dieses Geld zu verlieren.  Wie gesagt  nur meine persönliche Meinung. Jeder hat eine andere Risikobereitschaft.Wenn du die Kursschwankungen ausgleichen willst, kannst du es mit Cost Averaging versuchen, also statt 500 EUR auf einmal, 1 Jahr lang jede Woche um 10 EUR Bitcoins kaufen. Das ist auf jedem Fall eine bessere Investition als jede Woche einen LottoSchein um 10 EUR zu kaufen.    Humans are really bad at remembering phrases and numbers.  Even a seemingly easy to remember phrase like "category platypus ennui toast" will not last more than 3-6 months in most peoples' long term memory, unless they rehearse it regularly.  Most regular bitcoin users are too busy/lazy to keep rehearsing their passphrases.  Also, rehearsal can accumulate errors over the years and overwrite the original memory, so to be safe you would have to write down the passphrase to remind yourself once in a while, which defeats the whole point of a brain wallet.Humans are good at remembering images, however.Instead of memorizing phrases, I would recommend employing your visual memory, for example like this: Go for a jog/walk/bike ride along a particular route once a week, for a period of 6 months. Then use the GPS coordinates of certain key points along the route as your passphrase. Even if you forget the coordinates, you are unlikely to forget the locations, and you can always look them up on a map.Implicit memory is even more reliable than visual memory.Though time consuming, this is probably the most secure way to set up a brain wallet:http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/133067-unbreakable-crypto-store-a-30-character-password-in-your-brains-subconscious-memory Exports aren't needed if you're big. The smaller the country, the less stuff it can make on its own, the more it needs to import. In the long term, imports must balance exports.  A country that imports more than it exports is not sustainable.Thus, even small rich countries such as Norway are heavily reliant on exports. I would also recommend the Electrum client for a newbie.In theory, Electrum is not as secure as the original client, but unless you are dealing with volumes in the thousands of bitcoins, Electrum is absolutely good enough.However, I would avoid web wallets for anything more than 10 bitcoins. The business has changed owner twice since the days of selling cards. The software has been rewritten from scratch. The brand name, and a handful of original customers from back in 2010, is all that remains. Yes, I have.  My last SEPA withdrawal took 3 days.I doubt mtgox is out of money.   I have often had problems with delays with them, but I always received my money eventually. My guess is that they are overwhelmed by the bureaucratic burden of running a large bitcoin exchange.  My problem:I accidentally deleted a number of files using the rm command on an eCryptfs-encrypted Ubuntu laptop.After cloning the laptop HD using Clonezilla, I mounted it on a virtual machine and scanned it using extundelete.Extundete WAS able to recover some files and directories in my home directory (where I deleted the original files). However, I don't know how to decrypt them.The files and directories are located in  /home/.ecryptfs/myusername/.Private and have names like: ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWY..eji-ZXkFURR9uWEBwMcCU.iQiwLKedbxBNrycVOxcA.uMuYBD-bB---The aim is to recover as much as possible, but the criterion for awarding the 10 BTC will be the recovery of at least one unencrypted version of a file contained in the data above.  I can provide my ecrypfs password, and the original cloned HD if required.    Because this is sensitive data, the offer is for trusted forum members only. Great speech, Amir! TC doesn't require physical access to the server. Your RS232 solution does.  Apart from being more costly than using a dedicated hosting service, this simply isn't practicable for a lot of bitcoin entrepreneurs, eg. those with a nomadic lifestyle.  Where is Zhou Tong going set up this machine? In his student dorm? Beim Original-Client ist der Private Key Import in der GUI noch nicht implementiert. Private Keys koennen aber ueber die Kommandozeile importiert werden:Code:bitcoind importprivkey <bitcoinprivkey>bitcoind ruft die Kommandozeilenversion vom Client auf:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BitcoindHier die Liste aller Befehle:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list Den Bedarf, grosse Datenmengen zu speichern, wird es glaube ich schon geben.  Wie die Massenanwendungen in 10 Jahren aussehen werden, ist schwer vorherzusagen. Allein im Videobereich wird es zB. einige Neurungen geben.  Ein 2-Stündiger 4K HDR  Film kommt da schon locker auf 200 Gigabyte.   Da gibt es zB. heute schon Leute, die ihr gesamtes Leben mit Videobrillen filmen, 20 Stunden am Tag, 7 Tage die Woche.  Nicht, weil sie sich das ganze irgendwann ansehen werden, sondern weil das resultierende Videoarchiv mittels Bilderkennung durchsucht werden kann (Wie heisst das Restaurant in Paris wo ich vor 10 Jahren mit meinem Onkel gegessen habe?). Ob die Datenflut in 10 Jahren hauptsächlich lokal oder in der Cloud gespeichert wird, ist eine andere Frage.  How can you be sure this is not a red herring?  I don't see how 1PFgAJWLJZGSaVDg2rX3XDfTcyd6CpLdS6 more difficult to copy and paste than IBAN: DE46520400210277281204; BIC: COBADEFF520. It's not an either-or.  100% of all Bitcoins in existence are saved all the time.   100% of all USD in existence are saved all the time.  The only difference is how fast they change the hands of savers.There is no such thing as an arbitrary t="amount of time bitcoins stay in your wallet", below which it's magically not saving anymore. A currency that isn't saved is a currency where t=0 which is clearly impossible.You could argue that the rate at which money changes hands is lower for BTC, but I don't see why that is a bad thing.Bitcoin doesn't subsidize (long term) saving, all it does is not penalize it. Everyone has their own utility for deferred consumption. Inflation distorts this and takes away people's choice to defer consumption.  Less choice = everyone is worse off. Bei 2000 Transaktionen pro Sekunde (VISA-Niveau) würde die Blockchain ca. 50 Terabyte pro Jahr wachsen:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ScalabilityWenn Bitcoin wirklich VISA-Ausmaße erreicht, dann können bald nur Datenzentren und Supernodes die gesamte, nicht gestutzte Blockchain speichern.  Allerdings: Ausgehend vom Moorschen Gesetz für Festplatten, würde eine Verbraucher-Festplatte irgendwann zwischen 2025 und 2030 wieder mit der Blockchain aufholen (500-1000 Terabyte). That is not only a good strategy for speculators, but also for savers, esp. early adopters, who want to realize a fraction of their bitcoin investment but are not in a particular hurry.Instead of selling off an entire tranche of BTC at once, you do the thing described by the OP.Assuming that sooner or later you will make an incorrect range forecast, only two things can happen:a) Eventually you run out of BTC. Great, tranche has been successfuly converted to USD, plus you made a profit above average exchange rate. b) Eventually you run out of USD. No problem. Just return the BTC (+profit) into your long term savings wallet and wait for future selling opportunity.
For hypermobile people like me, it used to be a pain in the ass when every small country in the EU had its own currency. That's why I was really happy when the Euro came along.  It's a shame the Euro was ruined by flawed monetary and fiscal policy.  But in principle, the idea of having one standardized currency for the whole of Europe was not a bad idea. I like bitcoins for similar reasons. They have the potential to become the standard currency of the internet.  These local currencies seem like a step backwards.  If one currency per country is already a pain in the ass, just imagine the bureaucratic nightmare if every city had it own currency. I wonder, what is the effective price tag on the other famous pirate in the bitcoin ecosystem? Prob much higher than 5M USD.Considering that said pirate is still cheerfully going about his business after a whole year of being declared public enemy by a US Senator, I doubt that "our" pirate will be found any time soon. Don't know what you mean by "scraping" the web, but wallet.dat files are not accessible on the public internet. You usually have to hack into someone's system in order to steal a wallet. Or you have to be a corrupt employee of a cloud storage/ web hosting service.  This has already happened several times, but it is becoming more difficult even for talented hackers, as the bitcoin community is becoming smarter about security.Brute forcing the password will not work with the original Bitcoin client, unless the victim uses an embarrassingly weak password such as "1234".  The client uses multiple rounds of hashing in order to make brute force attacks expensive.Yes, for a handful of highly skilled black hat hackers it will always be more economical to steal wallets from careless bitcoin users, rather than doing honest work.  But the majority of miners possess neither the skill nor the criminal energy to make their money this way.  Going with Pieter Wuille's definition of "intrinsic value":Bitcoin would not have value if it were not a medium of exchange.Namecoin would. And don't forget: We needed porn to prove that e-commerce is viable.Despite tainting the reputation of Bitcoin, that is pretty much what Silk Road is doing for Bitcoin right now. Namecoin has intrinsic value. Does that mean namecoin comes closer to digital gold than bitcoin? I'm not sure about that.  It is true that teenagers are more fluent at using computers passively. It is true that a technically-minded subset of teenagers is growing up programming from a young age.  But the majority of teenagers doesn't know how to write even the most basic program, neither are they interested in learning.  In fact, the general purpose computer is on the decline, so don't expect programming to rise in popularity.  Just because everyone knows how to drive a car doesn't mean everyone needs to be a mechanic and tinkerer.Anyhow, for larger amounts of money, the bitcoin client can be moved to dedicated, highly secure hardware.  For small amounts, you can use online wallets. Both aren't harder to use than Facebook.    One of my biggest criticisms of mainstream environmentalism is that it often gets its priorities wrong because it fails to see the bigger picture.  When it comes to automobiles, there far is too much attention going to the vehicle and not enough attention to the transport system as a whole. The automobile is just one cog in the industrial complex that is the modern transport system.  This system consist not just of automobiles, but highway systems, refineries, gas stations, parking spaces, etc. but most importantly, the cities that are designed to accommodate cars.  After 100 years and trillions of dollars spent on R+D, modern automobiles are already highly optimized, and are fast approaching fundamental limits.  It is practically impossible to achieve a 10-fold efficiency improvement on a Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion or a Prius, at least not without paying a high penalty in price, complexity, comfort, useability and safety.Therefore, the focus should not be on building greener cars but on using them smarter.  In my opinion, the lowest hanging fruit is city planning. A 10-fold decrease in energy consumption can be achieved by designing greener cities, and it doesn't require complex technology and resource depletion, just time and willpower.  Hong Kong is a good proof of concept; it's no secret why it spends an order of magnitude less energy per capita on transport than North American cities. Unfortunately unlike car companies, cities are run by politicians, who have little stake in investing in long term improvements, but the problem will solve itself once the oil price hits $300. High energy cities will then start to become uncompetitive and lose population to low energy cities. Here is a sobering "bigger picture" analysis of green cars:http://www.withouthotair.com/download.htmlPS. I ride a bike around town not because I'm a green hipster but because it's convenient and economical.  Stuxnet wurde gegen einen feindlichen Schurkenstaat eingesetzt.  Einen Virus gegen Privatleute, noch dazu die eigenen Bürger einzusetzen bedarf einiges mehr an Rechtfertigung.Der einzige effektive Virus gegen Bitcoin ist ein Virus der Bitcoins klaut.  Sobald die Regierung anfängt Bitcoins zu klauen, hat sie aber ein Dilemma.  Entweder sie definiert Bitcoins als Wertsache und macht sich durch den Diebstahl selber strafbar.  Oder sie definiert Bitcoins als wertloses Monopolygeld, dann kann sie aber keine Rechtfertigungen wie Geldwäsche o.ä. verwenden, um Bitcoin zu verbieten.  That's not what I meant.  My point is that the June 2011 event was indeed a bubble and that the current rally is a different event altogether.  I'm not saying that is it not a bubble.  It could well be major bubble #2. Let's see a year from now. In den letzten Monaten sind hier am Marktplatz Anlagesysteme aufgetaucht, die im Vergleich zu traditionellen Anlagenformen extrem hohe Zinsen versprechen. Der Großteil dieser Anlagesysteme untersteht keinerlei Aufsicht einer vertrauenswürdigen dritten Partei, weder staatlich noch privat. Bei anonymen Anlagesystemen hat der Gläubiger im Falle einer Insolvenz zudem kaum die Möglichkeit, den Rechstweg zu beschreiten.Daher liebe Forumsmitglieder: seid euch dieses Risikos bewusst, übt Eigenverantwortung und schaltet bitte euren gesunden Menschenverstand nicht aus.    +1I know a 70 year old who hasn't even figured out how copy+paste works despite owning a laptop for 15 years.  Yet when I explained the principles of bitcoin to him, he groked it straight away.   Just focus on the principles and don't use technical terms such as "hashing" and clever old people will catch up fast.  Dumb old people perhaps not, but neither will dumb young people. 1 year is a very very long time in bitcoinland. The current rally isn't a "recovery" from the June 2011 bubble, but a new phenomenon altogether. The fundamentals driving the price are completely different this time, as are the traders.  My guess is that most people who speculated in the June 2011 bubble have long cashed out and forgotten about bitcoin, and are not coming back, at least not until the "late majority" and "laggard" phases.

Note that USA is a huge and diverse country unlike Finland; if the USA average is 19.1, then the user density is probably twice as high in hotspots such as New York.   In terms of users per square km, my guesstimate would be:1. New York metropolitan area2. San Francisco Bay Area3. Helsinki4. Sydney5. Stockholm6. Toronto7. Randstad(guesstimate loosely based on statistics @ http://bitcoinstatus.rowit.co.uk)    Then keep your recurring payments and charge a 30% premium for one-time payments. That way, you don't lose any of your "lazy" customers, while gaining additional privacy-aware customers, who would previously have refused to use your service. Win-win.Also, bitcoin volatility is not an issue for porn sites as long as bitcoin is bringing in additional customers, because porn sites have large fixed costs and small variable costs. In meinen Augen sind Bitcoins eher vergleichbar mit Bargeld als mit dem Übertragen von Rechten.  Bei einer Rechteübertragung kommt es zu einem Vertragsabschuss wo die Geschäftspartner aufgezeichnet werden. Bei einer Bitcoin- oder auch Bargeldbezahlung muss dies nicht unbedingt der Fall sein.Der Punkt ist, bei Bargeld kommt es rechtlich eben nicht darauf an, wo der Wohnsitz/Firmensitz der Geschäftspartner ist, sondern wo sich das Bargeld physisch befindet. Wenn wir beide in Deutschland wohnen und ich dir einen Brief mit Bargeld aus dem Ausland schicke, dann gelten trotzdem die Einfuhrbestimmungen für Bargeld, ganz egal ob das Geschäft im Inland stattfindet.Bitcoins sind ortsungebunden, daher ist von der Transaktion allein ein Import oder Export unmöglich festzustellen. The bitcoin system makes no such assumptions. Bitcoin is just a tool. What you do with it, whom you choose to trust is up to you. Saying that bitcoin security is flawed because people choose to give up control of their private keys is like saying that the security of a door lock is flawed because you gave the key to a caretaker who emptied your house while you were on holiday.Of course, for the economy to function, a good trust management system is required as a layer on top of bitcoin.  But the two systems are independent of each other. What is the advantage of using a salt+password over simply using a fully random private key generated by the satoshi client?The salt needs to be stored somewhere, and if you lose the salt you lose the coins, right?Seems more sensible to me to store an aes256-encrypted wallet or private key than a salt. Bitcoins kommen nicht sondern sie sind einfach.  Genau genommen gibt es gar keine Bitcoins sondern nur Transaktionen. Transaktionen kommen von Bitcoin-Adressen. Die dazugehörigen Private Keys könnten physisch in nur einem Land gespeichert sein oder auch in mehreren Ländern gleichzeitig. Oder sie könnten nach Aufnahme in die Block Chain schon längst gelöscht sein.   Wie dem auch sei, es ist praktisch unmöglich zu beweisen wo geographisch sich die Private Keys von einem beliebigen Sender befinden und nicht befinden.  Daher ist die Frage, ob Bitcoins vom Ausland oder Inland kommen genauso unsinnig wie die Frage ob Bitcoins gelb oder orange sind. 
Falls du dir nicht sicher bist weil der Client hängt kannst du immer noch im block explorer nachschauen, ob die Transaktion tatsächlich bestätigt wurde:http://blockexplorer.com/http://blockchain.info/ I barely even knew such a thing existed until I tried to invest a small amount of money in zopa.co.uk (a p2p loans market) and wasn't allowed to because Equifax had no information on me. I found it bizarre that I would need a credit score if I am the one doing the LENDING but apparently that is the way of our byzantine financial system. Never mind Equifax, I do value my bitcoin-otc rating and actively try to improve it.   This example illustrates why Brazil is rank 126 (out of 183) on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index.Red tape and regulatory overzealousness in Brazil is horrible. Doing any kind business there is more difficult than in English speaking countries.  On the other hand, the market is less saturated, and there are more gaps and inefficiencies that present great opportunities for making money.  And Brazilians have a real skill for dodging the overbearing regulators. That's why am I am certain bitcoin related business won't disappear from Brazil. For my "current account" wallet, I use a dedicated netbook where I run nothing but the Bitcoin client.The OS is an Ubuntu 12.04 custom install with the majority of default software packages removed.  The ufw setup is as follows:Code:$ sudo ufw status verboseStatus: activeLogging: on (low)Default: deny (incoming), deny (outgoing)New profiles: skipTo                    Action          From--                    -----           ---- 8333/tcp              ALLOW OUT       Anywhere               8333/tcp              ALLOW OUT       Anywhere (v6)From time to time I run the Ubuntu updates; for this I temporarily change default outgoing to ALLOW.My question is, is this setup reasonably safe against wallet theft by hackers or viruses, or have I missed something important? Bitcoin can still absorb massive growth even with the current block size limit. Normal users who do a few transactions a week would simply crowd out low priority transactions such as SatoshiDice.Say that an average "normal user" does about one transaction per day. The current "throttled" protocol could handle approx. 500,000 such users.  Transaction fees needed for inclusion could rise, but higher transaction fees are less damaging to bitcoin's reputation than heist after heist being reported in the media.That's why multisig is more pressing in my opinion. So are credit cards.What fraction of carders actually get caught?Even if the credit card customer is negligent, it's usually the bank that takes the hit, and then socializes the cost among all customers. Very rarely the it's the scammer.With bitcoin, at least I don't have to pay for other people's negligence. And yes, if you entrust tens of thousands of dollars to an alpha-web app run by an one-man enterprise then that is also a form of negligence. blk0002.dat  has already grown 100 MB  I my opinion, the minimum 0.01 BTC transaction output rule (fees or no fees) should be reintroduced.  Yes it would be a clunky solution but it would just be temporary and it would give the bitcoin infrastructure time to develop to a point where it can scale.Spamtoshidice and friends are getting a free ride.  Yes, they are paying transaction fees. But transaction fees go only to the miners, but not to the rest of us who are donating our HDs.  10-20 GB a year isnt that much but its enough to discourage casual users from running full clients and strengthening the network. In a local wireless mesh network, bitcoin will keep working as long as just one participant creates a link to the main chain (eg. via satellite internet). I wonder if a wireless mesh protocol can be designed where bitcoin is used to pay for bandwidth.Instead of signing up for an ISP, people could buy these wireless boxes that they simply slap on their roof and start earning bitcoins by routing traffic.This would be especially useful in poorer countries and rural areas. The pirate party does have some "real libertarian" members, but most of them are leftists."Real libertarianism" is an extreme minority view in Europe, and that's why they will never have their own party.The word "libertarian" doesn't even exist in the German vocabulary. There is only "liberal", which is used by moderate pro-market parties, and "freiheitlich" (literally: freedomist), a term which used to mean something like libertarian, but has now been hijacked by nationalist/populist parties on the authoritarian end of the spectrum.  Here is why I refuse to use services such as itunes:Some of them embed watermarks in the downloaded mp3 files, forever linking them to your identity. This creates an unreasonable liability for me that is completely disproportional compared to the tiny amount paid for an mp3 file.If I forget my smartphone on a train and then some jackass uploads my mp3s on bittorrent, then I will have to face a huge amount of legal trouble, prove my innocence, and possibly be sued for gazillions of dollars.Call me paranoid but it's simply not worth the risk. True, the likelihood of the above happening is small, but the potential damage if it does happen is huge.Even the services that say they don't use watermarks can't be trusted, because it's impossible to prove that something is not watermarked, and the MAFIAA has a track record of playing dirty.That's why I would embrace a music download service where I could pay anonymously.  Bitcoin would be perfect for this. This reminds me of the quote:"If rape is inevitable, you may as well lie back and enjoy the ride". This isn't a bitcoin specific problem.  Many books have been written on how to secure a web server.  I'm not sure if a universal guide would be useful.  Different architectures require different security measures.  What would be nice is a preconfigured server optimized for bitcoin security and privacy.  Something like  tails except designed for running a simple bitcoin web app.  The barriers to entry need to be lower.  Developing bitcoin-accepting websites shouldn't be an exclusive privilege of security experts.  Der Kurs hat wenig mit dem Gesamtwert der auf Mtgox angebotenen Bitcoins zu tun.  Das ist bei jeder Börse so.  Nur weil Facebook am ersten Handelstag eine Market Cap von 90 Milliarden USD hatte, heißt es nicht, dass Facebook 90 Milliarden wert war, oder dass irgendwo 90 Milliarden USD eigelagert waren um die FB-Aktien zu decken. The "internet industry" is a bit like the Wild West.  The frontier, which is still advancing into unknown territory, attracts the adventurers, visionaries, and outlaws.  But the further "East" of the frontier you move, the more conservative and risk-averse people become, the more regulated and tamed the industry becomes.  The internet industry has been around for almost 20 years which is a century in IT.  Old, established players such as PayPal and Amazon are dinosaurs by now and probably not as eager for "disruption" and "embracing the new" as their reputation suggests.  Some people who themselves lived at the frontier when they were younger are now terrified by the scary stuff going on at the new frontier. There are several levels of "bitcoin becoming illegal".1 - Developers banned from working on the satoshi client.2 - Distribution of satoshi client banned outright.3 - Owning copies of satoshi client banned outright.4 - Owning and distributing of the Chancellor block chain banned.5 - Owning and distributing of any block chain banned. 6 - The entire Bitcoin protocol becomes illegal.7 - ALL crytocurrency and Bitcoin-like protocols become illegal (including Namecoin, Litecoin, etc.)8 - ALL virtual currencies and currency-like systems not approved by government become illegal.Level 1-6 laws would not put the genie back in the bottle. People would simply work on new clients, start new blockchains, or continue paying with Namecoins or Bitcoins v2.Level 6-8 laws would need to be extremely overreaching in order to work, and would cause a big disruption for already existing industries. Even the banning of an entire communications protocol would be unprecedented, let alone an entire family of protocol.  If laws become too overreaching, people start to ignore them.Most occidental countries guarantee Freedom of Speech in their constitution. Some European countries guarantee Secrecy of Correspondence. In principle, those two should make Bitcoin safe.  In practice, governments shamelessly ignore those protections.    I've been playing around with a 3D logo. Here is the preliminary result: I suggest holding a logo design contest on 99designs.It's good place to get some professional looking logos for a good price.  Minimum award is $300. I think we should be able to collect that much.The advantage of using 99designs is that we can access a much bigger pool of (semi)professional designers than by just posting a bounty on this forum.  We will also have several designs to pick from and we can do a community vote to decide the winner. Sehr gute und ausführliche Analyse. Nut mit dem Fazit bin ich nicht ganz so einverstanden.Ich finde nicht dass eine Aufsichtspflicht im Sinne der Nutzer ist.  Eine Aufsicht durch eine Trusted Third Party (muss aber nicht zwingend die BaFin sein) kann durchaus die Sicherheit und Qualität verbessern, besonders bei den größeren Börsen.So eine Aufsicht erhöht aber auch die Kosten für die Börsen, und indirekt für die Kunden. Noch schlimmer, eine Aufsichtsplicht schafft hohe Einstiegsbarrieren und erstickt Innovation im Keim. Gerade im Bitcoin-Universum wäre das gravierend, weil fast alle gute Ideen als kleine Garagenunternehmen anfangen.  Wir wissen heute noch gar nicht, wie die wichtigsten Anwendungsbereiche von Bitcoin in 5 Jahren aussehen werden. Wir brauchen eine Wildwest-Phase, um so viel wie möglich auszuprobieren.Die Kunden sind sich dem Risiko bei kleineren und neuen Dienstanbietern durchaus bewusst.  Sie sollten selber aussuchen können, wie viele Bitcoins sie den unbeaufsichtigten Börsen wie zB. Bitcoinica  anvertrauen. Bitcoin decentralization is about equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.Regardless of who you are, you are free to buy and sell as many bitcoins as you like, to mine, or to contribute code, without asking anyone for permission first.In terms of outcome, yes the "natual outcome" is an unequal distribution of power,  but enforcing a perfectly equal outcome would require curbing the above freedoms for some bitcoin users. Where to draw the line?I am not even sure if a perfectly equal power distribution is desirable.People who own more bitcoin are typically more invested in bitcoin and more capable and motivated to defend it than casual or newbie users. Just speculating ... why the sudden spike in transactions per day?http://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=The spike in late 2010 was caused by a spammer/troll. The spike in June 2011 was caused by a spike in bitcoin users after the media hype.The current spike seems to have come out of nowhere. Any ideas as to who might be doing this?
13-20 Ghash/s means his mining botnet earns him approx. $1.100-1.700 per month.Now, I don't want to condone his actions, but putting myself in his skin, that seems hardly worth it to me. That's less than a cleaning lady earns where I live.  Why doesn't he just get a real job?  Why risk going to prison for such a modest amount of income?  I assume that selling the CC information is a lot more lucrative than mining, and the mining is just a side project of his.Either that, or his is doing this for reasons other than money. Prestige? Power?He seems to think he is invincible, but even Tor is not 100% safe, and all it takes is a second of carelessness and your anonymity is blown, and your life is ruined. How does this devalue Bitcoins? Bicycles get stolen at a massive rate, probably much a much higher percentage per year than Bitcoins.  Yet this does not devalue bicycles.     The market purists on this forum should agree that the market is working exactly as it should. The block award is for securing the network against a double spending attack, not for confirming transactions. Transaction fees are for confirming transactions. The null miners are essentially specialized miners that are only in the business of security, and not in the business of security+confirmation like most other miners.I don't think this is a huge problem. Even if the null miners had 50% of hashing power, average users would hardly notice any difference. Even if they had 90%, bitcoin would still work fine. It would just take longer for transactions to confirm.  This problem is likely to disappear in future because:a) The block award will dropb) As bitcoin becomes more popular, there will be more transactions per block, and thus more fees to be collectedc) FPGAs and ASICs will marginalize the hashing power of botnets.d) Most day-to-day transactions will be between trusted parties who don't care whether a transaction isn't confirmed yet, and who don't even broadcast their transactions most of the time.Is it worth adding complexity to the bitcoin protocol, with possible unintended consequences, in order to solve a temporary problem? I'll give this a try. Here is mine:Code:-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (MingW32)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swQu-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-------SSLID--eeba8f1d690fab5260cfe843859e4e33;--LOCATION--home;--LOCAL--10.8.0.198:26805;--EXT--95.211.10.3:26805; There is no need to be so abrasive.  If none of us had anything left to learn about Bitcoin, there would be no point in visiting this forum in the first place.Anyhow, I couldn't find anything in Wikipedia or elsewhere that proves me wrong. This is why I don't see total hashrate as a Tragedy of the Commons:In a Tragedy of the Commons, each additional sheep grazing the field has a negative effect on the supply of the public good.  The long term result is total depletion of grass, ie. supply drops to zero.In the Bitcoin network, each additional transaction has a positive or at least neutral effect on the supply of the public good (hashrate).  In the long term, hashrate might decline but it's unlikely that it will ever drop to zero.In my opinion, a better analogy than a public grazing field is lighthouse construction.  This is the key difference:  Even if a fraction of altruistic shepherds refrain from sending their sheep to the field so that the grass can recuperate, it will still be depleted  because the remaining selfish shepherds will take as much as they can.  In the lighthouse case, a fraction of altruistic lighthouse builders will ensure a non-zero supply of lighthouses, even if everyone else leeches. A pure proof of stake could possibly suffer from low "voter turnout" so even if someone doesn't own the majority of bitcoins he could control the majority of confirmations. That's why I like the idea of a mixed PoW/PoS system.   There is no Tragedy of the Commons.  What there is, is an underprovision of a Public Good. The public good in this case being security, not bandwidth or storage space for the block chain (which really does suffer from tragedy of the commons, but storage is so cheap that this is inconsequential).Underprovision of public goods is a well studied topic and several market-based solutions have been suggested.  Assurance contracts for example.  These could be hard coded into the protocol in the far future. Or something.But even if they are not, this does not automatically mean the death of Bitcoin.  Even if total hashrate is underprovided, it will never fall to zero.  Hash rate is a positive externality of a transaction fee, which some people will always pay for faster processing.Historically, there are many examples of public goods that are produced in a suboptimal quantity, but they are produced nonetheless. Just because bitcoin is suboptimal doesn't mean it will fail.   Look at bittorrent for an analogy. There are a lot of leechers who take more than their fair share and there is a shortage of seeders. But the technology still does its job.     Online wallets will never be 100% safe, but if you take all the necessary precautions it's unlikely they'll be stolen. See:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_Security_Dos_and_Don%27ts_%28Windows%29Offline wallets are practically impossible to steal, but again, only if you take the necessary precautions. Take them to court for what?Linode is a web host and not a bank vault. The question is not whether Linode's servers are perfectly secure (no such thing anyhow), but whether their level of security is reasonable for the service they provide, and it certainly seems to be.  Linode is not a suitable place for storing confidential information worth $200,000, be it bitcoins, trade secrets, or credit card databases.  Most judges will have little sympathy for this kind of carelessness.What happened here is the equivalent of someone storing a suitcase full of cash in a rented garage and then wanting to sue the garage owner because he didn't install armored doors.Also, technically speaking, bitcoins are not property but information. In court this probably wouldn't be treated as a theft but a privacy breach.  You stop "owning" bitcoins the minute the wallet.dat files leave your physical computer.I would hate to see Linode being taken to court because it would have the nasty side effect of web hosting companies refusing to host any service that is related to bitcoin in future, even if it doesn't use live wallets. It is equal from the perspective of the animal. Do you really think the animal cares, or understands, why it is suffering? And if the perspective of the animal is irrelevant, the whole concept of "animal rights" is irrelevant too.The only difference between cock fighting and battery hens is that one offends HUMAN cultural norms and the other one doesn't.  Cultural norms are subjective.Objectively, both are cruel.  Makes just as much sense as "animal rights" laws that say torturing animals for meat consumption is ok, but torturing them for entertainment is evil.Such laws are not really about protecting the animal or the fetus, they're mainly about protecting your Right Not To Be Offended. Don't know what you mean by "fully secure". There is no such thing as perfect security. Anyhow, it does have something to do with Bitcoin because, if you store wallets on servers, the level of security required is so much higher than for a site like Wikipedia, where any damage caused by hackers can easily be reversed.  Security is fiendishly hard to get right even for experienced web developers.   Hiring a team of 10 security experts should NOT be a requirement for every startup in the Bitcoin economy, otherwise there will be very few startups and this economy will never bootstrap.  This barrier to entry is a problem at the moment. Multisig alone doesn't solve the problem for any system that is automated. What we need is something like LinuxCoin for web developers - a separate preconfigured server just for handling wallets. This server could then be thoroughly tested by the community, just like the Satoshi client, and individual web developers wouldn't need to reinvent the wheel.   The Netherlands was probably just the last link in a proxy chain.We shouldn't be surprised by this. Bitcoin wallets are perceived as an easy target, and there is no shortage of desperate people in the world with basic hacking skills.Have you thought about storing your wallets offline and advertising this fact on your site? I hate "phone culture" too.  Asynchronous communication works just as effectively for 90% of stuff people do over the phone, and it's a lot less disruptive.There is really only one good reason to make an unscheduled phone call: when it's both important and urgent. Unscheduled phone calls that could just as easily been done over email should be considered bad etiquette.As for bitcoin "phone" apps, well they are not really phone apps.  Phone is just a historic term we use for "pocket computer" now.  Botnets are only a temporary problem for Bitcoin. The authors have missed several important points:1 Some honest miners also have a zero cost curve for electricity. Market forces will ensure that their market share will rise. Every electric heater in the world has the potential to be converted into a mining rig.  This market can potentially absorb a huge amount of Ghash/s. 2. Most ordinary people (=botnet victims) are ditching their PCs for laptops and laptops for tablets, which have humble GPU power compared to even an amateur miner. 3. Successful botnets operate stealthily.  Botnets that cause too much disruption for their victims are the ones that get shut down.  It is difficult to run a stealthy mining botnet for an extended period of time, because at the very least the fan noise is going to bother the victims.  4. Botnets have a limited lifetime. Hackers must constantly work hard at infecting new machines in order to make money. A miner, on the other hand, has a passive source of income once he has invested in the rig.5. CPU => GPU => FPGA => ASIC => highly specialized non-silicon IC The Bitcoin community is diverse. Bitcoin is just a tool and different people have different uses for it. I see no paradox in that.  Just like it isn't a paradox that nuclear technology can be used both for weapons and for powering zero-carbon TGV trains.  It would only be a paradox if one use precluded the other, but that's not the case with Bitcoin.Most people who are interested in Bitcoin for ideological reasons, are some flavor of libertarian and don't really fit into the traditional right/left or capitalist/socialist spectrum. Libertarians are pro free market.  Central banks are seen as a coercive distortion of the free market and that's why most libertarians oppose them.  Some, but not all libertarians also oppose big corporations because they are seen to hurt the free market through practices like regulatory capture. There are also a lot of moderates and pragmatists in the bitcoin community, but they don't tend to be as vocal as the ideologists. VVS dump:Leider hatten wir schon eine Menge Scammer hier im Forum, deshalb sind die Leute hier ein bisschen empfindlich gegenüber Newbies mit fragwürdigen Angeboten.Ich will zwar auch nichts unterstellen, aber wenn du die Quelle von den Bahntickets nicht angibst ist es logisch, dass es verdächtig aussieht.Handelt es sich hier um Aktions-Tickets (Tschibo-Tickets, Lidl-Tickets,)? Wenn ja, dann kann ich mir kaum vorstellen dass die Bestimmungen der Bahn oder von Tschibo den Weiterverkauf erlauben.  Du kannst Klarheit schaffen, indem du genauere Angaben zu Tickets machst und vielleicht auch einen Link zu den betreffenden Bestimmungen postest. In practice, for non-tech savvy users, it often works a little bit more like this:1. Find product you like2. Click purchase 3. Get up and fumble for your wallet somewhere in one of your jackets.4.

We are getting there. +1 Berlinmore friendly, more laid back, less crowded, affordable and spacious accommodation, plane connections slightly worse than in London, train connections a lot better. Not that I don't like London, but it's not the best setting in the world for conferences. A megaupload-style shutdown of Mt.Gox seems unlikely. Unlike megaupload, Mt.Gox is proactive about complying with regulations rather than trying to game them. What is more likely to happen is that Mt.Gox shuts down voluntarily in the face of too much regulatory pressure.Either way, it's good to be prepared.
This is what I have done on Windows 7 using a symbolic link:1. Open C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\2. Move the file blk0001.dat (the large file that stores the block chain) to a different disk, eg. D:\bitcoin-blockchain\ 3. Run Command Prompt as Administrator (Accessories>Command Promt) and right click "Run as administrator". CAREFUL! mistyping a command here could damage your OS, so make sure you have backed up all important files before doing this. 4. Go to Bitcoin FolderCode:cd C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\5. Execute mklink commnand, eg.Code:mklink blk0001.dat D:\bitcoin-blockchain\blk0001.datThis replaces your blk0001.dat file with an identically-named symbolic link file.Good luck. The problem with free trading is that allows people to open multiple accounts and trade with themselves in order to manipulate volume data, at practically zero cost. Such a manipulator would still face the risk of another user snatching up one of their bids, but if they trade with extremely high frequency and keep their amount of currency in bids and asks at any given times as small as possible, this risk can be minimized.Free trading also does nothing to prevent an arms race of spammy high frequency trading algorithms which would eventually overload the server.That's why a minimal trading fee is a good idea, though it could be probably be smaller than 0.6% to prevent the above.  Deflation is going to stabilize once bitcoin matures. The nominal interest rate will adjust to take deflation into account. Count me in! Glad I have a GA now. é um grande passo na direçao certa, mas para gahnar independência ao longo prazo, a hardware também precisa ser descentralizada. Um dia os ISPs vao começar bloquear todos os pacotes IP que nao sao mandados por progamas aprovados pelo governo, independente do conteudo.O mondonet é um projeto que tenta alcançar isto:http://mondonet.org/Uma rede deste tipo pode usar o bitcoin para comprar e vender capacidade dos nodes e namecoin como sistema de endereço. In theory, when an event is 100% predictable, the market should adjust to that long before the event and there will be no unusually extreme price swings on the actual date of the event.In practice, some of the traders are irrational, gullible, or just plain ignorant about how bitcoin works.Mining will always be worth it for SOME miners.  The question is: For how many? Seems like an unnecessarily complex solution. Preventing piracy for interactive content, such as games, is trivial.  All you need is a mandatory always-on connection to an authentication server.  Large game companies have already been doing this for a while (see Steam).  Gamers hated it initially, but they've come to accept that games are essentially services and not products like they used to be 10 years ago.    Still, it's nice to see non-traditional and unexpected uses for Bitcoin starting to pop up.  I hope this convinces the "Bitcoin needs acceptance by brick-and-mortar merchants or else it's doomed" crowd to change their mind.  Isn't it a bit too early for this?  The protocol is still undergoing significant changes and every modification introduces new bugs.   Dieses Vorgehen ist unmöglich. Eine Transaktion ist nur gültig wenn sie mit dem Private Key vom Absender unterschrieben ist.  Den Private Key besitzt nur du, daher kann kein Miner deine Transaktionen verändern.  Blöcke mit ungültigen Transaktionen werden vom Protokoll abgelehnt, egal von welchem Miner sie stammen.Die Aufgabe der Miner ist lediglich zu verhindern, dass du deine Bitcoins mehr als einmal ausgibst (double spending). Prinzipiell ist es mit einem Tauschhandel vergleichbar, und ich würde es steuerlich genauso behandeln. Ein Tauschhandel ist vollkommen legal.Die Rechtliche Lage ist im Moment noch unklar weil die Technologie noch so neu ist. Etwa vergleichbar mit der Rechtlichen Lage von Emails ca. 1992 (unterlegen sie zB. Dem Briefgeheimnis oder nicht?). Kein Anwalt wird da genau Auskunft geben können bis es genug Präzedenzfälle gibt. Das sagt nicht viel über ihn als Menschen aus. Zwischen Rechtssprechung und Realethik herrscht eine große Kluft. Moderne Rechstsysteme sind so komplex und überreguliert, dass JEDER Kleinunternehmer riskiert, früher oder später Rechtliche Probleme zu bekommen, auch wenn er noch so ehrlich ist. Das ist einfach Glücksache.Seine anderen Werbungen auch. Das scheint sein Stil zu sein. Er ist halt ein Vermarkter-Typ.Auch nicht ungewöhnlich, dass Menschen die profesionell kompetent sind, im Privatleben dumme Fehler begehen.Ich möchte Bruce nicht verteidigen. Ich kenne ihn weder persönlich noch habe ich sonst mit seinen Projekten etwas zu tun, aber diese ganzen Bruce Bashing threads gehen schön langsam auf die Nerven.   Zum Glück halten sie sich hier im DE-Forum in Grenzen.  Wäre schön wenn hier die Unschuldsvermutung gelten würde.  Ohne handfeste Beweise werde ich mich zu diesem Thema nicht mehr äussern.  Meine Transaktion ist nach 6 Wochen endlich durchgekommen. Schade dass mtgox jetzt wieder blockiert wird. Hast du im Block Explorer nachgesehen, ob die Ueberweisung in einem Block aufgenommen wurde?Wenn du sie dort nicht findest, versuche den Klienten mit der -rescan Option neu zu Starten. Ist es ein Windows-System? Manchmal braucht der Bitcoin-Klient ein bisschen Zeit zum Starten. Die hohe Festplattenaktivität ist normal während die Blöcke heruntergeladen werden.  Ich habe veranlasst,  vorerst einmal fünf neue Unterforen zu starten:   Mining  Alle Diskussionen die etwas mit dem Generieren von Bitcoins zu tun haben.  Pools, Hardware, Klienten, usw.    Anfänger und Hilfe  Newbies, Technischer Support, und sonstige Hilfe.    Trading und Spekulation  Diskussionen über Kursentwicklung, Börsen, Trading-Strategien, usw.   Projektentwicklung   Community, Termine für Treffen, Bounties, Initiativen, Ideen für die Förderung von  Bitcoin, usw.   Off-Topic  Themen welche direkt nichts mit Bitcoin zu tun haben.Dies sollte die Übersichtlichkeit des Hauptforums deutlich verbessern.  Je nachdem wie sich das Aufkommen entwickelt werde ich in Zukunft weitere Unterforen vorschlagen.Außerdem finde ich die Idee gut, das Marktplatz-Forum in Themenbereiche anstatt  wie bisher in Biete/Suche aufzuteilen, wie im Englischen Forum. Verschachtelte Subforen sind grundsätzlich möglich und theymos hatte nichts dagegen einzuwenden.  Bitte sagt mir eure Vorschläge, wie wir den Marktplatz am besten aufteilen! Hallo Deutsches Forum!Theymos hat mich gefragt ob ich hier als Mod aushelfen möchte und ich habe zugestimmt. Ich habe bisher hauptsächlich im Englischen Forum gepostet wo ich seit Juni 2010 aktiv bin, und habe im Deutschen wohl mehr gelurkt.  Wahrscheinlich kennen mich manche hier deshalb noch nicht.Zurück zum Thema dieses Threads: Ich bin auch der Meinung dass die Zeit reif ist, weitere Unterforen einzuführen.  Mein Vorschlag wäre, zuerst einmal 4 neue Unterforen zu starten (besser nicht zu viele auf einmal)   Mining (oder Schürfen?  Schöpfen?  Minieren?   mir persönlich gefällt Mining am besten)   Trading und Spekulation   Community und Projektentwicklung   Technischer SupportWenn ihr mehr oder weniger einverstanden seid, dann werde ich einen Admin kontaktieren um die Änderungen durchzuführen. This is kind of what they have here in Switzerland.  I wouldn't say it's ideal, but government does seem pretty efficient here.  However, there are disadvantages that highly centralized nations don't have, eg. reduced mobility. Where I live banking secrecy is still regarded as something of a human right even though it has been eroded in recent years.   I'm not saying that banks are angels, but I'm not going to have my bank account frozen for legally buying some cuban cigars, that's for sure.   A bank would need very good reasons (such a a court order) to do the kinds of things paypal does almost as a matter of routine. No they don't. Bank transfers don't involve nearly as many draconian and arbitrary restrictions as Paypal.  They also get abused for fraud and other criminal activity, but banks don't police their costumers like paypal does.  Banks leave that job to, you know, the police, and cooperate with the police if and only if required to do so.   It would rob millions of ordinary Americans (and non-Americans) of a big chunk of their pension. That's why it would be highly unethical, even if it's true that it's good for the economy as a whole.
Free market competition is wasteful by definition because effective competition always requires some duplication of work before the winner emerges and specialization can occur.It's less wasteful than central planning in most cases, but it's still wasteful.  Austria, duh!  10th richest country in the world per capita.  Whether that's a result of the former finance minister's Karl Heinz Grasser's policies is debatable though. Grasser is a self-proclaimed Austrian (one of the few Austrians who actually come from Austria!) Wie war das nochmal, "den Händlern ist es egal ob Bitcoin dezentralisiert ist oder nicht"?Dieses Beispiel zeigt doch dass ein Händler durchaus Interesse daran haben sollte, ein dezentralisiertes, unabhaengiges Zahlungsmittel zu verwenden.  Sonst ist er der Willkuer des Zahlungsmittelbetreibers volkommen ausgeliefert! Ich verkaufe dir gerne 10 BTC fuer Paypal.  Unter der Bedingung dass du die BTC erst 6 Monate nach der Paypal-Ueberweisung bekommst. Solange dauert es naemlich bei Paypal, bis das Geld dass ich bekomme wirklich mir gehoert!Wenn überweisung nicht in Frage kommt, dann schlage ich vor: Cash per Brief (langsam) oder Western Union (teuer).Siehe:https://www.nanaimogold.com/buy.php Exposure was bigger in May and June than this month. In fact, there is a good correlation between Bitcoin popularity and price, as evidenced by google trends and alexa rankings. I don't think it must.  The US has one of the lowest tax rates of all developed countries. See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDPIf the US increased general taxation from 25% of GPD to approx 50% of GPD, then it could pay back its public debt in less than 3 years.The debt problem in the US is political more than economic.  A restart would not result in a more equal distribution of wealth. We would see the same approximate Pareto distribution.Except that this time, the richest bitcoiners would not be geeky early adopters but City Boys from Wall Street and Canary Wharf who can afford to lose $1 M on a high risk investment.What difference does it make? So they move to states that are gay-friendly like California and form gay colonies, thus taking away tax dollars and brainpower from gay-unfriendly states.  (statistically, gays are more wealthy and industrious than non-gays).  That is an example of competitive government, though an imperfect one.The question is: Would gays be better off in an anarchy where the majority is homophobic? I seriously doubt it. An anarchy has no "bill of rights".  They would be marginalized and ostracized by the major Personal Defense Agencies to the point of being unable to function in society ... until they congregate in a gay colony somewhere far away and form their own Personal Defense Agency.   Either way, they are still forced to move. In principle I agree with you, I just think that your scale is not practicable.  Democratic government is a necessary evil, because without it, the stronger members of society start bullying the weaker members of society until a mafia emerges that doesn't give a shit about the non-aggression principle. I would love to be proven wrong though... That's why I'm a believer in highly federated, localized "competitive government".  I agree that democracy fails when it becomes too large and too centralized. If people can not be trusted to build airplanes that won't fall out of the sky, then how can they be trusted to choose good airplane manufacturers? Actually, you are not granting a person the right to do something that you don't have the right to do yourself.  You are surrendering some of your rights to an abstract entity called democratic government , and you are only surrendering them under the condition that every other person living under this governments also surrenders their rights.Even the leaders working for that government have surrendered their rights just like you. They are not privileged as individuals. They cannot exert power arbitrarily. They can only do so as a collective. If doctors can't treat themselves then what hope to they have to treat others?If (most) humans can't build passenger aircraft what hope to they have to let others build aircraft for them?see the flaw?Politicians are supposed to be representatives of the people and they are supposed to be competent and informed enough to make decisions about public goods that the average joe is too ignorant and incompetent to make.  Not saying that this is always true in practice though... Nothing that is 100% predictable creates a shock to the market. Everyone is an extremist from somebody's point of view. I don't think bitcoin is incompatible with loans. Once bitcoin matures reaches a stable user base, the rate of deflation will correspond roughly to the rate of global economic growth. Say for the sake of argument that this is 5%. (There will be fluctuations above and below this mean, but lenders and borrowers can hedge against those).Say for the sake of argument that the rate of inflation of fiat currency is 3%.Say that a lender is prepared to lend at a real interest rate of 10%.  Then he could either offer a bitcoin loan at a nominal interest rate of 5% or of fiat loan at a nominal interest rate of 13%.  Competition will push towards a market equilibrium with this 7% points difference between fiat and bitcoin interest rates.  Then it makes no difference what currency you lend in, you are getting the same real interest rate for both.The only thing that would not be viable would be lending bitcoins with a real interest rate below 5%, because you can make more money by just sitting on your bitcoins.  But that would not be viable with fiat money either.  Why would anyone lend for a real interest rate below 5%, if they can get 5% returns simply by investing in the  global economy? No he didn't. His intentions are perfectly clear from the snooty response he posted. I fully agree.  This is perceived as an "official" forum. We should maket it clear that the vast majority of the bitcoin community utterly condemns the initiation of violence.What is needed is an ostracism market.   If being an asshole (even if technically legal) hurt people's and corporations' reputation more it would also hurt their business.  Then they would think twice about being assholes. Pool attacks are a good thing because they increase "effective difficulty".   Gold has a lousy security track record.  It's supposed to be crisis-proof but during wars and economic collapses gold usually gets looted, confiscated, burgled, extorted, lost, and left behind on a massive scale. What matters is that people perceive gold as secure though, even though in practice it isn't.
Yes, Bitcoin is just like SDR.It's issued by a central authority.It represents a claim for a basket of fiat currencies.That central authority dictates to everyone what they can and cannot buy with bitcoin.That central authority dictates with whom you can trade bitcoin. Everyone using bitcoin obeys those rules.A bitcoin transaction takes several days.Nobody is using bitcoin for anything apart from storing value.Its supply is variable.Great analogy! So whoever controls the whitelist controls the flow of money - negating the main advantage of bitcoin, that this is done by predefined algorithms, not people.Your intentions might be good, but how do I know I can trust you in the long term (or whatever bureaucracy ends up controlling the whitelist)?  How do I know that this central authority won't start awarding itself Groupcoins by indirect means?Also, the whole point of  a block chain is to eliminate the need for trusting a third party.  But if you are reintroducing this need, why use something as inefficient as a block chain?  You may as well just record the signed transactions in a database on your server and publish the database regularly. Yet another thread with the word "imminent" in the title...Yet another poster with secret "sources"...This is starting to get old. I'm not so sure about that. Yeah, perhaps they don't litter in the park, but as soon as lots of money is involved, even "good upstanding citizens" start misbehaving.At least half of the people I know would dodge taxation if they could get away with dodging taxation.  Even though they think of themselves as "good upstanding citizens".   Half of the people I know who can get away with dodging taxation do dodge taxation.In less "developed" countries this number is much higher. People in South America for instance view government in a much more cynical light than in the US or Northern Europe.  In Brazil there is a saying, "that law didn't catch on".  I can so see that happening to a bitcoin ban. People are already working on a client that splits the private key between a secure server and your computer. Other people are working on secure liveCDs.This won't be an issue long term. Hardly anyone is going to store a wallet.dat file on their windows machine 1 year from now. You practically don't need courts of law of you have escrow and GPG web of trust. They wouldn't use it because it's not compatible with the existing clients on the network, and most people would reject their forked chain.In your system, collusion to award yourself more coins is compatible with the existing clients on the network.  Your system allows a gradual, creeping corruption.  It's a bit like a badly enforced law that initially gets broken by only a few opportunists, but after a while even "nice" people who (in principle) agree with the law start breaking it because they feel cheated by the opportunists. The current bitcoin implementation is highly resilient because of network effects.  A gradual corruption is not possible. You can't go from a situation where only 1% of miners use the corrupt client, then a week later 2%, then 10%, then 50%... no, network effects will very quickly drive the number down from 1% to 0%. Corruption in the current implementation can only be revolutionary, ie. >50% of users (not just miners!) updating to the corrupt client simultaneously.  That is extremely unlinkely.Also, 50% inflation a year as a result of Moore's Law is still a lot better than allowing people to vote themselves richer, causing hyperinflation. China is very lax on VPN though.  Perhaps it's because big business can't operate without VPN. Bitcoin grows too fast.   And here lies the problem. A system that relies on hope.The current bitcoin implementation, despite all its flaws, has one feature the gives it a huge amount of resilience:  A decision that is in the selfish interest of an individual user is usually also in the interest of the bitcoin network as a whole.  It doesn't matter who the user is or what his motivations are. Bitcoin is agnostic to things like hope and ideology.In the system you're suggesting, a decision that is in the selfish interest of an individual user is  detrimental to the network as whole. It's a tragedy of the commons of sorts.I'm not saying such a system can't work, but it's a lot more vulnerable than the current bitcoin implementation. Voting will make the number of generated coins highly unpredictable. You are setting up a system prone to positive feedback loops that could create even more price instability.I don't think that most people will vote altruistically or in the name of economic stability. A lot of miners will just vote for a very high number hoping to bring the weighted median up so they can make a few more coins. Once people get used to the fact that the block award keeps rising, they will vote for even bigger increases hoping to make up for the loss of value of their coins.  Hyperinflation could result. Even your idea of "vetoing" for upper and lower bounds will be "abused" for selfish means: Many miners will set lower bounds (that they keep raising) simply to make sure other voters don't bring the median down again.Here is a much less corruptible scheme that addresses your concerns:Number of coins awarded per block = DifficultySimple, predictable, easy to understand by everybody, and likely to lead to (more or less) stable prices because difficulty is roughly proportional to the size of the economy. Because you need to modify the MBR if you want create partitions, for example.  The order book is very unreliable.  It's only a snapshot. There are lots of buyers and sellers with BTC or USD sitting in mtgox who don't place orders until the last moment. There are dark pools. There are large trades going on on bitcoin-otc. And finally, mtgox doesn't publish most of the order book. Only a narrow range.   More than 600k USD in the order book. and that's just in the visible range of approx. 16-14 USD. The real number is prob something like 2M USD.I have never seen the bid side of the order book this full on mtgox. Something is brewing. Die sind ja nicht ganz bei Trost.  Wozu braucht zB. ein Theater oder ein Kindergarten einen Geldwäschebeauftragten???Wenn das so weiter geht, dann braucht jedes kleine Unternehmen einen:KlimaschutzbeauftragtenJugendschutzbeauftragtenSpielsuchtbeauftragtenDrogenbeuftragtenRassismusbeauftragtenSuizidbeauftragtenUrheberrechtsbeauftragtenErdbebenbeauftragtenSchweinegrippebeauftragtenElektrosmogbeauftragtenusw.die dann natuerlich alle auf Kosten des Unternehmens geschult werden muessen. Wer hat dann noch Zeit etwas zu produzieren? Kein Wunder dass so viele innovative Spitzenkraefte ins Ausland abwandern. I'll fix that to cater for miners. Bitcoin doesn't have to be anonymous.Exchanges won't be affected by this law because they already know the bank details of all their customers.Merchants of physical goods know their customers' names and addresses, no matter how they pay.The only businesses hurt by this law are sellers of virtual goods and services, such as MMOGs, but there is no particular reason to buy those in Germany, even if you live there.   Why so many? 15 seems like a lot of work. Won't about 5 suffice for the average user? Thanks for your feedback.It has been pointed out that shredding is not effective on modern operating systems.  I think it's still better than nothing, but does it give people a false sense of security?Password managers create a single point of failure. Do you think this is secure enough for protecting wallets? I prefer to encrypt my savings wallets with different, independent passwords.  It is difficult enough running your own business.  Running a bitcoin exchange is even more difficult, because in addition to the normal crap a startup has deal with, you are taking a personal (not just financial) risk. It's something I would never be capable of.  Exchanges provide a vital service to the bitcoin community in the bootstrapping phase. Every exchange operator (not just mtgox) is a hero in my eyes.  I am thankful for mtgox, despite their mistakes and screw ups.  I have no reason to believe that their intentions are dishonest.   That's why I will keep supporting them (and other exchanges). 
It's been almost two months ... time for the third informal bitcoin meetup in Zurich?  (well, I couldn't make it to the last two so it would be the first for me).Tentative dates: Saturday July 2Saturday July 23Would anyone be interested? Don't underestimate the "common" people.Early adopters of new internet technologies are not always who we think they are.see: http://www.economist.com/node/9249302?story_id=9249302Migrants were doing videoconferencing 5 years before everyone else. Migrants will also be the first large group to adopt bitcoin IMO, not because they find it sexy but out of necessity.  It's complex. Electricity is not a perfectly liquid commodity.   For example, powering up and down a gas power plant to match demand reduces the efficiency compared to a plant that is always running at optimum speed. Thus energy is wasted indirectly.  Nuclear power plants cannot be powered down at all. Pumped storage incurs losses.Long distance transmission incurs losses. Wind power is highly intermittent, and it's on the rise (6% of electricity in Germany comes from wind).The complex economics of the electricity grid will favour bitcoin mining over storage/long distance transmission/throttling in some places at some times. Exactly. Also, there are a lot of electric heaters in the world that could be replaced with mining rigs.Mining is a highly competitive market, so it will drive towards these kinds of solutions where the marginal cost of electricity is zero.Nobody will be buying electricity to mine anymore, 6 months from now. No, the old kind, except consumed in times and places where it would have gone to waste before. Standard list of warning signs of shills with an agenda, as applied to the bitcoin forums.1) Sensationalist or alarmist topic titles designed to grab attention.2) Fancy financial/legal jargon and sneering verbosity designed to give an appearance of authority and competence.3) False analogies, appeal to authority, guilt by association.4) Paranoia, mud slinging, FUD, conspiracy theories about secret developer cabals and exchanges that will run off with your money any day.5) General lack of understanding of the underlying principles of the bitcoin technology and how it matters to society; lack of interest to even learn about those principles; lack of positive and constructive forum contributions. If Bitcoin ever becomes that big, mining will be so competitive that it will use electricity that can can be used for little else but mining.  One positive side effect of all these botnet operators starting to mine bitcoin is that it might lead to a massive reduction in spam.If you were a botnet operator, why would you continue renting your botnet to spammers, when it's so much more lucrative to mine bitcoins? Spam has extremely low returns per infected computer. Think about it... One thing I have (painfully) learned about bitcoin is that everything happens on an accelerated time scale. I don't know where the price of bitcoin will be 12 months from now, but I'm almost certain it wont be within a measly +40% , -40% range of the current price. I felt that the Securing Your Wallet article on the Bitcoin Wiki was too hard to digest for a non-technical user so I created this simple, brief list of dos and don't as a starting point: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_Security_Dos_and_Don%27ts_%28Windows%29Any modifications or improvements are appreciated.Bear in mind that this is not meant to be a comprehensive guide on how to create a 100% secure wallet. I'm just trying to address the most obvious security mistakes made by beginners.  Namecoin is not only for DNS.The plan is to make it a generalized distributed namespace.There are a lot of uses for that. Yeah, go ahead, report them and perhaps they will be shut down or forced to halt trading as they are tied up with red tape for months.   That is really going to help the bitcoin economy.Honestly, what are you trying to achieve?This is pioneer territory. Most internet startup companies run afoul of some regulation or another.  Even the giants like amazon, google, and ebay did when they started out with two or three people.  They simply don't have the resources to deal with the complexities of the regulation jungle at that stage.  If startups were forced to follow every conceivable regulation to the letter, we would never get any innovation.  Don't like mtgox? Don't use them. But please don't be a jerk.   30 Million a year is nothing. That's the revenue of a small company. Remember that Bitcoin is a global project. There are now Bitcoin early adopters in the most remote corners of the world, and most people in the world haven't heard about Bitcoin yet.There are 1 Billion internet users in the world. If just 0.3% (3 Million) of them join Bitcoin in the next 12 months and spend $10 to give it a try, the price will stay where it is.So is Wikipedia. It is very easy to copy Wikipedia and make a for-profit fork. Even Wikipedia's content can be used commercially as long as it's published under the same license.  Yet, nobody seems to have succeeded with this. Well, there are a few examples but their user numbers are negligible compared to the original Wikipedia.Why is that? Mainly because of network effects and "community spirit".Network effects are even stronger for Bitcoin than for Wikipedia.A closed-source version of Bitcoin would lose the emotional appeal of decentralization. It would be no better than the dozens of centralized virtual currencies already out there: liberty reserve, linden dollars, pecunix, ... Sunday is actually the fairest opening time because the fewest number of users will be at work.  Ebay Germany seems to tolerate Bitcoin for the time being.I successfully sold some BTC on ebay two days ago.  The listing wasn't deleted.Neither could I find anything in Ebay Germany's  T&C and list of banned items that prohibits selling something like bitcoin. Make a list of all your major predictions that didn't materialze in over the last decade, and a list of the ones that did materialize.  Weigh them by how much money you personally put behind each prediction.   Then tell us the ratio.If the ratio of correct/incorrect predictions isn't higher than 0.5 you have no credibility IMO.Logical fallacy:Ponzi schemes exhibit exponential growth Bitcoin exhibits exponential growthTherefore Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.No it's not. My bitcoins don't just have speculative value. They have value to me because they give me a low friction, low cost way to send money to any other bitcoin user in the world, without filling out paperwork or asking anyone for permission. That's a powerful tool.This statement shows that you are clueless about bitcoin and haven't properly researched the technology you are advising your investors not to invest in.   So they haven't encumbered themselves with endless red tape and unnecessary overhead.  Boohoo.When I use a service, all I care about is whether the business delivers. The rest is unimportant.Mtgox has always delivered for me so far, and that's why I will keep using them.  As an adult, I can judge for myself whether a business is trustworthy. I don't need a royal stamp of approval. Obviously this is a very young economy and I can't expect bank-level security from a startup like mtgox.  But I wouldn't keep more than $1000 USD on mtgox either.  Not much.Botnets are like mosquitoes. They are irritating parasites, but they're not going to kill or seriously harm anybody. No matter how many you kill, more of them will just keep coming. Eventually you just learn to live with them.  Feedback about first impressions/ associations.I personally like crows, but a lot of people associate corvids with stealing. The thieving magpie and so on.Definitely not an association you want to evoke if you want people to trust you with their money!Perhaps you should choose a more innocuous bird to represent your brand.BTChicken ? BTCrane ? BTCackling goose? Complex, yes. Vulnerable no.  Localized internet outages do not threaten bitcoin's long term value.  It would require a massively catastrophic event to destroy the entire internet, worldwide, permanently. An event that would almost certainly also destroy the infrastructure protecting your gold: bank vaults, police forces, transport systems, electricity grids, etc. ...unless you are the survivalist type who lives in the woods and buries his gold in the ground.  Salt was backed by thousands of years of history ... until somebody invented the refrigerator.
This is an anonymous forum where anyone can join. We have no way of telling whether you are a troll.FUD posts like this one should automatically be considered trolling. Until proven otherwise.I'm am not saying that you definitely are are troll, but give us some proof, or a least plausibility, that you know those "sources", or stop polluting this forum with FUD posts. There is one more plausible explanation that the author hasn't considered:mtgox regularly moves coins from ancient mining addresses to newer ones. Yes, bitcoin is still very much experimental. Those people are taking a big risk, and hoping to pick up BTC at bargain prices, before bitcoin is more proven and institutional investors like you start to move in.Because that doesn't achieve shit when most users are running bitcoin on leaky, malware-infested Windows machines.  Security in the client isn't the weak link that needs to be fixed. It's security in the OS, and developers have simply lacked the resources so far. Remember they are all volunteers. They can promise you a lot of things. Will they actually deliver if the shit hits the fan? All you have is their word.  With bitcoin, you don't need to trust a person, because you can trust the mathematics.Nobody is promising or guaranteeing you anything. Everything is open. 99.99% of people in the USA perhaps. Please remember that USA != World and that Americans may be a large minority, but a minority nonetheless among Bitcoin users.Today, many countries in the world face the threat of a currency crisis, including America.  This isn't some crackhead dystopian fantasy. This is a real threat. How do I know this? Because even big corporations' CFOs are taking steps to be prepared for a possible collapse of the EUR for instance. Money doesn't lie.I have experienced a currency crisis first hand when I was a child, where people lost more than half of their cash savings overnight.  It is a traumatic experience that scars people for life.  Those kind of people are emotionally attracted to a currency that can't be manipulated.  Currency crises happened as recently as 2001 in Argentina and 1998 in Russia. Those aren't exactly small countries.Americans perhaps don't feel that way because they live in a bubble.  They feel that just because something has never happened it will never happen. If (when?) a currency crisis hits the US, it will take everyone by surprise, and it will be ugly, and then ordinary people will come flocking to alternative currencies. We need a user-friendly preconfigured live-USB Drive, and we need to make it clear to users that running bitcoin from inside their windows or mac OS is unsafe.  This liveUSB needs to be made availble right at the bitcoin.org front page. For-profit hackers are going to find more and more sophisticated ways of getting into people's systems. The average Windows/Mac user simply does not stand a chance against an attack targeted at stealing her/his wallets, no matter how many firewalls and antiviruses she/he installs.  Also, it is unreasonable of us to expect them to be security experts.If that doesn't happen soon, there will be thousands of cases of wallet theft and even more bad press. EDIT: Even a liveUSB is only going to hold off the hacker storm temporarily, because it doesn't protect against rootkit, MBR, and BIOS attacks.  In the long term the only satisfactory solution for the average joe user is a dedicated piece of hardware just for bitcoin (perhaps based on a cheap smartphone).  Bad idea. In all likelihood, Paperback will be defunct and forgotten 30-40 years from now.  Good luck retrieving the information from the bitmap then!See:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6265976.stmTo be safe, you would have to tattoo the entire source code (or at least pseudocode) of Paperback in addition to the bitmap.  A much better idea is to convert the wallet keypair to a QR code and tattoo that code in UV ink.QR codes are ISO-standardized, so even if they become obsolete, you will always be able to find the old technical papers that tell you how to convert them back to the keypair. Your idea is nothing new. It is not bitcoin 2.0. It is e-gold 299.0 Security can't  be simple. I've never seen an online banking site that was simple to use. And for good reason.  Who cares? It's all about perception. You are being just as lurid about the problems facing bitcoin right now as the media you are criticizing.Step back a little.  Tabloid journalists are going to sling mud at bitcoin, no matter what. There is little we can do about that.   Technologies that challenge people's perception of the status quo always tend to provoke that kind of reaction, initially.  Remember all the bad press and ridicule that Wikipedia faced just after it gained mainstream attention?  What we can do is increase the amount of positive coverage in media consumed by the decision makers in our societies.  Luckily, coverage has been more positive in those media so far (specifically The Economist and Der Spiegel)Bitcoin is facing challenges, but it won't die if we don't let it die. It grew a little bit too fast initially.  The bare bones infrastructure (the bitcoin protocol) seems to be solid now. The next step will be to build user-friendly tools (eg. wallet security software) that will unleash the power of that infrastructure. But that takes time.  Or how about this?  Exchange opens every second Tuesday of each month between 9:15 am and 9:45 am, and every third Thursday between 4:00 pm and 4:30 pm (Tokyo time). Closed for vacation in the months of July and August.This was the equivalent of your local supermarket running out of beer on a Saturday evening, because somebody threw a huge party and bought up the entire stock.   That doesn't mean there won't be any beer on Monday or that you can't find beer in the neighbouring town's supermarket (for the normal market price).If bitcoin traders are too stupid to grasp this then quite frankly I've lost faith in humanity and think that humanity doesn't deserve bitcoin. Corruption = abuse of power by an authority that has been granted this power by the people it represents.   An authority that acts in its own best interest rather than in the interest of the people it represents.In the bitcoin community there is no authority.  There is no representation. There are no "social contracts", implicit or explicit. Nobody is in charge.So by definition, there is no corruption.Sure, the distribution of power is not equal among community members, and some powerful members may be acting in their own best interest rather than in the interest of the community at large. But that isn't corruption. And there certainly is equal opportunity for power. Everybody, please realize this important truth about Bitcoin:You only own what you control.  You lose ownership of your Bitcoins the minute you cede control over them to somebody else.  Simple as that.I'm not saying this is a good thing or bad thing. I'm not saying that this is how it should be. All I'm saying is that this is how it is.  That is the way bitcoin is designed to work.  Don't treat them like credit or physical property because they are not. From nowhere. We have just witnessed the unintentional creation of the first fractional reserve bitcoin bank.   Asking for them back is reasonable, considering they don't want them.What is not reasonable is expecting to get them back. But asking never hurts. Obviously you don't hire a team just for yourself.  You join a managed investment fund.This is what most investors are already doing for almost any commodity apart from bitcoin. There are other solutions apart from shutting down the market, which can't be done anyhow. If one exchange closes during the weekend a competitor will happily step in and grab the customers who do want to trade while the other exchange is closed.The most obvious solution is to hire a professional team of traders to do the trading for you while you are sleeping That would be a lottery. I bet that as soon as it reopens the site will be overwhelmed and the majority of orders will end up in the queue for at least 10 minutes before being executed.The few people who actually manage to buy BTC for almost zero will be the ones who placed the order just in the right microsecond.  I for one, am going to be clicking the refresh button like mad starting from 3 minutes before opening time. No offense, but your web design looks sooooo 2000's. After thinking about this a little bit more, I have reconsidered ... this is a very bad idea.During bitcoin's more innocent times, I kept my wallet.dat files unencrypted on my main laptop. I use this laptop to try out new stuff and browse the web with plugins activated, so it has a huge attack surface.I have long since moved all my bitcoins to offline savings wallets and a spending wallet on a dedicated netbook.But those old wallet files with zero balance in them should be considered tainted.  Even if I move them offline and format my HD it's too late.  I am making the assumption that they have been harvested by hackers already.  The problem is, my EFF donation happened such a long time ago that it came from one of those wallets. The last thing we need right now is EFF donations being reclaimed by hackers!
It would be a better idea to put them into a bounty for badly needed projects to help solve problems of wallet theft and wallet loss for the average user. Eg. A user-friendly, secure liveCD or live USB drive configured for automatic online backup.Not that the faucet doesn't help the promote bitcoin, but I don't think that is our biggest priority right now.  I think the faucet was vital during the embrionic stage, but it loses importance as bitcoin goes mainstream.I have already donated 5 BTC to the faucet.  If I was given the choice to donate another time, I would never have donated an amount as large as 200 BTC to the faucet (no offense, Gavin).  Those funds were meant specifically to support EFF. If they won't have them, I would rather give them to the FSF than the faucet.Perhaps the EFF should allow people to reclaim their donation by signing with the private keys from the originating addresses?  Complicated, but doable. Could you please prove this by signing this message with the private keys from the wallets in question, in order to shut up the conspiracists? Mtgox keeps most of his users' BTC balance in an offline wallet.There is only so much the attacker could have stolen from the wallets on the server.  Definitely less than 500K. It's mtgox's decision. The owner of the site never promised you anything when you deposited your BTC or USD there. Please show me a contract signed by either party guaranteeing that there would be not rollbacks.You have basically entrusted him to do whatever he likes with your BTC.  It's the risk you were willing to take.   The point of this should be to pay for bandwidth, no content. $10.47 looks like somebody already cracked mine.(Mine is < 400)When I tried to log into my gmail account that was registered on mtgox I got this message from gmail: "suspicious activity reported. please change your password".Good thing I had a unique password just for mtgox!   You haven't  been here for very long, have you?This isn't the first time mtgox got attacked.  The attack in Oct 2010 was actually far more disruptive than this one because the result was that mtgox users could no longer deposit or withdraw USD for several weeks. Didn't hurt Bitcoin as a project. People just continued trading on other exchanges and OTC. That is the whole point of Bitcoin, that it doesn't depend on a single website or company. This is a test of Bitcoins resilience. If anything, this strengthens Bitcoin in the long term because it gives people confidence that their wealth cannot be compromised at the whim of a single organization. Obvious market manipulation is obvious.nice timing, sunday afternoon when nobody can get USD into mtgox.I don't know what's more hilarious. The fact that somebody just gave away most of his BTC for free. Or the fact that so many people actually fell for it.Man, I love the Wild West! The problem is that if there is a zero fee on trades people are going to try to game the volume charts by trading back and forth with themselves.  Though I think a trade fee of 0.65% is too high. Trade fee should be 0.1%, withdrawal fee 0.5%. SECURITY:* Make everything in the front end open source and have the source code audited by an independent security expert.* Offer a legally binding 1000 BTC bounty to anyone who discovers a security hole and privately informs you about it.* Site should be at least as secure as any online banking site: Two-factor authentication should be standard for all users. Security tokens mailed in the post for power users.* BTC withdrawal limit by default* Email confirmation and secret question every time user logs in from a different IP address.* Optional insurance of deposited BTC amount.  insured BTC held in bond by an independent trusted third party.FEATURES:* User friendly way to configure simple trade bots.* Loans, options, and futures supported by:* GPG web of trust.* EDIT: site should work without javascript!    Do everything in moderation, including moderation. The last three months have seen a strong correlation between BTC price and user numbers (growth in user numbers can be estimated from alexa.com, google trends, and forum membership)That seems perfectly sustainable to me.  Now that bitcoin has been in the mainstream media and most people have heard about it, price is levelling off.  I don't see a bubble anywhere. Write you own poem, and keep reciting the poem at least once a week.Then create your own rule for converting the poem into a password. eg. take 3rd and 5th letter from each word and capitalize if word is a verb... or something more complex. Just make sure you keep the rule to yourself. 40 character password that is both secure and hard to forget. Sorted!Needless to say, don't ever use that password online.  your prediction seems to be materiallising... 1) Waiting for confirmation is only necessary if you don't trust the counterparty. 2) Without the early adopters securing the embrionic block chain, bitcoin might have failed and wouldn't be where it is today. 3) Transactions with paypal and credit card are even less guaranteed. In fact, a lot of them do get rejected and reversed at the whim of those companies.4) User friendly backup tools will all but eliminate coin loss in practice5) Bitcoin doesn't rely on the whole network to be intact. It could easily survive even just on a handful of clients running in the whole world.  Splitting the network requires hermetically sealing one group of clients from another group. That is extremely hard to do on the internet.6) User friendly security tools will prevent most theft in practice7) Nothing is backed by anything. Even promisory notes are only as trustworthy as person making the promise. With bitcoin you don't need to trust anybody.8 ) Early speculation means that difficulty is higher than it would be without speculation, making bitcoin more secure in its early stage, making it more likely to succeed.9) A lot of hoarders have started bitcoin business exactly because they have a stake.  There will always be free riders in life.10) Do you really think people are going to care about a fixed 0.1 cent transaction fee? c'mon...11) Bitcoin is just a tool. If some people use that tool for ideological purposes, why do you care? You can use it for whatever purpose you feel like. This has already happened:http://www.wuala.com/en/bitcoinParent company LaCie has 350M revenue. Wuala is not as huge as Amazon, but a mainstream retailer of virtual sevices nonetheless. Personal cloud storage is a big growth market.  If the value drops as a result of this news that would suggest that a lot of speculators are idiots who didn't even do basic research on what they were investing in.The weakness that a wallet.dat can be stolen by a hacker has been discussed ad nauseum, and consensus on effective countermeasures, such as keeping an offline savings wallet has been reached months ago. They can pursue it as a case of "data theft".  1) There currently isn't a well functioning options and futures market in the bitcoin economy.  Merchants would certainly benefit from such a market, so expect it to appear soon.2) It's very easy to get BTC in and out of exchanges, but very difficult to get USD/EUR in and out. This asymmetry creates liquidity problems.Once these problems are solved, I suspect that fluctuations of 50% will happen on a timescale of days rather than hours. 
I find this guy perplexing.  Where on earth does all that hatred come from?  Bitcoin hasn't been around long enough for people to develop strong prejudices.  Someone who simply thinks Bitcoin is a bad idea would not react this aggressively and spend so much energy on it.  Either he feels threatened by the idea of Bitcoin in some way (that would also explain the excessive ridiculing), or it's all just theatrics and he has something else to gain.  Attention?   I don't quite get it... This is what's going to happen if government goes down that road:1. Bitcoin client is made illegal.  People create alternative clients.2. Bitcoin protocol is made illegal. People start new block chains with slightly modified protocols.3. ALL "crypocurrencies" are made illegal. People start using Namecoin as a currency.4. Namecoin is made illegal. People start using other BitX projects as currencies.5. ALL technologies that use a proof-of-work block chain are made illegal, even if they are not designed to be currencies.  People start using other digital commodities that are not based on proof of work blockchains, such as Ripple or OpenTransactions.6. ALL techologies that could potentially be used as a digital currency are made illegal.  This legislation would be so overarching that it would destroy stuff like WoW and Facebook. 7. Country loses competitive edge against countries that don't impose draconian restrictions on innovation.   Criminalising Bitcoin won't stop criminals from using it.  It will only stop honest people from using it. Then we are going to live in a world where, de facto, financial privacy and free trade is a priviledge enjoyed only by criminals, but not by honest people.This will make criminals wealthier and more powerful than they would have been in a world where bitcoin was legal.Somebody should explain this to these politicians. have been waiting for 5 days too.I suspect someone at mtgox is processing these manually and is now overwhelmed by the the sharp growth in user numbers. I don't really see brick and mortar merchants as a big market for bitcoin in the short-to-medium term.  For them, it offers too few advantages over paper cash.  The first markets to adopt bitcoin on a large scale will those that are in need for bitcoin's unique properties, not those that it shares with other payment methods.ie.porn, poker, remittances, MMOGs, mechanical-turk style workers, financial services.  From there it will slowly expand to other markets.In fact, brick and mortar merchants will probably be the last to adopt bitcoin.   One thing you forgot: configure iptables to block all ports except 8333 The problem is that using the bitcoin client on a system without a browser is extremely cumbersome - I make most payments by copy+pasting bitcoin addresses from the web, so a browser is a must. On the machine where I run bitcoin, I removed all plugins and add-ons from firefox and activated NoScript in addition to switching off javascript.  Anything else I can do to reduce the attack surface? That's why future versions of the client should let miners set the registration fees. Technically, and legally, bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency.  Also, bitcoins aren't really "coined" by anyone, not even virtually. They are discovered. You are not seriously suggesting that an old forum member faked the heist in order to crash the price? Are you?  That wouldn't even make any sense.  The fact that a hacker can steal a plaintext wallet.dat is not exactly a secret. This vulnerability has been discussed ad nauseum on this forum and consensus was reached months ago, that it is a good idea to keep a separate savings wallet. Even allinvain admitted that he knew his setup was highly unsafe before his coins were stolen.The heist revealed nothing that wasn't already known, besides it's not a bitcoin vulnerability but an OS vulnerability.  Thus the market should ignore such news ... unless ... the market is dominated by ignorant, immature amateurs who don't understand bitcoin and are swayed by whatever they read on Gawker. They're not changing hands.  The heist from allainvain has scared early adopters into to moving their wealth to fresh offline wallets.  Ich poste regellmaessig auf Facebook den USD/BTC Kurs, ohne das Wort "Bitcoin" zu erwaehnen. Bis jetzt hat noch kein einziger meiner Facebook Freunde erraten, um was es sich da handelt. ca. 30 meiner Facebook Freunde sind Techies. What I don't get: Why do you self proclaimed businesspeople from the Real WorldTM not do something about this alleged problem instead of coming to bitcoin.org and complaining, hoping that other people will take care of it for you?This is a decentralized project! There is nothing "official" or permanent about bitcoin.org. Persuade your investors to open another, less controversial "flagship site" and then market it heavily.The owner of this site is maintaining it in his spare time for free. He owes you nothing.  @Jessy:Bitcoin is more than just a technology invented to solve some practical need, like the toothbrush.  Right from the start, the motivations for inventing and promoting Bitcoin were very ideological indeed.  The technology is inseparable from the ideology, at least so far in the short history of Bitcoin.You can't really blame the bitcoin.org forums for their anarchist/libertarian roots. The would be like blaming CAFOD for its Catholic roots. When I came here about a year ago, almost all discussions (outside the technical sections) were philosophical in some shape or form, and the bitcoin technology was seen as an experiment to test those philosophical findings empirically.  Then all of a sudden (perhaps to everyone's surprise) bitcoin took off and became something bigger than that.  The first time I came here I was also put off a little bit by all that absolutist ideology, but I could see there was tremendous value in the practical applications of bitcoin and decided to stay anyway. Not to mention that I enjoyed having my world view challenged by some very intelligent community members.  Tell your small business owner friends to keep an open mind. I do agree with you though that the joe sixpack "consumer" of bitcoin is better off not learning about the ideological motivations of the orignial core community. Perhaps we need a different website than bitcoin.org to act as a  gateway. "I believe in the horse, The automobile is just a temporary phenomenon."  - Kaiser Wilhelm II.  In the long run, the profitability of mining doesn't depend on the price of BTC.  It depends on whether you can mine a Ghash cheaper than the competition.and what's gonna happen in 15 days, oh prophet?   Philosophically no. Practically, some things behave like they have absolute value because there is such broad consensus regarding their usefulness. only a matter of time until there is:IPcoinVersioncontrolCoinBandwidthCoinStorageCoinRoutingCoinTorCoinLegalnoticesCoinWillCoinObituaryCoinContractCoinStockholderCoinWebOfTrustCoinMarriageCoinetc. There will be a huge number of domains eventually, and if you register "unclaimed real estate" you are not really paying for the domain, you are only paying for storage in the block chain. The purpose of the network fees is just to slow down the initial gold rush, not to artificially limit the number of domains.What about highly sought-after domains, such as sex.bit? You are saying that you don't want a market where these domains are traded, because people shouldn't pay for them?  Then how do you propose to go about the allocation of sex.bit? by lottery? by decree from satoshi?   In practice, the only thing that is wrong with this idea for me is  that I tend to forget passwords that I don't use often.
100% safe wallet:1. buy an old PC on ebay2. physically remove any wireless cards3. boot from a linux live CD4. run bitcoin offline to generate address and wallet.dat5. encrypt wallet and save it to USB stick6. deposit USB stick in bank vault7. hand-type address into bitcoin client on other machine and send "savings" balance8. remove hard disk from old PC and physically destroy it with a blowtorch9. after withdrawing from savings wallet, repeat steps 3-8 with a new hard disk.Ok, to be really 100% safe you probably have do all of the above in a faraday cage, but I don't think we have arrived at that point yet. Pure fantasy? I'll give you a real life example: The vast majority of disputes on ebay are settled outside court. This was especially true during the earlier years of ebay.  Well, you could argue that this is only because courts act as a deterrent.   But if that were true, intercontinental trade over ebay would not exist.  If I purchase some computer hardware from a mom-and-pop store in Hong Kong, what recourse do I have in court if it isn't delivered? Realistically, none.  Yet, millions of people keep doing this and the majority of trades are honest.  The reason this works is not because of courts, but because ebay has an escrow service and a rating system (which is vastly inferior to otc-wot but still does its job).  De facto, courts already offer no protection for everyday voluntary exchanges.  For any purchase worth less than $1000 going to court is simply not worth the hassle and cost for an average consumer.  The few people who do go to court over such small amounts tend to do it out of personal pride, not because of a rational cost/benefit analysis.    Of course, courts will always be required for big deals such as real estate purchase.  But for everyday transactions they are simply not needed.  I have been able to login yesterday, but today the site is down.Mybitcoin has been around for ages. It was one of the very first bitcoin businesses. I don't think it's a scam. It's more likely that they have been overwhelmed by the rapid growth of users in the past month. As soon as somebody develops a user-friendly version of bitcoin-otc web of trust, lawful protection won't be needed for 99% of transactions.Facebook is just the beginning. Once the power of "Six degrees of separation" is fully tapped, it will act as a much stronger enabler of social cohesion than any court of law.   The first "mundane consumers" to use bitcoin will be poker players, porn consumers, MMOG players, "mechanical-turk" style workers, and people who send money to relatives in developing countries,.  Bitcoin's pros for those markets are obvious.  Then, once the bitcoin economy becomes more established, better security tools and exchanges for the average user will emerge, and bitcoin will slowly expand into other markets. It's also easy to trigger an avalanche.  dead man's switch transactions I remember someone posting about half a year ago (can't find the post now) that wikileaks decided to wait deliberately because accepting bitcoin too early would have endagered the still vulnerable currency. The market would adjust to that.  If Namecoins become more expensive, registration costs (denominated in Namecoin) decrease, and vice versa. Yes, at the moment there are network fees but they are just for bootstrapping and will disappear eventually.Thus, there is no reason Namecoin can't be used for both purposes at the same time. The internet already caused a huge turnover of power in the period 1997-2007. The elites lost control over the flow of information. What did they do while they were losing their power?  They were asleep, mostly, until eventually they crudely awoke to a world they didn't comprehend. Hardly any blood was spilt during this first wave. Now comes the second wave. Bitcoin marked the day the internet stopped being a toy for 95% of its users.  Please go ahead! We need more exchanges, especially outside the US and Europe. The advantage of joining an emerging technology at an early stage is that you don't need a huge investment to make it work.  There aren't a lot of competitors and even the main ones are very amateurish so far.Do not accept payments by paypal, credit card, or any other revocable payment method. This pretty much guarantees that you will get robbed by a scammer.  I don't think Bitcoin is ever going to replace USD or EUR.  If anything, it's going to end up as an auxiliary currency like silver or gold.  Rather than threatening governments, Bitcoin might actually help governments with their monetary policy once they start holding it as a "foreign reserve".Don't be naive in thinking that bitcoin can be used to evade taxes. This might work with smaller amounts below 10,000 USD, but as soon as you start spending serious amounts of money (no matter whether 500 Euro notes or BTC) you inevitably leave a trail in meatspace.   On the other hand, this forum was starting to become unreadable amongst all the OMGBUYBUYBUYSELLSELLSELL white noise. 5 posts and 4 hours is a good balance, I think. Holy shit. This happened so much sooner than I expected (a recurring theme to my bitcoin experience, it seems).An article in The Economist was my rule for when I would stop buying and start selling. I guess the time has come. Time to get serious.  @allinvainI'm sorry for your loss. You came to the Wild West 2.0, found great riches almost overnight, and lost them again overnight.  But you still have an interesting story to tell, and you are no worse off than before.I hope this doesn't make you lose faith in bitcoin completely. Come back in a year or so when the Wild West is tamed, and there will be other riches to be made.   This isn't a problem with the bitcoin protocol and original client. These just provide the bare-bones infrastructure on top of which the economy is built.  It's not the job of the core bitcoin developers to be everyone's nanny.  They have enough work trying to create a secure protocol, and they should continue focusing on that, instead of user-side security. Security disasters like this one will create a strong market for clients, backup tools, liveCD, etc aimed at the average non-technical user, and I am certain that there are people working hard at developing them right now.  Just give it some time. The problem is that the bitcoin userbase and value is growing so fast that entrepreneurs and developers have trouble keeping up with demand.  It's growing too fast for its own good IMO. Nothing stops you from calling it BitDNS yourself.  Perpaps that name will catch on. That's the beauty of decentralisation. BitDNS :  the overarching project.Namecoin: the things you buy in order to buy domain names.dot-bit :  the ecosystem around BitDNS I am not in favour of exploiting the weak and gullible, either.But people who see bitcoin as nothing more than a chance of making a quick buck, without any long term commitment to the technology, are damaging us too.That's why I think they are fair game and deserve to lose their money. Then use that to your advantage and profit from their ignorance. pledged amount sent to vinced... 
That's besides the point.You promised a carrot, not $400 worth of carrots.  And the developers were committing their resources expecting to get the full carrot. How you get hold of that carrot is your problem.But perhaps this could be seen as exceptional circumstances  I don't want to pick a fight here. Of course its totally up to you how much you give; its your reputation you are risking in the end. This should be a lesson to all of us to ensure the credibility of future bounties.Either reserve the pledged BTC in a place where you will never touch them (like I have done).Or denominate your pledge in a different currency. What is the point of pledging a fixed amount of BTC if you are just going to arbitrarily reduce it later?You should have just said "I pledge whatever I feel like giving". Conventional wisdom does not apply here. Bitcoin is a class of its own. It is a commodity the world has never seen before. Exponential growth so far reflects exponential growth of users. Nothing unsustainable about that - the userbase, and price, will stabilise eventually.  Once every tech savvy person on the planet has found out about bitcoin and it CONTINUES to grow exponentially, then it will definitely crash. We havent reached that point yet. ...until eventually, NO transactions happen on the bitcoin network, and the block chain is simply a historical archive proving how much money each of those banks owns.  Ok, I have verified vinced's signature.Before I send my donation, I'd just like to make sure that the public key on github is trustworthy. Could somebody please confirm this?Sorry for my extreme paranoia, but I been on this forum for a while and seen a lot of scammers... I just want to make sure it goes to the right person.  Right from the beginning, the Bitcoin economy has not relied on contract enforcement.  The Bitcoin economy is held together by reputation and ostracism,  not contract and force.  I think they are a great tool for small expenses while you are on the move.Don't keep 1000 BTC on them, obviously.Yes, they could run off with my money, but the chance of losing my physical wallet to a mugger is bigger I think.Best to choose a web wallet run by someone who has a reputation to lose, preferably someone who is also running other businesses that accept bitcoin. I agree. The best way to debunk misconceptions is not to talk about the misconceptions at all, but to present the positive facts that contradict them. Semantics semantics. Yawn. It's also called e-mail even though it isn't literally mail. Who cares? Really? I tried to do a test trade and got the same message. Seems that mtgox is a victim of it's own success and can't keep up with such a massive growth of users in such a short time. The internet is the steam engine.Bitcoin is the railways.And Chuck&Joe are the stagecoach lobby calling to crack down on railways because they cause motion sickness. These conversations about the price of BTC are getting just about as interesting as conversations about the weather. over 9000 So, Bitcoin is a company and Paypal has started accepting it?  What kind of fucking amateur wrote this garbage?  I always have a tough time calculating how much I really can afford to lose.I might get diagnosed with cancer tomorrow and then I might need every penny of my savings.  When I think about it that way, even $100 seems to much to invest in Bitcoin.On the other hand, if I lose $10,000 on Bitcoin, perhaps I won't be able to afford a few luxuries for a few months.  Not that big of a deal.  Bitcoin as a store of value/ financial instrument is not a market? Why not? Most of those people are passionate about Bitcoin, and will do everything in their power to make it succeed. If they become super-wealthy we will stand a chance against the old wealthy elites who will try to fight Bitcoin. Proof by assertion? If a few early adopters chip in, we should be able to afford this, now that BTC has almost hit 20 USD!The advert will be aimed at decision makers who are not familiar with Bitcoin yet.The point of the advert is to pre-emptively debunk gross misconceptions about Bitcoin.If the first thing they hear about Bitcoin is that it's "an online form of money laundering", then this misconception will stick. And it will be perpetuated by mainstream media.If the first thing they hear about Bitcoin is that it's "an open, decentralised accounting system where all transactions are public" they are going to have a hard time imagining it is "a form of money laundering"But we need to be fast!I reckon it's 2-4 weeks max now, before the tabloids are all over Bitcoin. We are at a pivotal point now. Let's do everything in our power to make Bitcoin successful.wanted to bounce this idea off the community first before posting a bounty... Maybe you should pay with Namecoins instead of Bitcoins, because they have a use value in addition to an exchange value. In that way they are even more similiar to gold than Bitcoin.
A healthcare system that is only free for those who have serious/catastrophic conditions can be funded by a $100/month compulsory insurance rather than a 50% tax on everyone's income. The problem with a system where everything is free for everyone, even for people who could easily afford to pay $5000 for a IVF treatment out of their own pocket, is that people overuse it, leading to ever increasing costs and eventually, severe rationing or state bankruptcy.Anyhow, the American public healthcare system isn't shit because there is a lack of government funding. It's shit because it's wasteful.  The American government spends the roughly same amount of money per capita on healthcare as the German government. No joke.  (source: WHO). And quite an active Bitcoin community. The first ever IRL Bitcoin meetup was in Zurich, although I missed it unfortunately.  I'm not Swiss, but I don't  have to pay taxes in my passport country if I don't live there.  If I earn in income in Switzerland while living in my passport country, then yes, I pay the difference. Unfortunately, the US is unique in its US=World attitude of taxing its citizens wherever they live.Actually, not even renouncing your citizenship may save you from certain taxes. You should talk to the forum member Mike Gogulski, who went the whole way and became stateless.   No I'm not.Here in Switzerland there are no taxes on capital gains.    On the other hand... ebay, wikipedia, and youtube never got replaced.  It's much easier to switch to a different social network than a different currency. The same way that air travel's path to success was to work within existing regulations? (before manned flight was invented, people owned all airspace above their land).No, regulations will need to adapt to new technologies. Not the other way around. Is that person living outside Switzerland?  Oh no, my browser crashed because of fucking flash player (on a different site) while I was waiting for the transaction to arrive.  Now I'm going to have to pay another 0.02 btc.  Consider the first payment a donation   The world market for commercial CP is rather small because it's, well, a "niche product", and most producers of CP are sadists who don't do it for commercial gain. commercial CP will only ever constitiute a tiny, negligible part of the Bitcoin economy. once the low-hanging fruit have been picked by law enforcement, CP trading is probably going to happen over extremely secretive darknets and friend-to-friend networks, where it's out of sight, out of mind, as far as politicians and mainstream media are concerned.That's why I don't think it's going to destroy Bitcoin. Also, there is probably tons of CP bouncing around the Tor network and that hasn't brought about its destruction. Hah. Most politicians still don't get bittorrent, a decade after it was invented.Do you expect them to get the concept of a p2p cryptocurrency?   If you don't want an international bank, go with the Zurich Kantonal Bank. I am pretty satisfied with them. Their customer service is not as good as UBS but they are a little cheaper. It will always be positive exponential, reflecting the growth of the world economy. Perhaps 3-5% per year. Perhaps up to 20% if there are any singularities.  I disagree. Just like Tor, bitcoin can never be 100% anonymous. An investigation team with enough manpower and time on its hands can track down any bitcoin user, with one exception: The bitcoin user who never spends a single bitcent in his wallet.dat.  But what use are bitcoins if you can't spend them?However it is anonymous enough for most people going about their daily honest business.  Discovering the identity of bitcoin users takes a large amount of resources, so governemnt will only ever bother going after serious criminals, while ordinary people can enjoy the benefits of financial privacy. They can't control Bitcoin itself. All they can do is prevent selected individuals from spending their bitcoins using traditional police work. The guy who wrote this article, Christoph N. v.Dellingshausen, lists "Querdenker" (= unconventional thinkers) in the "Wants" section of his XING profile: http://www.xing.com/profile/ChristophN_vDellingshausenUnconventional Thinkers   Yeah he could surely learn a few lessons from them   This is incorrect because money ≠ utility.True, commodity speculators are not adding or subtracting the commodity from the economy. But they are adding utility to the economy by giving more people access to that commodity at a time when they desire it. That is also a form of added wealth.  bitcoin-otc could take over that function.  the heart of bitcoin-otc is the GPG web of trust which could be ported to any website/chatroom.  Network effects for Bitcoin are stronger than for Facebook.Joining the losing social networking site results in a minor inconvenience the day you switch to the winning one.    Joining the losing p2p cryptocurrency results in substantial financial losses the day you switch to the winning one.  I don't wanna be part of a new elite replacing the old one. Fuck the yachts. If I become a Bitcoin Billionaire I'm going to open entrepreneurial academies and startup incubators in developing countries.   How disappointing.  Seems like the EFF is case of "dogs that bark don't bite".  A charity that doesn't practice what it preaches will not be getting my donations anymore.  Perhaps I'm being too harsh?Anyhow, soon Bitcoin won't need the EFF to speak out for it anymore.  The money will take care of the talking.  Retailers are a bonus, but Bitcoin doesn't need them to succeed.  The remittances market alone is worth $300 Billion USD per year. Then there is: online gambling, bitcoin-as-a-financial-instrument, supply chain management, MMOGs, cloud storage, commercial Tor nodes, and many other uses we can't even imagine right now... Can you prove a causal relationship between the two events? The exchange rate shot up a few times in the last 30 days - even without mtgox changing their policies.
I don't think it's going to be any more dramatic than the financial crisis of 2008 in terms of sudden job losses. It's a gradual process that will take a decade or two. People are not going to give up on traditional banking overnight.  The banking industry will adapt and continue to provide jobs.  People are still going to need loans.  Bitcoins need to be secured just like fial money. Do I understand the General Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem??Hell no.Do I believe this proof is correct? Yes.Why? Because mathematicians are competitive, and there is a huge motivation for trying exposing a hole in this proof.Same with the Bitcoin source code. The more famous Bitcoin becomes, the more confident I am that it doesn't have any security holes. There is a difference between simply being intelligent and knowing how to use your intelligence.I know lots of highly intelligent people who fall for the most stupid theories because of group pressure, ideology, or emotional baggage.  I know one guy with IQ 150 who believes in astrology. *eye roll*. Human beings are all kind of crap, really.People who are both intelligent and wise are very rare indeed, and they don't tend to work for government. Also, people working for such agencies tend to be sequential thinkers and may struggle to grasp the bigger picture with Bitcoin. Man, I didn't expect things to get this political this early.When I read stuff like this I fear that Bitcoin is going to turn me into a raging libertarian.  Das stimmt nicht immer.  Der Nutzen vom Geld hängt nicht immer linear von der Gelbmenge ab.Im hypothetischen "Lola Rennt"-Szenario ist es durchaus Sinnvoll, in der Lotterie zu spielen.   Für 100 Euro hast du kurzfristig kaum einen Nutzen, für 100,000 Euro aber einen sehr großen, wie zB. dein Leben.  Der Erwartungswert des Zuwachses deines Nutzens ist also positiv, obwohl der Erwartungswert des Zuwachses deiner Geldmenge negativ ist.Zugegebenermaßen sind solche Fälle im realen Leben selten.  The benefit of .bit is simple:You own your .bit domain names.That cannot be said of any other TLD, not even of the other alternative DNSs such as OpenNIC.The closest thing to ownership you can achieve with those is a long term lease but you will always be at the whim of the true owners. You have full control over your .bit domain names, the same way you have full control over your Bitcoins.  What gives someone control over a .bit domain is a private key and nothing else. What Bitcoin should be is academic. The market decides what Bitcoin is.  2-5 years from now Bitcoin will probably have a lot of weird uses for which it wasn't intended.  I foresee that paying for goods and services on merchant websites will only constitute a niche part of the Bitcoin economy by then. Anyhow, why do you care what other people use their BTC for? Ich finde den Artikel auch gut.  Er ist ordentlich recherchiert, sachlich zum Großteil korrekt, und kaum voreingenommen, was bei Massenmedien heutzutage nicht selbstverständlich ist.  Respekt, lieber Spiegel.  Die Leserkommentare finde ich allerdings deprimierend.  Da bekommt man den Eindruck dass mindestens die Hälfte der Deutschen eine technikfeindliche und veränderungsscheue Grundeinstellung haben.  Bei Spiegel-Lesern handelt es sich auch noch um den intellektuellen Teil der Bevölkerung. Ich möchte nicht wissen wie Bild-Leser auf Bitcoin reagieren werden.   Na ja, vielleicht braucht es nur ein bisschen Zeit, wie bei jeder Disruptive Technology.  Ich kann mich noch erinnern, als Handys in den 1990ern zum ersten Mal richtig populär wurden, war die Reaktion von vielen in meinen Bekanntenkreis zuerst mal negativ, so auf die Art, wozu brauche ich den Mist?. Nach 2-3 Jahren haben sie ihre Meinung natürlich geändert.   You do realise that your Bitcoin2 will also have a "speculator's reward"?  Except that this reward won't go to the early adopters but to City boys at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.  Any major commodity that is freely floating and experiences price fluctuations, will attract speculators.   Every time you fill up your car at the petrol station you are paying a "speculator's reward" to oil traders, because they were smart enough to bet on rising oil prices and you weren't.Worrying about the supposed injustice of the Bitcoin "speculator's award" is silly. Specualtion is inevitable in a free market. You may as well worry about the weather.   By the way, anyone who buys 1 BTC for 8 USD and sells it again for 8 USD (or buys products worth 8 USD), has given nothing to speculators.  The only time you pay a "tax" to speculators, early or otherwise, is when the exchange rate happens to drop between the time you buy BTC and spend BTC.  Bitcoin can, in theory, experience price deflation forever without collapsing like a Ponzi scheme. This price deflation would eventually reflect general economic growth.  Younger people would pay a "speculator's reward" to older people.  But once they get old, they would be receiving an even higher "speculator's reward" from the next generation, and so on.  This can go on indefinitely as long as the world economy keeps growing. Just like early adopters, early speculators were key to Bitcoin's success so far.  Without them, the exchange rate and difficulty would have remained low for a much longer time, making Bitcoin more vulnerable.  They also seeded confidence in the value and convertibility of Bitcoin.  Start your own block chain if you like, but stop pretending that this has anything to do with "fairness". Why would that be a problem?  They are redeemed for something valuable in the process of domain registration.  But before registration, they can be stored and traded indefinitely.  Nobody is forced to redeem them, and some people might end up just trading them without ever purchasing a domain name.  Think of them as vouchers or certificates, which certainly can serve as money. The Origin of Money and Its Value If Bitcoin is a good currency, then Namecoin should evolve into a currency too, according to the Austrian School. Right now it is, but why end up?  Gender distribution is equal on Paypal:http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/paypal.com Go to OTC and ask around. Someone is always selling BTC for Paypal. That would actually work in China. <pedantry>The greek μ character is an m, not a u. Writing it as a u looks childish and illiterate IMO.</pedantry>MBC for millibitcoins.MUC for microbitcoins. By the time things are priced in microbitcoins, Bitcoin will be so widespread and generic that everyone will just call them 'Coins.  halfbakery.com  June 2010 As soon as the exchange rate stabilizes. That might take years. I like Bitcoin because of its practical applications, not for ideological/political reasons.  Perhaps Bitcoin, or similar technologies, will shake up the welfare state as we know it. Perhaps it won't. Who cares? IMO it's a waste of time worrying too much about the future of society. There are too many unknowns. We will find a way of dealing with those problems when (if) they happen. By the way, there are examples of low tax and no tax countries that still have a welfare system, and quite a generous one at that.  Switzerland and Singapore come to mind.  Running a welfare system actually isn't that expensive if it is done well. The problem with the US government is that it's horribly inefficient at running its public welfare and healthcare systems.  It  will soon run out of money, Bitcoin or no Bitcoin. PS. I'm not strictly speaking a "liberal". "It is now equipped with 14,336 Xeon X5670 processors and 7,168 Nvidia Tesla M2050 general purpose GPUs"You can look up the performance of those processors here:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparisonM2050: 100 Mhash/sX5630: 8 Mhash/s  (let's just guesstimate that the X5670 can do 10 Mhash/s)So, Tianhe-1A can do approx. 0.72 Thash/s with GPUs alone, and approx. 0.86 Thash/s with GPU+CPU.Not enough to do a double spending attack!
"dead man switch transactions" have been suggested to solve this problem.  Even for the average user it makes sense to go to the place with the highest liquidity, because there you are likely to get the best exchange rate/ lowest spread.I don't even think mtgox is the best exchange in terms of user experience, but somehow it managed to become the largest (perhaps because it was one of the first), and because it's the largest it attracts most people and becomes even larger. Market forces will always push towards a small number of big exchanges dominating the market. There is little we can do to prevent this.  When I try to do name_update I get this message:error: {"code":-1,"message":"there are pending operations on that name"}I have waited for a day and still get the message. I only get this message for a name I name_firstupdate'd with an older version of namecoin. I doubled checked in my transaction history that I really firstupdate'd this name.  For all other names I own, name_update works fine.  Using linux 32 binary.Any idea what could be the problem? Help much appreciated.  A 100 character password is uncrackable for all practical purposes.  A 100 character password isn't that difficult to remember. Even if it's completely random it can be done in an afternoon of reciting.   1) I would only lend to users connected to me via bitcoin-otc wot. My interest rate would depend strongly on my trust connectedness. Thus it would differ on an idividual basis. My rule in the bitcoin ecosystem is: if something must rely on (some) legal system in order to be viable, it's not worth doing.2) btc i would only borrow at a negative interest rate, personally.3) can't we use bitcoin-otc for this? 1. No need for two installations. Just replace wallet.dat with your current working wallet.2. The original bitcoin client won't send to invalid addresses. The safest way to go about a savings wallet is to create it offline, back up encrypted vesion, then send coins. Use block explrorer to check if coins have arrived.Try doing several practice runs with 0.01 btc first. If you sell your BTC as soon as you recieve them, the risk is very low. Some merchants use scripts that place automated orders on mtgox for this purpose.Speculation will never die down. It will continue to coexist with "actual commerce", and it will always constitute a large part of the economy, as is the case for most commodities.  Since the beginning of this year I have donated thousands of USD worth of BTC at the present exchange rate, so I kind of feel like I have exceeded my donation budget many times over for this year.  It's wrong to think of it that way of course, since I assume some of the recipients sell their BTC donations as soon as they come in.Still, I have to force myself not to think of it that way. Human psychology is a bitch. Competent people already encrypt their savings wallet with something like Truecrypt.  This isn't too hard to do.  So I am assuming this feature is aimed primarily at non-technical users.It's not a bad thing to this include feature in the client, as long as you make it clear to non-technical users that the feature by itself will not protect them against thief viruses, and that additional measures are required. This would give users a false sense of security.  It would offer very little protection against viruses or hackers who know what they are doing.  All they have to do is sit around and wait until you spend some coins.The weakest link in the security chain IMO is not lack of wallet encryption but lack of a good firewall. What we need more badly than automatic wallet encryption is a live CD/ live USB stick with a pre-configured firewall that has been tested for intrustion. 1) Anonymity is a bonus when you use Bitcoin, not a requirement. Most users don't care about strong anonymity anyhow.2) Virtual Private Networks can be layered on top of a censored internet.  3) Pseudonymous Networks (such as i2p, Tor, Freenet) can be layered on top of a censored internet.4) Since it's low bandwidth, the bitcoin protocol can steganographically communicate over almost anything, such as email attachments. 5) Push comes to shove, Bitcoin doesn't need the "official" internet.  Bitcoin-over-shortwave, anyone?6) The US does not control all of the internet.  I fully agree with that.So were electricity, the automobile, and the internet shortly after they were invented. No, I'm happy to pay my 50 BTC.  This is now going to be the most valuable single donation I have ever made in my life.    But the developer deserves every Bitcent of it for making Namecoin reality.  How should we go about this, kiba? Are you going to collect the donations first, or should we send them to the developer directly? awesome project.  "in cryptography we trust"   If you are talking about Reuben Grinberg's paper, it's a good analysis, but his conclusion that Bitcoin could be a security is based on a misconception of the nature of the Bitcoin community/ecosystem. The blockchain genie is out of the bottle.  Soon, block chains aren't going to be used just for virtual curriencies, but in a hundred other applications too.   Distributed naming systems, birth certification, obituaries, legal notices, deadline verification, identity management, and many others we can't even imagine right now.In fact, block chains are only the beginning. The world will see an abundance of new technologies that will make the following inevitable: data promiscuitydata ubiquitydata permanence  Lawrence Lessing argues that the legal system eventually adapts to technological change, not the other way around.The point is, some jackass isn't just going to write CP to the BC,  Some jackass is going to write CP into RFID-tagged milk cartons in the supermarket. Some jackass is going to write CP into CCTV cameras, and vehicle sensors, and patterns of sand grains.  Some jackass is going to encode leaked state secrets in bacterial and pollen DNA. One day, we will all be covered in insurance.aes and we are all going to have parrot porn coming out of every orifice.  The law will change eventually, and it will stop prosecuting people for data "possession", unwitting or otherwise, it will prosecute for data divulgation alone, because, Planting kiddie porn to incriminate your enemy?  Sounds like a brilliant plan that could definitely never backfire. Seriously?  Do you really think that those "groups" you are talking about would do something so stupid?   Tell us something new.  Anybody can manipulate the market if they own enough BTC. Anybody can manipulate any commodity market if they own enough of the commodity.  There is nothing unique to Bitcoin about this.  DeBeers and diamonds comes to mind.   If that bothers you, don't invest in Bitcoin.Tell us something new.  That's why it's called beta software.If that bothers you, don't invest in Bitcoin.Agreed. But  I think that anybody who invests a large amount of money in BTC has researched the technology beforehand and is well aware of this.  If they haven't, then they are fools, bluntly put.Securities fraud??Bitcoin is a commodity, not a security.  Why? Because owning Bitcoin doesn't involve guarantees or contractual obligations.  It's just a number stored on your computer. No such thing as "official" Bitcoin forums. That's kind of the point with a decentralised project. bitcoin.org is just a website run by an individual who is involved with the project, that's all. And do you realise that the Bitcoin forums are the public?So I guess the public is misleading the public?Agreed. We should stress more often that Bitcoin is still beta, also on wesuecoins.comLibertarians prefer to use the word "consistent" rather than "extreme", to describe their system of ethics.  They would counter that inconsistency is juvenile.  But I agree, some people on this forum are very idealistic.I don't get this type of reasoning. Why do you care what other people are doing with their bitcoins? I mean, there are lots of deranged people who buy carrots. Does that stop you from buying carrots?Does it take "at least two good analysts" to demonstrate that the sky is blue?Obviously the block chain can store data steganographically.  Anything that can store data, can store data steganographically.Some evil biotechnologist could (theoretically) encode child pornography in a carrot's DNA.  That means that every time you buy a carrot you may (at least theoretically) be propagating child pornography.  OMG! We should all stop eating carrots!You're contradicting yourself now. Your own words from the beginning of your post:So I guess that wasn't advice at all but just a brainstorm?  Thanks for letting me know, I was just about to take it. If 21 Million tons of gold were "hacked" and stolen from Fort Knox, would that mean a massive loss of trust in gold?No, it would mean a massive loss of trust in Fort Knox. Facebook/Twitter is little more than a fun toy for most users. Bitcoin is potentially way more useful and serious than that. It takes the internet to the next level. I'm not saying that Bitcoin will ever have as many users as Facebook, but if it does, market capitalisation will be orders of magnitude higher than Facebook's.  
If you use Bitcoin in its raw form, no, there is no accountabilily. But there is personal responsibility.With Bitcoin, users are forced to think for themselves whether they trust the counterparty.  There is no nanny to bail them out if they are gullible, careless, or irresponsible with their business dealings. Of course, if you want a nanny to worry about those things for you, you can use an escrow service such as clearcoin.  But you'll have to pay for the overhead this incurs out of your own pocket.The point is, Bitcoin gives users this choice and Paypal doesn't.  This is inaccurate. Difficulty is the same for everybody. Total difficulty will be determined by the aggregation of all transaction fees.  When paying transaction fees, you're paying for faster processing.  You are getting a tiny little bit more security as a side effect, but you are paying for the collective security of everybody, not for your own security.If difficulty/security is lower than what the majority of users desire, no action of an individual user can do anything to increase difficulty significantly.  No individual will thus have an incentive to pay for higher security, only for faster processing.The free market leads to a solution that maximises individual self-interest, therefore the market will not sort out that problem.  Not in the current implementation of Bitcoin anyhow. That is like saying,You can either secure your house with a $10,000 steel vault door, or a $20 plywood door that anybody can kick in.  Pick your option.This isn't a binary choice, you know.  There are in-betweens that are reasonably priced and reasonably secure. I do agree though that Bitcoin transaction fees suffer from a tragedy of the commons situation that hasn't been resolved yet.   However, it will take decades  before this becomes a serious problem, and it won't become a problem overnight, so this will give us plenty of time to think of a solution. Go work on a construction site and ask to be paid in Bitcoin. Like anything that exhibits strong network effects, a blockchain is a natural monopoly of sorts.  Free market forces will always push towards the ONE big blockchain.  There is a strong incentive for new users to choose the social networking site that already has most users, to edit the wiki that already has the most content, and so on.  This discussion about rebooting the blockchain reminds me of Wikipedia in the earlier days, when several Wikipedia clones popped up, all of which failed or remained extreme niche of course.IMO network effects in Bitcoin are even stronger than in Facebook or Wikipedia.  I think that is it inevitable that new chains will appear, but the older and longer the main chain becomes, the harder it will be for them to stand a fighting chance.  Right now, I think that only Gavin has a chance of succeeding with this and soon not even he will. The only exceptions are chains which fulfill a very different need than the main chain, such as Namecoin.@unk:None of us can pretend to know if we are in a bubble or whether it will pop.  There is no objective way of measuring this reliably. This is really nothing more than a hunch of yours (and other users).  There was bubble talk after the first price spike in July 2010 and people were complaining that 0.06 USD/BTC was grossly overvalued  .  That bubble, if it ever was a bubble, never popped of course because the goods and services offered for BTC on the internet eventually caught up with the speculators' expectations.  Is it really worth doing something as drastic as a chain reboot, based on a hunch? It wouldn't even solve the supposed problem, because the new chain would be just as prone to speculation as the old one.I don't think speculation is such a bad thing anyhow. The market has already decided that Bitcoin is useful as an investment vehicle on top of being useful as a way to transmit money. The market isn't going to change its mind soon, and even if Bitcoin became primarily an investment vehicle, that doesn't mean the economy won't be sustainable. I don't think it's a bad thing at all.  We already have a competing currency: Namecoin. And I bet it won't be long until the anti-deflation crowd starts their own variable supply block chain. What would be a bad thing though is a splitting fo the existing community into factions. One big chain is harder to attack by a Bitcoin antagonist than many small ones. Great, then we would have two competing currencies, Bitcoin v1 and Bitcoin v2. Until somebody comes along and thinks that Bitcoin v2 is unfair too, and starts a Bitcoin v3.  The community would be split into three tribes, The Pioneers, the The Restarters, and The Laggards.   The majority of users (who don't care about our politics and just want Bitcoin to work) would end up purchasing all three of them anyhow, to make sure their cash is accepted everywhere.As if Bitcoin wasn't confusing enough for newbies already.   KISS. Good point, what if it's just the first 4 characters of the SHA-256? Aaaah, but anybody can change their nickname to Mike Hearn. How do we know you are the real Mike Hearn? Could you please post a copy of your passport and birth certificate?   Seriosly though, I'm going to follow Satoshi's example and not post under my flesh name, for all sorts of practical reasons. For example, I don't want a prospective employer to be able to google me and read about my philosophical stance on intellectual property on this forum.  This has nothing to do with lack of integrity, not standing up for my beliefs, or whatever. It's purely a matter of self-preservation. It's a jungle out there and I want to place myself in a good negotiation position, which means being in control over what you disclose about yourself. PS. If you want to I'll post a SHA-256 of my real name.  If Bitcoin ever becomes a major currency, it will effect a considerable redistribution of wealth in society.We all have a pretty good idea of typical demographic of the earliest adopters:Young, anti-establishment, libertarian, technophilic, rationalist, atheist/agnostic, globalist, entrepreneurial, open-minded, forward looking, optimistic, creative, conceptual thinkers.But who will be the last people to adopt Bitcoin?  You know, the day that Bitcoin is taken for granted by everybody and even the last skeptics finally shut up about it and just get on with using it. My guess is,  they will be the exact opposite of the early adopters:Old, authoritarian, pro-establishment, conservative, traditionalist, nationalist, irrational, religious, bureaucratic, technophobic, pessimistic, closed-minded, concrete thinkers. The demographic of Bitcoin newcomers will gradually shift from one extreme to the other, as we can already observe with newbies on this forum. If there is one thing that will do the world a favour, it's a redistribution of wealth from the latter demographic to the former.That's why I don't resent the enrichment of early adopters.PS. One thing I'm not so happy about though is the wealth transfer from female to male. (Female geeks where ARE you??)  In the Bitcoin economy the cost of lending is transparent.  Because there is no central authority policing fraud, users are incentivized to decide for themselves wheter they trust the counterparty.  Since Bitcoin users are not guaranteed to be bailed out if they make stupid lending decisions, they are likely to think very carefully who they lend their money to, and this will lead to the emergence of decentralised trust systems such as otc-wot.That's why I think it's unlikely that we will see irresponsible speculation with borrowed money on a massive scale.  What's deviant for one person is vanilla for another, and vice versa.  Sexual freedom isn't so much the issue here as sexual equality.  If I can't tell you how to have sex then neither can you tell me.  Obviously there are limits to sexual freedom as soon as sex becomes coercive, but those limits should apply to everyone equally.  Things like religion cannot be an excuse for exemptions.  But to answer your question:I'm a leftist of sorts, but not of the authoritarian variety.I believe that we could all be better off if we acted more cooperatively and shared more things. But this kind of collectivism should always be voluntary. I believe that people and companies who refuse to act cooperatively should be encouraged through reputation systems, ostracism, education and negotiation, but never through force. The minimum wage issue is complex. In principle I'm against mandatory minimum wages. But in the real world, governments already forcefully priviledge large corporations over workers, freelancers, and small entrepreneurs.   So in practice, any government force that tips the balance away from large corporations has a positive effect. Two wrongs don't make a right of course.  Bitcoin has the ability to support non-standard transactions; this has so far been disabled in the official client.You could for example design a non-standard transaction that must be signed by two people before it makes it into a block.Then all you have to do is give two trustworthy people in your business a private key each and make sure they keep that key safe.Using the block chain directly is a much safer option IMO than building another layer of security software on top of Bitcoin.  The more complexity, the more potential security holes.   shane, you should have a look into Namecoin.Namecoin has almost the same properties as Bitcoin, on top of that, it solves the issue you are most concerned about: it has "intrinsic value".No matter what happens to the exchange rate, Namecoins can always be used to purchase .bit domain names. I foresee that Namecoin will evolve into a major currency in its own right. If your theory is correct, it might overtake Bitcoin. Not sure if this is true.I can think of an untamperable distributed timpestamp method that doesn't rely on proof-of-work or  CPU:Cosmic RadiationEvery node agrees to point a radio dish at predefined sector of the sky and measure the random fluctuations in cosmic radiation in some standardised way.These measurements are translated into a linear data stream that is permanetly recorded by every node. Then use the block chain concept, except that the nonce in each block isn't incremented, it's the latest chunk from above data stream.Distributing newly minted money is harder, but can also be performed with a cosmic radiation proof-of-work.   The target isn't a hash but a set of stars/galaxies in a certain configuration (for example). Nodes scan the sky with high powered telescopes and the first node to find such a configuration digitally signs its exact coordinates.   It is then easy for other nodes to verify the stars on those coordinates.Somebody could of course open thousands of nodes with a forged data stream, but those blocks would be rejected by the nodes that physically have a dish pointing at the sky. Maybe I have missed something? Could this type of block chain be forged in some other way? Demandrel:Yes, a wealth transfer occurs in Bitcoin, but with time this wealth transfer declines sharply, percetage wise, and tends to zero.    I don't understand why you say that there is an increasing wealth transfer. Perhaps in absolute numbers, but it's the per capita wealth transfer that matters.  Once Bitcoin has matured, deflation is likely to be only a few % a year, reflecting aggregate economic growth.  Is that small amount really enough to put off new users? Also, anyone who holds on to a fixed supply currency for long enough will eventually experience a reversal of wealth transfer, as long as the world economy keeps growing for ever, as it is likely to do, since there are no limits to productivity gains.  The way I understand it, under Bitcoin there will be a few extremely wealthy early adopters.  Some of these will stop contributing productively to the economy, but still compete for products with all their wealth. This will drive up prices higher than they would have been under InflaCoin*.   But even these super rich will eventually run out of money if they just spend and never produce. The wealth transfer is not a permanent problem of Bitcoin, only a bootstrapping problem.  I'm not even sure if the wealth transfer is detrimental. Maybe one of those super rich early adopters will invest in some awesome new technology that will make all of us 10 times wealthier, who knows?  You are making the assumption that wealth is a static quantity.Anyhow, under free market competition, it's not the always macroeconomically most optimal system that wins. It's the system that is most optimal for each individual (Bitcoin), not for the collective as a whole (InflaCoin).  Bitcoin wins over InflaCoin, despite the wealth transfer, because a) merchants prefer to get paid in Bitcoin, and b) customers prefer to buy Bitcoin. Even if they intend to spend them immediately, InflaCoins offer no advantages over bitcoins. In the real world, you always need to store cash for some amount of time before you can spend it. InflaCoins would offer only disadvantages in this case. Also, it's not clear to me at all how excessive savings would depress the economy. Savings allow people to make sounder investments, which are likely to offer higher returns.  A practical example I can think of is education:  In an economy where people are encouraged to save, more parents will be able to pay for their children's university education, but they may not have the newest gadgets at home. This will eventually lead to a more productive workforce that can afford more gadgets AND an education. And so on...   *InflaCoin is what I am calling an inflationary version of Bitcoin. Their audience demographic confirms the polls on this forum:Females are greatly under-represented at bitcoin.orgAnother reason we should expect further spikes. Your post doesn't make any sense. How exactly is the cost of entering the Bitcoin economy determined by the USD/BTC exchange rate? Eventually, merchants adjust prices to reflect the exchange rate, so the cost of buying a Big Mac is more or less the same, whether you pay for it in BTC, USD, EUR, or gold doesn't make any difference.   The costs of buying BTC area) Conversion costs - these are completely independent of exchange rateb) Risks of your BTC losing value before you spend them - surely these are higher in an inflationary p2p currency?? How exactly would an inflationary p2p currency outcompete Bitcoin?  Any sane person who has the choice to put some of their cash savings into InflaCoin or Bitcoin, will always chose Bitcoin over InflaCoin, provided the two are equal in all other respects.   It was already happening months ago.  Back then it was much easier for a single player to manipulate the market because it was a fraction of today's size. Is such a complex system really necessary?If it is purely a psychological thing, then all we need is an android/iphone client for Joe Average that displays his balance like this by default:70 USD(10 BTC)Client becomes popular, mass psychological issues resolved.  Works because most people can be rather superficial unfortunately.Anyhow, once Bitcoin has matured its value will eventually stabilise or deflate at a few % per year, to reflect general economic growth.  Such a small amount of deflation will not anger Joe Average, I don't think.
How would you achieve this without making the system vulnerable to corruption?Who enforces the exchange rate? Who chooses the basket? Who gets to vote? How do you prevent double voting? In a way, we already have community driven inflation targets, because changes in the bitcoin protocol will only be successful if the majority of users agree with them.  A community-driven target will always be deflationary because people who already own BTC would never "vote" for inflation that decreases the value of their savings. Your concept of pegging the exchange rate by the community is thus flawed.  Which leaves some central authority to peg the exchange rate (the developers?).  But that would nullify the main advantage of Bitcoin. I would go as far as saying that it is impossible to make a currency decentralised and fixed to a basket at the same time.  A decentralised currency must be free floating by its very nature.  If you can think of a solution that proves me wrong, please let me know!  No, Bitcoin is not perfectly democratic but it doesn't need to be. In fact, that would be detrimental because casual users are more vulnerable to being tricked into using a fraudulent client than expert miners. No, Bitcoin is not perfectly anonymous but most users don't need perfect anonymity.  The few ones that do can approach perfect anonymity arbitrarily at a relatively low cost.No, Bitcoin is not perfectly secure but nothing in this world is. On top of its technical security, Bitcoin is also secured by the social aspect. Above all, Bitcoin is a social convention, not just a piece of software.No, Bitcoin is not safe against every conceivable DoS attack but neither is the internet itself.  Conclusion: Bitcoin is far from perfect but it still beats any money that was ever invented, by far. The European banking system is a lot better than the American one, but that is because the EU government forces banks to be more costumer friendly, not because it's a competitive market.This heavy regulation simply forces banks to find different, sometimes hiddens ways to cover their costs. Regulation cannot change the fundamental inefficiencies of the present banking system.   For example: bank transfers may be free in the Eurozone, but opening a bank account with any kind of extra functionality can easily incur charges of EUR 200 per year in some European countries.Also, bank transfers are horribly slow. A bitcoin transaction takes an hour to confirm at most, an IBAN transfer can take several days. (This might change soon though because there is no technical reason transfers should take this long)Needless to say, bank accounts can be frozen, IBAN transfers are reversible, and third parties can access information about your balance. This is just a lot harder to do than with paypal. I suspect that such a virus already exists.It is silently spreading and collecting wallet.dat files as we speak.Once it has incubated for long enough it will spend all balances at the same time. This strategy will maximise its profit. By the time infected users find out about it, it's too late. Mtgox used to publish the full order sheet but then for some reason they reverted to showing only the cropped version.Not sure why.  Perhaps some traders were trying to manipulate the market by placing large asks a safe distance above the highest bid, in order to scare people into selling their BTC cheaply.  There was some evidence for that a while ago. Perhaps mtgox thinks that placing orders that you intend to retract as soon as the price moves is an abuse of their site.This is pure speculation on my part of course. You forgot three more: mobile, replicable, and hideable.And gold is certainly lacking in all three of those.1) Moving larger quantities of gold from A to B is risky, expensive, and labour intensive.  Moving BTC from A to B is trivial. 2) Since gold is physical, if you lose it, it's gone forever. You can't keep a backup anywhere.  BTC, encrypted and backed up in several places, is practically impossible to lose.3) Finally, it's very difficult to protect your gold against confiscation/theft by despots and other thugs who are powerful enough and determined enough, as history has shown time and again.In fact, gold's track record as a safe store of value is pretty lousy given how many times in history people have lost their gold through methods 1) 2) and 3). This happened on a massive scale as recently as WWII.Really, people just used gold throughout history for lack of better options, not because gold is such good money.As the saying goes ... technology is everything that was invented after you were born.  Gold depends on technology just like Bitcoin, although older technology.  Without safes and guns to protect it, scales and density meters to measure it, and ships to carry it across oceans, gold isn't awfully useful either. Bitcoin only needs a very rudimentary low bandwidth internet to keep going. For the internet to stop working totally and  permanently, the world would have to be so fucked that it would be the end of "civilized history" as you put it.  In that kind of Madmax scenario, gold too would lose its usefulness for above reasons. Bitcoin is perfectly capable of surviving a temporary breakdown of the internet as a result of war or natural disaster. The blockchain is duplicated on millions of machines around the world. It is sufficient for just of few of them to survive in order to reboot the Bitcoin network. A few people would lose their wallets of course but not those who backed them up diligently.  For instance, a QR code of an encrypted version of your private key, printed on a piece of paper, even engraved on a sheet of metal, could easily survive an EMP. Bitcoin is far more durable than you think. 1. Extract private key from wallet.dat2. Split data into 100 equal chunks.3. Encode each chunk in a human-memory friendly format.  You know, like 01101000101011 translating to "Pink elephant telephones dirty saxophone" or something like that.4. Ask 300 of your friends to memorize one chunk each.  Each chunk is memorized by 3 friends for the sake of redundancy.  They are distributed in an order only know to you to ensure they will be reassembled correctly.  Perhaps you could offer your friends a small monetary award for correctly reciting their chunk once a year. Correctness is verified by comparing with the 2 other friends who memorized the same chunk.5. Memorize the order in which your friends were assigned the chunks and destroy all physical traces of it.6. Destroy all traces of wallet.dat and private key Solution: Nested hidden volumes. The question is: How far must you nest until courts believe they have really arrived at the last layer? I'd say 100 times at least   Bitcoin is whatever the market decides it is.  Even if Bitcoin was used purely as an investment vehicle it could still become a large and sustainable economy in its own right.Yes there is.  Every time anyone in history has managed to raise productivity simply by doing things more cleverly, new wealth was created without the need for extra work. This new wealth is effectively free money emerging out of thin air.  Bitcoin is one such example. Buying BTC isn't illegal today.Most Western nations prohibit the passing of ex post facto laws in their constitutions, so whatever the legal status of Bitcoin may be in future, you cannot be prosectuted for buying them today if you live in one of those countries.As soon as your country illegalizes Bitcoin flat-out (unlikely IMO) you will have to destroy all your BTC of course. The best way to destroy your BTC is to encrypt your wallet.dat with a really long password and to then to forget the password.  One day your government might lighten up and decriminalize Bitcoin and then maybe you'll remember your password again out of sheer joy, who knows?  Careful though,  forgetting passwords is illegal in some countries.   PeterSchiff, are you an adherent of the Labour Theory of Value by any chance?How much money we make has very little to do with how much we work.  Our ability to make money is almost entirely a result of the capital we have access to, and you are no exception to that.  Like it or not, that is simply how a modern free economy works.I make 100 times more money per hour than an Indian rice farmer.  Is this because I work 100 times harder than him? Of course not, in fact he probably works a hell of a lot harder than me. Is it because I am more intelligent? I doubt it, human beings have roughly the same cognitive skills regardless of their culture and technological state.  It is simply because I have access to:* Financial capital - Assets that I inherited, assets my employer allows me to use, etc.* Social capital - I know people who can help me accessing high paying jobs.* Information capital - My education, my superior internet access, etc.* Political capital - if the Indian rice farmer decided to move to Europe and compete with me, the friendly government I am living under would point a gun to his head and kindly ask him to return. * Cultural capital - I was brought up to think innovatively and independently....and the rice farmer doesn't.So if you think it's wrong to make money from capital and that we should all just be making money from work alone, we would probably all end up living like Indian rice farmers.  Are you prepared to do that? No? Who is the real hypocrite then? PS. Bitcoin will give the Indian rice farmer access to capital that was so far withheld from him by the banking elites.  The nice thing about bitcoin-otc is that it's the only place where Paypal will continue to be an option for the foreseeable future, at least for the small amounts that newbies will typically be buying.A user friendly interface for bitcoin-otc would be fantastic. Unfortunately I lack the manpower to develop it.   Why don't you have a go? imagine if this was 1850 ...Careful with using history as a guide.  Longevity by itself does not guarantee stability. There is nothing special about gold.  The only reason it has lasted as a money for 5,000 years is because there was no superior alternative for certain financial needs.  P2P cryptocurrencies may change that situation in a very short time. IMO there is a real possiblility that gold will lose its status as a major exchange vehicle within less than a decade.  The result will be a crash in the price of gold that reflects its value in jewellery and electronics alone.  Charging for Skype-to-Skype calls would be just as ridiculous as charging for each email you send from MS Outlook. I don't believe Microsoft would ever do something that stupid. Everyone except a few oldies expects VOIP to be free.  If Microsoft did that, it would infuriate 95% of Skype users who would run to Gtalk.What is more likely to happen is that they will start charging for the Skype client and continue offering a lightweight client for free, which would be fair enough IMO.MS isn't the control freak that it used to be, in fact, MS is a much more relaxed company than Apple in this respect despite its uptight image. I predict that Skype will start accepting BTC as payment before the end of this year.  Let's see if I'm right... This isn't hypothetical. This has arleady started to happen. See example:http://torrentfreak.com/u-s-government-seizes-bittorrent-search-engine-domain-and-more-101126/It might be a good deterrent for organisations like ICANN not to risk loosing control of the internet by being too authoritarian.  There will be competitors. The hyperinflationary ones won't last.The winning p2p cryptocurrency might not be Bitcoin, but the concept of a p2p cryptocurrency offers new features that are in high demand with a lot of people in the world, so it's more than just a fun new toy that will lose its appeal after the hype is over.Why are you so absolutist about Bitcoin's future?  Complete failure <=> Huge success  is a false dichotomy. There is no reason that Bitcoin can't remain sustainable as a secondary currency such as the CHF or silver, or even as a niche product. One of the closest things to Bitcoin prior to its arrival was Liberty Reserve.According to  Google Trends, Bitcoin has already overtaken Liberty Reserve in popularity.http://www.google.ch/trends?q=bitcoin%2C+%22liberty+reserve%22Liberty Reserve has been a successful niche product for several years now.  Why can't Bitcoin? I have so many wallets lying around in so many different places, different computers, virtual machines, usb sticks, gmail attachments, mobile phones, that I have no idea how many bitcoins I actually "own" anymore. I might have forgotten about some of those wallets, who knows? One of these days when I have the time I should try to tidy it all up.  The only amount that I know for certain I've lost so far is 0.05 BTC back in Oct 2010.  I'm a bit confused.I've re-read thread and the github page but couldn't find an answer for this:When is a domain name definitely tied to a namecoin address?after ./namecoind name_new  ?or after ./namecoind name_firstupdate ?how much does each of those actions cost? I've done business with Nanaimo Gold before and he always honored his end of the bargain. Can't believe diffuculty is already 512. It took Bitcoin almost two years to reach this.  I guess I'll just have to buy them... clarified, should have read the whole thread...
I've sent you 1 BTC.Please send Namecoins to 1PRTWnYmnTud5qia1KrpfpXwxPmov6ps7B Bitcoin has applications for which it is uniquely suitable. There lies its potential IMO, not in competing with existing currencies and payment systems.  It will enable new business models that could not have existed without Bitcoin and that will depend on Bitcoin.  I agree that it may remain a niche currency, but I don't think it will ever disappear completely. Or a least it will be replaced by another p2p cryptocurrency.It is very hard for us to imagine today what those business models might be, just like people could not have imagined in 1990 that Facebook is a viable business model.  Perhaps Bitcoin will even evolve into something whos prime use isn't a currency at all.  As for the dot com bubble, the "new paradigm" did create real added value, this just took a longer time than most people expected, and the added value was grossly overestimated. If you had invested in the right companies you would have made money. If the Argentinian government can't even stop a black market running on cash, how is it going to stop a black market running on Bitcoin?Bitcoin is easier to conceal than cash, and harder to detect.  He was perfectly honest about it, though!He may be a nihilist but I don't believe he is dishonest. Not until I see evidence that he has broken a mutual agreement of some sort.  Not necessarily. Most Swiss Francs in circulation are held by people who don't live in Switzerland.  Same could happen to BTC if it's perceived as an currency that won't lose its value.  Change in the legal system happens very very slowly, and the internet moves lightning fast. It will take politicians and judges years to even get their head around what a p2p cryptocurrency is in the first place, and by that time their 10-year old daughters will be using Bitcoin as in-game currency for MMOGs.  The major potential I see for Bitcoin are not so much large retailers but small entrepreneurs, freelancers, and the grey market, especially in developing countries where a lot of trade happens off the radar anyhow. Even in richer countries like Italy there is a huge underground economy that the government struggles to tax or regulate.  It is going to be almost impossible to enforce a Bitcoin ban in this sector. That would be even harder than trying to enforce a ban on cash!Many of the slums in the world's megacities are a cash-only economy, because a lot of slum dwellers don't even have documents, let alone a bank account.  This isn't a small economy though.  In 3-5 years time every favelado in Rio is going to own a smartphone.  Imagine what an improvement Bitcoin would offer for them compared to cash.  When the Brazilian government  struggles to keep the armed gangs under control, do you really think that enforcing a Bitcoin ban is going to be high on its list of priorities? They've got other things to worry about! Anyhow, I think it's unlikely that Bitcoin will be banned outright in the West. What we are more likely to see are attempts to regulate it, and prosecution of individual users rather than the network as a whole.   See the history of bittorrent for an analogy. It's certainly terrible for Mtgox. But is it terrible for Bitcoin?  If the success of a whole currency can be threatened by something as minor as a DDoS attack on a single website, then it isn't any better than a centralised currency and it has failed to achieve its goals. I am optimistic and believe that it can't. This community is very good at reorganizing around damage. It arleady proved resilience when mtgox and bitcoin market were attacked for the first time in Oct 2010. Tipping is not the killer app IMO because there is nothing that Bitcoin does much better about tipping that other centralised tipping services don't arleady do.   No, it won't make return policies unworkable. Computer hardware retailers already  operate in a deflationary economy.  The price of their products deflates by about 30-50% every year, yet they seem to be doing fine, even in jurisdictions where a 30 day return policy is mandatory.  If you buy an Intel processor or external HD it's very likely that 30 days later it has alread dropped in price.So what is their solution? I guess they already factor in the losses from returns into their prices. Simple as that.Also, don't forget that even in an inflationary economy, a lot of returned goods cannot be resold for the original price anyhow, because the packaging is damaged.Anyhow, I doubt that once Bitcoin is a mature currency deflation will be higher than 30-50% Depends how fast Bitcoin grows and how big it becomes. If Bitcoin becomes the world's dominant currency by 2020 and most of the world's population keeps their cash savings in Bitcoin, then most of the world's computing power will go into Bitcoin mining.Not only that, most of the world's electricity will go into Bitcoin mining. The total computing power will continue halving every 4 years but it would take until 2030-2040 until Bitcoin mining is no longer the world's biggest consumer of computing power and electricity. Forget power stations. Eventually they too will be uncompetitive.Polymer solar cells can be made extremely light and thin (100 nm) and are potentially very cheap to manufacture. Their biggest disadvantages are low lifetime, quick degradation when exposed to oxygen (requiring expensive coatings), and low yield (3-5% in commercial applications).But those disadvantages don't matter in space. I envision square kilometer nanofilm sheets, each sheet weighing no more than 100 kg.  A single Atlas V rocket could launch 200 square km worth of these fragile soap bubble thin collectors  into low earth orbit, where they begin the slow process of unfolding. The sheets have nano-tube based circuits integrated into their entire surface.  Bitcoin generation doesn't happen a few meters from the electricity source, it happens a few atoms from the electricity source.No need to transmit electricity back  to Earth, only low bandwidth data.After they reach their end of life they simply disintegrate in the atmosphere, but replacement is continuous.Eventually those sheets could become so numerous that they block a couple of % of sunlight reaching the Earth.Bitcoin not only saves the world from central banking but global warming too!   Bitcoins are not issued by anyone. Not even by miners. Miners merely confirm transactions. Even a block award is nothing more than a confirmed transaction. Patriarch Act thus not applicable.  I must admit he has a point there. DDoS attacks do not violate the non-aggression principle, so in an anarchy they are fair game.But just because you're not violating the non-aggression principle doesnt mean you are not being a huge asshole. DDoS attacks are an exploitation of the website owner's generosity and violation of the good faith principles that keep the internet running. (the tragedy of the commons that allows spam and DDoS  is an inherent design flaw of the internet but that is a different topic)This attack was a minor inconvenience for the community, but his ruined reputation is real autoregulation in action.  Does it matter? If Namecoin reaches critical mass, most people will stick with the system that came first and simply ignore ICANN's conflicting .bit or .web assignments. Remember, ICANN can't force anybody to use their root nameserves.  Even for a non-geek user all it takes to circumvent ICANN is a browser plugin, and I assume that this type of plugin would be turned on by default on a Firefox download, if Namecoin were ever to become mainstream. The real question is, should the bitcoin wiki allow links to  Christian DMT Users? Even when it's legal in Brazil  (well only if you are a Christian that is)? Bitcoin will decimate the banking industry for the same reason that the internet decimated the travel agent industry.Yes, they are good at securely handling currency, but only with big overheads.It won't stop being a valuable service, but securely handling BTC is a lot cheaper and less labour intensive than securely handling USD or EUR.A bitcoin vault service run by computer security experts would probably only need need 1/10th of the employees as an equivalent sized bank, and it would probably offer superiour security at that. Great idea. I like the speed and simplicity of the whole thing.It's bit like keeping some cash hidden under the doormat for emergencies.  To me it looks more like a bohrble. The potential for non-criminal activity is even greater.  Bitcoin enables all sorts of innovative new businesses that were not possible before. It will boost free trade and empower a new generation of freelancers and small entrepreneurs. It will give the world's poorest people access to a "bank account". I could give you many more examples how it will make most of us better off if it succeeds.Most technological advancements facilitate certain crimes. The automobile facilitated kidnappings and drive by shootings. The internet facilitated credid card fraud.  Chemistry facilitated the holocaust.But try to see the bigger picture. They also bring huge societal benefits that far outweigh the detriments. If your aim is to stop criminals by denying yourself the technologies that might help them to commit crimes, you have to reject other technologies too, not just bitcoin. And don't forget that Bitcoin can also be used to combat crime.Sit back and enjoy the ride. See bitcoin for what it is - just a tool.The 21st century will be scary but wonderful.
Well maybe we should expect them to learn about it. Basic computer literacy should be considered just as important as the three Rs these days.I've not saying that Joe Sixpack should be expected to understand the mathematics of encryption, but he should have a conceptual notion of what comprises a good password, the most common attack scenarios, what a firewall does, backup strategies, redundance, etc .Almost everybody can learn those basic concepts if they want to.  The problem I see with a lot of older people especially is not a lack of ability but a lack of motivation to deal with computers.  If a computer is suddenly more than just a novel way of shopping and mailing letters, and a big part of their savings is at stake, I bet that the motivation will appear.      The problem is that it's extremely hard to achieve user friendliness and strong security at the same time.  It might even be impossible. There seems to be a fundamental law that greater security must always come at the cost of less user friendliness. The best compromise I can think of is a piece of hardware, perhaps a smartphone, used exclusively for bitcoin.  This device takes the user's fingerprint and a password before every transaction. It has an extremely restrictive firewall.  The advantage of using a separate device is that it's simple to use and the amateur user can't compromise system security by installing software from third parties.Automatic wallet encryption is not very secure at all, because the trojan/virus only has to sit and wait for the next time the user sends some bitcoins for the unencrypted version to appear on the OS.  There is also the problem that modern operating systems are getting increasingly complex and who knows where cached copies of the unencrypted wallet might be hiding, even if the copy visible to the bitcoin client is encrypted?Giving users a false sense of security is worse than no security.The market will no doubt one day offer solutions for non-geek users, such as my example of the "bitphone". Demand for them will soar once there are a few highly publicised cases of bittheft.  I fear that the fear is what it will take for a decent product to emerge. Unfortunately that's the way humans work. They grossly underestimate the risk from events that have never occurred (yet).  Web of trust could solve this problem in a modified wiki.  Editors log in with a GPG signature and everybody sees their own version of the page.  Edits from people with a negative trust metric in your web of trust are ignored on your version.  Similarly, you can choose your edits to be censored from those people.Still leaves the problem with what the public global page should censor. IMO the domain name owner should decide, not the community. email addresses are as "real" as it gets for hardware agnostic freelancing air tramps. The notion that a street address somehow increases legitimacy is absurd. These can be rented from virtual office companies just like email addresses.    Not even Satoshi uses his meatspace identity. There are good reasons not to apart from dodging accountability. Why should we impose such an invasive requirement on traders?What matters more than a meatspace identity is a persona that has a reputation to lose in the community, anonymous or otherwise.    Evolved currencies do have two distinct types of value though, exchange value and non-currency value.  They were traded for their non-currency uses before they became currencies.  That places a limit on how far they can fall when people stop trusting them as currencies.For a designed currency like Bitcoin that lower limit is close to zero. Perhaps Bitcoins do have some value apart from exchange value, like novelty and collectability, but that value is negligible compared to the current market valuation.When people start "abusing" the main chain for non-monetary transactions such as DNS assignments, and a thousand other creative uses that we can't even imagine right now, then Bitcoin will start gaining substantial non-currency value too. Bitcoin could be really useful for the CIA one day because it's a good way to sneak money across borders without detection, eg. to pay informants in totalitarian regimes. In private, the CIA and other secret services may be delighted by the new possibilities a tool like Bitcoin gives them, but that does not necessarily mean that the governments those secret services work for will endorse Bitcoin publicly.  Great idea. Since obituaries only require a few tens of Bytes, maybe less if compressed, storing them in the Bitcoin main chain isn't very costly either. I don't see how an alternative chain for obituaries will become popular, since people will always regard the main chain as the more trustworthy and durable alternative, and even if the cost of encoding an obituary in Bitcoin transactions amounts to $10 it's still a lot  less than a newspaper charges.Obituaries should be digitally signed, by at least two signatories with a high rank in the deceased person's GPG web of trust.  Otherwise the system regards them as hoaxes.Alternatively, the super-paranoid could use "dead man switch" obituaries. One potential use of block chain obituaries would be anonymous life insurance.   My guess is that London is the most optimal place in the world in terms of average air/train fare paid by conference visitor.  Not only in places with an abundance of energy, also at times with an abundance of energy.Making energy is the easy part, getting the energy to the place where it is needed at the time it is needed is what makes most alternative energy sources uncompetitive compared to oil.The nice thing about Bitcoin is that you can take generation to where and when the energy is being made rather than the other way around. There are very few applications like that.Therefore, market forces will ensure that Bitcoin generation makes use of energy that few other applications can use. In many cases, it will be energy that would have gone to waste anyhow, for example, surplus output from wind farms during very windy nights.  The chief developer, Satoshi Nakamoto, arleady has dropped out, and the value did not plummet. It didn't matter because the bulk of the work had already been done and Gavin is just doing the fine tuning now. I remember it was only about 9 months ago that Gavin was still struggling to understand the code, and now he is the chief developer. That's how fluid this community is.Will Gavin still be the chief developer 2 years from now? Will the official Bitcoin client even be used by anyone but geek users? I doubt it. The point is there is not one closed group working on Bitcoin, there are several independent groups. Example: an entrepreneur in Zimbabwe might design a mobile Bitcoin client aimed at Zimbabweans. None of the developers could do anything to prevent this client from joining the Bitcoin network.  Other example: Someone writes a client designed for storing DNS assignments or other non-monetary transactions in the block chain. Again, nobody could prevent that client from joining the network.Other example: There might be several competing block chains in fututre, some deflationary and some inflationary, to cater for different ideologies. We simply do not know Bitcoin will be used 3-5 years from now. If other disruptive technologies are any measure, it's likely to be used by a diverse group of communities, for diverse purposes, some very different from the original intent, some of which we can't even imagine right now. It's unlikely though that there will still be a "common enterprise".   Any new technology can be used for both good and bad things.  There is nothing unique to Bitcoin about this.Inventors and champions of new technology cannot be held personally responsible for what people choose to do with that technology. If they were, it would be a return to the middle ages where technological development ground to a halt.  Given his expert cryptography and programming knowledge, I find it hard to believe that he has not published a single academic paper, not even a master thesis, not made a single conference presentation, not posted on a single forum (except this one), and not been involved in any other open source coding projects. Why would he use his real name just with Bitcoin and not other projects?Perhaps he is a 15-year old self-taught genius, but the more plausible explanation is that he is a professional cryptographer who chose a pseudonym to protect himself against bullying. Also, why would a 15-year old genius use LaTeX to publish the Bitcoin white paper? LaTeX is a specialised package used almost exclusively in academia. A Paypal transaction takes 6 months to confirm. That I call extremely inconvenient. Saying that "software developers ensure Bitcoin's technical and money-supply properties" is inaccurate.What ensures Bitcoin's properties is not the software, it's the conventions that the community has agreed upon, the protocol if you like.   The actual software isn't that critical. Bitcoin does not even need an "official" piece of software. It can happiliy function with several independent clients from different developers as long as those clients adhere to the protocol.  But even developers have very limited power to change the protocol.At this early stage the protocol is still undergoing minor modifications but at some point it will be set in stone, and require no further "maintenance".Even though the bootstrapping of Bitcoin did require a conscious design effort, its long term usage may not.  It is no more a "common enterprise" than the social convention that a piece of rare metal is used as a currency. usb stick under the mattress.duh. Na ja, bin zwar nur ein "Expat" aber trotzdem Wahlschweizer. Zaehtl dass? Ein zweites Meeting in Zueri ware nett.  Habe das letzte verpasst... only way to protect yourself from Sauron's tempation is never wear ring, evar.only way to prevent your bitcoins be stolen is never spend them, evar. Not much would happen. People would quickly move to a different exchange.  Mtgox and Bitcoin Market were crippled by scammers in Oct 2010 and it didn't threaten the project seriously. This proves that the bitcoin community is pretty resilient and flexible.  This is how i see the future: bitcoin block chain for big transactions. Ripple (or similar) for small transactions denominated in btc. The two technologies complement each other ideally Bump, because Namecoin has been announced.My offer still stands. Will we award this bounty?
If everything costs $0 it doesn't matter if everyone earns $0.Those people have a good point, they are just a few decades (centuries?) early. Until the post scarcity economy arrives money will remain a necessary evil. So your definition of a RealManTM (whatever that means) is someone who takes an irrational risk based on ideology rather than a sober cost-benefit calculation.  That's romantic and cute, and I kind of admire your optimism.But personally I prefer not to put 95% of my wealth behind a technology that may be brilliant, but is still in beta stage and has lots of possible failure scenarios. I guess that makes me a non real man.      Who cares?The world is full of idiotic laws that make all sorts of everyday activities illegal, but people do them anyhow. The important question is not whether Bitcoin is illegal but to what extent legislation applicable to Bitcoin is enforceable.De facto, that's all that matters.  Switzerland already tolerates a non-government currency, albeit a heavily regulated one.Anyhow, I don't think it will be Switzerland because the Swiss, especially the ones working for government, tend to be very old-fashioned and set in their ways.  They are not exactly on top of the latest technological developments and they are really slow to take up any manner of change.  One example: I always amazes me how the authorities here still refuse to recognise email as means of communication, 15 years after email has gone mainstream. Even for the most trivial messages they insist on sending snail mail letters, which means that communications that could be resolved in days can drag on for months.  The Swiss government taking up something as whacky as Bitcoin? I don't see it happening. Like most things they will start doing it 10 years after everyone else. IcelandBecause it's small, has a tech-savvy population, a resentment of centralised currencies, and a spirit of freedom and independence. Not everyone is an attention whore. If I had created Bitcoin I wouldn't step out either. I would just sit back and watch it unfold while enjoying my wealth.  Also, cryptography innovators have a history of being persecuted, even by the most "free" governments.Why risk a lifetime of being bullied just for a little bit of superficial status and recognition from people you don't know?  Total hashing power is roughly proportional to the exchange rate.At present no government or corporation is going to bother attacking Bitcoin because it's far too small and obscure.When the Bitcoin user base grows, so will its value, and so will the hashing power.By the time Bitcoin becomes so large that governments start feeling threatened by it, the exchange rate will have climbed to over $100 USD/BTC hopefully.Feeling threatened is one thing, but until a large bureaucratic institution actively starts fighting Bitcoin, several more years may pass.  Governments and large corporations have a track record of being slow to react to paradigm-shifting technologies. Treat it the same way as receiving "too much" cash in the mail from an anonymous sender.I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not sure what the legally correct reaction would be in this case.  Destroy the money? Put it in a safe until the situation is clarified? Hand it over to the authorities?    Either way, you can do the electronic equivalent of all those things with Bitcoins too.  What's "essential" for each individual depends on their subjective viewpoint.  Maybe skydiving gives some people great fulfillment in live, maybe they could not be happy without skydiving. How do you know? It is very arrogant dictating to others what you think is "essential" to them.PS. The societal benefits of a car driving majority are outweighed by the societal ill effects, but that's a whole different topic...  Speed limits don't work very well because they are fighting the symptom. It's certainly true that degree of injury and likelyhood of death increases sharply with crash speed. But the likelyhood of crashing in the first place depends mainly on the driver's attitude+behaviour, not their speed. Here's my theory:The vast majority of idiot drivers also happen to be fast drivers. So, even though not all fast drivers are idiot drivers, the idiot drivers are disproportionally represented among fast drivers.  Statistically, this means fast drivers crash more often than slow drivers giving the appearance that speed is causing the crashes. The wonderful thing about a p2p project such as Bitcoin is: If you want something to get done, you don't lobby a central authority in the hope that they will listen, instead you just get straight to work and do it yourself. So go ahead, police away!And when you're done with the policing come back and tell us how it went. I'll be very curious to learn about your effective strategy of ostracising Silk Road from the Bitcoin network.  I certainly can't think of any myself. Blatantly illegal activity also goes on with cash, and on mobile phone networks, and on bittorrent. Can't remember most governments trying to ban those.  (nb. bittorrent has never been explicitly banned as a technology, it's only illegal to use it in certain ways).Also, didn't napster rely on a centralised server?   I don't get what your point is.The phrases "trading USD against BTC", and "trading BTC against USD" describe the same action.  One uses the seller's perspective, the other the buyer's perspective. That's all. Otherwise they are both equally valid. The rest is just a discussion about semantics. Will a (by Western standards) unenlightened, superstitious, ultraconservative country such as Yemen or Western Sahara tolerate production of gay pornography within its borders? Even if it's a special administrative zone? What about setting up an ecstasy factory? Drawing a cartoon of a fictional prophet? Running a voluntary euthanasia clinic? etc... Because if those things (and others) aren't tolerated, it ain't a "free state".  It is one thing welcoming a no-tax, free trade zone.  (Those places already exist, but still they are highly oppressive in other respects).It is another embracing the concept of sovereign individuals who owe nothing to society and are free to ignore cultural and religious rules. That concept is alien to people in most poor parts of the world.  They will perceive a high degree of social freedoms as a threat to their very existence.  We are talking about incompatible value systems.  It's a much deeper issue than mere economics. A free state, hosted by one some the most unfree states in the world (according to the map on their website), coexisting peacefully?  I'll believe it when I see it.  If this is going to be a special administrative division of some poor country, it means that the country's laws will still apply to some extent, and unfortunately, most poor countries are extremely unfree and oppressive when compared to the West.I see the danger that this is going to become another UAE, where amongst other nasty things, you go to prison for being a rape victim, but hey, living under arbitrary state violence isn't so bad when you're not paying taxes, right? This might happen sooner than we think.  Wikipedia has a lot of things in common with Bitcoin, and I can imagine that some Wikipedia admins who still remember the poineering spirit from the early days of Wikipedia, will want to give the Bitcoin project a chance.  Also, don't forget Jimmy Wales is a libertarian.   Global reputation ratings are not very useful and easy to game.  The GPG web of trust concept is far superior IMO.  It's already in place at bitcoin-otc.  From my understanding, it is in theory possible to "double spend" a transaction in limbo.  If the second attempt with a higher transaction fee makes it into a block, the first attempt will be interpreted as a double spending attempt by miners and simply be ignored. (correct me if I'm wrong)  We will never reach the utopia like stage because as soon as something stops being scarce as a result of productivity boosts and automation, consumption of that thing skyrockets until it becomes scarce again.  There is always a bottleneck somewhere.Correction: The utopia-like stage will be reached once human settlement starts expanding into all directions of the universe, and once indefinite suspended animation is possible.  The universe is so vast that for all practical purposes it offers an unlimited supply of energy and matter.  The only limiting factor will be the time it takes to travel to unsettled places.  Bitcoin is easily replaceable by other, centralised currencies in a game like Farmville.  There isn't a strong enough reason to switch to Bitcoin.Bitcoin needs an open source, decentralised MMO, where game asset ownership must be recorded in a block chain because there is no central authority.  A Diaspora equivalent of Farmville. ICANN has very limited power over the internet. Telecoms companies and ISPs have ultimate power over the internet.Nobody can force those entities to use ICANN's addressing system.  It's a purely voluntary agreement.If ICANN starts screwing up the internet too much, those entities will stop using ICANN and find an alternative address assignment organisation.In the worst case it might lead to a fragmentation of the internet with several independent IP address spaces and domain name spaces.        ICANN knows this too and will be careful to prevent this from happening.
It's not that black and white in my opinion. It's good to be rational, but ignore your emotions at your peril.Kin selection in evolutionary psychology may have wired our brain in such a way that we experience happiness when we sacrifice ourselves for the good of the tribe. Possibly a kind of happiness that is difficult to achieve in any other way. If someone's aim in life is happiness, whatever that means to them, it can be a perfectly rational choice to engage in materially selfless acts such as volunteering in homes for disabled orphans, or finding a cure for AIDS. It doesn't even need to be done publicly, although that has the added benefit of reciprocated social status.Ultimately it does serve a selfish purpose of course - to improve one's own happiness.  I see no contradiction or "lack of integrity" in that.  If it works for you, go for it!  One of the Bitcoin developers would publish an updated version of the client where the difficulty has been reset manually @ the affected block.Most users and miners would accept this change because it's to everyone's benefit. Remeber that nobody is forced to adhere to the Bitcoin protocol. Anyone can use a modified client if they wish. The hard part is convincing other users to accept transactions.    The fact that companies such as Paypal work on such tiny margins and still need to charge 2-3% transaction fees suggests that the whole industry suffers from systemic inefficiencies, and that a shake up is long overdue.Bitcoin doesn't have the costs that those companies have, so it can always out-compete them in terms of transaction fees.  No bonuses, no middle management, no legal departments, no call centers, no red tape, no marketing costs, no office buildings, no dispute resolution, no chargeback, no cost from chasing fraudsters.Sure, Bitcoin suffers from scamming too but these costs are carried by the scammed individuals, not collectively by all users as with Paypal and credit cards.  Bitcoin users rely on a reputation system and  take personal responsibility for how much risk they are prepared to take.   That also removes the moral hazard and reduces system-wide fraud losses.  Bitcoin users can also optionally use escrow, but again then they have to pay for the incurred costs individually. The bulk of Bitcoin purchases hass been from investors so far. Psychology is not an exact science. I personally don't care what titles a psychologist/coach has as long as he does his job well. Titles are just a proof-of-work, as it were.  eg. he may have researched an obscure topic for his post doc that is irrelevant to my needs.  If my coach can prove to to me that his approach is effective, I will require no other proofs.  Every country is unfree in different ways.  You need to choose a place that suits your personal needs best.Russia is very lax on IP enforcement, on the other hand, censorship is pretty bad.  Switzerland has low taxes but regulations can still be complex and pretty draconian, especially when it comes to employing people.Oh, and forget about owning guns as a foreigner. It will take years until they grant you a permit.  Not that you are likely to need a gun for self defense because violent crime is rare. The Swiss themselves don't really see guns the way Americans do; for them shooting is more of a sport/social activity than an anti-government/personal defense thing. Why not? Bitcoin can be very educational. The transactions of a block are encoded into a bouldering problem, that can be replicated on standardised indoor climbing walls anywhere in the world. The first climber to crack the problem in a public competition confirms the block, and gets to keep the transaction fees.video of a climber "solving" such a problem:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH3Mc07xcE I don't care much for ideology. I just go with what works. Having said that, some aspects of Bitcoin induce cognitive dissonance in me because even on a very practical level they challenge societal norms that I have taken for granted my whole life. You are so right. I still haven't bothered to open a Twitter account simply because I find the name so retarded.Obviously, most of the world doesn't seem to share my taste. Not sure if that's true.There is added value to a bank offering a traditional bank account denominated in BTC.For instance, the bank takes care of all the security, and you don't need to worry about your Bitcoins being hacked/stolen/lost. The bank can also insure your Bitcoins in the unlikely scenario that they get stolen from them. Same as  for safety deposit boxes. You're correct, sometimes a "centrally planned" solution is better.Not sure about the social implacations. As it stands the internet is terribly unequal, bandwidth wise. The bandwidth you can get for a Dollar can differ by a factor of 1000 depending where in the world you live, sometimes even in the same country. This inequallity is caused by too much centralisation and lack of competition. If everyone could be "their own ISP", as it were, it would even out a little.  That's going to be a clash of cultures. The LETS bunch are stauch believers in The Labour Theory of Value.Good luck explaining the true nature of money to them. I have a more elegant solution, which would not only prevent spam but also DDoS attacks (both are caused by the fact that the internet is a commons).Every IP packet is signed with the private key of the sender's bitcoin address.Routers will only route packets as long as the packet's sender has a sent bitcoins to that individual router's bitcoin address, and as long as the balance remains positive.Of course the whole process is automated and instantaneous.  So for example, if your packet get stuck somewhere in a router in UK on its way to Germany, that router in UK would request a few microBitcoins from your client, so that it can sent it to the next router.  Say that the same packet is also stuck in a router in Sweden, but that this router offers a lower bid for sending on the packet.  The client could then decide to pay the router in Sweden, and drop the router in the UK (for minimising price) or to pay both routers (for maximising latency and reliability).Perhaps bitcoin transactions can be included in the packet directly for routers the client already trusts.Another advantage of this scheme is that your bandwidth and ping would not be determined by your ISP contract. You can instantly purchase bandwidth on-demand, directly from world market of routers, and the limit would only be your physical connection.The high liquidity of the world router market, as well as the increased competition and absence of contracts and middlemen, would also reduce everyones cost per mbit/s. Only problem is that this would involve building an Internet v2 from scratch.  The bitcoin network would also need to be expanded to somehow allow instant transactions. Write fully autonomous payment handling code that has zero dependency on third-party APIs.Become rich without becoming famous.Don't Trust. Verify.  The divorce lawyer may have taken your house, but he will never get his hands on your Bitcoins.  Your Bitcoins won't be gone once you get out of prison.   The fact that they appear successful compared to other countries in the world is a statistical artefact.Scandinavian countries are tiny and have a very homogenous population.  Finland and Norway only have approx. 5M inhabitants.  That's a similar scale as some counties in the US.If you are going to compare Scandinavian countries to the rest of the world you have to choose a similar granularity. For instance, the state of Massachusetts is just as successful as Sweden by most measures.   The state of New South Wales in Australia is just as successful as Finland.Also, because of their small size, relative isolation, and uniform culture, they were historically very community-oriented societies, even before the introduction of state socialism.  Most Scandinavians are inclined to voluntarily share their wealth even if the state didn't force them to do it. My personal experience from visiting friends in Sweden is that quality of life is exceptional.  However there can also be dark sides to living there, in subtle ways that are hard to measure.  The degree of intrusion by the collective into your personal life can be a little disconcerting and scary, especially if your values and lifestyle diverge from the societal consensus. Yep, de facto, that's how most of the Bitcoin economy works at the moment. Law of the jungle. Luckly it's a rather benign, plentyful jungle where symbiosis pays better than predation or parasitism. Deruas LLC I try to avoid video streaming because I find the user experience really clunky. I prefer to use video on demand if possible.  The other day I needed to catch a train and 10 minutes before leaving the apartment I realised I wanted to download a few TV shows to watch on the journey. My 100/7 connection allowed me to do this in 2 minutes via the Miro player instead of the 10-20 minutes it would have taken on a "standard" 10/2 connection.  I am a convenience junkie, and I'm prepared to pay an extra $30 a month for those small luxuries.   The difference between Bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme is that all possible outcomes of a Ponzi scheme are win-lose, while Bitcoin also has possible win-win outcomes.
+1I use Myers-Briggs not because it measures an objective truth, but simply because so many other people use it and it's a compact way of getting information across.  The 4 dimensions in Myers-Briggs are somewhat arbitrary, but they can be proxies for fundamental personal traits.  eg. "ENFP" gives me a better idea of what a person is like than just "Artsy". Home cable connection, marketed as 100/7. There's got to be some advantage to leaving the countryside and moving to the big city (well, big by Swiss standards).   Evidence? What you describe is not a new phenomenon and "old money" families are well aware of this problem. Some have devised sophisticated systems to prevent this from happening.     I know of one super rich extended family where all wealth is held by a trust and never inherited to an individual family member.  If a family member wants to access the money in the trust they have to work their way up in the corporate hierarchy of the family company.  The ones who make it to the top become shareholders, but even they don't have the power, individually, to blow it all on yachts and hookers.  As soon as they retire they are forced to return all their shares.  This system has been working successfully for 6 generations now, and there is no indication that the family company will fail.  I'm not sure if this kind of condensation of wealth is good or bad. Family companies often make sounder investments because they lack perverse incentives such as bonuses for taking excessive risks or boosting short term profits at the expense of long term sustainability.   Some form of voluntary socialism could be offered by insurance companies and banks.For example, a bank would offer to pay for someone's entire higher education upfront, including an allowance for the cost of living.In return, the student would sign a contract promising to leave 50% of their income (in excess of $20k) to the bank for the next 20 years.The advantage compared to regular student loans, from the bank's perspective, is higher revenues because a fraction of students would pay back the loan many times over. The advantage from a student's perspective is less risk. The student would not need to take out a loan that they may struggle to pay back, in order to enjoy university or vocational training.   A higher education does not guarantee a higher income, it only increases the likelihood.  In order to remain profitable, aptitude tests would be necessary to avoid too many free riders from joining who will never be able or willing to earn more than $20k.  That's the main difference to true socialism, where every member of society is included. True, even then this scheme would still have a lot of free riders who take more than they give, but that is true for many insurance products, and that doesn't prevent them from being profitable either.A similar scheme could be used for health insurance:  "We will pay upfront for a state-of-the-art cancer treatment if you leave us 50% of your income for the next 20 years".For housing: "We will save you from eviction and buy your house from your creditors. You may live in there for free for the next 20 years but must leave 50% of your income."etc. Both metric and imperial suck.Metric sucks because it's base 10 and that makes it inconvenient to divide by 3 or 4. Imperial sucks because it's base 12 system of measurements expressed in a base 10 numeral system.   (ignoring the fact that imperial sometimes uses other bases than 12,  adding even more unnecessary comlplexity) The ideal system would use base 12 for both measurements and numerals. Or even base 60.The reason most of the world doesn't use that system has nothing to do with govenment coercion and everything to do with historical precedent/ critical mass.Same reason most of the world uses QWERTY and not Dvorak keyboards.We should stick to metric for Bitcoin because metric is already used by most of the world (even Americans) for financial purposes. It gives Bitcoin a kind of wild west image.  I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.To me, things like this remind me how pioneering the Bitcoin universe still is.If you want to be where the exciting stuff is happening in history you can't expect everything to be safe and predictable. As for "unacceptable", I was always aware that mtgox is a homebrew project like most Bitcoin businesses, and I am happy to keep supporting them/him nontheless. I never expected their reliability and security to be on a par with Bloomberg.   It's an entertaining clash of cultures.  Bitcoin is a bit like going to a Swiss private bank and being attended by a punk sporting facial tattoos and a ripped anarchy t-shirt.People who work with money tend to be very conservative, parochial, risk-averse, authoritarian, uptight, narrow-minded, detail-oriented, left brained, and ISTJ, because traditionally, those traits were advantageous in this industry.The Bitcoin ecosystem contradicts pretty much everything they stand for: It's revolutionary, unpredictable, anti-authoritarian, disruptive, concept-oriented, "weird", right-brained, and rather INTP.It's no surprise these people are not enthusiastic to learn about Bitcoin. There will be a lot of cognitive dissonance once market forces force them to learn about it. Bitcoin ist für Geldwäsche (noch) schlecht geeignet.  Die Bitcoin Transaktionien sind zwar relativ schwer nachzuvollziehen, der Umtausch in EUR, USD... via Überweisung oder selbst Bargeld per Post ist aber alles andere als anonym.Das wird sich natürlich ändern wenn Bitcoin einmal an jeder Straßenecke akzeptiert wird und kein Umtausch mehr nötig ist.Außerdem: Jemand der erfolgreich Geldwäsche betreiben will braucht mehr als nur Anonymität. Er braucht vor allem auch eine legitime Einkommensquelle (zB. ein Restaurant) die gut zum Beimischen vom Schwarzgeld geeignet ist.Sicher, du kannst dein Schwarzgeld in Bitcoin umtauschen und keiner findet es mehr.Aber ausgeben kannst du es dann genauso wenig wie vorher, ohne die Aufmerksamkeit von Behörden zu erregen, zumindest nich im grossen Stil. A local or national currency offers no advantages over a global one. Only disadvantages because it's a subset. Tell me any usp, bitcoin has it too.  Apart from not appealing to a kind of cryptoracist ideology perhaps. With a decentralised, non-revocable payment method, you have more choice as a customer and thus more power.You have the choice to decide which merchants to trust, and how much risk you are prepared to take with the ones you don't trust so much. You have the choice NOT to be protected by "non-delivery insurance", and pay a lower price because you might not need it with merchants you trust a lot. With other merchants who you don't know well you can still get this type of insurance, for instance by using an escrow service.  When you use a chargeback-able method such as VISA, you are giving up control and letting VISA make those choices for you.  And this large overhead will cost you in the end, whether you want it or not.  I don't agree with your concern that merchants would become more dishonest if chargeback wasn't possible. The biggest asset of any online merchant is their reputation, if they want to stay in business long term.   Why would a well established merchant be so stupid as to damage their hard won reputation, just to squeeze out a little bit more short term profit? This is not likely to happen very frequently once Bitcoins become mainstream and people store a serious proportion of their wealth in Bitcoin. The scenario you describe is equivalent to someone burying gold coins in the garden and telling nobody about it until they die.Most sane people don't store gold in this way. They keep it in a bank vault, they insure it, and they leave instructions with their lawyer or notary in case they die. Similarly, most sane people won't store most of their Bitcoins on a single wallet.dat file on their laptop, once Bitcoin becomes mainstream. Unless it's only a small amount.  At the very least they will make several backups and tell a family member about them.  In a highly competitive market, transaction fees, and more worryingly, the network's hash/s, will converge towards zero.  This is because a miner who discovers a new block only has to pay for the cost of proof-of-work, not for the cost of bandwidth and storage associated with that block.  That cost is carried collectively by the rest of the network. Including transactions with zero or near-zero fees incurs practically no additional cost to the individual miner.  So far, I don't think anyone has come up with a solution for this tragedy of the commons.  Of course this is only true once generation of new coins reaches zero. This won't happen before next century so we've got plenty of time to fix this. He uses a mixture of the British spelling -ise and the American spelling -ize in his posts.For instance, in this post he writes "optimise"http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=955.msg12248#msg12248In this one he writes "criticize"http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2151.msg28228#msg28228This suggests that he is not a native English speaker. They tend to use either form exclusively, depending on where they went to primary school.  It would be nice to have a "bitbox". A smartphone-sized piece of hardware used exclusively for Bitcoin. It would have an aggressive firewall that allows no communication except for the Bitcoin protocol and perhaps a simple way to receive Bitcoin addresses from the web/ bluetooth/camera.  Automatic wallet encryption would mean that you have to enter a password before each transaction, but that's no more incovenient than using a credit card.  Perhaps it could include a fingerprint reader?The bitbox would be a way to make strong security accessible to the non-geek user.  Web wallet providers are not a satisfactory alternative IMO.  Except for small amounts of BTC.They are not banks and they carry all sorts of risks of their own. Yes, in future, there will be only a handful of players who will mine the majority of new Bitcoins. We will see the kind of consolidation that happens in most mature industries.By that time however, most of the Bitcoins will already have been mined.  The small, and decreasing rate of Bitcoin production will make it difficult for these players to manipulate the economy.A double spending attack by a cartel of miners is another danger, however:Pulling off a double spending attack is hard enought, pulling it off profitably is nearly impossible.Double spend too much, and users will get pissed off with Bitcoin and move to Bitcoin v2 en masse. The value of Bitcoin will collapse and soon you may find that your loot is worth less than the Billions you have spent on gaining more than 50% of the network's hash/s.Double spend too little, and you may find that you may as well use your computational power for honest generation instead of double spending.  Technically, the network may be vulnerable to double spending by this cartel, but there is also a social barrier. The community can choose to reject blocks from nodes who are known to be dishonest. Bitcoin could have been invented in 1997 and become a mass currency by 2000.The theory was there, the technical tools were there, and the infrastructure to support it was there, since it's a low bandwidth application.It was only a matter of an visionary like satoshi putting all the pieces together.The fact that this took 12 years is a sheer accident of history. The internet economy would probably look quite different today if this had happened sooner. That system is soon becoming reality. Whether it's morally right or wrong is irrelevant.  This system will emerge by itself, regardless of what advocates and opponents do. It's unavoidable.  De facto, nobody will have the power to "assert ownership" over information 20-30 years from now. The whole concept of copyright will be dead, as a simple consequence of the physics of information in the age of Petabyte hard disks and mesh networks. Regarldless of what is written in some law book.  The only reason the whole concept of copyright was practicable in the first place was because it was tied to the technology of a certain era. Not the other way around.Of course business will adapt. Instead of selling information (which nobody will buy because it's non-scarce), creative industries will sell personalised services. The computer games industry has already woken up to this new reality, and it's doing fine.  Overpriced?  Compared to what?So what is the "correctly priced" value of Bitcoin?   Ball park?  $0.1 ?   $0.01 ?   $0.001 ?  And why?No matter which of these numbers you choose, aren't all of them somewhat arbitrary?Currently, the value of Bitcoin is too low to make it a useful currency to buy just ONE house or apartment (approx. $200- $1000 k). The entire Bitcoin economy is worth as much as a handful of houses. That is still miniscule, given the fact that we probably have thousands of users.So the price seems about right to me. It could enable microinvestments that weren't possible before because of excessive red tape.Especially cross-border investments. Think crowdcube.co.uk, except anonymous and global, based on an reputation system instead of contract enforcement.  Without arbitrary and racist restrictions such as "you may not invest because you were born in the wrong place".That would be a powerful tool and a boost for the global economy.  For instance, I think that China would grow even faster if Bitcoin could be used to circumvent the Chinese government's draconian restrictions on capital inflow. Today, if you want to invest in a Chinese business, a) you need to be a large investor and b) you need to make concessions to the Chinese government.  I am sure that this puts off a huge number of potential investors.  An idea like crowdcube could never penetrate to the aspiring Mark Zuckerbergs in the Chinese market, but Bitcoin could change that.  DNS blocking is still relatively harmless.  Nobody is forced to use the "official" DNS. When they start blocking IP addresses and ports, however, then it will start to become really scary.
Doesn't it?I worked at a place once that used a supercomputer for numerical simulations.The average load was only around 50%. The reason is that peak capacity was only required at certain times of the day when lots of users submitted jobs at once and wanted a quick result.  Since most jobs lasted less than 12 hours, the supercomputer was usually just working at 10-20% capacity between 1am and 7am.What is interesting about the 1am-7am period, is that in some parts of the world electricity generated simply gets "dumped" at the power station, because powering down and up again would be even more inefficient. I suspect that eventually some clever entrepreneur will form a joint venture with a power company and offer a leasing deal for supercomputer customers, where they can get a reduced rate if they allow mining in the 1am-7am period. Your example illustrates that for a lot of miners, it is the marginal cost of mining that determines how many hash/s they contribute, not the total cost.In the long term, this is bad news for commercial miners who need to recoup their total investment (marginal + fixed cost) to stay in business.There will always be someone, somewhere in the world competing against them for whom the marginal cost is zero, and who doesn't care about fixed cost.  The core users of Bitcoin tend to be some flavour of libertarian, so the fact that we don't censor non-violent, consentual activities will not bother them. The average joe user is never going to get as far as the forum anyhow. He will more likely use a web wallet provider than download the actual client.The only danger that I see is that some tabloid journalist stumbles upon theses things and sees an opportunity for an outrage piece.Bitcoin being so popular that it gets attention from tabloid journalists, that would be a nice problem to have. I buy Bitcoins both for investment and spending.  My investment account currently holds more BTC than my spending account.Tell someone at a dinner party that you invested EUR 100 in a fully virtual internet currency in beta testing stage, with no backing and no guarantees.  They will probably think you are a gullible fool who throws away his money.  Yet large numbers of people, even very intelligent people, happilly spend EUR 100 a year on lottery tickets.  Maybe I'm just a hopeless optimist regarding new technologies, but somehow the odds of making millions with a Bitcoin investment seem vastly superior to the lottery. I must admit that morally and easthetically, I don't like the idea of "easy money". But I've come to realise that few people in the world ever got rich just by trading their labour for money.  If I don't invest in Bitcoin, somebody else will, and that person is just as undeserving as I am.  You sound like an extremist yourself. A balance extremist. I believe that balance and moderation is a good strategy in some areas of life, but that absolutism (I prefer to call it consistency) is a preferrable strategy in other ares of life.  For instance, I am an extreme and absolute in my views on slavery. If I was alive in 1800 I would have argued that slavery should be abolished altogether.  Many of my contemporaries from the moderation camp would called my views absurd, unrealistic, utopian, dangerous and so on.  They would have argued for "balanced" solutions such as giving slaves more rights or reducing the number of slaves, or trying to find a compromise between slaves and slave owners.  Now in hindsight it turns out they were wrong. The "extreme" solution of abolition was indeed the best for everybody in the long term.Well, you are probably an absolutist too on this issue, so I take back what I said Maybe 100 years from now people will look back at us and say "I can't believe this was acceptable back then, even just in moderation!".  Maybe government as we know it is one of those things.Anarchy doesn't mean no law at all. It means that laws emerge spontaneously rathen than being dictated top-down, at least that's what anarchists believe.  I suspect it will become a power law distribution of wealth.Not much we can do about it, and bound to happen in a free market.The presence of some super-rich bitcioners has some advantages too. For instance, one rich entrepreneur who is passionate about making a technology happen (say BitDNS), will get it done a lot faster than a collective of thousands of small investors politicking among themselves.From the point of view of a vendor who accepts Bitcoin, it makes no difference whether a BTC is worth 0.1 USD or 10 USD. None whatsoever. The only thing that does make a difference are monthly and quarterly fluctuations in the BTC value because that makes it difficult to cover his costs in USD.  At least as long as the Bitcoin economy is small and most of his costs are not payable in BTC.  He can protect himself against that through currency hedging, which I think will be on the market soon. Generating is supposed to be hard. Also, generating is not really the point of Bitcoin. Trading is.You can join a pooled mining effort, but with a CPU you can currently expect to generate appox. 0.02 - 0.06 BTC per day. That is if you keep your CPU running 24/7 at full power.  A background trickle process will generate a lot less and expect this number to go down in the next few weeks.  In my opinion, mining is something for enthusiasts/professionals, not for casual/newbie users.If you are really enthusiastic about mining then be prepared to invest at least a few hundred dollars and several hours of your time. Otherwise it's not really worth it. These milestones are meaningful from a psychological point of view, and by extention, from a PR point of view.There are also meaningful for this forum. For several months there has been talk and anticipation about when parity would be reached. Now we can go back and see who made the best predictions. (It turns out that S3052 was spot on) Clouds and mainframes are not the same thing.Mainframe means you have a central physical machine serving several user accounts.Cloud means your computer is virtualised and agnostic of the underlying hardware. A cloud account could be hosted on a central physical machine (eg. Dropbox) or it could be hosted on a p2p network (eg. Wuala). The latter is very different from the terminal+mainframe model.  There are plenty of young people in NYC who are lucky if they can find ONE job, let alone multiple. You cannot change the laws of physics. To reduce latency the data centres would need to be close to peoples' homes which would prevent too much centralisation. There are more are more applications for which low latency is  essential from a user experience point of view. Thin clients are a horrible experience when you try to do anything real-time, interactive with them.  I doubt people will be willing to give up their general purpose computers completely, even if most of their storage moves to data centers. They will sooner outlaw personal transportation (cars, motorcycles) before they outlaw personal computing equipment.  Occam's razor tells me that Satoshi is just a web persona. Going on a ski trip this weekend, so I'll skip this Saturday.I could probably make it next week, any evening except Thursday. I moved to central Zurich now so it should be easy.  It hasn't been thouroughly tested for bugs and DoS attacks. It hasn't been peer reviewed by security experts.Before that happens it's not suitable as a serious and reliable currency. Done.Well, it's a small amount so I've just you sent you the BTC.Please PM me the invite or send it to the email address in the PM. You have been on this forum for a few days only, so how do we know we can trust you? Maybe you can you point to an established reputation elsewhere (eg. ebay ratings, bitcoin-otc)?I will join the auction if in case I am the winner, you send the invite first and I pay second. Also, if you publish your Bitcoin address on this thread beforehand so that I can prove I have paid you.If you agree to these conditions, my initial bid is 0.5 BTC for one invite.Sorry for my paranoia, but we have had a few scammers here trying to trick people out of their Bitcoins.  Who cares if the gold bars are real or fake?It's not like have ever been used, or will ever be used, for anything other than sitting in a safe anyhow.And gold plated lead bars do that job equally well.They're a bit like the Yap money stone that fell into the ocean, that the natives continued trading anyhow because they all agreed among themselves that it must still be down there. If Bitcoin is successful and there is adoption by millions of users, a huge increase in value, perhaps 1000-fold, is unavoidable. Such a strong rally is desirable for a fixed supply currency because it indicates increase in adoption.Also, the higher the value, the more difficult it becomes for a single actor to move the market.As for wild, unpredictable fluctuations, this can be solved trivially with currency hedging and futures trading. Some are working on offering these services. Just give it some time. It's still early days.  +1 exoware.net Set up your own windmill for your household needs and generate bitcoin only when there is excess electricity at peak times. Then you are getting your electricity for free. 
every new technology can be used to facilitate crimes. as long as the societal benefits of the technology outweigh the negative effects, there will be no outcry. for example, I never remember any outcry against mobile phones when they took off, even though they allow terrorists to communicate far more efficiently.  "You can't expect large gains" means that the expectation value of your investment is approx. zero. But that doesn't mean large gains aren't probable.  Even if this is a bubble, it's unlikely to burst as long as there is a steady influx of new users and new businesses accepting Bitcoin.We are still a long way away from market saturation. 10 million users 2 years from now I think is possible, if the history of other p2p networks is any measure. Say that each of those users spends $100 to buy Bitcoins on average.The Bitcion economy would be worth 1 Billion USD and the naive exchange rate would be approx 1 Bln USD / 10 Million BTC = 100 USD/BTC. Popularity != TruthHere is an experience I made at Yahoo!!!Answers!!! a few years ago:Somebody asked what the most aerodynamically efficient shape of an idealised subsonic aircraft fuselage is, given constant volume, and assuming that all else is also constant.Is it a) egg/cigar/penguin shaped ("fat looking")  or b) needle shaped (very long and very thin) ? There were about 10 answers. Every single one of them answered "needle shaped", and every single one was the wrong answer (I confirmed this with a friend who has a PhD in aircraft design).The problem is that none of the respondends were experts in the field of aerodynamics, and they simply chose the answer that seems intuitive, which in this particular case is wrong.Now, Yahoo!!!Answers!!! has a credit system similar to the one you are proposing. People collect points according to how their answers are rated and can spend those points to ask questions.I was the only one who answered the question correctly, and I even went out of my way to explain why the counter-intuitive "cigar shape" is the most aerodynamic. In very simplified terms, it's a sweet spot where the combined losses of dynamic drag and friction are minimised. The result? My answer received lots of negative points, all other answers got rewards. The author of the question even rated one of the wrong answers with 5 stars, and thanked the answerer for his alleged wisdom!I rolled my eyes and cancelled my account.Yahoo!!!Answers!!! is a celebration of ignorance.How do you intend to deal with these kind of perverse incentives? Perhaps, but it would also be detrimental to the reputation of Bitcoin.   Most people in the web industry I know have a low opinion of PTC business models, even the honest ones.  Instead of spreading it too as many people as possible as fast as possible we should be focusing on spreading it to the right (ie. influential) people. Yes, I'm also curious why you think this.I have mailed cash from Europe to North America several times and it never failed to cross the ocean so far. I have been a customer there before. Always worked smoothly. He is probably just busy. Just because you need to trust someone doesn't mean it MUST be centralised.For example: The ripple monetary system relies on nothing BUT trust in order to work, yet it is fully decentralised.  In some ways it's Bitcoin's opposite, since Bitcoin was designed to work without any need of trust whatsoever.The web of trust makes it possible to lend money to a complete stranger who is connected to you via people you trust, and people they trust.  Since they collectively "vouch" for that stranger, you can have a degree of certainty that the stranger will fulfil their promise to you.This kind of system is more trustworthy and resilient than what you are proposing, because it has no single point of failure, and because it's unlikely that you lose all your assets at once.I personally would not trust my wealth to an anonymous website for any kind of extended time period (say 5 years) even if I knew the owner was competent and honest. Too many things could go wrong. Death, disease, bankruptcy, data loss, hackers, government crackdowns...My traditional bank is a safer bet. Here in Switzerland at least, if my bank fails, or screws up, it has an agreement with other banks (not the government, mind you) that they will bail out its customers.  Some kind of insurance by a third party is the least I would expect from an internet bank.my 0.02BTC...  good luck anyhow.  The sentiment is understandable. Many multinational corporations get priviledged treatment by the state, and lobby the state to violently subjugate its own citizens to their advantage (see patent and copyright legislation). But then some of those corporations refuse to reciprocate in return for their priviledges.It is no surprise that the "little man" feels cheated. The proposed solution is of course misguided.When some gang of thugs starts bullying you the answer is not to hire your own gang of thugs to bully the victims subject to the other gang.  worst comes to worst, the bitcoin client can be modified to communicate over email.  perhaps the bitcoin messages will be hidden steganographically inside jpg email attachments.   Webs of trust will prevent government agents from knowing whether a pet photo that I sent to my aunt contains a hidden message or not.  then there are always wireless mesh networks for the last mile distribution.  +1This will just confuse the average user.If you want to do an excercise in forensics you can always use the block explorer. People have a tendency to overinsure themselves against high frequency, low impact events and underinsure themselves against black swan events. Just because some government currency hasn't failed in the last 30 years doesn't mean it can't. Encrypting your "current account" wallet.dat on the HD is no protection against trojans or hackers because sooner or later it must be decrypted again (at the latest when you want to send a transaction).So the first priority should be protecting your system against infiltration.  Use a firewall, don't install too much crap, and only connect via Tor (that way you are not advertising to the whole world - hey eveybody, there is a wallet.dat located at this IP address!).Also, keep your coins in more than one wallet.  Strongly local government is what we have in Switzerland.  The cantons and towns have a high degree of autonomy. Towns can even set their own income tax. Government in Switzerland seems to do a much better job of providing public services than any other country I have lived in.  There is some degree of competition between town governements wooing wealthy migrants, so this gives them an incentive to keep taxes low and quality of services high.  Like you say, there are dark sides to this system too. In some more traditional towns you are basically a second class citizen if you weren't born there, but if you don't like that you can move to Zurich which is full of foreigners. Of course, Zurich will tax you twice as much because they know they can get away with it.  If you have the choice between taking charity from a friend or from a stranger, in my experience it's always best to pick the stranger first. Maybe I am missing something, but what exactly is the point of reintroducing lost coins? How is this for an outlier...I came across this moral foundations test in a TED talk:http://www.yourmorals.org/Here is my result:http://bayimg.com/hACbeAaDBIt seems that my moral foundations are weird. Well, I certainly do tend to piss of both conservatives and liberals in discussions about morality.  It's a shame that almost everyone I know falls into some linear combination of liberal and conservative "morality vectors".  Give it a few years, and people will be buying hyperrealistic sex robots ... thus pron will disappear from the official internet long before it has been trimmed down to nothing other than 5 government-moderated websites.  Those people should buy apple futures.It's not theft, because if you agree to use a mint's currency you implicitly accept the possibility of them printing new money at their discretion.  It would only be theft if they were contractually bound to refrain from printing money. The central bank doesn't force you to use legal tender. It's your choice.That's right. We should be able to decide ourselves. Hedging doesn't seem to be part of our everyday culture though. For instance, every time I go to some social gathering, inevitably there will be someone there who complains endlessly about rising petrol prices. (it's odd that this person never cheers when petrol prices go down, he only moans when they rise).  But they never actually DO anything. If you care so deeply about keeping your petrol costs stable for the next 10 years I am sure it's not hard to find some financier who will offer you a hedge. But people just moan instead and demand that government does it for them. or perhaps buying petrol futures is too impractical for joe average? That seems like a healthy attitude. Still emotionally, it's a cold and lonely place to be. Sometimes it feels as if the whole world is against you.As long as Bitcoin remains a hobby this isn't such a problem, but for those of us who are interested in building some kind of business around Bitcoin, even as an evening+weekend side project, it starts becoming part of our identity.  In practice, avoiding confrontation often means keeping your interest in Bitcoin a secret.
a straight-forward way to earn a few Bitcoins is to research Bitcoin related topics and contribute to the bitcoin wiki:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin:Contributors_Award Parece que charge-back existe sim, mas de uma forma mais limitada:https://cms.paypal.com/br/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/BuyerProtComp_full&locale.x=pt_BR If I was holding EUR in a bank account in Greece, Spain, or Portugal, I would have reasons to be seriously worried at the moment, even if I was an "ordinary person" who doesn't know what a libertarian is. The risk of the Euro breaking apart as a result of bad central bank policies is very real at the moment.  It is not some theoretical dystopian wet dream in the minds of libertarian philosophers.I know lots of hands-on people who are working in the finance industry and some of them think that the risk of a EUR collapse by 2013 is 50%.Your EUR in the Greek bank would then probably be converted to Drachmes, and god knows how far these would devalue.  Even in a German bank account you will be facing uncertainty. How would the central bank set the EUR / Deutsche Mark / EUR2.0 / whatever exchange rate?Skepticism about centralised fiat currencies is very much in the Zeitgeist at the moment, even among ordinary people. That skepticism will draw some of them to Bitcoin.You think I am being paranoid? Well, you don't have to take my word. The Swiss Franc/ Euro exchange rate has recently reached a historic high. (the Swiss Franc is seen as a safe haven currency because the Swiss central bank is not quite as incompetent as the others). The market doesn't lie. I agree, ordinary web merchants are no killer app. Some have suggested decentralised p2p file storage as a killer app. This is an example where you can only utilise a decentralised currency. Or at least, if you utise a third party payment method, that third party has the power to shut down the entire storage network at will. This would be seen as a weakness and would increase the risk of data loss from a user's perspective. Another killer app that has been suggested is a p2p DNS fused into the blockchain of Bitcoin.  Scary. Imagine the following, not totally unlikely scenario:Your boss has just discovered Bitcoin, and for a laugh, he gives everyone a little "New year's bonus" of 150 BTC.Being the meticulous person that he is, he includes this bonus when he fills out his tax form and asks you to sign it.You are new to Bitcoin and not particularly convinced by the idea, so you immediately spend it all on 2 lbs of finest CaPulin coffee.A few month later your HD fails catatrophically, and your wallet (and thus any proof that you no longer "own" these bitcoins) has vanished.  In the meantime coffee4bitcoin has gone out of business and is nowhere to be found.Another couple of months pass, and suddenly Bitcoin goes viral. There are millions of new users joining every day and the price of a BTC skyrockets to 10,000 USD.At the end of the year you get a tax bill for 10% of your assets, including the 150 BTC that you still officialy "own", now worth $ 1.5 M. Uh oh...That would be diabolical.  Technically, Bitcoin is not money or property. Bitcoin is just valuable information so my guess is that in theory it's not taxable. Perhaps it helps to think of other situations where an employee gets "paid" in valuable information.Example: Software company A hires a developer, and pays him a fixed salary. After a few months a competitor tries to hire him by offering a bigger salary. Company A cannot afford to raise his salary, but to avoid losing him they make a deal. He is allowed to study the entire source code of their closed-source product.  Previously he was just given access to the module he was working on.  This will give him valuable insider information about industry practices that will potentially increase his net worth.  The question is: Will such a "raise" be taxable? If yes, how would the value of the be "raise" be calculated in USD? Would the taxman need to hire an external auditor who signs a non-disclosure agreement? What if it is a prototype that isn't on the market yet? Can the value even be estimated? How would the taxman even know about this, given that the software is secret? And so on... Bitcoin is such a fundamentally new technology that not even a lawyer will be able to tell you what the precise legal status is.Certainly, Bitcoin behaves like money, and I'm sure that some judges will also see it that way.  Judges have a tendency to be awfully computer illiterate anyhow, and the risk of a mistrial is high even if technically you are not breaking the law.The only way to find out for certain is to step forward and be the first of us test it in court. You are entering pioneer territory. Government does a terrible job of providing public services such as roads and sidewalks.Here is a real life example: I used to live on a narrow residential street where a lot of families with young children lived. The families were very concerned about their children's safety, because a small number of inconsiderate drivers were using the street as a "rat run" and speeding through at 50-70 km/h. The street became a very stressful, menacing place to live, and so the families proposed turning it into a "living street" with a 10 km/h speed limit, park benches, flower beds, and so on. This proposal was accepted almost unanimously among the residents, and the impact on city traffic flow would have been negligible because it was not a main traffic artery.  Note: There seems to be a pattern in economics that when anything is offered for "free", a small number of anti-social rogues takes shameless advantage of it to the detriment of a considerate majority - you call that social justice?Anyhow, the residents ended up lobbying the city council for almost a decade before anything was done. Meanwhile, a whole generation of overweight sedentary children grew up because the parents were too scared to let them ride a bike in front of the house. First the city council rejected it on bureaucratic grounds. There are top-down, inflexible regulations on how roads are "supposed" to be utilised, completely ignoring the diversity of local preferences and needs.Then the city council rejected it on political grounds. The mayor's financial sponsors were mainly people who lived outside the city and just commuted through central neighbourhoods for work or shopping. It was not in their interest to promote "living streets". In a more anarchist society this issue would have been resolved within weeks. One possible scenario: Since the parents care passionately about this issue, they all would have chipped in and purchased the street and run it as a cooperative where they can set their own rules.   Ok, there are  now a handful of commuters who can no longer take the  shortest path to their workplace at a high speed, but do they really care enough about losing 10 seconds commute time to purchase back the street (among themselves) at an even higher price than the concerned parents are prepared to pay? Nobody can prove this conclusively.  There are just too many aspects of economics that are not understood yet.  Saying something like "X exacerbated the great depression" is an educated guess at best.  It is like saying "X causes clinical depression, and Y will cure it".   Perhaps we will never know what really caused the great depression, because even if we develop a  better economic understanding we can't go back in time to do accurate measurements. Or perhaps it will turn out that the great depression was just a random fluctuation in a highly choatic system, in which case it could neither be predicted nor prevented.Anyhow, intervention is wrong on moral grounds, and it would remain wrong even if it could be proven that intervention has desireable consequences. The Bitcoin community is doing a good job of selling Bitcoin using rational arguments.Unfortunately, I don't believe rational arguments are going to convince non-technophiles and non-libertarians (the majority of the population).My experience so far: When I try to explain the benefits of Bitcoin to friends and relatives, in the majority of cases I get a strong negative emotional response.  This response is almost automatic, knee-jerk like.  There seems to be something at the very core of Bitcoin that bothers "normal" people, something irrational (when I ask them to be specific about their objections, they become irritated or change the subject).When I try a rational response, it doesn't work. Even if the rational part of their brain agrees with me.  I think we need some snappy emotional counter-arguments that we can throw at people pre-emptively.  So here are some emotional objections I've heard:* Scam!* Ponzi scheme!* Name calling. (You are an idiot for falling for something like this! ; Another one of your harebrained Utopian ideas! ; You are clueless because you are no banker!) * Proof of work is a waste of energy!* If there is no guarantee, it must be worthless!* If I can't touch it with my hands, it must be worthless!* Economic inequality is unfair! Everybody should be issued an equal amount of BTC!* OMG Deflation! Bad!* No regulation against speculators? I lost half of my pension because of those bastards!* Nobody in charge? That's anarchy! Nothing ever succeeds without a strong leader!* Money Laundering! Kiddie Porn! Gambling! Drugs! Terrorism!* I hate tax evaders!* Capitalism/money is evil! A currency split is extremely unlikely, unless two networks become completely isolated from each other.It is almost impossible to restrict the adoption of a Bitcoin clone geographically, because anyone can join the mining effort, and all it takes is one communications link to the main network and the blockchain of the isolated network will be rejected.In my opinion yes. It it going to be hard to convince a Swiss person of the benefits of an alternative currency when what they have has worked pretty well for the last century.  (In fact, Switzerland already uses a decentralised alternative currency called WIR).  Someone who has experienced the horrors of the Zimbabwean Dollar first hand, however, is going to be instantly sold on the idea of Bitcoin. No it doesn't force them to be techies.Forcing people to be responsible for their own health doesn't force them to be doctors.Forcing people to secure their gold coin doesn't force them to be banks, or safe manufacturers. etc.If there is strong demand for user friendly wallet security, I gurantee that it won't take long until lots of friendly entrepreneurs will offer this service.Just give it some time. This project is still in its infancy. Bitcoin is more that just a payment method. It's also a currency. Other payment methods such as Visa, Paypal, Liberty Reserve, Pecunix, etc. are not currencies. They need to denominate their payments in some external currency that they have no control over.Bitcoin as a currency solves the problem of the need for a corruptible third party (eg. central bank) to mint the currency.  Compared to gold and silver, it solves the problem that it's hard to send gold over long distances and it's expensive to store securely.Bitcoin as a payment method is irrevocable like Liberty Reserve but unlike credit cards and paypal. Many here see this as an advantage because revocable payment methods are often abused for chargeback fraud.It also solves the problem of needing to trust a "bank" to hold your wealth. Liberty Reserve for instance could go bankrupt, become rogue, be shut down by government, etc.  Your bitcoins are stored in the network and you retain full control over them.Also, anonymity will improve as the economy grows, and more and more people can offer their work/services/goods directly for Bitcoin without relying on exchanges. As long as you only purchase and sell virtual goods full anonymity is possible.  Most people in the Bitcoin community think that deflation is actually good for the economy.The last three months we've already had massive deflation (approx. -75%)  and the Bitcoin economy is doing fine.See:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deflationary_spiralAlso, the deflation from losing wallets is going to be negligible compared to deflation from new users joining.  Unlike credit cards, Bitcoin feels like real money to people, and I think that most users treat a wallet.dat file differently to just any data stored on their harddisk. I would be very surprised if many people who own more than few hundred BTC don't keep at least one backup of their wallet. Since you are using p2p filesharing networks as an analogy...Government crackdowns actually stengthened the p2p filesharing ecosystem instead of weakening it. Government crackdowns acted like something of an evolutionary pressure; for every filesharing network that was successfully destroyed, a new generation of better, stronger ones sprang up.Napster relied on a single centralised server. The government  shut down the server. Result? Several Napster clones that could support multiple servers. Then the government started taking down servers one by one. Result? Serverless technology. Then the government started prosecution of individual users. Result? Proliferation of VPN providers and pseudonymous p2p. And so on....I doubt we would have a lot of innovative technologies today (eg. i2p, tor, bittorrent) if governments simply had left Napster alone.  Talking about unintended consequences!Conclusion:Government may succeed in destroying the current block chain. It may even succeed in destroying the current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. But it will never destroy the source code, the meme, the spirit, and the community. The p2p cryptocurrency genie is out of the bottle.  These companies happily support government coercion when it works in their favour so I have sympathy for people who suggest coercive solutions. Not if you take the right precautions:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet I doubt that in Guatemala itself they would use the saying "to go from Guatebad to Guateworse". Unless they have a very self deprecating kind of culture, which Latin American countries don't tend to have.Most likely he is from a neighbouring country.Seriously though, US Treasuary bills are definitely a Guatemalinvestment.You are probably even safer buying Guatemalan government bonds.   Anyone who owns a large proportion of Bitcoins (say, more than 1 million) could in theory corner the market.  But that would be a one-off.  My estimate is that you could permanently crash the price by selling 1 million BTC at once.  But then you would no longer own 1 million BTC, and the price would eventually creep back up as more users join. Somebody actually did try to crash the market by dumping 30,000 BTC back in September. They failed - the price went back to the original almost immediately. Also, no matter how many datacenters you fire up, you can at most  generate 7200 BTC per day. That is hardcoded into the protocol. So, to get hold of 1 million BTC, Amazon would not only need to fire up the equivalent of several supercomputer clusters, but keep them running for several months. Even a large company like Amazon would have to justify that kind of investment to its shareholders.  They wouldn't do it for frivolous reasons.There price of Bitcoin is free floating. Currently it's trading at approx. USD 0.25 / Bitcoin. like this:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RONJA Government prohibiting all cryptography? How is that supposed to work? Cryptography is just applied mathematics. The notion of making cryptography illegal is just absurd as, say, making calculus illegal. and again
Exactly. I grew up with the internet and I may be scarred but I know how do deal with the rawness of an uncesored medium.  If anything it is my parents who need to be protected from stumbling across goatse.  I suggest you stick to the 80/20 rule and simply publish your Bitcoin address on Facebook. Chances are that if someone knows how the get hold of more than 0.05 Bitcoins, they know how to copy and paste a Bitcoin address. Also in the guardian:http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/dec/19/broadband-sex-safeguard-children-vaizeyAnd yet again all internet users collectively have to pay the price for the incompetence of certain parents.In other words, 85% of computer literate parents are too lazy to spend 30 minutes researching and downloading a family filter (can it be that hard?).  If they really cared that much about their children seeing porn you would think that they would at least spend so much effort protecting them.    So if it's going to be a draconian solution, how about cutting off the internet connection of those responsibility-dodging parents for gross negligence, so that the rest of us internet users can just get on with our business? Bleh, I would be disappointed if that were to become the main use of Bitcoin. It would just be an investment like hundreds of others. There is nothing that "Bitcoin as an investment" does that other investments don't do.I hope that Bitcoin's killer app will be something more innovative than that, exploiting a feature that is unique to Bitcoin.  p2p bandwidth allocation and p2p DNS allocation are two examples where Bitcoin would not only be ideal, but it would be very hard or impossible to use a centralised currency. Asia seems really underrepresented. I would have expected more in Japan especially, given the number of internet users. It's only free wiithin the Eurozone, not Europe. If you can find a profitable way of generating, go for it! What I'm concerned about more is that a lot of newbies turn up here expecting that they should generate X amount of coins, and then become disappointed/disillusioned when their attemps yield meagre results. Or they feel that it's "unfair" that they mine so little compared to expert and early generators, because they feel entitled to X amount of coins, like our friend hromisko. And then they give up on Bitcoin for the wrong reasons. Where did you get this 10x figure from by the way? The cost of generating is likely to vary hugely depending on individual circumstances, because it is likely to involve sunk costs that are not related to generating. Also, there are the non-monetary costs: Time invested in learning about short lived mining software, fan noise, etc. In principle, I would consider it a fallacy to try and mimic gold. Gold has many flaws but in the non-digital era it was the best we could find as a currency for lack of alternatives. Bitcoin can be something fundamentally different to gold, and it should be if that makes it a superior currency. If we start using Bitcoin for generalised timestamping and whatnot, this might increase their value, but it will also indroduce additional costs and vulnerabilities into the network. KISS. Sigh.Please don't become fixated on mining. Mining is not the point of Bitcoin. Trading is.Sometimes I feel as if the bicycle has just been invented and everybody has become obsessed with servicing their shiny new bicycle (which is required to keep the bicycle working, granted), but people have now become so obsessed with servicing that hardly anyone actually bothers to ride it.  Good luck with that.With a centralised currency  it is already difficult enough to exclude people who try to use it outside the intended community or region.I am curious. How do you plan to enforce these restrictions in a p2p currency? Moreover, in a p2p cryptocurrency where a user can identify himself with nothing more than a set of cryptographic keys?  How do you plan to prevent a GPU miner (or any other kind of "speculator") from joining your network?And who is "we"? Are you part some kind of local currency initiative? In which case, the Bitcoin software is probably not the tool you are looking for. I would suggest looking into the Ripple monetary system.     You already have to buy rights in order to be allowed to shit.  Or at least you have to buy some of you own land if you want to shit for free.  So why not the same for breathing? The amount of CO2 produced by breathing is so small though that it would proabably only cost a few cents a year.  Hardly any one would even notice if you refused to pay this, let alone care. There is some validity in the idea of trading emission rights.The way it's done at the moment is corrupt though.Somebody at some point has to start with emission rights and that somebody at the moment is a goverment.Why should any government be given emission rights for free, only to sell them on? The atmosphere is a global good and no single government has regisdiction over the whole planet.Also, a government can arbitrarily create more emission rights according to subjective criteria that can easily be manipulated by voters, lobbyists, dictators, etc, for reasons other than protecting the planet.Finally, lifetimes of governments are finite and global warming is a long term problem (100 year span). I am not buying any emission rights from any government, that's for sure. If the premise is that global warming harms ALL human beings more or less equally, and that every human being is equally responsible for reducing his/her CO2 emissions, then the sensible approach would be this:Every person on the planet gets a certain (equal) volume of emission rights by default. The total is determined by consensus, much like the 21M figure in the Bitcion community. Individuals can then sell their emisions rights to other individuals or corporations in their web of trust. The ripple monetary system would be perfect for this.If someone breaches the "contract" and emits more CO2 than they have the rights for, this would mean social pressure from friends who have bought rights from them for BTC.That kind of scheme I would consider spending my BTC on. Ok, here is my controversial opinion on this:Casual Bitcoin users should not be encouraged to do any mining at all. They are wasting their time.Leave the mining to the experts.Mining is an essential aspect of Bitcoin. That does not mean it's the most useful or even  interesting aspect  for the majority of users.  Newcomers always seem to get fixated on the (relatively minor) mining aspect, and this distracts from what Bitcoin is really about, an exchange tool. I feel that if all this effort, time, and passion that so many newcomers devote to mining, was devoted to improving the exchangeability of Bitcoin instead, this project would be a lot more successful by now.If I want to acquire 1g of gold, there are several ways I could go about this.1) I could head to the mountains with a gold pan and wade in the river all day every day, and after half a year of panning I would find a nugget (if I am lucky). 2) I could join a collective of 100 panners and head to the mountains for just a weekend. Then whoever is lucky enough to find a nugget agrees to divide it equally amoung the other 99 panners. 3) I could do what I am good at, be it programming or hairdressing, for a few hours, earn some money and then invest in a professional mining company that sends its heavy machinery capable of extracting thousands of nuggets per day. 4) I could buy the gold from someone who already owns some.Anyone who did 1) IRL would be considered nuts, unless it's purely a hobby that they genuinely enjoy. But that is a good analogy of what you are doing when you attempt to mine Bitcoins with a CPU.Option 2) would be considered slighly less nuts IRL, yet still highly inefficient and silly to say the least. But that is essentially what a pooled mining effort is.Option 3) is smarter but still too cumbersome for a casual gold user because it requires detailed industry knowledge and investing experience, and because you have to wait until you get your gold.Option 4) is by far the most sensible choice for the majority of people. Want some Bitcoins? Trade them! That's what Bitcoins are for. What I would like to see more in music sites is a bounty + exclusive release system. For example, everytime the artist releases a new song, the 30-second sample is posted on the website. The artist can define a bounty and a timeframe. Fans can then pay as many Bitcoins as they choose into the bounty account (perhaps above a minimum, also set by the artist). As soon as the bounty is reached, the mp3 file is made available only to those fans who have contributed, perhaps a month before it is released for sale to the general public. If the bounty is not reached in the specified timeframe the Bitcoins are returned to the fans.edit: coming to think of it, this is more a ransom than a bounty, but I think ransoms work better for music than bounties because music is such a subjective emotional good that it's hard to for the listener define in advance what she wants. ಠ_ಠ Assange has enough "whuffie" to get by without money. Even after all his bank accounts and credit cards have been blocked, he could travel to almost any country in the world and couchsurf, hitch rides, or use air miles from people who are sympathetic to his cause. Shit, that Wikipedia admin is seriously starting to suffer from paranoia. Now he is even accusing us of hacking into dormant Wikipedia accounts to promote the subject. *rolls eyes*Maybe we should just leave Wikipedia alone. Soner or later Bitcoin will appear there by itself anyhow. I don't understand why Americans get so neurotic over the supposed fall of their empire. It's not the end of the world, you know. Look at the UK for example. It's an empire that has been falling for over 100 years now and is still falling (at least in terms of relative importance on the world stage). Daily life consequences? Not noticeable. Yes, a lot of people moan about the good old times when "Britain was still great", but they ultimately get on with their lives.  London is a great place to live, state or no state. There are a lot of examples of "infinitely increasing" databases where nothing ever gets erased.One is the US constitution, where new amendments are appended to the body of the text without removing what already exists.  Yet, the US constitution hasn't "run out of paper" in over 200 years.Another is Wikipedia, where every edit is recorded for all eternity."Infitinitely increasing" is clearly not an issue. It's the rate of increase that matters.  The only banks that have the ability to create money "out of thin air" are the central banks.This money is then lent to the high street banks, which lend it to individuals.When you borrow 100,000 to buy a house, that is hard money. Your high street bank doesn't have the mandate to "create" it, it must borrow the money just like you.In Bitcoin the distrubuted network acts as the central bank.Satoshi is no different to anyone else. He does not have priviledged minting rights.Satoshi could run a bank if he wanted to, but that would be nothing but a "high street bank".
If a few thousand bored teenagers is enough to destroy the internet, then the internet has a serious design flaw. In which case, the sooner it gets replaced by internet v2, the better. Sigh ... I guess now you'll have to resort to the last resort, TPB.   It's a mob, but it's not criminal in my opinion. To quote critical mass, "we are not hindering traffic, we are traffic".  This article is surprisingly balanced and accurate for a mainstream publication.PC World is a big deal. I am psycheless. Time to restore the Wikipedia article. If I wanted to, I could make a profit at ANY khash because my electricity is already included in my rent, and I must always own a laptop anyhow, Bitcoin or no Bitcoin.Still can't be bothered with mining though, because constant fan noise is a little irritating and not worth earning a handful of bitcents. Signing petitions doesn't achieve shit. Most effictive thing to do is to stop doing business with Visa and Mastercard.As for DDoS being wrong, I disagree. People are simply exploiting an inherent weakness of internet protocol, namely that you can send packets for free, creating a tragedy of the commons situation.  Same thing for spam. The more often this happens, there more motivation there will be to fix the internet. Bitcoin could even play a role in this. Bitcoin does not necessarily need to compete with Visa and Mastercard.When you open an account with Visa you get billed in USD or EUR; why not in BTC in future?Visa and Mastercard could offer services that the Bitcoin network is not capable of. Giving people credit, escrow, acting as a trusted third party, verifying physical identities, securing wallets, insurance,...Both sides would benefit from this. Payment processing is only a part of Visa's business.Same for banks. I pledge 50 BTC.I trust kiba to be the final judge on whether this bounty has been fulfilled. I am somewhat of a left libertarian too. I'm similar to an authoritarian leftist in how I would prefer society to be organised.The difference is the means of achieving that goal. I would prefer society to be more cooperative, economically equal, and tolerant of lifestyle choices. I do not believe the way to get there is coercion, but persuasion and reward. It is impossible to completely prevent that kind of abuse unfortunately. For example, someone could encode information in the decimal figures of amount sent, or in a "vanity plate" Bitcoin address.Probably not practical for jpeg or mpeg files, but for other low-bandwidth "illegal data" such as Blu-Ray keys, this is bound to happen sooner or later. Even "low bandwidth kiddie porn" could create big problems for us one day. All over the world, legislation is becoming more draconian every year and in some countries even the "wrong" kind of fiction and poetry is now considered kiddie porn by the courts and thus illegal. I suspect he has a problem with the fact that Bruce Wagner is a phytoestrogen-infested New Yorker.   Reputation is subjective.My guess is that extremist, irrational views based on the naturalistic fallacy, wisdom of repugnance, and argumentum ad populum, are not going to resonate well with the highly educated and rational Bitcoin crowd. Probably a good idea not escalate this discussion, otherwise you will be the one with the dirty reputation. The Austrian School is a bit like The Sound of Music - the only thing that many non-Austrian nationals will ever associate with Austria, but paradoxically, almost completely forgotten in Austria itself. The first female user of Bitcoin may be Jutta, the founder of halfbakery.comShe posted a link to Bitcoin as early as Oct 13 2009. To conclude with your sexual stereotyping ...  Women love things that have no "intrinsic value" and a high "generating difficulty" (jewellery, diamonds, flowers, wedding ceremonies, Harvard MBAs, etc.)So they must be crazy about Bitcoins. Right?   Wikileaks is not about complete, unconditional, immidiate transparency. Wikileaks does not actively spy on people or force anyone to be transparent. Wikileaks simply relays information that has been voluntarily divulged by someone who had access to that information.If you "own" information that you think is highly sensitive then it's your own responsibility to secure that information.  If you didn't take enough precautions, and the information leaks, you don't have the right to raise hell and supress its dissemination by violent means.  Serious criminals already operate mostly in darknets, not on the public web. The DNS is of no importance to them. We should not trust the "free market" blindly. The problem is that including a lot of data in a block creates costs, not just for the miner who includes the data, but for all other miners and all other users, for all eternity.In the current implementation, the user is passing on the costs to the miner, and the miner is passing on the costs to the rest of the network. However, the user's transaction fee only compensates the miner's costs.As long as this tragedy of the commons situation hasn't been sorted out, the free market won't fix anything. Satoshi is against it because Bitcoin is still in germinal stage.Too much bad press too early could destroy the project. Not that there a lack of solidarity towards Wikileaks in the Bitcoin community, but we need to help ourselves first before we can help others, or at least that's the idea.Of course Satoshi's word should not be taken as gospel, but majority of the community seems to agree with him/her right now. It doesn't need to be the safest, it only needs to be safe enough for the user's individual needs.What's "safe enough" is a matter of opinion.The more safety you want, the more cumbersome/expensive it gets, and diminishing returns mean that at some point you reach an optimum where the expense of making things marginally safer no longer pays. That's true for many technologies, not just bitcoin.Here is a super-safe scheme that I've proposed:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1816.msg22407#msg22407
+1 nanaimogold.com The "uncool" people who don't have the "right" friends?  Transparency is not good because it's useful, or because it's safe, or because the world isn't simple. Transparency is good because it's morally right, irrespective of the consequences it may or may not have.Same can be said of a related concept - freedom. Once you introduce more ice cream vendors and more types of ice cream, you are changing the parameters of resource allocation space.  But even this new space has certain constraints (scarcity of resources), so mathematically, there will exist a new global optimum somewhere. The free market may or may not lead to this global optimum, but it's by no means guaranteed.I agree that the constraints of 1) there may be only two ice cream vendors 2) there may be only one type of ice cream, are somewhat artificial. Still, this simplified model illustrates the general idea. I'm a purist and think that the official client should remain as simple as possible.I don't think it should be bloated with mere nice-to-haves.There are many different ways of doing pooled mining and many independent projects. Which project should then be chosen as the "official" one?  Too much centralisation IMO.Also, even pooled mining with lose its appeal to Joe Average 1-2 years from now because by then the real specialists will dominate the mining market (with specialised hardware and such).     Would that be any different in an anarchy though? If you violate a contract the other party will demand compensation, if you fail to compensate they will attempt taking the compensation by force by hiring a PDA, if you resist that force by threatening to retaliate with violence, the PDA will also retaliate with violence, etc....Eventually, if you refuse to negotiate and keep resisting, the outcome is likely to be death too, even in an anarchy.The only difference is that under a state you enter certain contracts automatically (the act of getting a driving license and getting inside a car means an implicit contract between you and the state). Free markets do not push to the most optimal resource allocation possible (aka "global optimum").They simply push to a point in resource allocation space where no further optimisation by incremental change is possible (aka "local optimum").In the real world the nature of resources and demand is changing all the time, so the market jumps from one local optimum to the next.This property of free markets can be illustrated in a very simple economy: Two identical ice cream vendors on a 1km long beach with a uniform density of customers. There are only two variables in resource optimisation space: The position (x) of each ice cream vendor. The further away a customer is lying from a vendor, the less likely she is to make the trip to buy the ice cream.The most optimal resource allocation would be if the ice cream vendors were evenly spread out (something like x1 = 250m and x2 =750m). In this configuration nobody ever has to walk further than 250m to buy an ice cream.But in a free market, where the ice cream vendors compete against each other, this configuration is unstable. They would gradually migrate towards the middle of the beach (slowly grabbing each other's customers) until the free market equilibrium is reached where x1 = 500m and x2= 500m.  This equilibrium is globally suboptimal. Usenet newsgroups can be accessed via the web using Google Groups, but to set up a new Usenet newsgroup (not just a "Google group") I believe you need a Usenet subscription.Is there anyone here who has one? A distributed, auto syncing forum?What about Usenet? If the whole thing is based on "insecurities" rather than securities it may just stay inside the confines of the grey market. Make it an informal, honor-based exchange, without binding contracts, and you no longer meet the legal definition of a security (which always requires some sort of contract). Make it a bit like crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter except that the giving goes both ways. Tit for tat. Use webs of trust to keep the "insecurities" as private and confidential as possible. Nobody but the parties involved need to know about them.You could also follow the example of Wikileaks and go supranational, cherry-picking from the legislations that suit your business model most. There is no reason this website must be under the jurisdiction of any one particular country. Bitcoin itself is already supranational. Apolitical, not big on ideology, more of a practical, "whatever works" type of person. But I probably pass the duck test for a centre-left-libertarian.I believe that a functioning society needs a balance of collectivism/cooperation/solidarity and selfishness/competition/individualism. However, I believe that collectivism can and should be strictly voluntary.  I'm too cynical to believe that true anarchy is sustainable. Humans are a very hierarchial species by nature, and some thug will always dominate unfortunately; that thug may as well be democratic government (the least of all evils). That government should be as small and as accountable as possible.  Utilitarian, "harm-reduction" based government interference should be minimised; if it can be justified at all it must be based on reason and empirical evidence. Speculators will anticipate that there will be fewer coins hitting the market after 210,000. The price will rise to reflect this supply reduction, long before the day of the switch. I bet that price fluctuations on that day will not be any more untypical than on any other day.What will happen is a dramatic reduction in difficulty. That's only a minor issue, because even if difficulty drops from 10,000,000 to just 1,000,000, the chance of a double spending attack remains zero for all practical purposes. I don't think it's as simple as this.Amazon and Walmart were initially successful because they gave customers what they wanted, at a lower price, yes. Once they reach a certain size, however, network effects come into play, and network effects will give you an automatic advantage over your smaller competitors even if your customer service isn't better.A company that makes lots of money in absolute numbers is a good sign, I agree.A company that sustains excessive profit margins (over 20%) over more than 3 years is often a bad sign however, because it indicates an uncompetitive market. In a perfect market profit margins always tend to zero. In the long term an uncompetitive market is bad for everyone, even for the companies making those kind of profits, because they encourage complacency.  What's the point of learning every last detail of a technology if the technology will be obsolete after 10,5,3 years anyhow? Transferrable skills, meta-skills, and flexibility, that''s what you need to survive in a double exponential growth, high tech economy. What's so crazy about the idea? To me it seems like an obvious way of using the internet. Wasn't something like Bitcoin bound to happen sooner or later? But WTF do I know? I didn't think Wikipedia was crazy either when I first came across it in 2003. They would be the physical equivalent of open source software which also "belongs" to no one.  The more BTC stored inside the robot, the smaller the chance of vandalism.Destroying a "wealthy" robot for fun would be the equivalent of you  finding a safe on the street that you know has $100,000 inside it, and then dumping that safe in the ocean, just for fun.  Fully homomorphic encryption would open the possibility of 100% autonomous robots.The robots store Bitcoin private keys inside a fully homomorphically encrypted program.Whenever the robot gets repaired or refuelled (by whoever feels like doing it - there is no central authority maintaining the robots), the robot rewards that person with a few BTC.Of course the robot would require some unforgeable proof that it has been refuelled or repaired, before sending a BTC transaction. I'm not sure how this could be done.The robots could also "earn" BTC by delivering stuff for people and getting paid.Vandalism is discouraged, because if you destroy the robot the BTC stored in its memory are gone forever. Remember that simply copying the memory is useless because it's encrypted, and decryption is only possible by interacting with the robot. If that's too inconvenient for you, this trader will buy your Bitcoins for Paypal USD:http://www.nanaimo-gold.comIn your Paypal account you can instantly convert USD to GBP, then transfer the balance to a UK bank account. Find a user who has a UK bank account and do an over-the-counter trade with them:http://bitcoin-otc.com/ I have the impression that they are being deliberately secretive as to how exactly the price of the Ven is determined. At least I couldn't find a satisfactory explanation of the mechanics anywhere on the site.Is the price fixed by the central authority (Gekko Global Markets - deliberately ironic choice of name?)  using a basket of commodities?Or is the price allowed to float freely?Seems to be both, or a combination of the two.  In any case this currency is far too centralised and far too closed for my taste.But I really liked their idea of pavillions.   Would be a great way to promote bitcoin and to allow people to trade face-to-face.
Good idea. Perhaps Valais/Wallis as it's accessible from both sides of the country? Crans Montana would maybe be easiest transport wise. I haven't skied in Zermatt yet and would love to go some time this season. over 9000 I'm not worried. It rose prematurely because speculators anticipated the deflation. That's why I prefer to mail the cash. Even if one in 20 of your letters gets stolen in the mail (a very high estimate) that's still cheaper than Western Union.Bitcoingateway is great in terms of convenience, but they need to have a high spread (last time I looked it was approx 10 %) in order to protect themselves against the high risks of accepting credit cards. Compare that to bitcoin4cash and bitcoinexchange who offer a 3% spread. Maybe it's because former paypal customers on mtgox are slowly running out of USD balance, and once they run out they decide to give up on mtgox because Liberty Reserve is too cumbersome.   There are exchanges where you can buy Bitcoin directly for Western Union or bank wire, so why should someone buy LR via Western Union only to trade it into BTC?  That would only make sense if there was an arbitrage opportunity, but most users can't be bothered with doing arbitrage.  I'm an expat living in the Zurich area. Probably too busy this year to make it to a meet up though.   My personal experience is that strict specification creates software that is extremely good at doing what the specification wants, but for all its elegance, it's not always what the user wants or needs.  We haven't fully figured out the details of how Bitcoin is supposed to behave yet (see discussion on transaction fee policy). We are finding out as we go along.  Nothing against specification, but isn't it a bit early right now? For me, the skillful execution of an idea is just as important, if not more important, than the idea itself. There is no shortage of ideas in the world. Most are never executed. I doubt Larry Sanger is the first human being ever to think of a collaborative encyclopedia. I think Wales deserves this title equally.Larry Sanger certainly seems to resent Jimmy Wales. His attemps to defame Wikipedia were really childish and below the belt.  Seems like a bitter man; I kind of feel sorry for him.Doesn't bother me in the least. Understandable. Jimmy Wales is a libertarian in private but mainstream opinion isn't sympathetic towards libertarian values. As a public figure he needs to be careful not scare away big donors. Have you thought about using 3D secure? This forces the customer to enter a password for each purchase. The password is issued by his bank.In combination with email verification it's probably secure enough.Your present procedure is cumbersome. It will discourage a good percentage of potential customers. I personally find the idea of someone calling me on my mobile phone over some $50 Bitcoin purchase very invasive.  If someone is going to interrupt me at work, it better be something important.  Maybe it's just cultural... If I really wanted to set up a recurring payment, this would currently take me about 2 minutes.Example: I want to donate 200 BTC to the EFF on the 15th of every month.1) create a file called DonateToEFF.cron2) edit file:* * 15 * * ~/programs/bitcoin-0.3.15/bin/64/bitcoind sendtoaddress 1MCwBbhNGp5hRm5rC1Aims2YFRe2SXPYKt 2003)$ crontab DonateToEFF.crondone!Also, it shouldn't be difficult for Bitcoin web interface providers such as mybitcoin.com to develop scheduled payments for non-geeks.There is no reason to bloat the Bitcoin client with this kind of functionality when it can be done more flexibly outside the client. I think what your merchant friend was trying to say is that, unlike credit card users, Bitcoin users can't be suckered into signing up for recurrent payment schemes that are then a big hassle to cancel, where the merchant ends up with a lot of recurrently paying customers that are only customers because they are too apathetic/computer illiterate/disorganised/embarrassed(in the case of porn) to cancel the recurring payment. Not because they still genuinely want the product, or genuinely prefer it to the competitor's product.Bitcoin takes away control from large financial institutions and colluding merchants and gives control back to the user.I understand that a lot of internet merchants have a problem with this because their whole business model is based on this odious practice rather than offering a superior product.I for one, would be happy so see these types of merchants go bankrupt one by one as Bitcoin gains popularity. A more competitive internet economy can only be a good thing. I have been a p2p enthusiast for about 10 years. I have been a strong supporter of pseudonymous p2p projects  such as Freenet, i2p, and Tor since I think their existence is essential to guarantee free communication in society.  But I always thought that most p2p networks don't have a satisfactory mechanism for allocating bandwidth among their users. I already came up with the idea of a p2p cryptocurrency myself to solve this problem about 5 years ago (my version was not nearly as ingenious as Satoshi's).Also, I have always been angered and frustrated with the crappiness, inconvenience, and lack of security of popular online payment methods such as credit cards and paypal.  My credit card has been scammed twice. I felt that the ensuing grief was completely unnecessary. There is simply no good reason to give everyone on the internet (and on the street) you pay a few dollars a blank cheque (essentially that's what CC details are) and then to trust them not to abuse it. The stupidity of this system has always amazed me.   When I first stumbled accross Bitcoin (thanks to the now deleted Wikipedia article), there wasn't much selling to do, I simply thought, YES this is what I have been waiting for all these years.   In a free market for transaction fees,spamming the network will have the effect of increasing transaction fees for everybody. Maybe Mr Burns is more than just a common griefer. Maybe he is a miner with more rational motivations. A miner has more to gain than to lose by spamming. Yes, eventually a spam equilibrium will be reached where the marginal amount you lose in your spam to the transaction fees of competing miners equals the marginal amount gained from your own transaction fees.  But that is still a macroeconomically subobtimal situation. To escape this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_trap social trap, more than a market is needed. Some simple but effective rules should be hardcoded into the Bitcion protocol/specification itself, to discourage the excesses of spamming.I know that this approach probably sounds too "top-down" for the free market enthusiasts in this forum, but the rules should of course be purely voluntary and consensus based, like the 21M rule we have already. He probably does want to send money to a relative in a different village. In many remote parts of Africa this is currently handled by SMS. This system is better than nothing, but it still relies on capital-intensive mobile phone infrastructure, and the transaction costs are huge, in the region of 10-20%.  The only reason wifi has such a short range is because government regulations artificially limit transmission power to 50 mW. This is tiny. Even a mobile phone can go up to 2000 mW.Technically it should be trivial to modify transmission power of a wifi device, and government regulations don't get enforced much anyhow in "offline" parts of the world like Somalia, if they exist at all. Then it should be possible to construct a wireless mesh network with several tens of kilometers between each node, bringing even the most isolated villages online.All you need is one person with a smartphone in each village acting as the local banker. Wow, this website looks like it hasn't been changed since the day it was started 1998. It has a very retro feel to it.  But I thought the article was a good read. It's refreshing to see an external piece on Bitcoin that isn't based on gross misconceptions.  The author did his research and actually bothered to understand how Bitcoin works before criticising blindly.  Substance over style.  Question: If we commission you draw a design, will you permit the design to be released under Creative Commons?  I said never, because before that number reaches 10%, AMD will start manufacturing chips specialised just to compute SHA-256 (HPUs- hash processing units?) No, it's a joint venture of consumer electronics corporations:Samsung-Toshiba-Nakamichi-Motorola
Named after Gox, the god of greed  +1 mtgox thanks for letting me withdraw the bitcoins purchased for paypal USD, despite the jackass who caused your paypal account to be frozen. Because an unencrypted copy could still be hiding somewhere on the HD. The more complex your OS, and the more "user friendly" stuff you have running in the background, the higher the risk.For instance, some backup/recovery tools keep copies of recently accessed files in their cache. Here is what you can do for maximum safety:1) Use a separate physical machine just for Bitcoin. Any working 10 year-old laptop or PC with Linux installed will do. 2) Important: This machine must never be connected to the internet.3) On this machine you set up a "savings account". Run Bitcoin (while disconnected), to generate a wallet.dat.4) Then encrypt your wallet.dat using Truecrypt or similar. Use a 20 character passphrase and a keyfile. A hidden volume doesn't hurt either if you live in places like the UK.5) Backup your encrypted wallet.dat in at least 3 different places. One should be geographically separated from the other two. I recommend cloud storage such as Dropbox or Wuala. Remember to upload the encrypted wallet.dat only from your other, online machine.6) Copy your Bitcoin address from your offline machine to your online machine. Only the address, not the wallet.dat.7) Shred the unencrypted wallet.dat file on your offline machine. Simply deleting is not enough. You can use the shred command in linux. Power off the machine and remove the battery.8 ) Now, from your online machine, send the Bitcoins to the "savings account" address. Keep a smaller amount of coins in the online "current account".If you ever decide to spend the coins in the savings account repeat steps 3-8 with a fresh wallet.datBefore sending large amounts, make sure you test this method first with 0.01 BTC!Of course, this lengthy procedure is overkill if you just own a few hundred coins.Then I would recommend an online wallet provider such as mybitcoin or mtgox.They will take care of all the technicalities of securing bitcoins for you. Just keep in mind that they too are not immune to hacker attacks, technical faults, bankruptcy, etc. Before sending a copy of my passport to some shady company in the Caribbean I'd rather just buy electronic currencies for cash in the mail.There is simply no reason to divulge that amount of information about myself just to buy a few hundred XBC.There is no reason to expose myself to the risk of identity theft. However small that risk may be, the risks of cash-in-the-mail are smaller and more manageable.And once you have to go though all the trouble of scanning passports and such, the bank wire procedure becomes just as inconvenient as cash-in-the-mail, so I may aswell buy XBC for cash-in-the-mail directly rather than go through 3 or more intermediaries.That's why I stopped using mtgox the day he stopped accepting paypal. Last time I received a quote from him was November 9 too. Last time he posted on the forum was Nov 13. He is probably just busy.   +1 bitcoin4cash I don't know about the US, but here it would be a bit of a legal grey area. The problem is that Bitcoin is unprecedented and the only way to gain certainty is to test it in court, or to wait until somebody else in your jurisdiction tests it in court.New technologies often push societal boundaries.  The legal system is not flexible enough to adapt quickly and often lags 10-20 years behind the technological reality.Entrepreneurs who promote any disruptive technology are likely to get bruised by legal issues somewhere on the journey. It's an occupational hazard. A computer purchased for the sole purpose of generating is unlikely to be profitable. You are up against a competition whos marginal cost of generation is practically zero.Examples: 1) Someone who uses generation to heat their living room, and switches off the electric heater. 2) Someone who has a flat-rate electricity contract where off-peak electricity is free. 3) Someone who's got solar panels installed on their roof but not enough batteries to store surpluses on peak days. 4) A bored system administrator running a server cluster that sits underutilised between 12 pm and 6 am.etc. I see it more like a maintenance fee for a condominium that happens to be a regional monopoly.  If Bitcoin becomes mainstream to the extent that it takes advantage of the network effect, it would take more than an unquestionably superior design to break it.There is a point at which people will prefer to use Bitcoin simply because most people are already using Bitcoin. Don't trust the order book. At mtgox it doesn't cost anything to make an order a safe distance away from the last price and to withdraw it as soon as the market moves, so it's reasonable to assume some people are trying to manipulate the market in this way.Also, it's reasonable to assume that traders wanting to sell/buy large quantities will want to keep this information secret for as long as possible, so they are not going to make a huge order all at once. This community is still too sparse to support a face-to-face economy. Maybe a good place to start the first local Bitcoin economy would be a university campus.  Success! http://www.eff.org/helpout"Donate to EFF using Bitcoin P2P Cryptocurrency. Transfer money from your Bitcoin account to ours: 1MCwBbhNGp5hRm5rC1Aims2YFRe2SXPYKt" Speculation has benefits like the ones you mentioned but I think it also has downsides. Some speculation is good, but if the Bitcoin economy becomes too dominated by speculation it will hurt Bitcoin's image. People on this forum may unsterdand the benefits of speculation, but the average Joe doesn't and public opinion is very much financially conservative at the moment. The average Joe would not be pleased if he bought some Bitcoins to send to his granny and they lost 50% of their USD value in a period of 24 hours.This is why I think that Bitcoin web interfaces aimed at non-geek users should offer some sort of currency hedging, at least in the early stages of Bitcoin.  Speculation was bound to happen and there is very little we can do about it because the whole point of Bitcoin is that nobody is in control.  Truely free markets have a lot of benefits but one of their downsides is that they are intrinsically unstable. A bit like the weather. Positive feedback loops are a bitch, but to get rid of them you'd have to change human nature. If Bitcoin will be anything like other disruptive technologies in history, we should expect a huge bubble as early adopters get overexcited, followed by a crash, followed by a few years of disillusionment and consolidation, followed by mainstream adoption. Actually, I do think that certain technical modifications to Bitcoin could mitigate the excesses of speculation,  for example damping (Tobin-Tax-style transaction fees) and inflation (more bitcoins awarded for mining).But those modifications would reduce the usefulness and desirability of Bitcoin, and they probably wouldn't prevent the coming bubble either. There is deep seated fallacy in the collective consciousness of Jewish/Christian/Islamic societies regarding the morality of money.The widespread view is that money is somehow related to effort and that those that put in the most effort are morally deserving of the most money.This approximation might have been applicable to  some extent in an agrarian society of 2000 years ago, but in the modern information economy it is not even approximately true.  Those who make the most money are of course not those who put in the most effort but those who generate the most marginal utility, and this ability is becoming increasingly decoupled from effort.A famous formulation of this fallacy is Marx' Labour Theory of Value, but there are several other versions of it on both sides of the political spectrum. It's a meme that remains surprisingly robust even in 2010.I have always found it absurd how unproductive members of society who have made leisurely pursuits their life goal are despised by mainstream opinion, while equally unproductive members who outwardly project the image of effort for effort's sake, are respected.   Exchanging any revocable currency into an irrevocable currency means a certain inevitable exposure to the risk of fraud.  Hence the reluctance.This is a fundamental problem of internet commerce that is not limited to Bitcoin.  Trust networks could solve this problem, however, such technologies are still in their infancy just like Bitcoin.The two exchanges I've used, Nanaimo Gold and Bitcoin4Cash, will use the exchange rate from the day your letter is stamped. Price of BTC in USD up by a factor of approx. 15 to 25 in a few weeks. Yet the number of traders where you can spend Bitcoin on the internet has barely changed. This is beginning to look like a bubble. I asked the same question a few months back when I had just discovered Bitcoin.The short answer:Energy isn't "wasted" on proof of work. It's used for something most users value: security. Just like the money/resources spent on a safe to store gold coins isn't wasted.Yes, it's macroeconomically sub-optimal, but the money/resources spent on proof of work is only a small fraction of the Bitcoin economy anyhow.
Proof of work is not only widely used in society, it's widely used in biology by all sorts of species. There it's called honest signalling:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory#Honest_signalsPeacock's feathers are a classic example.I would even go as far as saying that a high school / university degree itself is mostly just proof of work in many cases.  Like, when a graduate applies for a job, the employer thinks "he got top marks so he must be intelligent and self-disciplined". The employer cares more about these personal traits than the knowledge that was actually tested in the exams. I disagree with this analogy. Gold is a lousy currency, but for thousands of years it was the best humanity could come up with.Bitcoin has the potential to be far superior to gold. Why should Bitcoin delibarately copy the weaknesses of gold? Difficulty adjustments should in theory have no effect on the exchange rate whatsoever because predictability approaches 100% the closer you get to the adjustment. Finally some really clear charts.Donation coming your way... Yes you can, but in my undestanding, that offline wallet needs to have been online at least once, otherwise its public key(s) are not known to the bitcoin network. If you try to send money to a bitcoin address that has never been online you'll get an error message - try it.Hence the need to copy only the public key to the online machine. Good. More BTC for me then.  On a more serious note, I wouldn't advise anyone to invest "big money" in bitcoin, even the modified version you propose. *The security of bitcoin hasn't been thouroughly tested *there hasn't been any peer review by cryptography/security experts *critical mass hasn't been reached*competition from other p2p cryptocurrencies*the economy is still tiny (liquidation value of all BTC in existence is probably closer to 50,000 EUR than 500,000 EUR).*danger of massive government crackdown...This project is in a very early stage and there are still many big hurdles to overcome. For the time being, investing in Bitcoins should be seen as high risk investment or nothing more than a fun hobby. The way I see it, there needs to be some sort of "official" or consensus set of parameters and rules that a block chain needs to obey.Otherwise, if the only requirement for acceptance was chain length, someone could just arbitrarily change the rules, say, that 1000 coins are awarded instead of 50 every time a block is solved.Right now, this "official" set of rules comes from satoshi, and you are quite right, if he changed the source code to his own personal advantage (and to the disadvantage of other users), he could probably manage to rip off a few people, simply because this is a very early stage in this project and most people automatically download from sourceforge as soon as a new version is realeased.But that would be a one-off. People would no longer trust either satoshi or sourceforge, and some other consensus would soon emerge. After that, satoshi couldn't change the rules even if he wanted to.  Very good job. I think the B symbol would look even better without the serifa.  I am trying to set up a "savings account" where I can be 100% certain that the private key of a bitcoin address never comes in contact with the internet:1. generate a private/public key pair while not connected to other peers, on an offline machine.2. copy only the public key to the online machine.3. connect to peers4. receive payments5. copy private key to online machine only to send a payment.Is this doable? If were are going to banish these words we have to replace the "coin" part in the name of this currency too. "Bitproof" - "electronic unit of proof of work"That would be enough to confuse most politicians and judges. The problem is, it would also confuse most potential users,  who would then skip Bitcoin for other e-currencies that are easier to understand. Will BTC fall under new regulations for electronic money when this Directive comes into effect? http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:267:0007:0017:EN:PDFBitcoin does not confer any kind of claim, whether on the "issuer" (be it an exchange or a miner), the developers, or any other Bitcoin user.  Neither it is issued on receipt of funds. So it seems to me that BTC does not fulfil the directive's definition of "electronic money" and that legally it should be considered an electronic commodity.However, if it does, this directive would imply that an amateur cannot legally mine Bitcoins! The true value of all Bitcoins is less than marginal price * total amount. Has anybody tried to estimate that number? If the hoarding was so strong we wouldn't see these kinds of volumes. Thanks for sharing your experience. All this jurislation and regisdiction is making my head spin!   I store my wealth in more than one wallet.dat. Encrypting your wallet.dat is a good move, but you can't get around the vulnerability that there is an unencrypted version of it sitting in the .bitcoin (or AppData) directory while bitcoin is running.  No firewall is 100% impermeable. Third party programs such as Adobe Flash can have security holes that allow hackers to bypass your firewall. Even if you delete and shred the plaintext wallet.dat, and keep only the encrypted backup, how can you be sure that the data doesn't remain hidden as a duplicate somewhere on the HD? or in memory? or in some cache? or in the antivirus quarantine? For ever second that your computer remains connected to the internet, you are exposing yourself to the risk of bittheft. That risk will only increase as Bitcoins become more valuable.Ugh, there are just so many things to think about when it comes to securing Bitcoins.   I have invested some of my wealth in bitcoins. It's an amount I can afford to lose but it's still big enough that it would hurt if I lost it.This has forced me to think carefully about how to backup up my wallet.dat files in a way that a) the chance of losing the data is very small and b) the chance that a third party can somehow gain access to that data is very small.This proved trickier than I thought because a) and b) are somewhat conflicting. I was forced to learn the basics of cryptography and computer security in the process. (I strongly recommend even the non-geek Bitcoin user to read up on these topics as dauting as they may seem at first). Thanks for your contribution - I've donated some BTC. You forgot another key aspect of fluffy web 2.0-style design: Rounded edges. Seriously, all those sharp 90-degree edges on bitcoin.org are probably scaring away whole legions of potential early adopters. I mean, somebody could poke their eye out!On the other hand, web 2.0-design seems to be going out of fashion slowly. When the unashamedly pointy London Olympics logo was unveiled in 2007 it was ridiculed, in 2010 derision and outrage have made way for indifference, and I bet by the time the Olympics happen in 2012 people will say it was ahead of its time. Even the iphone has started becoming more angular again.   The current Bitcoin community and the Bitcoin protocol are two distinct developments.  The Bitcoin protocol is just a tool. It just so happens that at this early stage it's been enthusiastically embraced by libertarians because it lends itself particularly well to further their goals. But that doesn't mean that other communities will not discover Bitcoin as way to fulfil their particular needs. There is no reason that multiple communities/philosophies cannot coexist, even if they use the same tool.Some people on this forum have already self-identified as anarcho-communist.The average Joe will trust whatever most of his friends use, or whatever is endorsed by mainstream media. He doesn't know or care who is behind Bitcoin. If the average Joe discovers that Bitcoin is more convenient to use than other e-currencies, the average Joe will start using Bitcoin.Similar example: Jimmy Wales calls himself "Objectivist to the core". Does the average Wikipedia user care about this? Does the average Wikipedia user even know what an Objectivist is? Is a non-Ojectivist user discouraged from using Wikipedia because of this? No. As for respecting the law, discussing the theory of illegal actions is not illegal in itself, otherwise crime novels would be illegal.As I said, Bitcoin is just a tool.If you think that the message on this website is too extreme for your customers, then why not do some PR work yourself, on your own Bitcoin-accepting website? The more diverse the bitcoin economy, the better... The discussions here are not so much about bypassing law but more about bypassing government. I don't know if you have already noticed, but most people on this forum are some flavour of libertarian. They see Bitcoin as an ideal tool to achieve more independence from a coercive government, or even to make government obsolete altogether.  Ideological considerations are thus not completely unrelated with bitcoin.Most libertarians will agree with you that a "moral common ground" exists, most will agree with you that courts of law are necessary, the only difference is that they think people who associate with one another should arrive at the moral common ground voluntarily, rather than having an arbitrary moralily forced upon them by a central authority. The heroin store idea was more of a libertarian thought experiment than a serious proposal.If somebody started discussing a CP store on this forum they would a) very quickly get a really bad reputation and b) probably get banned by the admins.So why not the same reaction to somebody who discusses a heroin store? Because CP is coercive and selling heroin to adults isn't. 
The 21 million is "only" a client limitation too. There is nothing stopping you from using a modified client where you change that parameter to 42 million. But then most of the network won't accept your payments anymore. For it to work you would need to convice the majoirity of users to switch to your client, and they are not likely to do this if their Bitcoins lose value as a result.Increasing the divisibility, on the other hand, is something that would benefit all users in the situation that 1e-8 becomes too big, so if the developers introduce that modification it is very unlikely to be rejected by large numbers of users.  Good user experience is very expensive to develop. Bitcoin is still in beta stage and the client developers are currently focusing on the first priority, namely making Bitcoin reliable and secure, rather than making the client do too many things poorly.But there is no reason that a non-geek user should use the Bitcoin client itself. A web interface for Bitcoin will sacrifice some security and privacy for useability, but that will serve most non-geek users' needs. I think that eventually, the client will only be used by a core of geek users and "banks", while the average joe will probably rather trust a third party with the technicalites of securing the wallet.dat files and access Bitcoin only indirectly through the third party's interface.Bear in mind that even the average joe would have a strong incentive to make an effort to learn how Bitcoin works and how to safely back up his bitcoins if they were worth the equivalent of $100,000.By the way, a web interface for bitcoin already exists:https://www.mybitcoin.com/Well, yes, it's unfair in the same way that early investors in Google earned a 1000-fold return on their investment without working for that money "the hard way".  But still, they were rewarded for spotting a promising technology and for being prepared to back it with a high-risk investment.Fact is, the newly created Bitcoins need to be initially distributed somehow. If you can think of a fairer way then giving it to those who are prepared to dedicate CPU cycles to make the network more secure, let us know.What would be fairer? A set amount of Bitcoins for every person on the planet?  That would create its own set of problems and unfairnesses. Who pays for this huge administrative task? How do you prove that every person has received their Bitcoins? etc. 21 Million is just an arbitrary number. It has no physical meaning except for serving as a reference point. It really doesn't matter whether that number is 21 Million, 400 Billion, or 888.888 Trillion - as long as everyone on the p2p network agrees to adhere to that precise number for the history of the currency. If 21 M "feels" too small for you, then think of them not as 21 M Bitcoins but 21 Trillion Microbitcoins (which they will eventually be called anyhow if Bitcoin ever goes mainstream).Also, in the unlikely event that the smallest unit of divisiblity (1e-8 Bitcoin) becomes too large for everyday transactions, the client could easily be modified to support even smaller divisibility.Yes, some money will disappear, but the more money disappears the more valuable the remaining money will become, incentivising people to be more careful not to lose it.We will never run out of Bitcoins, since however few of them remain, they can be divided indefinitely if need be. To my knowledge, Bitcoin is the only truely decentrasiled p2p-cryptocurrency that has ever made it from concept to production to adoption by online businesses.   Bitcoin already *is* such a small-scale experiment. Would be nice to have a control experiment, an inflationary fork of bitcoin. Let them compete and let the market decide which model is superior.  Such an organisation would not be in charge of Bitcoin. It would simply promote Bitcoin's adoption. Also, there is no reason only one such organisation should exist. One solution would be not to use bitcoins directly on facebook, but "vouchers" that can be exchanged 1:1 for bitcoin. To make those vouchers less currency-like impose rules such as expiry after 30 days. Bitcoin isn't any kind of "istic". It's just a tool.Even in its spirit, it differs from anarcho-capitalist principles in some subtle ways. Anarcho-capitalism is based on the notions of private property and voluntary, but binding contracts. Bitcoin's most intuitive form of usage is based on divulgation, gamerism, and reputation. Not property and contracts. In a way it's a good thing that scammers are attacking this early because it's weeding out the weaknesses in the system. I don't see a problem. The Bitcoin community and the Bitcoin protocol are two independent developments. Piggybacking ideology on Bitcoin is a bonus but not a necessity for its success. The founder community is only writing the charter. How Bitcoin will eventually evolve is beyond its control anyhow. If it catches on, it will outlive the founder community by decades. Bitcoin is a tool that could be used to spread any number of ideologies. It's a very versatile tool; it could fulfill the needs of a diverse range of communities, in ways we can't imagine today. We shouldn't see it for more than it is.   Getting a bank account in Europe is very difficult if you are not a legal resident. I presume the MtGox owner lives in the US outside the Eurozone. The only place I know where a foreigner can simply walk into a bank with their passport and open an EUR account on the same day, is Switzerland.  They still make sure that the barriers are high. Last time I checked with UBS it required a minimum deposit of CHF 50,000 for these non-resident accounts.    +1 Mullvad http://www.mullvad.net/ Why don't you guys take this bet to Long Bets?http://www.longbets.org/ I remember Wikileaks' headache earlier this year when their Paypal donation account was commandeered and when someone leaked the donors' identities.Perhaps we should emphasize that Bitcoin would encourage more donations by protecting the privacy of the donors and so on, using Wikileaks as an example."Ein dezentrales, anonymes System zur Uebertragung von Spenden schuetzt die Privatsphaere der Spender und garantiert, dass das Geld unabhaengig von den Interessen eines Bezahlsystem-Betreibers ankommt."  bin auch Deutschsprachig aber poste lieber auf Englisch. wo ich schon da bin... hat von euch jemand den Mut eine BTC-Devisenboerse zu oeffnen, die IBAN-Ueberweisungen akzeptiert? They are more similar to bitcoin in that payments are anonymous and irreversible, though still managed by a central authorithy. Once a code is spent it's spent. If someone steals your code and spends it it's your own fault; there's no chargeback. Also, you can get them for cash in newsagents, which would be useful for those of us who don't have a credit card.  Sooner or later you are going to want to use large scale infrastructure and the government can easily commandeer that if it wants to and run it as a state monopoly. In most countries, highways, railways, and airports are already a state monopoly. Electricity, water, fuel in some others.If they can no longer make money from taxing income or sales ... worst comes to worst they can expropriate all land/real estate owners and demand "rent" from everybody, in Bitcoins if need be.   What would motivate someone to steal Paypal accounts and then buy lots of Bitcoins at MtGox? What's in it for him? He knows that because of the 30 day freeze he will never see any coins. All he can do is shake up the market and cause grief for the MtGox owner.That would be a hell of a determined troll who is prepared to commit a criminal offense just for a little bit of lulz. Paypal is shit. This was bound to happen sooner or later.Shame none of the exchanges accept Ukash or Paysafecard:http://www.ukash.comhttp://www.paysafecard.comYou can buy the codes for cash at any newsagent, and once you've entered the code the payment is irreversible.

How many people in this forum do you know personally? Today is a historic day for me. For the first time in my life I have made a profit trading a currency - a whopping 30 dollar cents.  Now I am going to reveal my secret trading strategy, ingenious in its simplicity:1) Buy Bitcoins whenenver you can afford to lose the USD (or EUR in my case).2) Never sell Bitcoins for less than you bought them. Ever. I was thinking about launching a Bitcoin accepting website and to get around all these pesky regulations (most of which I probably never even heard about!), what if I just post a disclaimer on the website saying"WARNING: Bitcoin is nothing but Monopoly Money."Would that work? I mean, is it my fault that some crazy people are prepared to trade Monopoly dollars for real dollars on some crazy website in some corner of the big wide web?   How do you interface your auto trading program with MtGox? Do you simulate keyboard input or is there  a less clumsy way of doing it?  He kept insisting that "if there is no guarantee, it's worthless". He was quite dogmatic about this and no argument would convince him, no matter how rational. Oh well. Maybe it's easier to explain it to someone who is ignorant in this area and thus unprejudiced.    I've used bitcoinexchange before. Their exchange rate is sometimes unfavourable compared to what what you can get at MtGox, sometimes favourable. The difference can be 30% but it usually levels out within a few days.Bear in mind that at MtGox you will need to pay paypal fees + paypal USD/EUR exchange commission. At bitcoinexchange EUR bank transfers are free.Since volume at bitcoinexchange is low, it's only good for small amounts at a time.  An anonymous investment market with no enforcement whatsoever is nothing but a game with possible win-win outcomes. Investors and borrowers would eventually arive at an optimal game strategy. This is likely to end up being tit-for-tat with some tolerance for honest mistakes built in.Defection would never be completely eliminated but it's likely to be a small percentage. The aim of the investor is not to minimise defection but to maximise returns. She accepts that this optimum point may entail a degree of defection.  She knows it's part of the game.The most likely defectors would be the newcomers. A newcomer would thus need to offer higher rates of return to attract investors.No contracts, no rules (except those hardcoded into the Bitcoin network), no right and wrong, just winning and losing. If the government knew a secret algorithm that allowed it to break encryption faster than anyone else, that algorithm wouldn't stay secret for long, given the government's dismal record on securing data. Idea: Bitcoin Easter Egg Hunt.Hide wallet.dat files in a software, game, or website you are developing and leave some clues with your users.    I do care about organised crime using bitcoin.The fact that a technology can be abused does not make that technology immoral.  But that doesn't mean that we should ignore such abuse.  We will never be able to eliminate a degree of abuse but we can use our common sense and refuse to do business with people who seem fishy. On a strictly voluntary basis of course.  If the Bitcoin economy becomes too dominated by criminals it will hurt Bitcoin's reputation.  It's still one of the most secure packages you can get because it's open source and has been peer-reviewed.Problem with other packages is, even if they use good encryption standards they may implement them poorly. The likelyhood that there is an undiscovered security hole is bigger because they haven't been peer-reviewed as much as Truecrypt. Technically, it is impossible to steal them because technically, they are not property.Apart from that,They can even be protected against divulgation by torture.Store your wealth in 1000 wallet.dat files. Make sure that you use a scrambler to make the transactions so that it's impossible to link those bitcoin addresses to you. Then hide the wallets in different places. Perhaps Truecrypt hidden volumes. Perhaps Truecrypt hidden volumes nested inside hidden volumes. Perhaps usb sticks buried in your garden.  Perhaps steganographically stored in a photographic print in your grandmother's house.When you get tortured, divulge only a few of you wallet.dat files. The torturer can never know the true number.   The difference is psychological. There seems to be a consensus among the community that bitcoin exchanges should rely on reputation rather than contracts. There isn't a sense of obligation like there is with money. We are more tolerant to the possibility of scams. We see a degree of leeching as a given and factor it into the equation. We try to minimise it instead of preventing it by force. We rely on relationships rather than a sense of universal morality. Sure, whether you call Bitcoin money or not is "just" semantics.  Unfortunately, semantics matters. It doesn't matter for people in this forum. Most of us understand Bitcoin.  But it does matter in terms of PR.  We can't expect the average Joe to understand Bitcoin. (I have given up trying to explain Bitcoin to my cousin, and he is a frigging FX trader by profession!). That's why we need to pay attention to how Bitcoin appeals to the emotions of the average Joe. Details that seem silly to us geeks may make all the difference between success and failure. It doesn't hurt to discuss them.  That is the problem. In order to enforce a contract involving Bitcoins, all the following conditions need to be fulfilled:1) Bob and Alice need to agree on some centralised court or protection agency.2) Bob needs to prove to the court that he "owns" Bitcoin address X by digitally signing a court statement.3) Alice needs to prove to the court the she "owns" Bitcoin address Y by digitally signing a court statement.4) Alice and Bob need to digitally sign a contract that 100 bitcoins will be sent from X to Y and that Alice will deliver 10 widgets to Bob.5) Either Bob or Alice needs to leave some sort of collateral with the court, either in the form of an escrow deposit, or in the form of giving the court jurisdiction over their meat identity. 6) Alice needs to have the ability to prove to court that she has delivered 10 widgets. 7) Bob needs to have the ability to prove to court that he did not receive 10 widgets.Bitcoin CAN be utilised in this way, but this would be cumbersome, expensive, and it would negate most of the advantages of Bitcoin, namely: 1) anonymity2) low transaction costs3) speed4) independence from a centralised third party 6) irreversibilityPeople are not likely to use Bitcoin in the first place if they have to relinquish that much authority to a centralised court; they may as well use the court's own mint and be done with it. This is why I said that Bitcoin doesn't pass the Duck Test for property.  The economic reality for the majority of Bitcoin users is that it doesn't behave like property.   On the other hand: Google vs. AltavistaFacebook vs. FriendsterIE vs. NetscapeI'm not saying that Bitcoin won't become the market leader; I think it has a good chance. All I'm saying is that the first mover advantage can be overestimated. Bitcoin has most of the advantages of gold and few of its disadvantages.I think that some manner of cryptocurrency is likely to become the next gold. However, it might not be Bitcoin and it might not be the current block chain.Once cryptocurrencies enter the mainstream, the price of gold will probably drop to something that reflects only its usefulness in jewellery, electronics, etc., as people stop perceiving it as useful currency. This is likely to be a slow process, because the perception of gold as a currency is ingrained into most cultures.  It could take a couple of generations.    so if I understand correctly, you take all the coins the cluster generates in a  week and divide them among the investors, in proportion to how much Mhash/s they rented?  Or do I only get the coins that "my own" rented GPUs generate? I don't think it does because Bitcoin isn't property. Money (even gold) relies on some sort of centralised court or protection agency that enforces property rights. Without these institutions money would be worthless.  Bitcoin is different from money because it functions in a universe completely devoid of rights, whether positive or negative.  You can't "own" a Bitcoin, you can only know a piece of information that allows you to spend it. If somebody "steals" that information you can't take the coin back by force. Neither can you "owe" a Bitcoin. Sending someone a bitcoin does not oblige the payee to do anything in return.  Reciprocity is based purely on reputation. There is no enforcement of reciprocity.We all agree that a physical person has certain rights, but a bitcoin address has no rights. None whatsoever. There is no way of proving whether a bitcoin address "belongs" to a physical person.  Your model of paying for divulgation doesn't solve the free rider problem.Still, lighthouses can be run profitably in a voluntary market so there is no reason that this can't. Only difference is that it's likely to be less profitable than the paying for diffusion model (back when it used to work). You will never be able to completely eliminate free riders.Another paradigm altogether is that instead of selling static data, you sell algorithms or services. Or rather, you sell their data output and never divulge the actual algorithm.Computer game makers have already caught on to this. This is why you don't see that industry fighting to maintain the copyright staus quo the way the MAFIAA is doing.
Who cares what Satoshi's goals are? He has given us a wonderful tool. We can use this tool for whatever we decide is our goal. History has shown that new technologies often end up being used in ways which the original inventor didn't intend, or couldn't even imagine.  How do you know what his plans were? Maybe it went exactly as planned. Maybe he knew that 30,000 BTC wasn't enough to crash the market and he was only trying to lull traders into a false sense of security.Or maybe those 30,000 were a weather balloon.Maybe next time he will dump 1 million bitcoins. It's probably that nenolod guy distributing his coins between his wallets. Maybe he's scared that we will expropriate him.   bitcoinexchange.comI transferred some EUR to their bank account in Finland and my Bitcoins came 3 days later.Good source if you need some Bitcoins quickly. EUR bank transfers are free and there is less danger of chargeback than using a credit card or paypal. Bitcoin is not trying to replace anything. This isn't an insurgency. It's trying to be a better currency.The Fed will only pay attention to Bitcoin once it's gone mainstream and by then the Fed won't have enough money to buy every coin in existence. Trust is something that can be created and destroyed at will, plus it's subjective, so it doesn't make sense to have a market in trust. There are two happy days in the life of a red elephant owner. Depends how it's done.There's what I would call the static trust model. This is the one most commonly found on the web. It's used by Ebay, Amazon, Web of Trust, and many others.  The trustworthiness measure is simply a constant assigned to each agent.  The number is some sort of average of ratings of all people who have done business with that agent, perhaps weighted according to the size of the transaction or the trustworthiness of the payer.This static model would not work with Bitcoin because Bitcoin is anonymous. There is no way of proving whether bitcoin address X belongs to person Y. If you allowed static rating of bitcoin addresses people would simply create new adresses and inflate their rating by sending money to themselves.Then there is what I would call the network trust model. The trustworthiness measure of each agent is not a constant but a function of your location in the network. The idea is that a bitcoin address would only show up as trustworthy to you if it has been rated trustworthy by address owners that you yourself have rated trustworthy.   This model would work well for bitcoin IMO. It's similar to a social network except that you can have "relationships" with anonymous users, and the relationship strength depends on transaction size and how long you have been doing business with them. We should give him the benefit of the doubt. We shouldn't assume his intentions are malicious just because he is a banker. While traditional banks may see their business model threatened by Bitcoin, there are other, innovative forms of banking that could benefit from a decentralised currency.Sucessful p2p banks do already exist. Here is one example:http://uk.zopa.com The "meanigless computation" aspect is something that I too found ugly about Bitcoin when I first came accross it.True, proof-of-work does create overheads. True, we could be computing protein structures instead of hash functions, IF we could find a protein computation algorithm that has the same properties as a hash function. But then I realised that security always comes at a cost. More security will usually mean more inefficiency, but that doesn't matter too much because people value security. Using the physical gold analogy: Sure, we would all be better off if we didn't "waste" our money on safes und just kept our gold coins in the drawer. All we would need to do is to mutually agree not to steal from each other. Then we could spend the money on something more sexy than safes.  But in all but very small and tight-knit communities, this is unworkable because it only takes one rogue...In any case, the overhead imposed by the proof-of-work function isn't that high. Generating coins is only a small part of the economy; the price of bitcoins is low enough to make generation unprofitable for the vast majority of users.It is reasonable to assume that the few users who still do generate coins, do it at almost zero marginal cost, utilising resources that would have gone to waste anyhow. So it is not as ineffecient as it seems.   His marginal cost of generating bitcoins is probably close to zero. Maybe he owns a windmill and just pumps the electricity peaks, which would have gone to waste otherwise, into generating bitcoins. Same for the unused CPU cycles of his server farm. This doesn't change the fact that selling bitcoins way below the market price would create opportunity costs for him. No rational person would sell a thing for less than people are people are prepared to pay it, even if they found that thing on the street.Of course he might not be a rational person, but the majority of buyers will be.  There is going to be someone somewhere in the world for whom the marginal cost of generating bitcoins is zero.For example:1) A server farm that is used for some other profitable purpose during the day and sits idle during the night.2) A geographical location where electricity made from cheap, always-on sources and surpluses produced during the night are wasted anyhow. Iceland comes to mind.  I'm sure in some parts of the world it's possible to negotiate contracts where you pay nothing for electricity during certain hours. Or some sort of pure flat fee.That someone will always be motivated to generate coins no matter what the price. The only limit to the generation rate will be the amount of capital at her disposal.For the vast majority of users, however, generation will become unprofitalbe and they will give up.Hence difficulty will not depend on bitcoin price, but on the number of new users who find ways of generating coins for free.  This too can be handled by the repuation system. There doesn't need to be a top-down one-account rule. Alice can claim she is Alice all she likes, but if Jose, Sabrina, Anna, Colin, Peter, Jasmin, and Michael all claim that Alice is Bob, then nobody is likely to believe Alice/Bob.It is easy to open a Facebook account claiming you are somebody that you are not. But it is almost impossible to make that account *well connected* and uphold the lie. The person you are impersonating is more likely to find out the more connections you have, and they will tell those connections.Poorly connected identities should thus always be viewed with suspicion, and remember, connectedness is not only a function of the number of connections but of the topological distance from the center of mass of the network, and the latter is extremely hard to forge. If authorities started blocking the websites bitcoin.org and sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/ they could actually be doing the bitcoin community a favor!A dozen alternative sources for the bitcoin client would spring up. Other conventional websites, .onion sites, .i2p sites, torrents, emule, usenet binaries, usb sticks hidden in geocaches, etc. The bitcoin community can be pretty evangelical, especially when provoked. Shutting down one source at a time would then become a game of whac-a-mole for the authorities, with each major shut down generating free publicity for bitcoin.It would remove the only single point of failure that remains in this project. At worst, this would cause the whole bitcoin project to fork into several parallel currencies with independent chains and slightly different clients/rules. But I see that as an advantage because it would mean even more resilience and redundance.  Exchanging Bitcoin for Bytecoin is much easier than for USD or EUR; the overhead would almost be as low as for an internal Bitcoin transaction and the exchange rates would reflect the desirability of each Bitcoin fork.  You don't have to associate with the "industry" in order to run an adult site. Set up a studio, place some ads in your local newspaper, sell the movies on a .onion site that only accepts bitcoin. Even if some Pron Gangsta guy, presumably in California, decides to "make you pay", well he is going to have a hell of a hard time to find out who you are in the first place. And even if he does, will he bother coming after you if you don't live in California but Finland? or Brazil? Not likely, as long as you keep a low profile.  Or maybe I'm being naive here. The thing is just, there seems to be a growing cottage industry of "Erotica by Amateurs for Amateurs" on the web, and I find it hard to believe that these people are all getting death threats from the Pron Mafia. Wouldn't work. The cornerer would simply generate thousands of new bitcoin addresses and distribute her wealth eavenly among them. How do you prove whether a bitcoin address belongs to a certain person? How do you prove whether physical  person X has access to private key Y? You can't. A better idea would be a damping of the trading volume built into the bitcoin algorithm.  For example, you could have a rule of thumb that no more than 10% of bitcoins in existence may be traded each hour. The algorithm could use floating transaction fees that increase as a function of all bitcoins traded the last 60 minutes. As the trading volume approaches 10%, the transaction fees approach 100%. This would not prevent someone from cornering the market, but it would prevent panic selling.Someone who owns more than 10% of bitcoins could of course clog the whole system by sending large volumes of coins to himself, but he couldn't do it for long, and he could only do it once. He would leak massive amounts of coins as transaction fees are paid out to those generating blocks. Rather than permanently crashing the bitcoin price, such an attack would simply make the market unusable for a few hours. What's so special about money? Money is just one form of storing value, among many. What if your profit isn't money but, say, a friend who thinks he owes you a favor? Then the originator doesn't deserve a cut? Why not? The profiteer is profiting either way.Not true that *nobody* will be motivated  to do anything if there's no money in it. Perhaps fewer people, but not nobody. Psychological studies have shown that intrinsic motivators (eg. sense of purpose, belonging, social status) are stronger motivators than extrinsic motivators (eg. money, threat of punishment).As for compensating creators, I agree that it is the moral thing to do, but that doesn't mean it should be an obligation.  Just like saying "thank you" and helping old ladies across the street shouldn't be. There is a difference between advocating violation of contracts, and providing a tool that *may* amplify the harm caused by the violation of a contract.  The act of selling a crowbar to a know burglar does not  in itself constitute advocacy for burglary. Also, believing that people should have the freedom to behave in a certain way does not mean you necessarily approve of that behaviour personally.  It's still a freedom worth advocating, even if it means more of that behaviour will take place. In any case, there are plenty of ethical uses of Tor that would also benefit from bandwidth trading.  And what if XYZ does violate the contract? How harsh would the penalties be in absence of a government-sponsored MPAA racket?  Yeah, you could draft a contract that said "if you leak the film you owe me $100 million compensation", but good luck finding a theatre chain who would be prepared to take that kind of risk. On the other hand, if the mutually agreed penalty was more market-realistic, say $1 million, that would no longer serve as deterrent onerous enough to prevent a leak. All it takes is 1 out of 10,000 employees being careless, or dishonest, and the damage is  irreversible. XYZ would not bother investing millions in airport-style security scans for every cleaning lady that enters the cinema building. It would simply accept the risk of paying the penalty. What bitcoin needs to take off, is a killer app.The only people who are motivated to use bitcoin at the moment are cyphergeeks, who are attracted the beauty of its internal mechanics, and rabid libertarians, who see it as a tool to spread their ideology. The vast majority of internet users are neither of those. Paypal fulfils their needs just as well as bitcoin, so why would they be motivated to switch?The killer app, IMO, would be a system for trading bandwidth on anonymity networks such as Tor and i2p. The problem with these networks at the moment is that they are slow and inconvenient as they rely on volunteers to provide bandwith and suffer from congestion. If Tor users had a way of paying for node providers anonymously, the size and speed of the network would explode.  Anonymous bittorrent would become viable, and judging from the amount of bittorrent traffic on the net, there is no shortage of demand. Increasingly draconian copyright laws, and their increasingly heavy handed enforcement, will motivate even the most lazy bittorrent users to switch.That is one application where bitcoin has a big competitive advantage. There are few, if any, other currencies suitable for anonymous bandwidth trading.
