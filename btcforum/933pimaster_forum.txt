1) Have you been using bitcoin for more than two months?Almost. Basically since the slashdot article on 11/07/20102) Are you currently attempting to generate coins?Yes3) If not currently generating, have you attempted in the past? If generating, how long have you been generating?Since I got it (and remember to leave it on)4) Have you ever succeeded in generating a block? Many blocks?Just the 1  My attempts might have been stalled by the issue with that bad block. I recently upgraded to 3.10.1 beta but didn't delete my old blocks. There was nothing in the readme about it.5) Why or why not do you generate? Purely profit-oriented comparison of cost of generation with market value in another currency? Just for fun? As a selfless contribution to the mathematical strength of the proof of work?Taking the 5 from the faucet felt bad so I gave 6 back. If I had more I'd be interested in seeing what I can do with them.\Not interested in buying any.Not interested in selling for $$$'s, I'd want something more interesting/unique.-edit-I've thought of some useful examples that I might use it for.Donating to a software project to getting a feature built.Recognition of online help.The sorts of things that I think deserve some sort of reward.
