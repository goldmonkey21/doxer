While there is no way to donate to wikileaks right now.  Another option for those who want to help those in the same mindframe for freedom of the press wikileaks would be The Electronic Frontier Foundation.  EFF accepts bitcoin payments.  Information is on their website at https://eff.org.   Thx, didnt know if it was anything to worry about or not. ive blocked these addresses initially, and the bitcoin client is still generating coins and downloading blocks.  If this is the case, why run thru these different ports at all.  So for instance, I just started bitcoin, i get this address192.75.207.148:6667I google the address, and the first 4 sites on the list are all from www.emergingthreats.net.and this ip address98.124.198.1:80Google this one and the 3rd site down is www.malwareurl.com and the 4th site is malwarebytes forum where someone asks why this site gets blocked and the moderator replies: This IP is sadly home to over 30 malicious websites, which is why it is blocked.I just dont understand why bitcoin would even connect to any IP address in question, whether its legit or not. Just started to get into bitcoins and have a question I cant find an answer to here in the forums.  When I start my bitcoin up i get a couple of ip addresses not on port 8333.70.86.96.218:80208.78.68.70:8098.124.198.1:80208.78.69.70:8092.243.23.21:6667thenx.x.x.x:8333x.x.x.x:8333and so onIt always happens when I start the bitcoin client.  I thought at first nbd.  But when I google search these addresses, sites that list botnets, siteadvisers, and other websites listing as suspicious for some of these addresses.I keep watching my ip logs, and these addresses only appear immediately after starting bitcoin.  Does anyone if this is a bitcoin thing or something else? Greetings to all and hoping for future successes for bitcoin.1JfPbs97uzrJPDaC7414XvmYwz6p9yKgKM
