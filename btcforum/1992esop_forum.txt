revenge for bitcoinica Post it, the tooth fairy will handle the rest! This all happened before and I an not talking tulip mania. I am talking to the first bitcoin panic, all the way 10/10/10 mtgox decided who could buy and sell out of the panic based on who you knew. The same today with bid price far exceeding ask but not being executed. A small group of individuals at gox stopped bids from every one but the group during a supposed ddos. Well joke is on every one who sold or got stopped out you just made the group a lot of coin. History repeated, gox won you lose.The only way to defeat banksters is to not deal with them. EVER.Never sell a bitcoin for USD!! SPEND IT on things or service or commodities.Never trade a bitcoin on a market!! Invest in someones idea.This will happen again and again and again and I am just wasting my time again. Petrodollar is backed by force of the united s army. All righteous armys on earth cant change math.Energy return on energy investment of oil has fallen by ~40% in the 21th century. Bitcoin is backed by truly free trade.Centrally planed economics are the lie of intelligent design, the second even one variable changes all evolution brakes loseThe great question will beWhat is more fit for our new world bitcoin/petrodollar/gold&sliver/barter town? +1 with hookers and blackjackare ya selling the 3dvenders or the objects by snail mailcause I wana go to the corner and pick up my new toy now like red box Do you want folding money(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home), seticoin(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI@home) or some other type of science coin? Would it inflate?Would it monetize these(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_projects)?I am with ya all the way that hashing is a wast of electricity! So did mt.gox have all cash seized for money laundering or just card fraud?Is trading mt.gox money rely just passing off bad debt?And why is mt.gox putting up fake low quotes?The way I see it if you buy bitcoins at $0.20gox you'll at least get half of your coin back.If you wait too long the feds mite find his box then you get nothing.It was a good try, and I thank mt.gox for the try.If mt.gox was the edonky.com of bitcoin who is the pirate bay?Perhaps we could take from the "hawala" system.If you sell on ebay the old e-con-o-my will con you just like it did mt.gox.
