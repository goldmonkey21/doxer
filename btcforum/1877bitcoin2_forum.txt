Daniel Domscheit-Berg from openleaks has mentioned bitcoin:http://www.wdr.de/themen/computer/2/republica/domscheit_berg_150411.jhtml Are there any referrer statistics or google-statistics from www.bitcoin.org available?There are Download-statistics from sf.net: http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/index.php?group_id=244765&ugn=bitcoin&type=&mode=weekbut i can't find any referrer statistics.Thanks Bitcoin Faucet running out again : http://www.bitcoinmonitor.com/ http://rinf.com/alt-news/sicence-technology/an-internet-currency-which-promises-to-work/10796/ Laut http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/index.php?group_id=244765&ugn=bitcoin&type=&mode=week wurde die bitcoinsoftware heute bereits über 1000 mal heruntergeladen ( es ist erst 15:30 UTC). Kein slashdot und auch keine besonderen Newsereignisse. Gibt es eventuell eine Referrer Statistik von bitcoin.org?  Ist der Handel mit Bitcoins in Deutschland / Europa eigentlich legal? Falls Bitcoin noch nicht als Währung anerkannt ist müsste ja bei jedem Trade Mehrwertsteuer bezahlt werden, oder? I would like send a part of my bitcoins to a wallet which private key is not generated by openssl. In my worst case scenario there could be an openssl bug like the openssl-debian bug in May 2008. Another elliptic curve implementation would spread the risk of a total loss. What do you think? On testnet I got only a "invalid or state" error message. Has anybody successfully mined a Block with the new Software? writing on usddollar:http://www.freelawanswer.com/law/1543-law-4.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_George%3FMaybe it is a bad idea to make this on usd-notes. Maybe we could take 5 euro banknotes. Only the issuer of the BitDollar are able to double spend because the private key is under a scratch field (if the scratch field is destroyed the BitDollar is not valid) or the private key is in a database from the issuer.If I worked for my money it belongs to me and I can make with it what ever I want, its only paper isn't it? No, the dollar-note is only the paper to print the bitcoin-wallet on because everybody knows the Safety Features of the dollar notes. If the inflation of the us-dollar is coming, we have cheap print paper for our bitcoins :-) We could sign the serial number of a 1 Dollar-note together with the value of the bitdollar and maybe a expiry date and print this signature as qr-code on the dollar-note. Everybody could check this signature offline with an android phone. This should keep someone from faking the BitDollar. The private key could be printing as qr-code under a scratch field on the bitdollar. Or without private key and scratch field, the bidDollar should only convert online in real Bitcoin after the expire date (to prevent double spending). I would like insert a private key from QR code. So I could print a wallet on paper and give this paper to another person. He could scan this QR code with an android phone, check the value and transfer the bitcoins to his wallet. There are cards with display and press button where the amount could be confirmed direct on the card:http://silicontrust.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/maia-display_custom_items-download_seealso_file.jpeghttp://www.incard.com/products.html All Europe prices: http://www.energy.eu/ The bitcoin client is OS independent, but the OpenCL driver for mining / ATI Radeon runs only under win and Linux (for Radeon 5970 linux is recocommend because you can't disable CrossFire under Windows). I don't know if there are NetBSD or OpenBSD driver from ATI. You could take debian or ubuntu and install the driver from ati.  One HD5970 need 300 Watt. Put one computer with 2 HD5970 in your building and you have 600 Watt. I don't know if the windows driver support 2 HD5970 at the same time, but linux should do this. Of course you need Internet connection in your building. You need the standard bitcoin client and m0mchil (or puddinpops) miner. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1334.0;all The EFF built Deep Crack for less than $250,000, I thought he has make it with custom ASIC DES chips (called Deep Crack or AWT-4500) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_crack.How you can help? A full implementation would be great   I would give you 150BTC for a miner implementation (vhdl or verilog) on Spartan-6. Maybe there are other user who would donate. You should write your Bitcoin address in your Signature ArtForz expect the arrive in february: https://stuff.caurea.org/irssi/freenode/%23bitcoin-dev/2010/12/%23bitcoin-dev-2010-12-20.log : 18:36Maybe the first step to develop a ASIC is this vhdl code. I don't believe that ArtForz will give us his code. If we put money together, maybe we could have enough money to let manufacturing a real ASIC.  ArtForz has developed sha256 ASICs and let them (100 pieces) manufacturing for about $500/engine. This ASICs beats 5970 on hash/W by a factor of 6 but loses to 5970 on hash/$ by about a factor of 3, he said. These ASICs are not exactly a real standard cell ASIC but "metal-layer defined ASIC, basically FPGA without the FP part" (source: #bitcoin-dev).
