I'm sure it's called libeatmydata for a reason. Sorry I don't trust computers enough to disable syncing to non volatile storage regularly. Even with UPS battery backup. Uh Blizzard won't like that. wow.com did a feature on how gold selling is explicitly not allowed in WoW.  Such trades could be bannable offenses. You won't find a legit trading price because there is none. The idea is interesting in general for game currencies that have a precedent of being traded. The only one that comes to me is Second Life's L$ Sounds like you value something more like Folding@Home for your CPU cycles. And that's fine. They work towards such goals and reward contribution with points. The work done isn't easily translatable into points however. I've read about the folding project tweaking the point system to reflect different projects and computer platforms running them. So it might be difficult to understand the value of a point.  Energy is spent maintaining the system, true. Some of it would be used anyway some not, but the trading system is worth it.  As an analogy, people drive cars which use energy and also emit CO2. Is the gasoline to drive to the bank wasted in that it doesn't produce any more useful work from you?I'll have to punt to the economics forum on the give everyone all the coins question but I don't believe it will quite work if you drive out all the scarcity. P2P programs don't have to be bandwidth limited. It just happens that the majority of widely deployed P2P networks do file transfers and are limited by your connection speed. The computation work to data transferred is more like distributed computing projects like SETI@Home or Folding@Home rather than file transfer.Suffice it to say that it is verifying transactions and cryptography strength hashes are computationally expensive, and this is good for the value of a bitcoin. For further detail, again, see the paper or the source code.
