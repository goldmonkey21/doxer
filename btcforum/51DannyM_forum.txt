Thank you for this. Will IDISNEY be taking over the tokens for Marvel Comics, Star Wars, and the other pieces of my childhood? Or will I have to acquire those tokens separately? I don't see anything on http://tetla.org that the counterparty asset TETLAS is associated with the project.Can you redeem the counterparty asset TETLAS for physical coupons?Do merchants that accept physical TETLAS coupons accept the counterparty asset as well?  Are the counterparty developers opposed to moving from bare multisig to encoding within P2SH multisig scriptsig inputs?If so, why?If not, problem solved? No he didnt refund anybody, and the SEC acknowledged in doc #2 that pirate/trendon was lying and the evidence is he repaid no one. The time trendon talked to the SEC prior to this interview transcript, he told them he had 100000 BTC left, in his mind it somehow showed he wasnt running a ponzi. At the time of the interview linked above, he claimed to have no coins left, since the court ordered his assets frozen. The SEC called him out on that, "where are the 100000 coins you said last time that you had, and he said, oh I paid some people back. Again, even the SEC acknowledges he paid no one back. You can control it with the "bitcoin-cli" program that is also built alongside bitcoind. It is a bitcoin json-rpc client.

I've got it here in my hand and there is some variance to the speeds and temps of each individual unit; this one here is getting 56 GH/s. There's a small scratch to the black paint that must have happened however they racked them at the data center. It runs great, like it should, only 3 BTC, free shipping to the USA. Yep, that's the last status as far as what's posted there. That was a certified letter I believe informing Shavers that since he stopped replying to the court, a default judgment was entered against him. Looks like he pretended to not be home and never went to the post office to claim it.

IOUs created "out of thin air" with no backing will likely be valued less by the market or not accepted for payment at all by anyone. Check the policies of the gateways and issuers you choose to trust and accept. To obtain a positive USD balance, trust an issuer for USD and have them send you some. Or you can buy it on the internal exchange and that does not require granting any trust. Main USD issuers are Ukto's WeExchange r9vbV3EHvXWjSkeQ6CAcYVPGeq7TuiXY2X and Bitstamp rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B.To obtain a negative USD balance, just get someone to trust you for USD and send them USD via the client.

Thanks. The fix to PoS is a hard fork https://ripple.com/wiki/Ripple_Client
of course devcoin uses the same address format. Post your address here and someone will send you the 300 XRP/Ripples needed to activate your account. I thought he meant satoshi dice shares are his sole retirement plan, which is absurd. Unless you mean "It is [a small part of] my retirement plan", it is absurd. The more people trust you the darker the hue around the "ignore" button gets under your avatar. That really doesn't help anyone. Give us some reasons and details please. Lots of people verified that pirateat40 was not a scam dozens of times. I can personally verify that George W. Bush is immortal because out of all the times he has been observed, he hasn't died once. See if anyone notices if you don't. You lose 5% with both of those "pass throughs". Also check coinbr.com  Of course it does, read the FAQ, its the PUSH command. Not could, it was seeing beertokens (well multicoin) that made "Nasakioto" see how easy it would be to change a few lines and create ixcoins. Too bad he didn't quite understand what he was doing, and his attempt to increase the subsidy generation rate actually doubled the total subsidy at the same rate until patched.Umm beertokens had an exchange that worked, miners, I can get you an old copy of the blockchain if you like, what would make it not "an actual cryptocurrency"? Same for weeds. Also groupcoin is still going at low difficulty. Beertokens - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=9493.0WEEDS - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=24209.msg300830#msg300830Groupcoin - (still active) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=24813.0Ripples (XRP) - ripple.comAlso ask markm which of his OT galactic mileiu currencies started out as actual blockchains, several did, but he stopped thenm due to low hash power. I think with the exception of groupcoin/devcoin, sacarlson's multicoin client got most of those forks you mentioned an easy path to making their genesis blocks and alt coin clients and chains and rules. His Beertokens and weeds experiments were interesting as well. I'm also interested what you estimated the hashes/second of devcoin and ixcoin at. Waiting on an answer to this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128841.msg1409754#msg1409754 So I guess passphrase information in blockchain.info is not hashed? behave. Also http://exchange.zapto.org/ and another:https://btcjam.com/listings/690Off the wagon it seems. 1-888-GA-HELPS
umm, what is this? https://btcjam.com/listings/682 OK, I'll accept that you are of the point of view that now that the lists are released, those addresses should be paid without any further verification. I accept that as a valid argument.I also accept gigavps' argument that if he doesn't do further verification of these lists, he opens himself to a mess if nefario is proven to have lied about the info in the future. I think you both have good-faith arguments there. I just want to point out that without the "invented legal bullshit", specifically without the pressure gigavps' lawyer put on nefario to release lists that nefario must have had no intention of ever releasing, based on his actions up to the escalation of the legal pressure,  there would be no lists, and no addresses to repay.So I accept that some people will consider gigavps a scammer for not paying the lists as given by nefario, but gigavps' work in obtaining these lists in the first place, precludes the possibility of his intentions being to not pay at all. So say he should pay dividends indefinitely without any further info because you think that's the right thing to do, but don't project false intent to scam back to everything he did.  No. If he had not been the one to legally pressure nefario into providing the lists, it wouldn't have mattered one bit that he is not anonymous, it is impossible to pay people if you don't have those lists. By the way, nefario has admitted the lists are even incomplete. If that were the case it would have been much easier to do nothing than to hire a lawyer to express to nefario several times on the record that if he didn't send the lists there would be consequences. If giga wanted to make it difficult for investors to get paid he wouldn't have done this, and it would have been near impossible for investors in any other glbse asset to get paid either. Before giga gets the scammer tag, you would need to give the scammer tag to every other glbse asset issuer, because they did not fulfill the terms of the contract, where giga went to great expense and put himself at great risk to find a way he could continue to pay people, when the easier way would have been to do nothing just like every other asset issuer has done so far. what about GNU/Hurd and Plan9? It isn't possible to buy out the shareholders per the original contract, because that specified the highest traded price, which doesn't exist, as the basis. Unless you want to take the tiny value based on the mpex price. So either making up stories or believing incorrect information that was fed to you is a service to the community? Ditto. hang in there bro I'd liove to see bitparking too. I wouldn't worry. The tagline on their logo says they are "The Ethical Exchange". Since it seems to have been a ponzi scheme, pirate likely has no money, paid it all out in interest to keep the scam going. Maybe linking bitcoin addresses and transactions to taxpayers for tax enforcement purposes. What is STG? What does BCB stand for? What does CTG stand for? What about PT?So you are posting nonsense drivel in the name of helping the people who lost money to pirate is because there is a secret method to your madness and it will help in the end if we just trust you? Why? You don't seem to have any accurate information at all. You're spreading disinformation because "people who know Trendon are reading these threads"? How does that do anything at all? Who are the "we" who will be in touch with poor Charlie? You don't have a "we". It certainly isn't the people who lost money to Trendon cause the ones I know aren't anywhere near as off base as you are. What are you doing anyway? You say you didn't even have any money with him either (which I guess explains why you're so clueless) but what are you trying to do? I'm waiting for you to ask for money or something, its just extremely odd. Thanks, I love "unverified anecdotal evidence". Is there any ETA on when nefario will have an asset claim system? This is turning out to be worst-case scenario. The do have computers on the island of Texas now. What have you done with the real MPOE-PR? What is Ryan Zhou Tong's real name?
I've purchased a few, its a nice test of the #assets-otc system, and a nice to encourage and help artisans, and really nice to keep Bob busy so he doesn't troll other threads Go ahead and throw a coin at this project. The problem is how to have supporters of the project contribute bitcoins toward the cause, in a way most likely to be considered "legal" by aggressive governments. Donations is one way, but how to reward the supporters legally? That show is dumber than "My Mother the Car" Sounds cool. So the bounty also requires running a BCCAPI type server for the devcoin blockchain? No one uses geistgeld because it is a resource hog and the blocks are too fast. Why do another experiment? There have been 2, geistgeld and liquidcoin, and both are unusable for the main reason of the exact property you are trying to add. Heck, litecoin is having problems due to its block propogation speed. I know how you coin will turn out (unusable) because i've tried it and it doesn't work. What are you going to do differently to fix the problem? Nothing, you're going to make it even worse. Good luck with that. Wow worse than craigslist? We all know what a failure that guy's site is. One day when you get your site using the "new" bitcoincharts API, people may remember it and start trading there again! Um, MPEX has always had better assets than GLBSE, but anyway, your statement is certainly not true anymore! Really? What does the HRPT in OBSI.HRPT stand for again?So the assets in NYAN.A did change.

So you don't like the guy, you think his website is obscene, quit making up serious lies or else prove it. Have you personally been involved in any arbitration cases? What happened? What is your investment philosophy? How frequently do I get statements? How will this investment make money? (Dividends? Interest? Capital gains?) Specifically, what must happen for this investment to increase in value? (For example, increase in interest rates, real estate values, or market share?) What are the total fees to purchase, maintain, and sell this investment? Are there ways that I can reduce or avoid some of the fees that Ill pay, such as purchasing the investment directly? After all the fees are paid, how much does this investment have to increase in value before I break even? How liquid is this investment? How easy would it be to sell if I needed my money right away? What are the specific risks associated with this investment? What is the maximum I could lose? (For example, what will be the effect of changing interest rates, economic recession, high competition, or stock market ups and downs?) How long has the operation been in business?Is its management experienced?Has management been successful in the past?Have they ever made money for investors before? Is the venture making money? How are they doing compared to their competitors? Where can I get more information about this investment? Can I get the latest reports filed by the company with the SEC: a prospectus or offering circular, or the latest annual report and financial statements?  oooh, I'm an internet lawyer too. detrimental reliance.
If GLBSE goes away will the F.GIGA.ETF shares on MPEX still pay? Or are they tied to GLBSE shares? Well not GLBSE, but nefario announced that the Bitcoin Global asset listed on GLBSE was in fact officially the company owning and operating GLBSE. When I saw GLBSE trading months later, I thought perhaps some of the Bitcoin Global shareholders had decided to sell. I had forgotten that the ticker symbol was BG not GLBSE. In other words, "Are you stupid, or a scammer?" Can we get an exact timespan it was trading for? I was considering purchasing shares of GLBSE for a couple of weeks. So do you run the DVB stock, UnthinkingBit? It's not clear what activity is generating the bounty that this assets pays in dividends. Thanks. The CLC abbreviation is already taken by "Luke-Jr's CoiledCoin" So you are a psychic detective? Because IF IT ENDS UP THIS WAS A PONZI THERE ARE GOING TO BE HARDLY ANY FUNDS TO SEIZE. Thank you for offering to give us MORE HASHES than our current contract calls for FREE. I also wish it wasn't remarkable here to do business with someone who ACTUALLY KEEPS HIS SIDE OF THE DEAL, but thank you very much for that as well. Thanks. Whose site is that? Is it yours? Dancing. Umm, that's exactly the situation. I love Indiana cats too. what does your avatar mean? I don't get it. Hail Xenu! witnessed. The above post looks beyond not very helpful. http://dot-bit.org/HowToRegisterAndConfigureBitDomains I really think not being on bitcoincharts.com anymore hurts the volume and liquidity at bitcoin-central.net. A lot of people won't bother to manually add an extra feed to their trading system and so they don't even notice the site. Like a penny with a hole in it How about a new tag for such people, we could brand them "bulanulas"
And OP,Despite your jabbering and rambling about violence and supporting violence, IBB has done nothing at all to promote or encourage or perform or support violence. So save your wrath for someone who has crossed that line. It bothers me that you treat him as if he has harmed anyone or coerced or defrauded anyone in any way, when there are ZERO people making such claims other than you.Tell us what he did and when and to whom. "He gets his money from eeeevil Sharia/Islamic activities" is no where near a concrete allegation. Who did IBB hurt? When? Don't make me drag this thing out but rounding up the the dozens of people and projects IBB has helped and the good that came out of that.You mention shooting people and slavery and forced prostitution. Come on! That is so ridiculous and you have absolutely nothing that links the actions or attitudes of IBB to anything even close to that. IBB's goal appears to be to provide small interest-free loans to people who can be helped by them, and also to support and provide hosting, capital, and other resources for new bootstrapped bitcoin businesses.Just stop this nonsense. Hookers and blow. The site was so nice he made it twice I should know better than to reply to a post like this, but...Religion does suck big huge donkey eggs, but please go take a look at the ~actual~ ~actions~ of Senbonzakura and IBB.They have done nothing even close to harmful to anybody (well except maybe unknowingly being an enabler to rexcoin).In fact, they have done a lot of good things; they have helped several community projects get off the ground and promoted the actual use of bitcoin.While I can't disagree with you about the harm religion causes, IBB is not a religion, it is a small bitcoin community organization that has been a great and active member of this community. I'll also add, I've noticed that while Senbonzakura won't get IBB involved with something he doesn't feel is right, such as interest payments or gambling, he is more tolerant of other folks doing what they will than several other folks here. What about Spain?   I bid 1 BTC I'm pretty sure most people are trolling for free. So does this means that astana did not use stolen cards?I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just want to make sure i understand clearly. Yes, lolcust who started geistgeld started the CPU friendly "tenebrix", from which "fairbrix" and "litecoin" were derived.I could be wrong, but it looks like similar straight-forward and simple, yet breaking/forking changes as were done for namecoin, etc. would enable the CPU-based chains to be merged-mined. Coordinating changes for these chains could be seen as difficult because of their low profile, or perhaps it could be seen as simple because the low interest level allows you to overpower the chain with your fork. Geistgeld uses the same algorithm as bitcoin and can be GPU mined with standard bitcoin gpu mining software.For this same reason, geistgeld cannot be merged mined with litecoin. Also http://bitcoinservice.co.uk/ I have found the information and techniques available at the image searching section of Fravia's memorial site very helpful when searching for images and trying to find out more about them: http://www.searchlores.org/images.htm I know, I had to read the thread twice. I see now that bitlane was using a picture of imsaguy all along. I got really confused with everybody changing their avatar to a picture of bitlane, but I think I understand now.Yeah, so if you hold bitcoins, take a loan in bitcoins, or get paid in bitcoins, sometimes the market moves, and not always in the driection you want it to. So this is stealing? http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ Look at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6428.0 for the signmessage and verifymessage bitcoin rpc commands for signing a message with the public key of a bitcoin address you own.

I am so bad at detecting sarcasm on these boards. You do know there is no such thing as a respectable white hat?Don't take my word for it, a good reference can be found if you google the whiteh8 teachings of PHC and the chronicles of el8.Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks. No.pywallet does have a web interface which some find simpler than the command line.  Look at jackjack's fork of Joric's pywallet software for importing the keys from several wallets into one wallet. https://github.com/jackjack-jj/pywalletBe careful though and do some testing and keep good backups just in case!  Get down with IBB Then I apologize to bobajob. I thought IM was short for "instant messaging" also. Therefore I thought the intended userbase was facebook users, sort of a QQ coin attempt. Oh well, I'm wrong again. So funny. Look into this assumption. All done! Thank you Uncle Scrooge and thank you #bitcoin-escrow witnessed. Sorry it's sold, but thanks for the offer. By the way the buyer and I are using #bitcoin-escrow on freenode for escrow. I'm in. I hear you may accept litecoins as well? Okay, but I will feel a little "dirty" since it's not bitcoins. But since I expect you will use it to mine bitcoins, that will ease my conscience. Selling Sapphire Radeon HD 6970. It works great. I'm pigeons on #bitcoin-otc on freenode. I can give you references of other users I've sold video cards to in the past if you want.I'm only asking 31 BTC with free shipping in the "USA" because I'm nice (and need some money). I'll ship elsewhere for the exact shipping cost.Edit - SOLD So what do ya'll think about the "Zero Exchange" project? http://zeroexchange.sourceforge.net/en/book.htmlOne description is that it's like #bitcoin-otc (http://bitcoin-otc.com/) over facebook.While at first glance it seems more applicable to LETS than bitcoin, maybe it can enhance the usage of our favorite electronic tokens. For example:1.) Robert wants to trade his bitcoins with Alicia for her socks, but he doesn't have enough bitcoins, he can draw on his "credit" with Luke.Robert is happy to get the socks he wanted but otherwise couldn't purchase, and Alicia is happy to get the bitcoins she wants and now has more eligible buyers than she would have if she didn't use the system. Luke gets his prior obligations to Robert settled, and everyone wins!2.) See all those large address balances (http://bitcoinreport.appspot.com/)? What if that value was working for mutual benefit instead of just sitting there?I'm sure there are better ideas, what are some of them? I'm sympathetic to your frustration, but let's please not equate this to violence. I've bought keys from Delorean and he's a good guy. Finally got started mining with mine and so far it's nice!!! I got my X6500 from fpgamining.com a few days ago and finally got around to getting it running.Its nice and quiet, not too hot, over 250 MH/s under 32 bit linux.  I saw 2 in your price range from a great guy!http://bitcoin-otc.com/vieworder.php?id=5915 Yes providing tor hidden service names is a great use for namecoin:http://dot-bit.org/Domain_names#Value_fieldTLS support is potentially the most important application of namecoin:http://dot-bit.org/Domain_names#TLS_support

This way they say: "I trust this guys. I checked them out."There are 2 ways users can view other users' partners:1) They can click on the name of the partner in their partners list,then click on the "view trusted traders" link. This way, they can viewthe partners of their partners.2) They can use the public search page that is generated for everytrader. For example: https://www.multiswap.net/search/751181894/?q=alexThis search-URL can be used in any third-party website.-- Minor changes to the manual.The source code is available at:https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmb/"Circular Multilateral Barter" (CMB) is free server-side software formanaging peer-to-peer networks for circular barter exchange.CMB is aimed at supplying local enterprenours with a way to exchangegoods within a p2p-network, without using money or any other currency,overcoming the "double coincidence of wants" problem, inherent totraditional barter.One thing that distinguishes CMB from other "credit commons" is that alldebts in CMB are person-to-person debts. There is no centralpolitical/administrative unit to decide who deserves to be trusted andwho does not. Because of this, CMB should be able to scale-up very well,so that local communities can be seamlessly aggregated into larger ones.CMB allows everybody to issue their own trade-backed currencies, whichothers can use to pay each other with. So, one way of thinking of it isas a "multi-LETS", plus there is a open market place for exchanging onecurrency for another (via circular trade).Here are some of the advantages that CMB offers compared to traditionalapproaches:* Traditional approaches (fiat money, barter dollars, LETS points)unfortunately blend social trust into a fragile system of collectivizedcredit. CMB makes it possible for individuals to use their own judgementin choosing whom they are willing to trust. That is: you supply productsto customers who trust you, and you receive products from partners whomyou trust.* CMB does not suffer the double coincidence of wants problem. Thetrader you deliver goods to and the trader you obtain what you need fromdo not need to be the same person, so there is much more flexibility forarranging trades.* CMB allows virtual money to circulate at infinite velocity so that noreal money is actually needed. That is: trading is not limited by theglobal scarcity of money or any other commodity.* CMB uses money solely as a standard of value for a short period oftime (typically a day). Thus CMB is insusceptible to changes in thevalue of money.Go to http://www.multiswap.net/ to see CMB working! Liberty Dollars held by collectors subject to seizure as contrabandhttp://www.coinworld.com/articles/liberty-dollars-may-be-subject-to-seizure/Liberty Dollars held by collectors may be subject to seizure as contraband by federal law enforcement, officials with the U.S. Attorney's Office and Secret Service said Aug. 24. It seems that new statements by those two federal law enforcement agencies reverse the position released from the United States Attorney's Office in Charlotte, N.C., and published by Coin World in April. The new article quotes Jill Rose, chief of the criminal division for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Charlotte, N.C., and the prosecutor who convicted Bernard von NotHaus that the Liberty Dollar medallions are confiscable as contraband regardless if they are being exhibited for educational purposes only.The most telling new statement in the article comes from the US Secret Service. On Aug. 24, in addition to speaking with Rose, Coin World talked separately with Glen Kessler, assistant special agent in charge in North Carolina for the U.S. Secret Service. Kessler subsequently conferred with his Secret Service superiors as to the potential confiscation and informed Coin World that because the publication has a worldwide audience, he had to defer additional comments to the U.S. Secret Service Office of Public Affairs. George Ogilvie, the public affairs officer for the U.S. Secret Service in Washington, D.C., said Aug. 25 the bureau had no comment on Liberty Dollar and indicated that Coin World would have to call back in a few weeks.  That's good news to hear the site is growing and will be back shortly.Are you going to implement the new bitcoincharts.com API soon? http://bitcoin.crimeunit.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Pagehttp://bitcoin-otc.com/ I wouldn't do this if I thought it would hijack your thread, FreeMoney.Rather, I reckon posting might help to motivate a seller to come forth, by showing the demand exists:I am buying Bi-Lo gift cards too.

I'm sure by the time I finish typing this someone will show you how to actually exploit the sql injection vulnerability. I don't know, but probably they had only paypal as their payment option, and only just starting today or yesterday or so, bitmarket.eu no longer supports paypal trades.They already had discouraged paypal, but fraudsters caused a lot of problems the past few weeks.So give it a few more days and I'm sure it will be straightened out. PMed you.Oops, I meant to send the details as a PM.I wish there was a "quote to pm" button as opposed to "quote to reply" only. Edited Dear "crypto-currency" bitcoin fork projects,Freenode runs such a great free service to the community. Please use another peer discovery method, or your own server, or a different irc network, or AT LEAST, communicate with freenode operators first so they don't spend their valuable time responding to what looks to them like a botnet using their network.Thanks.Love ya. Mean it.<Donate enough ixcoins to xc5RCkt7irRck4feobe4ULQu4mGexpS5Es and I won't release shinier-coin> I have Project Entropia Dollars (PED) I want to trade for bitcoins.
These are the exact 4 notes you get, you can let me know if you have any questions.This is from wikipedia: Just 0.69 BTC total shipped in "United States" gets all 4!(Free Shipping!)PM for Shipping outside the US.Thank you!Danny  Does the satoshi/bitcoin.org client build for you, or do you get the same error?I'm just checking that you have boost installed -> http://www.boost.org/users/download/ I'm running 5 different block-chains at the same time on the same machine. Yes, a separate multicoin instance for each, and at first I wanted a feature like you describe.But there really isn't a need for multiple tabs, just use "screen". The multicoin client will use whatever network/blockchain the config file specifies. The default config file is $DATADIR/bitcoin.conf.The default datdir is ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf, the same as the satoshi client.To use it with namecoins, rename bitcoin.conf.namecoin to bitcoin.conf and put it in your datadir.If you made a /home/mot/.bitcoin/namecoin directory, and started multicoind like this:Code:multicoind -datadir=/home/mot/.bitcoin/namecoinIt will use the /home/mot/.bitcoin/namecoin/bitcoin.conf file.Or specify the config filename with -conf=Code:multicoind -datadir=/home/mot/.bitcoin/namecoin -conf=/home/mot/.bitcoin/namecoin/bitcoin.conf.namecoinCall rpc commands like so:Code:multicoind -datadir=/home/mot/.bitcoin/namecoin/ getinfomulticoind -datadir=/home/mot/.bitcoin/weeds/ getinfoAll of this is the default behavior of the satoshi client. I haven't been able to withdraw from bitcoin2cash.com all weekend either, and also, matching orders were not being filled over the weekend either.I emailed support, and hope for a resolution today.I previously had an issue with my account due to my openid provider, no fault of bitcoin2cash, and he helped me out even though it involved non-automated work on his/her end. He could have found and excuse or not answered, so I believe bitcoin2cash.com operates in good faith.Its a shame cause its so illiquid that I wont be able to trade there unless it changes and its such a cool service, I hope it comes back strong. Thanks for the halving service. I guess it's only about half as efficient as the whole/full service that was offered by mybitcoin.com, but with their servers down, I guess this will have to do. People will certainly use the service, but too many people will fraudulently charge-back that your 15% won't be enough and that is why this is not already widely available.You can use a credit card via paypal to buy linden dollars at virwox.com and then trade them at virwox for bitcoins. I would like to request a 5 BTC loan from IBB, Islamic Bank of Bitcoin for the weekend.I will pay in full Monday, August 8, 2011 with funds that are tied up in transfer.Thank you.14ztzbEumd3YomNFhTPn8RdUajP3yk2A5WYour venture might also want to talk to the guy in the Newbie board about e-dinars:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34615DannyM  e-dinar is a precious metal backed digital currency - http://www.e-dinar.com/Gold backs the dinars and silver backs the dirhams.Traditional Islamic dinar coins were 4.25 grams of "pure gold", but there is a modern initiative to introduce a new version intended for savings/circulation/settlement that will be 4.25 grams of .917 gold alloy.You might want to talk to senbonzakura and the IBB folks - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=21732.0. I think your services could be a great fit for partnership with Islamic Bank of Bitcoin (IBB). Maybe they could start a zakat service in e-dinars or something?E-dinar charges relatively low fees compared to competitors. One issue with most gold-backed digital currency is that a robust market like the bitcoin marketplace (see https://bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade since this is the newbie section) tends not to develop around the currency.It has been suggested that this phenomenon is in some way related to "Gresham's Law", where people holding the gold-backed currency would rather spend fiat currency than gold money when given the choice.Also, of course, bitcoin has the advantages of not being able to be confiscated or seized and not being able to be shut down. E-dinar requires trust in the issuer company as well as that there won't be interference by gangsters/governments.Bitcoin also has some great transparency e-dinar can't really match.But word on the street is that e-dinar.com folks are good people, but do your own research of course.  Thanks. Can you elaborate on this bug and the fix a little? Our credit officer is Helen Waite.If you need a loan, go to Helen Waite.  Tell us what you can about the ball cards. Everybody wants to protect me. If you really want to help and protect me/us, run an open-transactions server or a freenet node or an open wireless AP or donate to Fellow Traveler.  Super fast, super friendly, super-great product! I got mine too. They are great! Thanks for the warning. I'd better look into that for sure.bitparking has been great, they also have a namecoin mining pool for standard rpc bitcoin mining clients. Another good BTC/NMC exchange is https://btcex.com/  I liked that...Where'd you go?You said there would be more! I like the idea, but can't afford another 1% and wouldn't expect to be able to convince anyone else to either. https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki/Business-CasesOperate a transaction server (running Open Transactions) in return for transaction fees. These can be earned anonymously, and thus the server has the option to run anonymously (on Tor or I2P, etc.)Operate a Tor outproxy, services paid for in digital cash. Finally these sorts of services can be offered for profit, instead of relying on hobbyists and enthusiasts!Integrated with an anonymous network, Open Transactions solves problems of resource allocation. College kids will leave their computers running all day while they're in class, so that anonymous file-sharing can occur through their computer while they're away (collecting digital cash postage in return.) When they get home, the postage is theirs to keep -- or they can use it to pay for their own downloads. Voila! Anonymous networks can now be drastically sped-up through the anonymous contribution of resources. If you don't want to contribute computing resources, that's fine: just pay for those resources with anonymous digital cash instead, and the network will provide you those resources from someone else.Write a Wallet software that is also a file-sharing client, that allows users to pay for faster anonymous resources using digital postage. The wallet also contains an anonymous network node internally, so it has the capability to collect postage as well. If the Wallet software is unregistered, then the postage is sent home to the software company. Also, expired cash reverts to the software company. But once the wallet is registered (with a payment to the software company) then postage is retained by the user and expiring cash is exchanged for the user. The wallet software itself can be distributed for free. This constitutes a great example for the next generation of file-sharing integrated with digital cash....
Thanks for setting up this service.Suggestion:Integrate Open Transactions and its PGP-signed Ricardian-style contracts.https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki It could be important to people who donate bitcoins to an address associated with a politically unpopular yet legal and moral cause.Some of the coins in the donation could be linked to you from another transaction, and you don't seem to be able to control which specific coins you pay with. OK, I'll try it too! I ordered a set for my collector friend. They came the next day! They look great! Thanks Since that post over a year ago, bitcoin denominated accounts were added, first to Raindroplet https://raindroplet.info/ and then to Ripplepay http://ripplepay.com/ Make sure to always follow tax advice from internet forum members rather than a professional tax advisor. That's great news anderxander!Did you correspond with anyone at the project to make that happen?If so, share your experience, maybe it will be helpful for understanding how to approach other organizations. Thank you for this and all your work FT.Maybe the escrow use case discussion should have it's own thread, I bet many people with good thoughts won't be reading this one.The only features I can think of are: * configurable agreement between parties on the number of confirmations before a transaction is accepted.* integration of ripple-style trust routing: http://ripple-project.org/Protocol/Protocol05Also, for my particular issue, I should be fair to paypal and mention they have restored my account and will follow their standard practices against the thief.Everyone who isn't aware of Fellow Traveler's work please get familiar now: https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wikiEveryone who is familiar, please send him some support. That may be an issue for a little while still, but it looks like the ubitex project is just getting started, so I wouldn't expect to find many users yet.It looks interesting to me too, I'll look into it some more to see how they will handle the details.  There is not. That has been outside the scope of this project, but there are several projects for a future "secure wallet protocol".Here are the best practices in the meantine: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet That link does not relate to bitcoin being illegal. It it discusses the regulations of the United States regarding the -exportation- of crypto systems outside of the country, not their -use-.I had a bad day and I'm feeding the trolls. I'm sorry. I'll stop. While I acknowledge this, you have not provided any statutes that back up your claim that "Bitcoin is already illegal in most places.  even in the US." Does anyone have any proof of this allegation that the UK Serious Fraud Office (I was SURE that was a fake name until I looked it up) is investigating bitcoin?The connotation is some sort of "serious fraud" investigation. By "bitcoin"? Who is bitcoin? Who has been defrauded?  Today I sent bitcoins to bitcoinmarket several times and they always showed up in my account immediately after 1 confirmation on the network.Did your transaction confirm?I see a support email on the "contact us" page. I had had a very similar experience from the same exact thief.No need to mention I was careless, I accept that. I have had the same experience as Ian and my paypal account was limited (can't withdraw ANY money) because of it. They want me to fax proof of shipment.It was the same user b4rrydoyle, user 5184 on BitcoinMarket.If this is somehow a misunderstanding I will update this post and thread. I just got limited by paypal today.I just got a dispute of not received from a bitcoin related transaction too without any contact from the other party yet.UBITEX FTW http://ubitex.org/ ---------- Forwarded message ----------From: Bernard von NotHaus <bernard@libertydollarnews.org>Date: Wed, Jun 1, 2011 Subject: Kevin is OUT!Kevin is really out. Praise the Lord and all of you who have supported Kevin while he was incarcerated! I am very pleased to report that after almost two years in stinking county jail, Kevin Innes, my male co-defendant in the Liberty Dollar case, was released at 4:PM on Aloha Friday, May 6, 2011! He is currently living with his wife, Julia, who stood by her man and was the biggest moving force to get him released. Kevin is currently working on becoming an American citizen and assisting Julia in her dove business of releasing trained white doves at weddings, funerals and other important life events. Please send a quick email to Kevin via: worldmusician@gmail.com. Julia can be reached via: aspiritswings@yahoo.com. Her website is: www.aspiritswings.com.  I want to vouch for Dustin Dollar and his bitcoinmarket.com site. Dustin is a long-time bitcoiner and one of bitcoins entreu-pioneers, and a stand-up guy.That said, I have heard from others that customer support and response time and communication have been challenging lately.Who was prepared for this explosion of interest in bitcoins?I'm sure he will get in touch with you and straighten this out.Try leaving him a PM on the bitcoin.org forum user dwdollar.I agree that your experience is troubling, I just wanted to give another view from someone who has had good experiences with Dustin and bitcoinmarket.com.Good luck! I was not familiar with open-e-farm. I see there is some information out there to be found, but what are your personal experiences and thoughts about the project? Can you give us some more info on possible bitcoin/open-e-farm synergies?
