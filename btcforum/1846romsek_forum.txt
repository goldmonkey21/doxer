I just wanted to let you know that i experienced the exact same problem on Ubuntu 10.04.3 64-bit using the current version of the Bitcoin client. The block where it crashes is 130670. That did the trick. Thanks again!  Thank you very much, twinpeaks, that solved the problem.Now i get the same output like you. On behalf of the users in #bitcoin-charity:"Hi guys me and some other bitcoiners just created the irc channel #bitcoin-charity on Freenode. it is intended for people with very immediate financial problems, say like you dont have enaugh money to provide enaugh food for your child, your dog needs immediate surgery and you dont have the money or really need money to continue your education and so on.We also need people willing to donate a small amount of their Bitcoins to people in need, so if you consider yourself wealthy enough to be able to provide for all your needs we would very much welcome you Please dont abuse this channel.

Like i said i already got this error days before MtGox was down. Source: https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20208066-huge-bitcoin-sell-off-due-to-a-compromised-account-rollback For some reason, your application is not working anymore for me.All i get is this (i got this error days before MTGox was down):Code:== 2011-06-19 06:54:16 ================================*** curllib: Operation timed out after 30001 milliseconds with 0 bytes receivedPHP Notice:  Trying to get property of non-object in /home/peter/toyotasupra-ToyTrader-7825748/mtgox.php on line 35PHP Notice:  Trying to get property of non-object in /home/peter/toyotasupra-ToyTrader-7825748/mtgox.php on line 36USD:   BTC:  Z.B. die gesamte Kette nicht laden zu müssen. Da das nun schon mehrmals in diesem Thread fiel und ich das Argument schon aus anderen Foren kenne: Eine geringe Anzahl Beiträge lässt nicht darauf schließen, dass jemand unglaubwürdig sei.Wieso denn nicht? Ich komme auch schon seit langer Zeit ohne das Forum "zurecht", das ist doch kein Indiz. So lange der Threadersteller sich nicht meldet, hilft aber ohnehin alles Spekulieren nichts. But in grondilu's information market you can't sell your information hamburger more than one single time. With real hamburgers, you can.Thanks for your reply, grondilu.But would you buy a block for 5 $ if there is a chance that you will never get the complete content? IMHO for this hypothetic information market to be attractive it needs several pre-conditions like an existing anonymous p2p network where content is spread anyway. Else there won't be a big demand for such an information market: Without an anonymous network it's still more lucrative for an information distributor to sell information the traditional way. This may not apply to content where small amounts of earnings are expected.Also necessary would be a rethinking of people about how they buy content and about the idea of property.From the point of view of a consumer it will look like this:Buy block(s) for a quite low price if demand is highWait for the expected money to be raised (if it will be raised at all!)When raised, download remaining blocks and finally be able to consume contentLive with the fact that others will be able to consume content without ever having to buy blocksFrom the point of view of an information sellerAdvantage that there is no need to provide a distribution infrastructure itself like file servers etc.Necessity to set a price one time without room to make more profit in the future with the same contentWill a purchaser risk to invest any money even if there is a chance that the expected money will not be raised at all?Are people patient enough to wait for the complete blocks to be sold until they can consume the content? How long will it take? The less popular, the longer it will take?
