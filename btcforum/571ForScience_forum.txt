if he sends you 20 that also makes him a scammer, if he refunds you your money then theres no reason to list him as a scammer, he admitted that he screwed up and so long as he refunds then theres no reason to go to the extreme of listing him as a scammer, after all it was pretty pretty clear that he was joking which is why i only risked .03, although it was a very hard earned .03anyway i have now received my refund of .03, but i would have liked to have received .06 in return even if that made him a scammer  you posted your address and you didnt expect anyone to send you money? somebody didnt think their scam through  i was going to keep sending back a third of my earned money so that i was never at risk after the first returnmy address 16YXoiWXiPZcv6ScF9aT1nRZ2LEsWs8kkV is in the from field and you can verify it all you have to do is stop the client and copy your files to your local computer and then run bitcoinbitcoins are really hard to generate you dont want to know what i had to do to get those .03 bitcoins so please refund my bitcoins i was the first to publicly donate to this opportunity so you really should send me all .06 bitcoins anyone else who wants to reward my investigation for science is welcome to send me bitcoins as thanks to the above address this needs to be investigated for the sake of science, i promise i'll post my results honestly, i just sent .03 bitcoins, i'll edit this post as the bitcoins start rolling inno bitcoins as of 7:00 pm gmt time on the 23rd  i'm glad i didnt send over 300 times more bitcoins like that other guy
