My last Mtgox withdrawal arrived today :-)2013/05/04  745e -> received on 2013/05/07 (3 days)2013/05/05 1000e -> received on 2013/06/03 (29 days)2013/05/06 1000e -> received on 2013/07/23 (78 days)2013/05/07 1200e -> received on 2013/08/01 (85 days)2013/05/15 2000e -> received on 2013/08/13 (90 days)Even if these delays are terribles, in my point of view Mtgox is OK they doesn't lost my money like Mybitcoin did (around 100btc lost).My wish now is to have the same happy end with bitcoin-24 !I wish good luck to everyone who wait for withdraw. This is my datas updated :2013/05/04  745e -> received on 2013/05/07 (3 days)2013/05/05 1000e -> received on 2013/06/03 (29 days)2013/05/06 1000e -> received on 2013/07/23 (78 days)2013/05/07 1200e -> received on 2013/08/01 (85 days)2013/05/15 2000e -> Waiting ...For sure it's really too slow, but it's look like that they will finally pay all my withdrawal :-) I hope ! It's because after waiting long time to validate your bank acount, they write you that you are allowed for withdrawal > 1000 BUT before you have to ask for it and wait a week more !!! It's why before the 2013/05/07 it's was not possible to ask more than 1000in reality without their slow procedure these withdrawal can be started from april.I agree with your argument, but in my point of view i doesn't understand why their software doesn't automatically agregate these withdrawal ? An Euro SEPA withdrawal newly arrived !!!This is my datas updated :2013/05/04  745e -> received on 2013/05/07 (3 days)2013/05/05 1000e -> received on 2013/06/03 (29 days)2013/05/06 1000e -> received on 2013/07/23 (78 days)2013/05/07 1200e -> Waiting ...2013/05/15 2000e -> Waiting ... Thank's for the info, so they are very slow but doesn't stop. It's a good new.PS: Today i received my Yubikey from Japan to Europe, so post is faster than electronique banking ;-) I'm curious to understand in which order MtGox proces our Euro SEPA withdrawal ?For sure it's not in first in first out !!!This is my datas :2013/05/04  745e -> received on 2013/05/07 (3 days)2013/05/05 1000e -> received on 2013/06/03 (29 days)2013/05/06 1000e -> 45 days and still waiting ...2013/05/07 1200e -> Waiting ...2013/05/15 2000e -> Waiting ...I'll update, If it's can help to find the clue.
