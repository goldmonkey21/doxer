Hi! I think Bitcoin is very innovative! Since I installed the Windows client and started generating keys, I have continuous hard disk usage? I admit I have on 1 GB of memory, and it is completely in use. Is the Bitcoin client highly memory intensive, or does it store a lot of data? Thanks for considering this issue, which may become a barrier to utilization for me at some point. Thanks for your perspective, Michael
