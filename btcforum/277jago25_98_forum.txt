My channel also got shadowbanned. To sad that every cryptotuber gets censored!! Where's freedom of speech?? Actually read a news article that the Halving might not have cause the big previous bull run and might not have done it this time. Covered that in todays Analysis and News video https://youtu.be/dowwTpAd0-kBut looking at all world events: Money Printing, Trade Wars, Hyper inflation, COVID-19 and so on I expect a bull run coming. However it might drop first but I see the halving event as a possible contributor to a bull run of Bitcoin. The future of cryptocurrencies will continue to grow. Mass adoption is around the corner. Look at everything that is happening in the world.Explained this topic quite a few times in several videos. Debt/GDP ratios, money printing, COVID-19, Trade Wars, Velocity M2 money supply and so on.Check it out if you're interested on the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpVFVb5ACbRfmZxKgb5CFcQLatest video: https://youtu.be/e2_L7YHS-bU Gold is heavy, physical, difficult to move from one place to the other. The so-called Physical Supply Chain is what makes Bitcoin " better".As you can keep your bitcoin easily with you in whatever quantity you want. In times of disruption, you can move anywhere in the world with your whole capital. Although gold has value as a precious metal, I do believe that Bitcoin outperforms Gold as a safe haven. But if you look at building a portfolio I believe diversifying is key and both gold and bitcoin are good to have in there.Covered it in today's video (also previous videos)  https://youtu.be/e2_L7YHS-bU  Explaining Gold vs. Bitcoin Nice chart. The great spot on the Bullish Flag. This price right now seems due for a correction. There will be inefficient miners dropping offline. I can imagine they are ready to cash out.You can see that price is flattening at the moment and volume is extremely low. I think there's a big move coming soon Source: https://youtu.be/VV3JFhmy7U4 Hi Everyone,DELETED Yes I think you're right. But I heard rumours that the pattern of Bitcoin is over and that it will choose a direction anytime soon. I'm a BTC believer and will hold mine for long term. Segwit gives hope! I believe in btc. Still regret selling a lot back in 2014. Luckily I still have a good amount left. If the devs manage to implement innovations that reduce the fees and speed up the transactions then btc will be used as investment and daily payments. That's quite a statement. I don't try to advertize Dash at all. In the topic question I even ask if there are other coins people think that will be used as payments. Anyway, I see you're not a fan of Dash, that's fine. What about the high transaction fees of bitcoin? Can you imagine if amazon accepted bitcoin payments and people order a book for $20 and have to pay high transaction fee which makes it too expensive? I see BTC more as a investment than a currency for daily payments. Masternodes. Unlike Bitcoin, Dash introduced Masternodes to incentivize users with payments to secure the network and add cool transactional features like InstantSend. Masternode operators invest 1,000 dash to host a Masternode. InstantSend. Instasend uses the instantX Masternode feature to send and confirm transactions in seconds. Bitcoins block propagation takes an average of 10 minutes, and 6 typical conformations for large purchases could even take an hour. You probably meant that bitcoin is not much older than dash .I definitely agree that bitcoin is more an investment asset. If you look to LTC which has actually more potential than btc to be used for payments as the fees are much lower and the transaction time faster. Agree but the danger for ETH is that their blockchain can be stuck with transactions caused by for example these kittens. Well I agree with you if the transaction fee of BTC was lower than it currently is. The fee is only interesting for transferring big amounts of money. Dash is faster, better encrypted and the transaction fees are way lower. Probably it has a substitute by then because we might be using different computer technologies, quantum computers, it needs to upgrade it's codes and safety.But I'm a believer and Bitcoin WILL survive. Will Bitcoin become the new gold and will Dash be used for daily payments? Any other potential crypto currencies in mind that can replace BTC or DASH? One million is overrated but it most definitely can hit the 100kIt's the new gold.  It's just a rumor to scare people. There are numerous other articles in the past about China's ban but it never happened. And IF it happens, not much will change. Bitcoin can easily survive without China. Bitcoin is leading and definitely the future. I will hold on to my btc and don't sell. In a few years there are so many people who had wished they'd kept them. Bitcoin will be more well-known and more accepted in the future. Can you imagine if a few major internet companies will accept bitcoin payments... People let themselfs easily scare by bad and fake news. The one with patience will be rewarded. If you need them for living I can't disagree with you. If you can "miss" the money I'd strongly suggest to save at least 1 as investment. Agree, although for many people $2k is a lot. But glad to see a lot of new members here. For longer existing members I'm also surprised that they don't have at least 1 btc. 
You can buy bitcoins. In the future the bitcoin will only gain more value. My believe is that shortly after the fork the bitcoin will gain a lot more value. According to the topic question "Which coins will you invest in before Aug 1" it'll be too late for the ARDR ICO. TrafficX is launching on the 25th this month. Perfect investment. Also Eros is out. Waves, Ethereum, Dash, Maid and the rest on new icos such as Eros and TrafficX and gain a bonus as well. ICO not made it Everything can be hacked. Just make sure you have your own private keys. One of the safest ways to keep your coins is to save them on a paper wallet. Make sure you don't lose your paper wallet! Bank and governments are afraid of crypto. Several banks are developing their own block chain at the moment. They know if they don't catch up they will loose in the end.  Bump!?! (reserved: for the actual writing result) Aragon is an interface for decentralised companies, running on the back of Ethereum:https://aragon.one/I didn't think much of it until it raised $25mil in 15mins, the most successful dApp IPO we've seen. How's about we try it out on the kovan testnet (it's in alpha) and give it a go to learn how to use it. This will surely be messy. It will be interesting to see if Aragon makes any difference in organising a thread like this. There's a web version via Chrome, linking to the Metamask extension. Since this is just a test let's not worry about the security of that just yet...Here's the company link. Join here: 0xeed0d46b10207eb10ffa200b4d845643fca89a87Let me start with the story. 2 opening paragraphs to open to vote on taken from /r/writingprompts1) "It took them twenty years to notice I wasn't aging and report it to some relevant authority. Twenty years, three wardens, four cell blocks, forty-one sessions in solitary."(user: preston_stone)or2) "The oldest man in the world sat behind bars, his wrists cuffed together and feet chained to the floor. Officially, he was 140 years old, though that was because his doctored birth certificate had him born May 28th, 1870." (user: Jraywang) A few musings on a chain of problems. Rather than put in a specific forum I thought why not make it wider.I've sent a password reset for Ripplepay classic and haven't received that email. Same problem with the Ripple forum (not in junkmail...). Should I be worried... I believe Ripplepay moved to something else since this point? So now I have to migrate that old account over. I think this time I'd like to self host once I get the key off. I hope that doesn't use much disk space. Seems a good use case for Ripple, not using XRP for long. The reason for all this is to use Alipay. I have to use Alipay to pay for something from a Chinese Taobao agent. There are exchanges but there's a minimum which is too high. Perhaps I should try localbitcoins next. Topping up Alipay with a credit card doesn't work and has a surchange anyway. No debit cards are accepted. The password reset link for alipay is broken (!). A comedy of errors. So, I was thinking to try Ripple. Ripplefox have a alipay bridge which would be nice to try. It's clear once I have a ripple login working again I can send to them for the exchange ( https://jc.ripplefox.com/#/withdraw ) ... but it's not clear how to then instruct them to actually get the alipay note off ripple and send to my alipay (or someone else's...?)Funny that there is no Taobao agent accepting Bitcoin. Is there a reason for that? Agents for westerners charge double... agents for locals living abroad only accept Chinese methods such as Wechat. ...perhaps there's an exchange doing Bitcoin<->Wechat credit....  I figured you guys would actually be some of the best to ask. What card can I use with limited liability to verify my AWS Amazon account? I want to use Glacier for backup but I don't want my credit card on the hook for an unlimited bill if my account gets breached. Mixed reports on entropay. Since it's possible to buy gift vouchers and AWS credits (against T&C's btw) actual paying shouldn't be a problem - it's just verification.  Not looking for privacy, just some liability limit.    I have had this error for a few days now and I seem to be ignored. I'm tied of asking for them to look into it. When trying to trade I get the error "Internal Error".Looking into the matter it looks like some problem with verification because a window quickly pops up and closes with less than 1/2 a second. ...but when I enquire I am told that my account is verified.  What to do now? Perhaps another way to contact support?In the meantime, beware.   First it was ethereum, now Pokemon Go. Since Bitcoin I've tried to keep an ear to the ground on disruptive technology. Only thing was that keeping up with all the altcoins got wearing and when ethereum came along I missed it as I'd stopped checking the news. Likewise with Pokemon Go my interest in Ingress waned a bit. It seems I take an interest really early but by the time it gets popular I'm on to something else. It would be good to have someone look out for these things for me. Is there some thread, blog, or site somewhere for this kind of news? What's another interesting thing you've seen come along that has taken your interest?  I don't really want to buy a virusscanner for mac... I would prefer to use a service to scan the file for me... or use a portable application to scan it (clamav maybe...)Is there a service out there scanning for bitcoin? Or a way to get past that 128mb limit?  Where can I follow the attempts to trace the missing coins? Do we need to keep checking back all the time or can we relax a bit, forgot about it and wait for emails...   This previously hasn't been a thing because of the sensitivity of designs. However...  with 3D printing taking off and these designs being shared a lot more there's a market for this I believe. I've been using free solutions but most people are using hacked copies of Solidworks. I don't want to buy the hardware and a full license just to sketch out a quick idea. If you have a gaming machine I suggest to rent it out when you're not using it. PM me for offers.  Done. Offered diag version, but hasn't been sent yet.  Can confirm. Same here too. No firewall, no permissions restrictions. Can't see review comments from other people on the play store, only stars. But maybe it's working for some people? 29th May 2015UK FATCA I noticed this nugget summary today regards UK FATCA. Basically it looks like the UK has seen some sense after seeing how FATCA for the USA has alienated the USA businesswise and barred USA citizens from banking in other countries due to the high costs abroad. I expect the plan is to let the USA push the way for reporting abroad and then when (if?) it becomes cost effective, step up reporting to match the USA. At the moment it only effects crown dependencies so in a worst case scenario it might mean residents in the Isle of Man, or somewhere where foriegn customers are more common could find themselves unbanked.What it basically means is that UK Bitcoin exchanges have choices for residency KYC - :from http://www.arthurbellcpas.com/article/fatca-2015-significant-deadlines-and-uk-fatcaIn general the UK now has a lot of info regards foreign transactions... in theory. They probably always did through spook agencies. It's just now they have info they can use. Norwich and Peterbough free debit card ATM abroad withdrawnStill seems to work for card holders. But no new accounts being opened. Metro ATM free withdrawals reduced to SEPA ZoneIt's now SEPA zone only for Metro Bank. To open an account you have to go to London. SEPA transfers still expensiveThe UK still likes to think it's different, charging for SEPA zone transfers. Seems a bit strange. Why the cost? Language barrier? Why is the rest of Europe able to do it but not here? Transferwise and currencyfair offer an alternative. This begs the question... why don't banks cut them out and do it themselves taking the profit? Both TW and CF both are blocked from sending to Bitcoin exchanges. However... there are probably some exchanges they aren't aware of yet as there are so many. CurrencyFair and Clearing Houses - watch outIf you send a payment with CurrencyFair bear in mind that if you use the cheap option, your name will be stripped from the payment info. This means that due to Know Your Customer (KYC) the receiving bank may withhold your funds. I wonder what the legal aspect of this is. I'm not sure if Transferwise has this problem. Bitcoin debit cardsMost seem to be available for UK customers. Thankfully FATCA hasn't scared them off. Some banks are lumping in UK customers with USA due to FATCA because they heard UK is FATCA too... and blocking business. Thankfully not here so it seems. Bitstamp isn't a very cheap one... and since you can't interact with them due to bank blocking, not much use.Cashing out coin is easier in this sense. Prepaid cards for the unbankedThe homeless etc, still paying massive fees. Kalixa seems to be cheapest. Bitcoin cards not really any better than this for fees.Getting slightly offtopicList of UK Bitcoin merchants info thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=261667.0UCL seem to still be active with Bitcoin development:[url]http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/bitcoin/[url]Please let me know if you have any info people should know and I'll update here  One thing I've learnt is that by following the money you can learn a lot behind the politics of the world.I want to start a thread tracking UK financial services. Things like regulation. Things like"is SEPA ever going to be cost effective here or do we have to keep using Transferwise and CurrencyFair?" Debit card costs abroad, this kind of thing. Things are changing all the time and it would be good to go to a central place to keep updated. 
New email or scam? How secure is the insolvency procedure I don't know... Taking a long time at the moment with:It's slightly in favor of the person selling their coins in exchange for the goods:  If you signed up with an incorrect name on Bitstamp (and thus unable to verify) you will lose all your funds in 2 days time. I have a friend from Slovinia, I will ask him on options for lawyers. Is there a contact number for the company? I can't login as my Google Authenticator got wiped (turns out Google Authenticator isn't backed up by Google backup...) edit: related thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826251 who is the regulator? http://www.qwghlm.co.uk/toys/dailymail/ Would be amazing if somehow there was a way to port indicators from another platform. MT4 in particular has the most indicators but is not a good platform. There are now lots of obsolete indicators out there for MT4 because of Metaquotes treating clients so bad. Opensource would be an excellent lesson in this area.  Yes. You have to upload the Bitcoin applet to a spare Yubikey applet slot. It's similar to how you use the Yubikey with the GPG applet I believe. What I don't know is how exactly you interact with the Yubikey once it's installed. AFAIK you can't have PGP, the normal Yubikey stuff AND Btcoin applet at the same time since there are only 2 slots... on a Neo anyway... I think. I think at the moment you need to be a programmer to interact with it:http://opensource.yubico.com/yubico-bitcoin-java/apidocs/com/yubico/bitcoin/api/YkneoBitcoin.htmlTo be perfectly honest I'm a non programmer in the main and I'm just hoping to bring some attention to it. That code would be a great addition either to Myceilium or as a standalone app. If anyone's reading this and has a Gox key, Gox kindly locked the keys so you need to crack the pin to do something like this. I bet all the pins are the same so hopefully someone can crack it and share... and probably legally so since the company is no more (bankruptcy email out today)  1) Is it possible to program a chain of transactions with multisig to form logic?  2) What is currently using multisig? Has there been any developments of anything running off the back of it other than a simple interface? (not to degenerate the website interfaces - those are fantastic to see) If you want to play with the ideas at https://wiki.unsystem.net/index.php/Bitlaw I suggest the sx commandline tool as a starting point:  Code:ToolsBlockchain transparency + multisig for organisations.Accountability for actions taken within an organisation towards participants (shareholders, community .etc).Tools for managing working groups.Accounting tools.Establish micropayment channels for ongoing payment of a good.Trustless resilient purchasing by doing swaps, where swap_amount == tx_feeArbitration platform.See arbcom on Wikipedia.Enforcement?Competitive/polycentric law?Enabling different legal systems to interact.Auditing and transparency.Blockchain data for spends.Multisig working groups.Tools to issue securities/tokensTraded p2pAssurance contractsSIGHASH_ANYONE_CAN_PAY -> multisigCrowdfunding interface.Bonds, securities, options, futuresFood trading within CIC + CSAsPrimary contract: A promises B to do XSecondary contract (guaranteeing performance): C promises B that if A does not perform, then C will compensate B First of all, a massive thanks for a great app! Great appS!I saw this:https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-bitcoin-javaYubico-bitcoin-java-android allows using a Yubikey as a Bitcoin wallet via NFC and a Yubikey Neo. I guess this would be better off as a separate project in which case this is offtopic... but there is currently no interface for it. Possibly offtopic if you feel this is not a good idea to have this in the advanced section of Mycelium... but this really seemed like the best place to mention it.  Stop hunting is completely endemic in the forex world. It must be expected here too. The only thing to do is walk away from all trading until transparency is achieved - producing the trade ticket receipt from a straight-through broker. More motive for Bitcoin enforced contracts and decentralised exchange. People are broken so we are replacing them with robots.  Before Bitcoin forex brokers were the scammer of their time. They still are.Here's a run down of why they all might be scammers, sharing my experiences. 1) FXCM. They don't cover Bitcoin but it's worth sharing to show how common this is. Not necessarily too bad if you trade with them on the daily timeframe. However, I found:- price movements during recess time- trailing stop moved the wrong side of price (so it never triggers)- buy and sell limits not engaged (yes, far side of both buy/sell line of the spread)- TP not triggering. - MT4 platform in particular wouldn't put the trade through with a particularly good opportunity comes along... various "errors"... 2) Avatrade. I had a short on Manchester United and Bitcoin. Had a margin call due to the price of MANU spiking to 74 from 17. The data feed has never shown that price. Avoid. I expect xCFD to scam in some form. Any broker that can't produce the trade ticket - expect them to scam you - and that is every broker as far as I know. There is a plugin for MT4 and other platforms designed to help them widen spread to stop you out. Search for ECN Jesus as this info has been censored. Other tactic include massive leverage such as 500:1 which will cause you more swap bills and also, well... the professionals don't use leverage.  Many firms have been slapped with fines but continue to steal people's money. Beware.  Is there actually any code behind this project? Is any of https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/tree/master/src actually not from the freenet project? "What stage is MaidSafe at right now?  At https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki/Roadmap I see that, over a "local static network," that "Login/Logout via MAID keys" and "Store/Get data chunks" currently work.  Okay, but surely that's not all, because I also see..."from: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/maidsafe-development/vnJFdUdll7EI have to say, if there is literally nothing to invest in... this is the best business plan ever! Raising $6M already - can't imagine that on Dragons Den. When I heard about this I was happy to see that the thought even exists. And indeed I might even buy a few to support the idea of the project. If they have this much cash then if I were them I would at least spend a small amount trying to start the project.  I looked at spreadex to spreadbet on Bitcoin as that's tax free for uk residents paying uk tax. But in the agreement there's the possibility to owe more than you send them. So its a bit like a credit agreement and I don't like that. Imagine getting hacked before even using the site, and I can't see any upper limit on what you would owe. FXCM had a protection against this but they don't cover Bitcoin. Is there an alternative with spreadbet status?Please stay on topic. No USA specific chat and non spreadbet status accounts in this thread please. Thanks. bump.Shameless.Dirty.In your face,       Necrobump. What do you think about the security of funds stored at these p2p exchangers? Quick intro. CurrencyFair:Offers the most fair pairs. You can store fundsSet your own rate. Klickex: Aimed at NZ and Australia but also has GBP. NZD/AUD/GBP only (plus some pacific island currencies) Set your own rate. Transferwise: Can't store funds. You send, they convert at the rate previously agreed and they forward onwards. Best for euro fiat pairs but has CNY and INR too. Other brokers like XE:Can't store funds. They typically forward when funds received.  OK. Seems to be a bit of Gox tunnel vision here. Try again. I'm living in China. I have my tech analysis priced in BTC-e but I want to sell on BTCChina. How do I best convert the price across from USD to CNY?  The only problem is that my price analyst has done it in Mt.gox price. Hence the question Now that we have BTCChina and Bitstamp and also great service from BTC-e I'm not really too bothered about Mt.gox shenanigans.  And of course it would be even better to have direct coin exchange in common use (there's a thread on it but i forget what it's called) Isn't Mt.Gox regulated now? If so then they can't do certain things with funds... assuming the rules in Japan are similar to the USA and UK? However, there's a lot of scope for scamming even with rules - something forex broker clients would tell you all about; it took years to see fines dished out and they didn't really hit share prices. I mean, the picture there has just been amazing - it's par du jour. Thanks for the link gethimnow  This isn't an arbitrage question but maybe it's one to file under that?  So, I have my levels that I know I want to buy at. How do I figure out what each level is equivalent to at the difference exchanges? For example, let's say someone gives me a tip to buy at $450 at Mt.Gox... what level would that be at Bitstamp or BTCChina? I mean, the Mt.Gox rate doesn't really have much sense now but even so maybe that difference has been tracked by someone as a percentage?  I had a look at BTC-e and noticed a massive spike down to $290 too. Wasn't sure what to make of that either.  In general there's going to be price difference between exchanges but those price differences should be fairly stable over time so it should be possible to at least get analysis for example on Mt.Gox and convert that to other exchanges to within $50, right?   iron mountain have been accused of burning client docs before - anyone have a link for that?it seems its the bank rather than the country.  I am trying to link to an 65kb image in a dropbox but it's not working either: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fmo3q2gz7k4t7dq/destinia-no-btc-option.png
https://www.dropbox.com/s/fmo3q2gz7k4t7dq/destinia-no-btc-option.pngNo Bitcoin? Problema?  I can see that ages ago I sent a very small amount of BTC to the NXT address but can't remember what else I did. I've tried a bunch of my longest passwords but none have any balance... what might be my next steps to figure out how to recover any coins?  Ok.  Seems like thing to do then is :-new user2,  seed new wallet,  send coins to that wallet, back it up. Add password less ability to run that wallet software from user3 with the sudoers file example I showed in 1st post -new user3 for browsing and desktop. Login as this user graphically. No sudo capability for this account -keep original user1 for sudo to root only. Access it via ctrl+alt+f2 or just login as root This would be in addition to majority of coins in a paper wallet which you'll need a Webcam or phone wallet to access, not to mention physical access to the age they're stored in. Hope this helps. This should all be setup out of the box or just apt-get'able   A lot of people give their browser and it's fully unvetted extensions access to their wallet by running their browser as the same user as their bitcoin wallet. Seeing as the NSA have poked a hole in Firefox and arrested people with it we can rest assured that this is not a far fetched attack.  If you're running linux it makes sense to at least make use of the security features it offers. The question is, what is the best setup for this? - Is it best to run your browser as a different user to your X session and bitcoin wallet? Code:[user2@localhost ~]$ cat .profile # allow user1 (gamer, untrusted stuff)  to display apps on this X server# (don't do that for local non-X and any remote connections)if [ -n "$DISPLAY" -a -z "$SSH_CLIENT" ]; then    xhost +si:localuser:user1fi[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/sudoers.d/chrome-as-user2user1 ALL = (user2) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/google-chrome[root@localhost ~]#Code:sudo -u user2 /usr/bin/google-chromesandbox -t sandbox_web_t -i /home/j/.mozilla -X firefox - Sandbox prevents copy and paste... so that's pretty useless. If you run your browser as a different user then you then need everything else running as that user because if you download to your home directory you then need the filemanager to be able to read that directory. It then becomes really tiresome changing everything else over.  - So... perhaps it's better to run your bitcoin wallet as a separate user and keep everything else as before? Then have a shortcut on your desktop to run bitcoin as that other user. You can then interact and backup by copy and paste... but you don't have access to ~/.bitcoin (or ~/.electrum)Code:(copy wallet.dat to user2 dir and chown to user2:user2)[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/sudoers.d/electrum-as-user2user1 ALL = (user2) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/electrum[root@localhost ~]#Code:sudo -u user2 /usr/bin/electrum But hang on... the chances are that your current user has sudo capability to root... and it's also common thanks to Ubuntu to have the same password for logon as to sudo...  so how do we change that? I mean, what's the better setup for su/sudo regards that? Am I on the right track here? How do you have it setup?  Can't see GM reenabling gold payments any time soon. I got a feeling they got the heat from some kind of external power Great find. I didn't know about that! Here's a link to that https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91843.0Sadly not in production AFAIK  Nah, the FDA just stopped them from commenting on health related stuff in the data so now you have to do it yourself. The ancestry stuff is still the same and you still get the data download that you can process either yourself or with 3rd parties. I can see why the FDA wanted to put a stop to that part but the way it's done is so stupid. I don't live in the USA and I understand Google isn't a doctor...  ...I trust google more than both doctors and the FDA....  Looking to buy for a reasonable price.

The UK will probably follow whatever decision the USA takes. The UK did not see Bitcoin as a currency but if the USA does they will probably copy that stance.  All guesses, but better than nothing. If this is smoke and mirrors, the FOI isn't always enforced so well. The key would be to leak info showing that it's flaunted to remind. An example of another fail:https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/what_was_your_bas_observer_obser#outgoing-204061Looking at requests in general you see more refusals around financial subjects. The key could be to not ask directly but to investigate something around the subject and hope they mess up with info that allows us to confer the facts. We could divide requests up separately and cross-corrolate. Remember, these are FSA requests, now it's renamed as the FCA.  This is great! Thanks for your help. You've actually been more helpful than support on some of the exchanges. When I asked Bitstamp they said "Europe" to which bank (!) Couldn't get it to build on fedora.... could do with a rpm... Could really do with an RPM...  Are funds segregated? Mt.Gox = Japan... but which bank?Bitstamp = Slovenia... but which bank?BTC-e = Bulgaria... etcBTCChina = ? HK? China?Will edit original post to update info (thanks people):BTC-Exchange.info: Citibank (United States), Barclays Bank (United Kingdom) and Fidor Bank (Germany)Bitstamp: Unicredit banka Slovenija d.d (subsidiary of the Italian branch) BTCChina: Bank of China, ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, China Merchants Bank When a new technology comes along fighting against it is always going to be an uphill battle. In this case we're looking at the development of coin tracking. Like it or not there has been various heists and as a result of that people have started coin tracking. This has already happened. It is not a threat for the future, it is a threat that has already been applied. It may have been used by the FBI already. (If only it was applied to the MyBitcoin wallet thefts and Mt.Gox thefts so I can get some of majority of coins lost back...)When a technology such as coin tracking starts to come into play you have to go with the flow because fighting it is like trying to make water flow uphill or dam a river. It's better to divert it into something positive.What would the interpretation of that be in this situation? That's where it gets interesting. As a start I think the best thing to do is put coin tracking into the hands of community and democracy in order to prevent it from tyranny. In order to do that there has to be a way to easily share feelings of trust regards each address - a distributed credit rating... only this time it really is a credit rather an debit rating!For anybody reading this thread not up to speed on the history there was a paper written on coin tracking... anyone have the link (I can't find it)? I've trialled Waveaddict, S3052 and the other guy who's name I forget. They've all got their problems so there's room in this area. However, there's no clear methodology on your signals and no free trial to live forward test so it seems a bit silly. It's also 4-5x more expensive than transparent newsletters showing their methodology. Obscenely expensive. Even futures signals aren't this expensive. I do like that it's clearly communicated - that is the best thing about it. Also, it's got the whiff of scam about it's presentation.  All I have to gauge when China got involved is:http://thegenesisblock.com/mapping-bitcoin-adoption-a-global-perspective/Isn't there anything more accurate in terms of gauging where China became so dominant in Bitcoin?  candidate for plugin Can we super-impose a graph of Chinese market share onto these graphs. I think that would be very revealing I'm sure the forum used to have it... can't see it now nor mentioned after searching...?

I didn't know about that public feed - good to know :-)Moderate, all I know is that FIX is a standardised financial protocol so I'm hoping that any implementation would make me less tied to FXCM. The end goal at a minimum is to be able to get a price and place a trade according to that price. The problem with pending orders is that they get hunted with deliberately erroneous data and spread widening. Similar for stop loss points and take profit points. Once I have the basic functions I'll be then using it in bash scripts - hopefully I can take it from there. hmm, digging in it seems one has to subscribe to get API FIX access? http://www.dailyfx.com/forex_forum/fix-api-support/588820-how-get-access-fxcm-using-fix-protocal.htmlI will ask them to enable my demo account and if they can do that I'll forward detailsMore info:http://www.dailyfx.com/forex_forum/fix-api-support/453300-fix-documentation-subscribe-updates.html just segfaults for me... Just a quick one to say thanks and congrats for the first user level multisig implementation. The stage is set for a website programmer now to build a frontend to assist democratic voting through payments.  I'm sure blockchain.info's wallet unique selling point was to host as much as possible client side as a response to the MyWallet debacle. Worth a look?https://github.com/zootreeves/blockchain.info/blob/master/wallet.jsI've sent piuk a PM to let him know.  -jbtw, love the decentralised exchange ideas Here's a demo account for testing:http://www.fxcm.co.uk/forex-trading-demo/I'll send you my login and the server address in an hour when I get to the other computer so you don't have to sign up.Something like TradeStation on the linux commandline via python would be ideal.   I can't get the data in because I don't know a way of doing it without programming unfortunately. As far as I can tell quickfix-messenger ( http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/quickfix/quickfix-1.13.3.tar.gz ) shows how to do it. To have a command line program like goxsh.py that would just need to be reimplemented on the command line I think?I'm OK with the suggest price.  PPCoin and Prime coin. Great to see. Sunny King is definitely the best dev out there in altcoin land. Well... really, stating the obvious, it would be nice PPCoin used the same proof-of-work aspect as PrimeCoin. It would be nice to see an altcoin combining all the progress of other projects. You could also build each network node as proof. In fact, could merged mined proof of work be used to boot strap a protocol and then gradual switch to proof-of-stake and network node proof (quorum)? In terms of immediate PPCoin direction there are a few things that would get the attention a lot more. None are particularly low hanging fruit but SunnyKing is quite the developer!- multisig. If you could beat Bitcoin to a enduser implementation that would get a lot of attention- reducing blockchain size. Again, this could get a lot of attention if marketed right. - transition to even less dependence on proof of work. I don't think this would get as much attention but it would be interesting.- a very light wallet implementation, command line on your Raspberry Pi, or VPSThe obligatory begging address! PSJ4WkbKeRGJW1qFqUJTgdpHCsTyZ7aSSb Stating the obvious here,  but Mandrik from the client side blockchain.info might have a comment or 2 regarding browser security. Might be worth a PM once you have some more concrete ideas Please suggest a fair price even if you're not interested in this particular job. Here's the info:http://www.rugatu.com/questions/22212/place-trade-on-forex-broker-from-linux-command-line A few have got shutdown.  Never put all your eggs in one basket. I don't want to see this held up as poster boy for the media in a campaign as to why coins must be confiscated and regulated.  I wouldn't expect this to be a factor... but what if it was. What if the great wall of china was an influence? great site. I'm only seeing USD & CNY at the moment though I want to use Ripple for this community. Where can I see a decent guide on how to integrate the system to a community website? All I have is:https://ripple.com/wiki/Gateway_Integration_Manual#Manual_alternativeIt's pretty technical. Not sure how to arrange it around a community website so the grannies aren't too confused...  Ideas:There is a library somewhere I've seen, maybe in a security/pentest/hacking website which allows a program to connect to the tor network without having tor installed. It's the sort of thing botnet control server software probably uses. Perhaps that could be worked into the mix so no need to install tor as well? Maybe there's something similar for i2p? If so that might be an even better line of enquiry.  Regards getting 2 projects to have that agreed open surface, I think the phrase you're thinking of is herding cats. I'm not sure about this. If a single fork was able to demonstrate it and another fork was inspired enough to follow that exchange compatibility that sounds like enough to at least get the ball rolling. At the moment in a sense bitcoin is running only as well as the number of exchanges across the globe. It has some protection because there are different countries in the world. But that is under threat as countries merge together (EU, USA, SE Asia, west african bank etc etc). Bitcoin also has some protection due to being on the internet but that too is slowly under threat via firewalling, deep packet inspection. An address to both of these is decentralised exchange. But to do that we have to establish the lowest footprint, most simple way to exchange say, Bitcoin for Litecoin without that big central Mt.Gox antithesis. Until this is done price stability is not going to be in Bitcoin.There is a fork out there that professes to support escrow built in... I will have to search to remind myself of the name, I hope it wasn't getting multisig confused? Surely multisig needs to come into play - it seems like it can do a lot more including escrow... and if we have escrow then perhaps that could be a (non ideal) way to establish decentralised exchange for the various altcoins... rather than having to build something new into each coin to support it. Is multisig already the answer? Why aren't there any altcoins doing anythig interesting with this, seems like a good thing to play with. Also the mini-blockchain idea has been solved only in whitepaper I believe? I hope we can see an implementation of that. infoporter: If the mini-blockchain idea was to be implemented you might need less than 1gb used at max anyway. Now there's pybt this should be achievable. Thanks for letting me know regards sCrypt and merged mining. That puts me off merged mining! Will keep an eye out on the proof of stake forks too. Am I right in thinking that money is influencing the development landscape around us these days? Hopefuly not outside just trying to make forks. Maybe it's mostly a good thing. Makes me wonder... if you've put effort into one version does that then put pressure on you not to bring out a new blockchain... or does that success of that just encourage to innovate more and go for the bigger prize... or do people just do it for fun anyway... certainly a lot of people have sold out - myself included regards trading coins. but then we have more people involved these days...  but for all the new people involved there should be more progress... if everybody was working in the same direction all these things would be nailed and the world would be a different place already If you're going to make an altcoin here's some features you might want to think about. The most pressing ones imho are in bold. - faster than Bitcoin- open surface / API for decentralised exchange:      -interfaces with ripple?      -or with another cryptocurrency that doesn't exist yet? (for price stability via easier speculation)- ^ and/or built in escrow (or multisig)- related to the above, namecoin functionality but wider in scope than just domains- proof of stake, quorum efficiency improvements- prime number search or similar- fixed small blockchain through mini-blockchain- i2p, tor support- merged mine compatible with another large coin for fast security startup- no inflation built in at the start, switch to demurrage in 90 years time (next generation)Other aspects to think about:- programmed in something assessable, quick to dev with, i.e. python (pybt)- could be applicable to a particular community for some reason Thanks for a great article. The UK is a backward place for Bitcoin now. But this really points out the importance of decentralised exchange through an agreed API/surface across coins and currencies. Honourable mention for bitbargain UK. Let's not forget that any remittance service connecting to Bitcoin has been shutdown - Transferwise and Currencyfair. Also this article is pointing out Freedom of Information request refusals from all parties requested - this is also suspicious to my mind. Finally there is the aspect that Bitcoin can be less anonymous than banking in some cases and the FBI have used this to advantage. This is shades of capital controls. While it is true that no one single action can prove conclusively that it is not simply concern for money laundering I have seen enough in other areas such as hedge funds, forex, gold, latvia to see that things are in place for the locks to come down should they need to ready for a Cyprus bank holiday. Although VAT is unfortunate and unfair, it's a well trodden path. The blockade was a great motivation for me to move financially away from the UK. I could be thanking that action if (when?) the worst fears come to fruition. At the end of the day, try to take the global view. People from China to Brazil are getting in on the revolution, that isn't going to change. If London is left behind it's really just one city in many, one increasingly less significant city. The once great London now begging to host Chinas currency yet there's no bitcoin exchange... Stay on the sidelines and places such as China who don't have to worry so much about capital flight, take over. It's just getting interesting!
I've heard c++ tends to be quicker but you know...  I don't really see it that much personally. Computers are pretty quick anyway these days. Google for compiled python program vs c++ speed?  Python is a very nice language, I know that much. By balance it is the most in use of these more readble \"higher level"? languages. The most established of these. You have many libraries at your fingertips. Electrum is coded in python, so easy to install cross platform with pip. Gentoo linux is python.  I did a quick search:http://blog.udacity.com/2012/05/learning-to-program-why-python.html It's a language that has often motivated me to try to learn how to program but even this wasn't enough to get me past my stupidity.  I'm not a coder either. Here's a good reason - rapid prototyping. Assembly language is a nice example. I had a friend learning assembly at school. Suffice to say... it's very very slow to knock up ideas... the best way to approach the problem (bear in mind I'm not a programmer) that I've seen in practice is a library call written in a .dll/.so written in assembly where speed is required. This system is the best development I've seen for cryptocurrencies in a long while. Hopefully multisig can be added - or a way to exchange value through different coins/blockchains? aka - no more exchanges.  ping-pong algo is a ranging strategy. widespread use of this will lead to more price stability on coins for the shorter timeframes when the price of a coin is not trending up or down Same connection problem here. Installed via pip. edit:Was able to get connection by playing with auto connect setting, exiting and reenter a few times. Is there anything I can try typing in the console when it does it again to help diagnose the problem?  - as an advert for cryptrade.org premium hosted bot and price data service- to contribute to the price stability of bitcoin by helping speculation I'm not an experienced trader but I've already learnt a lot. Is there anything you want to know in particular? Can I try your program? (assuming there's sourcecode that can be audited) Maybe it's a good idea to install separate O/S for gaming. As a test, would you run steam on a system that has an unencrypted wallet.dat? I'm a bit disappointed this doesn't get any attention. What's the point of Bitcoin if we all have to keep our coins on exchanges because the value is all over the shot!?

There are legal ways to reduce tax paid. I'm not from the USA so I don't know those details but they probably involve things like deferring.  Outside the USA every situation is less Kafka. The UK doesn't tax spreadbetting for one so you could hold your gains in a spreadbetting account. There are probably different holes and incentive programs for each country around the world. A whole industry is built on optimising tax. The likes of Starbucks pay to find ways to reduce exposure. The one I've seen companies do is overcharge from a tax efficient place (i.e. Taiwan) to a subsidiary in a tax expensive place (i.e. UK). In the most basic way you can open a company in a lower tax country, open an account at an exchange and bank account and then cashout that way.  Then there's evasion. I'm not sure if it's even legal to discuss this in some countries? Nevertheless this has been reported on recently in major newspapers like the Guardian. That Canadian tax evasion leak so we saw a peak into this world with that. Basically financial privacy is very difficult to get these days but the key thing is that it's still very possible. All those money laundering post 9/11 rules have done is increase the costs. Basically the difference now is that you have to bank in a different country to your company, do more research and pay higher fees. Regards moving cash around the Guardian article shun a light on many methods - one of them was basically suing yourself in a sham courtcase.  I've researched these things just for interest's sake. I'm drawn to all the subjects you're not supposed to know. Knowing how all these multimillion corporations manage to pay zero tax feels very empowering. Just how rich do you need to be to join the elite this way?  Setting up a company in a tax haven with all the associated anonymity costs = ~>$3000/yearGetting banking for that company = Tends to need a balance of $50,000 minimum but really this is the realm of private banking which tends to be >$500,000Consultants fees, seeing as you'll probably want some professional help along the way = ~$2,500I think really it's a case of $100,000 minimum required to tax evade like the elites do.  But there's a problem. Part of my research has been into trying to find out where the elites are parking their cash and what banks are safe. In short... nearly no banks are safe. The G-20 has recently discussed and therefore it's believed recently approved Cyprus style bail-in plans with anglophone countries confirmed on those plans. So you can't simply pick banks with good credit ratings. Thus fiat in the banks is at risk. Getting away from this risk is very difficult since the G20 is most of the world and the countries left over aren't considered stable. AFAIK the elites haven't moved cash but some cash has probably moved to the more stable nations. What's the best response to this? Many elites have been buying things like art and antiques. I'm sure there's a lot more going on behind the scenes (i.e. secured vs unsecured deposits) but we'll never hear about it and if we do it'll probably get blocked. So Bitcoin probably isn't that good for security but unless you have $100,000+ it's the best you got. So... don't cash out.   If you have 2 coins both with multisig capability, can that commonality be used to establish an exchange rate between the 2 different coins?  Is there any high level documentation on multisig? Is there anything out there actually using it yet? Is namecoins ability to put more information in it's blockchain relevant? Is there somewhere to read about this that's a bit easier to understand?  +---------------------+|Namecoin             ||                     ||                     ||                     ||                     ||                     |+--------------+--------+               |Multisig|               +--------+                       +---------------------+                   |                            |Bitcoin              |                   \                            |                     |                    \                           |                     |                     |                  +--------+                    |                     \                 .'Multisig|                    |                      |             .-' +--------+                    |               +------+-------+   .'            |                     |               |Something else|.-'              |                     |               |not required? |                 |                     |               +--------------+                 +---------------------+ We do it openly:http://www.channel4.com/programmes/come-dine-with-me Congrats daybyter that's a great looking program. Unfortunately... it's totally not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a cli program to trade on stock or forex brokers in a similar way that goxsh.sh does on Mt.Gox. Have you seen all the other trade platforms out there? There's quite a few but yours looks the most mature non web interface for arbitridge by far I've seen Unfortunately I can't code beyond making very minor changes to prexisting code. Where is this cli bot you have for FXCM? Can I have a look? Yes. Let's say you're out watching a game and you want to put a bet on. At the moment you need to get your card out, type in the number and deposit an amount. This is presuming you're also already verified and registered with the betting firm. It could be a lot easier if you have some coins on your phone and you can copy and paste the payment or something equally slick.  What would be nice is a commandline linux bot that can connect to various broker APIs such as FXCM:http://www.fxcm.com/services/forex-programming/api-programming-interfaces/Either that, or something that can help connect preexisting bitcoin bots to trading on broker APIs
When I start MT4 it deletes sKVM-BTC-Import_v1.2.ex4 from ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/MetaTrader 4/experts/... I just want to double check something:Code:2013-10-15T12:00:01.438Z - verbose: updatePortfolio: { btc: 5, usd: 0 }2013-10-15T12:00:01.530Z - info: BUY order wasn't created because the amount is less than minimum order amount 0.01 BTC"^ this just means the USD balance isn't enough to buy any BTC because we're already long on BTC right? -and if there was a sell signal it would sell all to USD right?Just double checking... not trying to get rich... more like trying to avoid the potential for a massive crash.Bear in mind the system relies on both the exchange and cryptrade both not being fully DDOS'ed (backup site on tor, informed by email anyone?) If we were to use Ripple how would we transfer the existing database?I'll suggest importing the database into Google. I'm sure it's possible to have forms to allow people to enter their own trades.  It's a few hundred members. At the moment a tresurer is having to type all the entries manually into a spreadsheet. It would be great to transfer that spreadsheet online and send user/pass to emails on the spreadsheet.There is software out there to create the whole community website but frankly I don't rate it. I think it's better to have separate accounting system (Ripple?) and community website (Dolphin).The only thing stopping me is thinking that maybe Ripple isn't ready for this. Love that little ledger tool. Great points. Only thing is, you're talking at me like I can program... very unfortunately that's not so possible. We have someone who might be able to help but I don't know the extent of their skills. hmm...  I was thinking of selling some legal things on SR after noticing that there were plenty of sellers on there doing this taking advantage of the better and more liberal conditions than ebay. Seeing as PlutoPete was selling legal things and got arrested anyway...  that's not good! Is the ZirconiumX one a typo? How come so much better? Is this something that's a good bet to try running live? What has been reported of course might be a load of claptrap so that the same issue can be used again. They say the guy was caught due to those mistakes but actually other sellers were caught in the UK so there must be something else involved right? How do we know coin tainting wasn't used - watching the mixing services for mistakes and combining that with other data? Likely it was a combination of things. People still suspect SR was backdoored and then combined with the firefox exploit to phone home.  I asked bitbargain.co.uk to open their code as I'd like to see it hosted on a hidden service. Unfortunately it hasn't happened yetEven a deepweb site for LTC/BTC would be something  I have a Local Exchange Trade community searching for a ledger solution. Bitcoin is fine but goes against the goal of the system which is local. Forking a new blockchain seems over the top.Ripple seems not ready for he prime time, since it's only running on one server. You can't change your password and we need to export the values of the preexisting database to each user.Cyclos seems too complicated... as does OpenTransactions. We just need user, balance, send amount.  A Google Spreadsheet with forms might be fine... any example of that?  Am I right in thinking that EMA is the only (reliable) bot method for btc? Think I got it all working today by having a relative plug them in and out. Needed to update cgminer. This is on a 'Pi. I'll still sell the one on auction but might just keep the rest now. Depends how the person hosting it feels about it.  7. But was thinking of selling 6 to keep one for testing and messing about with Thanks for the hub link.

You often aren't given the secret key to copy and paste so a common way is to screenshot that qrcode or take a photo. The thing is, you have to remember to do this on logon and you're punching an unencrypted backup through the system. The whole thing is a disaster waiting to happen. It got me when my phone got stolen and it's caught many others out too. There should be an encrypted backup solution for Google Authenticator. It's just because it's intended for use with Google and usually gmail - there you have all the backup options - paper codes, phone, SMS. Using Google Authenticator for third party things is fine but really I think gox and all these sites should tell people they should backup and print or backup and encrypt the qrcode.  Also,  why can't normal regulated currency exchange houses such as FairFX or CurrencyFair just add BTC as a new supported currency?  Transferwise and CurrencyFair both blocked payments to Bitcoin exchanges, they say due to money laundering alarms at the banks they use.This further confirms that it's not regulation that's the problem. I've read differing opinions on the Bitcoin bank block. Some say the banks are abusing the laundering alarms to stifle bitcoin. Others say that genuinely a Bitcoin exchange looks a lot like moneylaundering so it's no wonder this happens.  However, Transferwise & CurrencyFair are 2 services that take out that factor of looking like moneylaundering out of the question surely and these were shutdown too? If these services really do take the moneylaundering factor out of the detection algorhythms then that's a smoking gun to show it's banks abusing the moneylaundering laws and putting UK business behind in the Bitcoin revolution.  The most efficient way to buy is currently Bitbargain, a great site but the spread's a bit fierce - so much so it excludes using Bitcoin for most remittance amounts. Another way to do it could be using a transfer service and taking your banking abroad. A good example of how regulation drives business away. It's pretty easy to open a bank account abroad - any recommendations for a non UK bank somewhere supported by transferwise that isn't technically already dead?  I'm NOT condoning this... but what happens if you were to have 2 wholly separate businesses with separate bank accounts - one only buys your coins, the other only sells. Balancing between the 2 is an open market. Using company entities is the time honoured way of skirting taxes and regulations, why not here too? How could price fluctuation risk be reduced?  I believe the accounts are only demoninated in BTC but that the base currency is probably USD which is simply displayed as BTC via conversion using the Gox rate. No big deal. There is a broker now offering USD:BTC and also with leverage but I forget the name  Gox rate only. No offers please. Need good rep. Thanks Syria is Iran's ally. Iran is in trouble for trading oil for euros defying the petrodollar empire. The USA/empire is enforcing the petrodollar tax system. Russia and China are allied to Syria. Russia has mentioned nukes but Russia doesn't have enough to go head to head with the infidel empire without China. Not sure about China. Both countries have basically said how can you be so obvious after Iraq and Libya? It's like the cold war all over again. The USA feels it can win this one probably because China isn't being as ballsy as Russia so they're pressing ahead calling Putins bluff on the nukes. If they win then Iran invasion will be one step closer to install a central bank fiat system as in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and all the other colonies across the world. If they fail then the domestic situation in the home countries will be distracted by a bigger, profitable situation of WW3. The chemical weapons and civil war in Syria sounds very much like the CIA etc up to it's usual preparation tricks. Have a search and you can confirm it not just in conspiracy sites but intelligence communities too who knew about this for years. (p.s. what happened to Google Discussions to search like this on non Google forums?)Folks at home in places such as the USA and UK continue to park their money in the banking system and invest in weapons manufacturers that lead Russian nukes to be aimed at their own front door with the common man being excluded from the spoils of war as prices rise... £1 for a loaf of bread to £2.50. All of this should be very obvious to people on this forum. Should be able to work this all out yourselves without me leading you by the hand explaining everything.   Something that would help all of these efforts would be a protocol more designed for intermittent than TCP/IP? What if something much more lightweight could be used on mobile phones via bluetooth, searching for nodes, passing packets whenever available and allowing the user to have some manual input on what priority to give to relayed info. This could then sync over other networks as and when they become available. Bitcoin is too heavyweight for this AFAIK. It could be used however to share more basic information. You could walk around in China with your phone spamming one and all with Tor relay node IPs for example.  I think we have limits on the disruption potential of Bluetooth? I think to relise the potential you would need to work at a lower level than simple application... anyone care to comment?   The 2nd USB hub I've tried doesn't work (AMU0 errors). Which hub on ebay (item number) definitely works?  OK. It looks a lot like a DYM was sent: Every app on your phone has access to that, it's unencrypted and if it goes missing you're probably going to find it impossible to trace. Trust me... from someone who's lost >600BTC in various ways.  Agreed. I hope it can be improved. It is extremely easy to write an closed source app to grab the file off the sdcard. I would prefer a normal encrypted wallet.dat backup. Of course it could be argued that it's futile to have decent security without a permissions monitoring system running or using a separate system like an old phone. I for one don't run many different apps. I used to use permissions controlling apps but it was a lot of work to keep on top of so when the built in permissions in the new Android came out I've been using that... but it only has some protections and it doesn't help against this problem. I might instead try to take a photo with something but it seems a bit of an odd thing to do. Coinsidently, I wonder how many linux Bitcoin users have their browser as the same user as their electrum binary... and what Chrome extensions they are running. Security is still a big stumbling block for Bitcoin. All it takes is for someone to lose $10 and they might say "I'm never using that again!"Cold storage is fine but I'm really hoping apps like BitcoinSpinner and Electrum and make it easier for people.  On 1.8.0 if I go: wallet > create backup > openThe backup isn't actually saved there. Is this a known bug fixed in 1.8.1 ? I suppose to do it manually you just copy .electrum/electrum.dat In mycelium,  how do you backup your encrypted wallet.dat?  Having searched around I can see that I have had LTC and TBL stored with TTBit but still no trace of DYM.  I suppose I just have to chalk up to a false memory getting mixed up in the LTC and TBL testing.  The strange thing is that I could swear blind that I had 1DYM in my balances. I remember so clearly that it was there. It makes sense because my goal at the time was to get a minimal balance on every currency available and to setup as many trustlines as possible at minimal balance for testing. So if I didn't have 1DYM then I wouldn't have had the full set which seems like an easier thing to remember.  Anyway, this isn't enough to go on so let's forget about this for the mo.  What can I say. Funny thing memories. Apologies all round I guess.  OK I've found a way to do it - short oil.  Thanks buddy but no need, you hang on to that for the moment :-)TTBit, can you see a transaction to me of any kind? Any PM's between us, anything in threads. Any record of it in your wallet. I'm very sure I had one DYM at some point. I'm also pretty sure I haven't sent it anywhere but not 100% on that. Certainly I can't remember sending it anywhere. What I do have though is a lot of trust lines setup. I was trying to do as much as I can with Ripple as a test and also practicing with it. Joel has been on the case. So far he's found no transaction, only the trust line from me. Everybody else don't worry so much yet. We haven't found any problems so far and my memory is all er have to go on so far. Has there been any bugs like this before? As I say I do have a lot of trustlines setup.  Thanks for giving us a heads up on this one. I now know not to use the turbo in Opera. Add this info to the 'banned for spam' message Thanks. Will send you a PM. Don't panic people. TTBit gave me the DYM very generously to help with testing. I just thought it was cashed in, which is fine with me of course. Perhaps I've sent it to someone for testing and forgotten about it... but I would expect that to be visible. This is a good test of things.  I had 1DYM in my wallet... now it's gone?Can't see any trace of it moving in the transaction history... Is there any alternative to the site now?When I go to checkout the cart doesn't seem to work anymore. What's the latest on Bitmit?
Coinabul was surely one of the last ways to maintain anonymity and cashout large amounts, no? You don't deserve my help. The sanctions will soon be lifted and those who could see this will profit.  Cheers for the info. If a client with i2p lib build comes out I'll invest in it but otherwise surely any coin can run on i2p... ? Other way round. If you're betting on peace you can invest in Iran which is a very positive thing. If you were to be betting on war then you'd be buying arms stocks.  Just wondering...  if you import a private key, use and then delete it again how secure is that compared to generating a new private key and sending funds to the new key?Not just this for Electrum but also in general too Great idea. - One thing that should be clearer is whether you need i2p running in order to run the client with anonymity or whether it actually has it's own support for i2p built in via some kind of library. - next up, merged mining? p.s. on the https://anoncoin.net//Downloads.html page the link to downloads actually goes to https://anoncoin.net//Company.html which is a dead link So far I see NMC, DVC, groupcoin, ixcoin, i0coin will all merge mine with Bitcoin. - Are there any more?(and, other than NMC, is it worth it?) I've done a few trades, given tons of feedback but I still have no feedback. Seems it's just too much effort for people. Slightly offtopic but there should be something to make the process of OTC feedback quicker too - just click a button rather than:connect to irc, ident, auth with gpg, find user you want to rate, ident that user, decide on wieght to rate, rate the user and comment the user.  Disagree on restrictions. Prefer stronger guidance to encourage due diligence - clear marking and advice on the threads preferably automatic also ways to discern escrow safety I never used to notice sigs. But then I noticed some people posting useful stuff and I found it's a good way to find out abuot new services. Obviously you got to e careful but the way it works is that the people posting useful stuff tend to have the links of interest. Found out about a lot of new things this way I can't see the latest new threads where it used to be at the top left of the forum. Is it still there for you? Bit disappointed the way I suggested profit out of the news and everybody ignored it and starting moaning politics again oh dear. fail. OK folks. Looking at the news it looks like Iran is conquered now. So, how can we intimidate benefit from this? Any investment tips which match up with Iran getting back on track now? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_Stock_Exchange#Exemptionshttp://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=IRR&view=10Yhttp://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=XAU&to=IRR&view=10YThis has been really interesting:- they pay (paid) less tax than us- they had less inflation than us (before sanctions)- Tehran stock exchange was doing extremely well before sanctions - massive spike loss in value on - I can see USD:IRR price charted in some places but also read in other that USA tried to stop IRR use Great implementation. You should think about improving video seek and selling the code for it all for people wanting to setup their own sites  Going on holiday here and would like to get cash via Bitcoin so if you want to buy in cash get in touch Ah, righto. They are minuscule amounts apart from XPM which is a few dollars. I had to trade the XPM into the other things and back again :p Probably lost it all in the spread, who knows Very much agreed. It should be simpler. I think the key to things like Blackberry Messenger that have become more widely used is that the keys are already generated. I know this is not as good as making sure you generate your own but it means it's alot more likely to be used. The insecurity this brings up only opens up a crack for feds and above to get in and most people only need a little bit more security than they currenctly have. Thus an example, k9mail (or a new app) should automatically generate gpg keys and pair this to your email on install, unless otherwise instructed. The pubkey is attached automatically and al messages signed by default.  http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/tor-tormail-dark-web-communication-pgp/ sorry to quote bump myself but can anyone comment?

You all missed the house in the background overlooking it and went along with the article. Shame on all of you. Still crap though.  I think an important test of Bitcoin is will people outside the USA buy Bitcoin to give a support level if the USA was to drop massively thus leading desperate people to cash in their BTC savings? - how to analyse that other than simply looking at country distribution? If we look at:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Ladder#Top_countrieswe see a few BRIC countries... key ones for me are Poland & Russia. Brazil seems a bit reliant on USA trade? - as do the other big ones?  So it's difficult to say what if would take for BTC to decouple to the dollar. One thing's for sure - we need to get Bitcoin spread more multilaterally & economically in order to further secure it. Growing use in USA antagonistic countries such as Venezuela & Russia is bullish. states.edit: This presupposes a drop in the USA dollar and stocks. While many have been going on that the USA is about to fall for ages you have to remember that it is the global ruler and if times get tough cash tends to flow to the core, hence the USD bull run.  From:http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Troubleshooting_power_problemsYou can use a multimeter to compare power usage before and after you plug in your USB miner:Code:Results of tests:Before tests: 4.90v available, 4.91v before polyfuse, 4.69v after polyfuseWith Eruptor: 4.54v avail, 4.91v before PF, 4.58v afterWith no external power HDD: 4.90v before polyfuse, 4.46v afterImmediately after tests: 4.71v avail, 4.92v before fuse, 4.72v after and noted increased after 1min to 4.74v but after 5mins did not recover further; did not test for longer. The HDD was noted as not fully spinning up. Conclusions:- a HDD needs external power no matter what. I expect if I was to test a flash drive power use is lower- a Block Eruptor is right on the limit of what my Pi can supply. What probably happened was that it worked at first but then an increase in CPU load pushed the Polyfuse into action. This was then increased by the HDD when I tried that to test it. Now the PolyFuse has a lower limit so neither will work - I have to wait for the USB PSU to arrive before I can the Eruptor back in like I did before- the PSU isn't supplying 5v, probably due to poor cabling- the PolyFuse doesn't recover fully when stressed but this is no big dealThanks folks and in particular jbeale :-)This has also been very useful in giving a way to measure what voltages USB devices consume. Thanks for sharing the experience of this.Who designed the Eruptor? Don't they have some kind of page or tool for querying the device? AFAIK the USB Eruptor is very basic - USB-Serial interface -> ASIC. No diagnostic output, no temp sensor, no firmware. I can see header pins on the board though Yeah that's probably it... though I would have expected something more verbose to help me figure that out. I guess if so I'd have to figure out how to cross compile... easier to change to openwrt and use the supplied distro copy. Meanwhile, the beaglebone (angstrom) doesn't recognise the Eruptor with lsusb.. perhaps not enough power even though the Eruptor lights up and all looks ok......and USB ports on the Raspberry Pi are producing errors now. So all 3 platforms each have their own problems... Is there somewhere with more info on these sticks just as how to assess if they are heat damaged, how they work, how the serial/usb interface works and so on? I see what you're saying but I wanted to check the binary does actually run before installing as a service... it should run. I would expect if I installed the whole thing it would still fail WL500G-Deluxe so that's a BCM4702/4710. One has a very old Oleg firmware, the other has what appears to be the latest DD-WRT from 2010. I've only tried the DD-WRT one andthat's the one that gave illegal instruction because then I'd need a USB hub and mine's taking ages to arrive from china. Just tried running cgminer-3.3.1-mipsel on dd-wrt v24-sp2 (build 14929) ((old - will try upgrading...):Code:root@router:~# ./cgminer -nIllegal instruction Seems I'm just talking to myself here using this thread like a diary. I was hoping someone might chime in and tell me a way to monitor the temp on the USB Eruptor. Tried a USB flash drive in the Pi and it works... and the Eruptor works on the laptop (I've no USB powered hub yet to help with testing) which all points to the mips compiled cgminer... but different versions and I still get 4bytes etc and so forth. I still think I've overstressed the Pi USB ports somehow. It would be good to be able to know that the ports are ok for sure. update: Now running on a BeagleBone but need to create the /dev/ entries for /dev/ttyUSB0 or AMU0...  I don't want to use a powered USB hub if possible since I only have one miner. However, I think the problem is that I need to put the cgminer executable somewhere and that therefore needs extra USB storage right - and therefore a USB hub. Unless I mount a network share...? An alternative in NZ would be good. The guy running BitNZ... I think sounds like a busy guy and doesn't need the income so much. I think it's run, certainly at the start as a charitable thing for Bitcoin point of view. As such, I hate to say it since it's a profit making thing but... don't moan too hard as we need the site up and running. Hopefully an alternative in NZ will turn up at some point as a backup. I'd also like to see a market order option to help newbies. That change didn't happen either which makes me think it's always going to be a bit neglected.  Yup, USB HDD is dead too. Let this be a lesson to you folks - if you plug your Eruptor straight into your Pi your'll burn itshameless hotlink...meanwhile... on the laptop:Code:AMU0: invalid nonce - HW errorI wonder how hot the Eruptor is running and what it's limit is... perhaps a fan is essential...  Right... must be something to do with the RaspberryPi... no such errors from the laptop. Perhaps the USB port couldn't handle the heat.... will have to test some more... edit:Code:raspberrypi ~ $ /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temptemp=56.2'C^ though this is the CPU rathe rthan the ethernet/usb chip which also generates it's own heat. It's possible the heat from the Eruptor conducted through to the Pi and that's effected the Pi usb chip... however it's strange that the fail happened as it did; only slightly... Next thing to do I suppose will be to try a USB HDD.  The hashrate reported at bitparking.com/(user) is saying zero. I only have a single USB eruptor.

I did a search and found bash scripts in this dev section so I'm posting here... but it doesn't seem the best section to post in, sorry if it's wrong All we need to have something workable ASAP is an android device with a camera and eink... but I don't think one exists (other than a Nook with USB camera clumsily hanging out)Other than this I suppose there are android phones and cheap chinese tablets that you could solder over the wifi or try to put a switch on the antenna but they're not that small. 
 2 items required:- eink display^ display good enough to show QRcodes, eink seems most appropriate- camera^ this can be cheap and low quality.The devices generates addresses and transactions, that's all. Interaction is done via the screen and camera, nothing else. While I think the various hardware devices are great this is a lot simpler to communicate to people than USB sticks. It would be simplest to use Android, or something that can run python and use a client that already exists. I'd like to make such a device but it's beyond me.  I just want to be 110% sure about this - we're just syncing labels which can be used to make a record of what each transaction was and is for, for easier accounting. Transactions are noted but these can't be abused in any way and private keys aren't transmitted. Thus, the encryption is there for financial privacy. Just want to be totally sure that this is what it is? I'm thinking of using https://labelectrum.herokuapp.com/ to syncronise my labels. But I don't want to synchronise wallets because I see that as a risk even if its ssyncronisetore encrypted. Are the private keys transmitted or just the labels / history?p.s. it would be nice to be able to freeze multiple receive addresses in one go by holding the shift and ctrl keys Code:[2013-07-30 20:48:38] USB: AMU0 read1 buffering 4 extra bytes^ was worse when I had something plugged into the Raspberry Pi hub next to the USB Eruptor. Ran ok for the few days. Now it's crapping out. Very hot to the touch but not sure how much. Have that basic included heatsink on the back but no fan. Don't want to put a fan on it really... noise... Acceptance is a very important indicator of how well Bitcoin is doing. However, look at gold. I've tried a few times to see if a shop will accept a gold coin and they never do, or if they do they like to make a fat profit from it. Yet gold is still seen as a currency and countries in particular use it for payments. The question then becomes, how much is speculation and how much is real value? That's the hard one to answer. In particular it's difficult to unpick people who have a small store of emergency funds as BTC because it's harder to confiscate than gold for example.  Any ideas on how to import blockchain info into this:http://gephi.org/?( or http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/online - both from http://blog.datamarket.com/2012/04/04/choosing-the-right-visualization-tool-for-your-task/ ) Just making a thread... for future use! The point I'm trying to make is that debt has been ill advised for a very long time. Yes, it has the advantage of making new connections in the financial system but it also allows for ebbs and flows and massive crashes due to the extra linking. Movements like this are natural for any network. When you take out a loan you allow the lender more than interest - but also an extra facet of control that is not at all obvious.  Unlike Bitcoin, Ripple is based on this same broken system.  I don't write off advise from a source because that source is unfashionable. All the major religions have something to say about debt. If you want to write off religion as a source for what people thought in the past then there isn't much left in history.  Science is like a disrespectful brat right now to it's parents which are religion and philosophy. The attitude is slowly maturing.  What I mean is that at a setting of 0.80/-0.80 I find that it tends to get to miss the very small timescale(daily), get it wrong on the short timescale(weekly) but get it right on the medium (monthly) scale. This is of course very general and it hasn't been tested enough. The short weekly timescale is a shame. For example in the log here I have: Which of course is the very opposite of what you want right!Now, come to think of it, I remember why it caught the 70 dip - it was because I manually intervened and then used the bot to buy if anything changes. I was hoping that I could use the EMA to catch those very large changes and basically create a less speculative more stable level but it doesn't seem to do that and just holding USD would be better at that. Anyone had any wins with EMA? Even though it's made losses I somehow how feel safer thinking that something less human is watching some coins for me. I'm not sure if it's too early to say experiment failed.  I did a group buy. I trusted because there was use of PGP and so forth signing who gets what etc. I did only buy 1 though. What I don't understand is why people get them. They're about $90 for one and I make about $0.03 cents merged mining off of mine which I expect probably doesn't cover the cost of electric running off a Raspberry Pi so there's need to have use of whatever system it's plugged into or buy more of them.Surely all these people buying so many of them are making a loss. It's a funny thing how the mining has changed. We started off in a decentralised manner with everybody able to mine and now it's more a case of - can you find the ASIC cheaper and before everybody else does (BFL probably the winner here). Anyone with a Erupter seems to me to be supporting the decentralisaton but its at a cost to them. hmm... this is weakening BTC don't we think? What values do you run it at? Always seems to buy low and sell high for me... but it did catch the more major dips so far which is handy Btw, tried from a UK proxy and failed, article is only viewable from outside the UK. Apparently... it's not funded by the license payer! Phew, and I thought it's because the propaganda machine wants to present a different face to home as it does away..."Three-nil to sterling" "converting life savings into BitCoins to escape Europes struggling economy"^ because Britain isn't Europe, right "cold, hard PayPal dollars"^ haha!!"eye-watering £17 transaction fee my bank demands for transferring a few bits of data across the English Channel"^ haha! This is what bitbargain is for and transactionwise before that, and CurrencyFair too. It's a good point but we can't fix the banks... we're working on the pressure on them though, PingIt coming out after Bitcoin, lucky coincidence. " I could leave my computer to mine for BitCoins, using its processing power to slog away at the coalface of the BitCoin economy, crunching blocks of encrypted data in exchange for virtual coins like the worlds most tedious version of Super Mario Bros"^ I liked this  Wow, no replies!?Ok, let try this. Who wants to earn some coin!Q: How much would it cost to fix this code and get it running on PHP v5.4:https://github.com/cdmweb/Local-Exchange-UK? I'd like to add that I didn't need a USB hub for a single stick in my Pi... seeing as there was only one of them.  I think it is important to allow people to post competition in other people's threads. Such free speech and free competition is exactly the sort if thing that enourages the market to be efficient. It's a brilliant micro case study as to why people should be allowed to do things that are considered rude. Another example would be standing outside a shop and poaching customers. It appears unfair but actually it is fair if the shop is free to do the same thing back to the poachers. Being liberal on this is more efficient as it requires no action. Being liberal also encourages the price to come down, better for consumers. And finally, it's a more efficient market. In my culture I think it's rude but anglophone countries are particularly territorial and the UK is particularly territorial too. You wouldn't get the same opinion in Romania and probably many other countries (China) so you have to bear that in mind. They would say it's fair game.... no wonder those countries are on the way up. edit: of course the disadvantage of a separate thread is that people are less likely to find that separate thread so it's worse for the consumer to have that and better to have a free-for-all. Speak to a shop owner and he might say he's in favor of liberal business... but start poaching customers and all of a sudden capitalism seems to be a bad thing. That's the problem with people, it's all good when it's going there way but then when someone else starts doing the same they want special dispensations.   There's also these:http://www.cxss.org.uk/drupal51/node/18of which the easiest solution with support (in particular for arranging people, rather than just the tech) is:http://www.cxss.org.uk/drupal51/?q=node/10and fees to help with that: http://www.letslinkuk.net/practice/online.htmor self hosting that to save some cash. The advantage of that system is that there's someone there to help set it up, host it (if need be) and be there to help if it's needed. The disadvantage is that unlike Cyclos it's extremely basic. I'm assured that records can be exported from that system at at later date if needed.   Last time I looked at LETs accounting systems was a couple of years ago now. What's changed since?  Ideally we're looking for a way for members to go online, check their balance and pay and be paid easily. I shouldn't need to go into too much detail as to why the idea is to use this rather than Bitcoin or cash other than to say that there is some firewalling to the market this way.  Last I looked we were going to use Ripple but it was very different back then and I don't want that much ease of connectivity to other markets.  So what I'm looking for is decentralised accounting.  Would this be OpenTransactions? Is it stable yet? (edit, update: No, not ready according to the git site) Is it (very) easy to use for old people? How would we handle people who don't really use computers? If so, where would be best to host it? I could pay for a low end server and do it but I'd rather use someone else if possible. As an alternative, in a simple way Ripple could be used for this couldn't it? Let's say I was treasurer, then everyone would have to trust me with their currency. The next problem would be that I can't change my password and I can't share the job. So I think Ripple is no good (yet?).  Any solution has to be totally ready as an alternative, in a simple way Ripple could be used for this couldn't it? Let's say I was treasurer, then everyone would have to trust me with their currency. The next problem would be that I can't change my password and I can't share the job. So I think Ripple is no good (yet?). And with a slick interface. There can't be any java interface shernanagans for the users.   What about more established online accounting systems? The most important thing is that any data can be exported and migrated to any new system that comes out down the line. Could a group edited Google spreadsheet actually do this since we have such a simple system?  At the moment they're using one guy who makes a note of everything manually on the phone. edit:Just found Cyclos... seems like the best yet?There's also https://www.community-exchange.org/ but it looks centralised and not making use of cryptography as much as Cyclos.  hmm... shame I can't make use of these low GPU prices... I only have a laptop... Why would I be needing to run as root even after changing /dev/ttyUSB0 to 777?

In reading this thread we've seen a few people who don't know what Ripple is, nor how it is different. With Ripple you are trusting other people to pay you back. That is "Promise to pay the bearer" as printed on GBP notes and specifically advised against as a bad idea in the bible. It's an IOU but unlike a Hawala notebook it's digital. Howeverm here's the interesting bit: you can infer trust to someone you don't know via someone else. Thus, if there's someone on the forum yoiu don't know you might be able to get trust via that someone else. This is good when people are paying their debts but if it goes wrong the debt default Ripple goes through the entire system. The other good thing is that Ripple facilitates setting up an exchange through the gateways. However, it's not as easy for the average user IMHO. Finally, the whole thing is glued together with XRP and that is dodgy. Scam or not, you must at least be aware of all this stuff! Yes of course, that's what I'd like to envisage... but how would you best do that t for a EUR/RUR buy signal? - and also bearing in mind getting funds to the various exchanges is often a problem too (btc-e?) No worries, I'm not trading live (actually opened some empty new accounts just for testing). I do love it though, gives me some satisfaction seeing saying something even if it does give a worrying counter to another trade strategy elsewhere...Couldn't see that hard coding commented in:https://github.com/aido/AidoATP/blob/master/src/main/java/org/aido/atp/ArbitrageEngine.javabut then I don't do java and I could have missed it. My question though, and this was aimed more at the traders here rather than programmers was more about how to trade manually to take advantage of an arbitrage situation in general and that was meant as an example primarily. I see a scenario earlier in this thread but the person is using the example of 2 people who are friends and trust each other. One way I can see if we have a signal for RUR/USD would be to go to a forex broker and click buy on that. But really for arb I was thinking more about Bitcoin and then it gets complicated with transaction delays and costs in for example sending USD from Bitstamp to USD. Of course, http://bitcoin-analytics.com/ does alot of it for us... but for a fee. There are also other arb bots... but I don't see how they work without sending funds from one exchange to the other Also, which USB adapter for a raspberryPI USB HDD? Not all support turning off/spinning down with hdparm and so will overheat Let's say we have the message:"Arbitrage Engine has detected an after fee profit opportunity of 123.15897301% on currency pair RUR/EUR on BTC-e"How would one take best advantage of that?The other messages are interesting in that they conflict Code:2013-07-12 12:27:51,200 : MtGox Advance/Decline Spread algorithm has determined that the USD market is trending down.2013-07-12 12:27:51,201 : MtGox VWAP Cross algorithm has determined that the USD market is trending flat.2013-07-12 12:27:51,208 : MtGox Trend following trading agent has decided no USD action will be taken at this time.ah, a nonce in the works!Code:2013-07-12 12:32:12,137 : Arbitrage could not trade with a balance of RUR 0 on BTC-e2013-07-12 12:32:12,257 : ERROR: Caught unexpected exception, shutting down BTC-e trend following trading agent now!.

Basically what's happening is that I only get output when there is a change in advice when I was expecting each hour to say something like "No change detected, advising to HOLD" There's also http://coinapult.com/sms-wallet (via https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=169404.0 )but I don't the code for such an SMS server anywhere  - or a Android app that recieves an SMS and controls a local wallet accordingly - gap in the market there.  With backtesting on this I found 0.80/0.80 was better... thus perhaps best to change the gekko config file to:"  sellTreshold: -0.80,  buyTreshold: 0.80"? There is no set price to buy and sell at - it's does it based on the EMA rate  Some films are pretty good but they seem to get the timing just right and articulate what people are thinking about at just the right moment. Sometimes with art if it's balanced just right such that it's open to interpretation it can be like the film was written especially for you. Fight Club. Day of the Dead (I found it very funny for some reason)Films of the style Moon, Shawshank, Green Mile all safe bets but I really like it when a film is more specific on something rather than a big impact on something everybody reacts to. Thank you for the Japanese films FirstAscent. Seems you have a greater appreciation for Direction than I but there's a few to look at there so will have to check them out. I guess you liked OldBoy...?Amazed there's no Anime mentioned yet. Would expect Akira, Castle in the Sky. But then I'd also expect here to see Pan's Labyrinth & ...Dirty Dancing.... Greese.... That's strange... I get no update after an hour (interval is 60 in config.js)... in fact I left it for a day and no update. It just checks the EMA once and then no more... but continues running.If I quit and rerun it does the same - gives one advice and then no more How do you know it's still working? I ran it, it gave one trade advice... and nothing else since... Courage & certainty are said to be the things needed for trading, to cancel out fear. Needs to be real, not ego. Another case against ego. DMT off SR anyone? seems forward thinking - an idea for you - how's about automatic trade on receipt of funds? I have rich and I have been poor. When I was rich I think I felt it didn't suit me. My ego said no. It's like being with a very beautiful woman... and messing it up because you just don't feel worthy. That can happen. If panic is coming on you might have to admit to partial sell to get to that level of trading that feels natural again. It takes a loss to find where that point is. Before I lost a lot of money I had a gut feeling. I ignored it. It gave me about a months notice, that's quite a lot. Likewise I would guess you've had this feeling for a while. Introspection to inner knowledge is not easy. You got to delete anything that gets in the way - logic, guilt, fear... I find tax declarations so confusing. I guess the truth is that I hate paperwork but really to go back through all the transactions one makes in a year and figure out a profit/loss for the whole thing is really forensic accounting. Just think, wages -> transferwise -> bitstamp -> BTC -> (BTC rate rises - taxable) another exchange -> another foreign account -> buy gold -> gold value drops -> sell the gold to the foreign accountNow imagine all that happening with different things, transactions flying everywhere. How the heck are you supposed to declare this kind of stuff to the tax man? I guess the way is that any money you receive in fiat you should have your own accounting trail for. Just look at the money hitting your fiat bank accounts in order to simplify. With this born in mind I'm going to plan any future transactions around this to keep things as simple as possible. It's not so much the nightmare of having to pay tax (since often we make losses too), but it's the beaurocratic nightmare of all the paperwork that's the worst. And if you think it's bad where you are, just try some poorer countries (poor in part because of such beaurocracy!... usually along with inflation too!)This is why ID verification is Bitcoin's Achilles heel right now. The beauty of bitcoin is the lack of beaurocratic crud... but ID verification is just the start of this. We had gold years ago and that got eroded, there's no reason why Bitcoin won't be bastardised as well eventually.

Is verification now needed to buy as well as sell BTC? anomymous transactions are not only useful for criminals. this is the anonimity argument again. similar to the guns argument. there are pros and.cons but think about concentration vs decentralisation of power. as just one example, would you.buy a 23andme genetic testing kit and trust google not to store you cc info next to your google openid info/facebook and all the rest? i find this thread interesting as debt is not something that bitcoin addresses alot. in particular I see people talking about trust. but in my experience its not trust these days thats the problem; its the ability to repay. its gambling; typically we gamble for a reward and the risk can be sometimes be.to loose everything. typically we are not equipped to assess the risk:reward payoff. debt is running the world. its in our minds and has been, including in religion.just because we choose to ignore leverage doesnt mean it doesnt effect us. are house prices effected by it? are markets distorted by it putting.those who avoid.it at a competitive disadvantage?theres a book 'debt: the first 5000 years' I think... if you think its bad now just be thankful theres less.selling.of daughters these days. question: what was the monetry value of pirates reputation before the problems, how much was taken vs this and how does this ratio compare to a typical credit.ratio rating? I've noticed women are better at those meningeal jobs and most jobs are meningeal. They are better at most unskilled jobs. Better attention to detail in report writing for a start. But for the man to stay at home and child raise, that's still very very rare. It's a bad deal all round. Not exactly a boycott, just ignoring the role given.  The proof of work mining should be used to balance the network, otherwise the network with naturally clump into larger and larger nodes. That's why a good businessman is all about connections. I'm not talking about penalising nodes for being big, I'm talking about load balancing to cancel out the natural network effect.  This is the most recent thread for the escrow provider. The thread agrees on JohnK's reputation as safe escrow. A bidder should do their own due diligence and research, I quickly posted the most recent thread. Turns out it would have been a good habit to exercise in reading that thread especially AWsq7spFKuj1oVC8KRpeCUabxMoLofTTBywell why not :pTIA :-) Better to show the prices in USD using btcticker methinks JohnK rep thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=225059.0;all From experience in boats and RVs I can say that it's a good idea to keep things simple. I want to find a guide for the Raspberry Pi & 12v ASICs. You want to keep everything 12v if you can. Converting to and from A/C induces loss and gets complicated. The advantage of ASIC is that you can potentially keep adding them until they match what your solar panel is putting out. I also recommend keeping the whole thing independent on it's own if possible, running either off a leisure battery or another battery setup if you have something cheap or for free. I don't like batteries; I would much rather store energy as kinetic if possible - like water in a high place. Batteries are always going wrong and they're hard to service. Even forklift batteries get corroded on the fins inside. Sealed batteries are even worse. Questions:- 12v USB hub. How to add extra power without using a wallwart? - Is there a guide for the Raspberry Pi and ASICs? I think if the Pi runs off USB it's unreliable? I've tried the Beaglebone and that's more reliable off USB, running at a lower CPU mhz (300mhz instead of 800mhz I think)- another way to store 12v energy other than batteries which need replacing? Doug Casey is the only foriegner I've read to understand the madness of Argentina when he says (not exact quote) - 'They have these young people in power with optimism idealistic thinking, almost communist'.That matched my experiences when I was living there. It's a thinking that everyone can be equal and free. I kind of like this. The problem is that it's all done manually - like in communism, this is too inefficient to work and nobody seems to have the brains to use the market rather than fight it. The inflation has been high for years and years. Everybody's hardened to it and used to fighting to avoid the gov monster. Everybody trades USD cash in the black market so Bitcoin is an easy adjust. The mailing list is busy now but very quiet. A very long way to go before people are using it as they do the dollar. The best way for them I think would be to buy Jalapenos. Other than that, many have secret accounts outside the country. Many have family members in places like the USA in order to escape some way financially.  I've had the same problem before; account limited. I think the thing that did it was connecting from another country. I travel a lot so maybe it was that. Hopefully I'll get a chance to go back to the country I opened the account from one day to login and withdraw... I'm never submitting ID - talk about financial suicide Finally had it open a couple of days ago. Various contacts corroded, much worse than I expected. I never thought it would be possible to get it working at that point. Spent hours cleaning with isopropl alcohol spray cleaner. The spray itself wasn't actually removing the corrosion - it looked as if it was but after drying out it was much the same. In the end I'd cleaned a lot but gave up and tried powering on... still nothing. Then gave it to a friend. He picked at it for a minute and tried switching on... well, magic hands because now we have power to the screen (mostly grey and white)!...worked on it a bit more and got it working. Remember that next time you got water damage. Quite amazing really, whole areas were white with corrosion.Q: This reminds me of heat damaged radeon repairs. How expensive do you think a piece of electronics has to be to make this sort of repair economically worthwhile?  Increasingly interaction with fiat currencies is involving more and more "verification". This typically means involves finding a utility bill and ID document and uploading it to a server. We have no idea whether the ID is actually of someone using an account. We have no idea how the documents are stored, yet we see passport scans being sold on the deepweb no problem and anyone at the exchange with access to these files can reuse them again to open an account somewhere else...Does nobody notice how ridiculous this is?In the UK for example, there are laws on storing certain documents. Credit cards have a whole load of guff legislation regarding them; visa then awards a compliance level. In order to get to the various compliance levels companies have to do various things to get there; it's a real ball ache for all involved. It helps but of course beaurocracy is one step away from the crushing inefficiencies of communism and statism slowing it down for solutions like Bitcoin to fill the gap.Surely there's a 3rd party out there to store documentation on behalf of companies? Can't something like OpenID step in to help too?  Where does Bitcoinspinner store it's data in the filesystem? I am trying to recover a wallet or private key from a water damaged phone. 
I don't where conspiracy theory starts in what I am about to say. AFAIK it seems to work a bit like this. I'd like to know a more accurate view of how it works. The USA tends to lead the world in everything. It's still very dominant. AFAIK laws tend to be formed in the US usually under pressure from a cartel and very powerful interests and companies. This then gets exported off to the UK, pushed into the UK and then to the commonwealth and former commonwealth (like Australia), somewhere along the lines countries which have less obvious ties, less historical ties then may follow suit; countries like Chile. Meanwhile you still have countries which don't follow suit. Argentina, Iran, China and so on. These countries could carry on using Bitcoin... but would they and would they be enough? - would they be enough to support and at what price? Looking at where the trade is Bitcoin is still very much in the influence of the USA. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Maphttp://www.thegenesisblock.com/mapping-bitcoin-adoption-a-global-perspective/The significant ones look like China & Russia. If it wasn't for this I would be more bearish. Seems amazing there's not more Bitcoin in South America. Has anyone got a better view of how politics tend to fan out around the globe? I'm no expert, just the impression I get from the news and propaganda. I guess countries not aligned with the USA could attack Bitcoin independently of course but my point is that the USA is a big question for Bitcoin - we are expecting the USA to attack it and when that happens we can expect many but not all countries to follow suit.  Problems with Ripple:big 3:- no source (still?)- a massive amount "premined" as-it-were- the idea is to ripple trust but really you are rippling debt; it's debt based and defaults can ripple exactly like European banksAlso:- the high level of organisation just makes me suspicious politically even if it does seem bullish for price- the devs explicitly say don't speculate on XRP- no privacy (good thing?)... - very centralised at the mo- basic (good thing); no cold storage... yet?I'd say the same as Bitcoin, check it out, get into a bit but not alot Is there any cards available outside the USA that work with this? The list just shows the names of the cards... guess we'd have to click everyone and check manually to see if they outside the USA paperwallet generator please someone :-) I tried an alternative account number for Bitstamp... this worked once for a small payment but then a slightly larger payment failed. I then tried Currencyfair. I tried a very small payment to Bitstamp as a test, that was 2 days ago. I then tried 100 a day ago and that too isn't there yet either. I have been using Bitcoin to regularly reduce banking fees. It means that instead of saving up and sending in big blocks of cash to reduce fees I was able to send as little as £1 if I wanted to with no extra costs - otherwise this would have cost me £25 on send, ~$20 in the middle and $15 on receive.I will try bitbargain. Might look into getting paid outside the UK... it can only get worse I think my company uses VISA recharge to pay expenses to people in some situations. I know cards have a facility to take funds for refunds but can that be used to fund any prepay card? If so, an exchange could charge a prepaid card with the proceeds of a Bitcoin sale.  I need access to a UK VPN or VPS as my server has fallen over. I've looked but from experience many seem to make the accounts manually and that's too slow. Is there anything that will auto setup the same day?  A better hedge would surely be buying gold. Of course the problem is that it's inconvienient.  2 favourite subjects in one thread!Looking at Hollywood depictions of how satan does control it tends to involve way superior maths and taking advantage of faulty human psychology. We see a lot of that here.Don't forget to have a look at other religions view of Satan; Jewish, the various Islam sects and so on. Can someone chime in? There's also the alien conspiracy line to mix in if we want - breeding humanity, control by money... somewhat got us between a rock and a hard place but also not so almighty. So Satan can crack AES and it's game over would be one thing. It does look a lot like people are manipulated by numbers. Bitcoin could fit into it but I think whatever is available would be used anyway - not so different to stock markets. If you have a view that Satan is also positive in that all negatives have an upside you can work it round to an education viewpoint. Bit harsh of a lesson in some cases but advocate would say life is harsh anyway. I'd like to know what life would be like left on it's own - does a wolf stay a wolf or turn into a dog eventually?Someone on this thread earlier mentioned that they didn't feel forced use would be such a threat because people can always transact in other ways. Have you ever tried to do things like that in real life? Sometimes it's fine, sometimes people just don't trust you; try to pay for a house in cash maybe you're a drug dealer, gold - did you steal it. So it needs mind control too. Bitcoin is a game changer for the world but I feel that yes, if it become very popular it would be used against us, be that from Satan, oligograph governments or one via the other, whatever. That's why you got to stay ahead of the curve. It might be easier motivation to imagine that the force pushing you beyond the curve is life rather than Satan or maybe it's better the other way round for you. If you're thinking positive then projects and opportunities like Bitcoin will just come to you. That's what praying's about - not asking some bearded chuff for a favor but bringing in what you want to happen by thinking about it in the efficient way to elicit change. So, visualise what you would like Bitcoin to be and imagine the positive feeling that you might get as if it were now for the win.  If you're wise you could do all your trades over the counter on localbitcoins or whatever. Anyone who's used an exchange likely has a papertrail. That trail is strongest if you've sent them ID.  Would love to see a list of some sites confirmed they can be used with  My order was paid partly by Paypal balance and partly by debit card. The limit for debit card charge is 120 days and I ordered in August so that's past. Paypal haven't asked me anything as yet; I don't know how to contact them if it's beyond the 45 days. So I have asked for a refund, given them 14 days and said if no response will use the UK small claims court (not sure if this is really possible but I'll look into it later).  Some strange wallet amounts not seeming to match up:Since the Ripples sold for 0.01 I should have more in my wallet even with the fee (which makes this a bit silly but nevermind) How do you do the autotrade on recieve with MtGox? Do you have to use the API? I can't see how to do it. If I try to place an order before any funds are there I get "not enough available funds" The strongest psychological trick I know is to not check the price or read speculation threads. Hard to resist! One trick I suppose could work would be to script something to trade at a point you have decided well in advance and not check prices. I say script rather than set orders because I think it's reckless to keep funds on the exchange and no exchange does auto trade on recieve (why??) A lot of people sit on BTC waiting for it to rise. Some others don't buy it because they think it will fall. I do neither. I feel that I can't tell whether it will go up or down. I sit on the fence and any reserve I have is quite small on the basis that it's a useful emergency fund. But I still use it to pay for things instead of hoarding because I sit on the fence. I feel if you are a bear you are wrong... and if you are a bull you are wrong. Both think they are right. Both think that they are more intelligent than 50% of the market. If you pause for a second and think... can you really out trade the market? Do you have time to monitor MtGox for lag? Do you have time to follow tech analysis and trade accordingly... or program something to trade for you that will work even when your exchange is down? Probably the answer is no. It's a full time job and the crashes usually revolve around the weekend. Bear/bull thinking seems to me as a binary thought trap. Why not sit on the fence? If we do that then it's possible to use BTC for normal transactions. The problem with greed is that it takes all our focus. Instead of getting on with work we're thinking of the price. If we can sit on the fence and forget the price then we can get on with work. Those who are working with BTC are making the real profits. Sure there are fluctuations to mitigate for but in general having a skill is much more valuable than money in any form. However... it's genuinely addictive. Kick that habit. Post back here the longest amount of time you've gone without checking the price! another way to frame the scenario: pay now in Bitcoins or USD or take a Euro loan?  Let's say you buy a property in Spain. You can have it denominated in £ or . Let's say we go for Euros. Then Spain goes back to pesos.  Most likely the mortgage gets converted to pesos and then the peso devalues so you're in profit... but that's not the only scenario. The banks aren't going to be happy with switching to pesos? What if the mortgage could stay in Euros and then your asset is going to devalue massively. It seems less likely but is it possible? Looking at history you might think no but those examples are different in that this time we have the eurozone and a group of countries - is there an analog in history... US states or anything like that?If one believes in a switch to peso then perhaps it's better to wait for that switch and devaluation first. Or perhaps not - perhaps in a situation like that trade with things like offshore accounts or Bitcoin would now be under massive attack by governments... and might not be an option because everything is such a mess. Is it possible to use a mortgage to make a bet on this? The only valid line of reasoning for deflation as a problem is that it makes life easy and you get rusty. Another argument that could be used... but isn't could be if it was referred to like a tax and the proceeds were used to defend the country making a bit less of an obvious theft.Never believe this ridiculous crap that somehow taking money away from people makes us richer. All it can do is skew the stats short term as people panic to try to escape the threat by converting savings into houses, cars & debt, anything to shelter the abuse. Your common sense was right all along.It doesn't stimulate an economy - it just creates an illusion of this in the short term as people scramble to escape the problem, moving into asset bubbles. Some say that people hoard in deflation. Preparing and saving is a good thing to be encouraged! People still have to eat and live so they still have to spend those coins at some point. The agreement we see everywhere is because we have had the idea of accepting inflation repeated to us for all our lives in the news and media. Eventually if we have no other viewpoint we come to believe it. However, if we speak to locals when on holiday in high inflation countries we start to get a perspective - you've been lied to. Watch out for the themes that are repeated again and again in the news. Notice how the volun on the TV goes up at news time. Look for the common themes (i.e common theme=family - for Paedos, gay rights, feminism) (common theme=violence, on tv,games,war,gun control). Now go the next step and tell me why. Then also you have to come to terms with it and know it's going to influence people... but you are too smart to go that way so let those young fools go to fight the good fight, let the women struggle balancing a career... and ignore all that and go your own way in success.  I suggested making a firefox addon (or greasemonkey?) that integrates Bitmit results at the end of ebay searches
SLL is the secondlife currence. The risk API is basically trying to stop laundering Yes I did but for a full TBL because I didn't think I could have less. Somehow I have less and still some BTC leftover I seem to have 0.865TBL... I don't see how that happened I'd like to give a small review. I've tried piracetam and I found that the day after I was a little less alert than I was prior to taking. That is, what it gives with one hand it takes with the other the day after. I'd be happy to compare this experience with what you provide and see how it works and report back here. I don't want (need?) a number of bottles though because I don't believe in taking these things long term. Rather, I think it has a place for when you want a burst of 5-6 hours and the next day doesn't matter - for example when you're not allowed to sleep in your car and you're stranded or when you need to perform something as a one-off. To anyone taking this stuff I recommend making sure you're up on your omega3 too.  Couldn't a creditUnion (or anyone) achieve this by issuing cards, supplying a QRcode sticker and then automating the exchange to refill it?In fact, perhaps I could emulate it myself with one of the polishcards... but how can I set up an automated exchange that automatically converts BTC to fiat and sends it via SEPA? It's only a whitepaper at the moment. It uses IP addresses instead of proof of work. It's an interesting take on the problem. It was suggested that this could be used along with PPCoin's proof of stake to additionally change the way the network is enforced if that is wanted.I think this is a genuine (albeit small) step forward for innovation.  Ah I see it now. I'd like to try it out but $18 is a bit much for a test - how do I gauge trust that I will see the cash again? Is there any live shares we can buy into to test this with? Not starting something from scratch, tweaking code rather than something really different. It might be possible to come up with something truely new and different, so low bandwidth that it could run on bluetooth only, leveraging the Bitcoin network somehow... instead it's just another coin. Not matching the Bitcoin code talent - bit harsh but it's true. Generally not innovating. Only PPCoin & Qubic have done something like that. Not taking the previous gains for various coins and or systems like Ripple or OT and putting it all together. Translation. Cynically trying to get rich quick in general. And finally... calling it somethingCOIN.  I was meaning for that to be an option too. Anything that skips having to install another client Well I suppose if no one wants to try then I could try some more options to fix - but where can I get pure ethanol? (not cleaning grade) Thanks to Ditto for showing me this. Needless to say, bear in mind security. If anyone has any comments on if any of these are safe or not please comment back here some feedback:I got caught out when my usual cards got wet recently so I used the PLN card for a cash withdrawal. Using Google rate a day later it worked out as 76.01 for 70. I will go with the EUR card at that discount when I renew to hopefully reduce costs. The limit for each item you can buy is quite low, I think $180? For me that meant I couldn't use it to anonymise genetic testing. But it's very good. I even was able to call the bank and speak in English. I think also it's useful if for some reason you were like the guy in the fugitive where all your normal cards to your name stop working!  1NsrcRhanyoYGsAjJRCCqtbxM86QA8D5Er Just wondering if there are any paper based/brainwallet/offline wallets for any of the various alternate cryptocurrencies? Ah thanks I getcha. Increased the LTC trust too. edit: In the name I get the impression your ultimate goal could be stocks /shares/assets. Any time frame on that? I guess we need to get trustlines established first? Thoughts? Thanks!  32oz? Good grief I wondered why it was written in apostrophesCan't see any TRC in my wallet (which would be a new IOU for me) - do I need to do anything more? I guess this is why we test. I can see a pathway for LTC, USD & XRP but nothing else. I have the trust levels set less than 1USD equivalent on each but I thought that should be enough.  Yes I think so too - another reason for problems. Likewise on currency exchanger licenses for exchanges too. If one follows the law though, nothing changes? hmm... I am in the north if you need to buy a few coins
I'm playing with this thing and set aside a small amount of balance that could be lost in order to establish trustlines. I used previous issued amounts to gauge how much trust to set. r82ovvXckDPTbJ7adQxqQ38dQ7MWXXW3FWill be interesting to see assets exchange through the system. Still would prefer Ripple to be open with fair XRP distribution but hey here's to hoping. edit: Does 'church' mean bent over the alter with Mr Whippy? well $4 higher is quite a lot. I tried market fill when I last bought ages ago and I always get frustrated since it never gets filled quickly so I wait for it to fill a bit, cancel and try again (if you leave it it takes 10mins to re-adjust) Maybe this person got fed up with messing around with all that and decided to just go well above the asking price to get it filled ASAP. $4 is a lot though. edit: Another thing to say is that they also might not like having funds on the exchange and want to get in and out quickly. They also might not like the price swings. Would be nice if we could just send funds, convert automatically whenever it's recieved and then withdraw automatically too.  Paypal is owned by ebay so...Can't deliver to somewhere other than your registered address... yet still get chargebacks. High fees. Blocking digital goods. Blocking interesting and rude items. Seizing funds sometimes for no reason. Shutting down accounts. Forcing people to use Paypal - deemed uncompetitive in the USA... but continues in the UK and elsewhere! Buying up Mercadolibre which is also a mess can of worms of it's own and no improvements since the acquisition. Had rubbish site design for years - had to sign in for completed auctions and so on. The grouping items we had before. Harassing Bitcoin mentions. Vero - not allowing people to use tradenames that actually are part of common language - ok this is a tradename subject but I would prefer that genuine 'TomTom' devices were prioritised over other sat navs or giving the user a choice - same with 'Hoover', 'Perspex', 'Selotape' and so on. Ebay is rubbish. It has failed to break many markets were there was already an auction site. They clearly don't have the talented employees in dev... research and dev team must be so impoverished. The only way it gets away with it is that it's entrenched. I'd like to see a firefox addon that shows me additional searches on Bitmit etc when I search on ebay as a start. I'd really like to see this monster cracked. It's another possibility for decentralisation too. That is... we have decentralisation and we even have some mesh trust with Ripple on the way. Perhaps add in ID and then we have all we need for a decentralised market. Until then I guess it's Silkroad.  In psychology a victim of say, bullying often becomes the bully. Here do we see parts of Israel treating surviving traders with the same suspicion the Nazis treated Jewish bankers in particular prior to WW1? Bitcoin has a very poor representation in terrorist areas at the moment (why?). The speculation is very possible but has no basis. Shame on them - yet more terrible PR for Jews and Israel.  9flats is pretty cool. I found it has less listings than AirBNB and as such the competition means it has lacked the cheaper rates that I sometimes see on AirBNB. That said, thanks for letting us know - if I ever run out of fiat it could come in very handy, no? 9flats seems to be better for full apartment rentals which is not what I look for particularly. A general comment after having used AirBNB twice. Bear in mind that many of the listings (but not all) are not professionals. It takes years to learn how to become a hotellier - it's not easy. You're staying in someone's house. Often it's cheaper than a full BNB but you do sometimes lose out that service. For example I'm used to conducting everything online with emails and backing it up with SMS. But people here expect a call. Nothing wrong with that, but that's the difference. A great thing to see for Bitcoin. It's very good to see some of the spaces we have been used efficiently finally. Just think of all the hotel space out there unused with homeless people outside. This isn't a fix but for some the increased competition can go a long way for helping some people out. And allowing Bitcoin means that even the homeless who can't get a bank account could be in with a new chance.   Let's say we're staying in a hotel. You connect over open WiFi... this doesn't sound safe to me for sending BTC.  What if the WiFi is encrypted but all the guests in the hotel know the password?  What if you're using a remotely hosted blockchain such as Electrum or Bitcoinspinner?  My guess is that the best you should do is connect to a VPN or VPS using a one time password or 2 factor auth and then you'll probably want to run a thin bitcoin client athough ideally the full client would be best? Failing that then perhaps if using Electrum then make sure you have an SSL connection to the server in settings.  A more likely threat to me seems a man in the middle with MtGox website rather than actually intercepting transactions because you have the private key right and the private key signs where the transaction is going - the worst that can happen is the attacker drops the packets so the payment doesn't get through... then you pay again, possibly.  So, Bitcoin in hotels... comments?  I had a look at Coinapult's SMS wallet. Pretty handy but a shame to have to trust them. It would be better to be able to send such messages to your own phone number at home either through gnokki or by linking to a SMS server where you can rent a virtual mobile number online. All this would be useful for travellers in countries with unreliable infrastructure or where it's hard to buy a local simcard with prepay internet - Iran... others?  Yes the farmer doesn't get business but it doesn't matter because he's richer. The IS a argument to be had in that it weakens the people's ability to farm. By being rich you just pay for what you need. That's why us in the wealthy countries have gone soft. And there's nothing wrong with that. "The best thing to do is let other's suffer the death and hardship and then have their babies." -satan Do I need to do anything after depositing to lend out the BTC? From limited info house looks London-like. Must be a very big place for Lancashire. No location, no info really. Interesting idea though, best of luck Thanks for the advice folks. If I was at home I would try these things out but unfortunately I am travelling and that's why I'm looking to sell. It could be rewarding to someone. I guess if nobody wants to fix it, pocket 1BTC in addition to a getting a SGSII albeit with no screen all for £90 then I guess I'll just have to wait until I get home in 3 months to fix it.  Well really I'm looking to invest...  still, coinlend looks better but I would prefer auto cashing out than having to keep logging in and withdrawing to reduce risk on the siteThanks for the link though Sadly the BTCjam test failed so I'm skipping lending and looking for stock Bump. Nothing? Really?? Instead of trying to get rich off speculation where greed clouds the mind such that one things "I am better than 50% of bitcoiners" how's about looking at it as:"I'm not sure how safe my /£/$ in the bank now so I'm going to buy some BTC and try to forget about it so that it might be there should I need it." Even if you lose out from $240-$50 you still have some coins. If there is some kind of economic emergency then you still have those coins. Further, such coins are more likely to rise in such a scenario (but not always - see gold's fall this year). So it's a punt, but better to punt in a small way than not.  Trust meeeeee, openleeee!r82ovvXckDPTbJ7adQxqQ38dQ7MWXXW3F^ a good point. 2 wrongs don't make a right though. I use Gentoo to compile mine automatically from source, checking the signed distrib. I go a bit further than most... perhaps not far enough. To the early people on this thread - I wouldn't trust another forum member with as much as 1BTC! What I decided to do was credit myself with as many of the different currencies that are available and then extend a small amount of trust to some of the gateways. By doing this I am risking as much as ~$10USD but I hope this means that I have encouraged the network? How can we engineer a situation where I can meet someone I wouldn't normally trust, yet through this I have some trust? edit: Surely another key use for Ripple is in assisting people to become currency exchangers. Let's say I want to help people in the UK buy and sell BTC for bank transfers to my own account. I put up a thread offering and then people have to trust me with the amount they want. Then they credit me 1GBP and send me 1GBP. When I recieve it I have to manually convert to 0.001whateverBTC and then, rather than sending them Bitcoin to their address we send it through Ripple and they withdraw using Bitstamp. This doesn't seem so different than a OTC exchange at this stage? Can Ripple help address the decentralised exchange problem by making it easier for people to exchange? Hopefully a few key trusted forum members could step up like the DYM example and assist in gateways for fiat? edit2:See if you can do this: I have notes open at some mark down for RantinRave nexusakachus Bemtje Paranorman SynOpsFeel free to have a look. Q: How low does the price have to go before you're interested in buying from each person? SynOps: I'm most gracious to this guy because he is responding. I understand - good job, keep at it, I'm behind you.              (with a flame thrower! :p) The others - how do the price changes effect it all?

Take your time if you have a problem, as long as you're trying or we get something then that is enough for me. I know things can go wrong. I don't want to jump on anyone for responding. I'd rather jump on anyone who hasn't said anything. Q: I wanted to use this kind of thing to profit from arbitridge because I don't have the time for it.

SynOps: if you can get back from it all and you know the need to be more careful next time then let me know any future business plans because I could invest again with more details on the plan next time.  The Bitmit auction is linked to GBP and I've taken into account the big fall. Open to any feedback I wanted to buy an Arbitridge fund on the Rock Trading but it's in SLL and I'm blocked by the risk API. Where can I find the same thing but in BTC? How come we can't see anything in the order book for EUR/SLL? It would be great to finally buy SLL to buy stock without the riskAPI getting in the way. I just tried to deposit a coin there via their website. That was successful but then I coudn't do anything with it, such as trade for SLL and buy a stock - I get blocked by the risk API... but I was hoping the trades would be possible without actually using an avatar. I also can't seem to do it through Ripple either.  I also tried buying SLL, registered an Avatar just to sell it for BTC and I also get blocked by the riskAPI at the Rock ATMs and VirVox ATMs!  Conclusion - unless you already waste your time playing SL don't bother! 
Yes I agree. I don't think it's a scam per-sec... rather I value it at $1USD for 100,000,000's ripples due to the centralisation & lack of source. I cashed out all except a few XRP for testing... made close to 50 out of nothing! Of course the value may rise but then also XRP will be given away again: Keep an amount according to how much faith you put into itNo doubt XRP value will probably go to the moon like BTC did and I'll be kicking myself but here's something no one mention:- where you put your money is what you support. If you buy a stock you are not only betting on it rising; you are supporting the company.  I choose to support Ripple only a little.  Can I trade XRP for DYM and just trust you to hold one for me as a test?You know... regards ripple I haven't found a new usable trust pathway yet whereby I can trust someone I don't know through someone I already trust... this seems to be the whole point. I have made as many 1USD trust points to people I trust a little but still no paths found. Any tips? I also notice that there is only one Ripple server and I can't get the source to run my own gateway - did DYM manage to automate and the team allowed him to run a copy of ./rippled?  Chose not to link my FB with my Ripple address. Chose not to like and encourage my friends to bump up the price for something closed source and premined.  My gut feeling is that security is good on an unrooted iphone but privacy is poor. If you are worried about someone hacking your phone then the iphone is probably good. If you are worried about your taxman looking at your phone and then billing you then it is probably a bad.This is my gut feeling regards closed source things. So the answer is - it depends. You are in the hands of Apple, you either trust them or you don't, it's not for me to say. Personally I trust them but perhaps other people would be more paranoid that somehow Apple might delete the Bitcoin app from your phone somehow (possible?) - does that happen if an app is pulled from iTunes? Here's the missing step - you need the "destination tag". Bitstamp uses a single Ripple address and uses that destination tag to match it to your account. The easiest way to get the destination tag field to actually appear is to click the deposit link from within Bitstamp. Of course you also need to send BTC after you have traded your XRP to BTC. When I try to send XRP Bitstamp have been kindly sending them back to me. I also notice you can copy the Bitstamp Ripple address with the dt (destination tag) field but for me I found that while I can paste it into the box the destination tag field does not appear so I haven't tried it this way yet. Still don't like Ripple until it's OpenSourced though.  Every 'smart' phone is closed source to some degree and so, insecure. The least closed would be an Android running Replicant with only the modem closed, next would probably be a Galaxy running Cyanogenmod. iphone is pretty much a closed and controlled shop but is if not rooted then possibly more secure... just less private.  It depends what privacy you want and what you think is the biggest threat. Personally if I had bought an iphone anyway I would trust Apple but hesitate to trust the apps.  Quick note: In addition the right clock you also need the right timezone - careful when travelling. I broke my phone recently and lost access to Google Auth. I had my auth key setup but how can I setup a new Google Auth without a phone?  http://www.goldtrends.net/FreeDailyBlog?mode=PostView&bmi=1267250^ here this guy gives a 3 stage theory on gold's loss of value recently. 1) "FED will no longer QE"2) "Cyprus to sell gold"3) Crash the physical gold selling system so people can't sell in that market However... before all this I read plenty of tech analysis saying gold and especially silver as in a downwave generally for this year.  However, the theory regards gold is useful for the Bitcoin price fluctuations we've seen, especially regards (3) I've been using BitNZ to transfer between my account in another country. The reason for this is the annoying charges that you get to and from NZ accounts - do you know any way to avoid these? I looked at CurrencyFair and their NZD account is in Australia so you still get that $15 charge. klickex was a full 0.01 off the interbank rate (!) so it's only cheaper than xe.com or oanda if you transfer less than $1000My experience with BitNZ has been very good. You do have to set the rate you wish to buy or sell your BTC at manually. I suggest looking at the order book and typing in your price according to what is available to get the match instantly. Even so, be sure to do a few test payments first and take your time. The guy running it seems la bit busy and probably has other things on his plate, running this as a contribution to the community rather than for the cash - just bear that in mind. It's a lot quieter and slower than other exchanges but it has worked well for me. YMMV Example price for future reference. Great idea to see this  been waiting for this kind of thing for a while. Recommend pictures of examples Yes it's a SGSII model i9100 with CM10 on it. Bitcoins are stored in Bitcoinspinner on the phone - I will send you the withdraw pin with the phone. I don't know the internals of Bitcoinspinner but I think we should be able to get the coins out if we can access the filesystem - it's just too dead for me to get that far. Bearing in mind the price swings I think what I will do is make a Bitmit listing which you can then use escrow with. I think your original offer was a bit high in allowing 1BTC for the phone itself since the LCD is scratched and the lens has come off so I changed the Bitmit listing to 1.349BTC linked to GBP and 15GBP for postage from Spain where I am now (guessed) and also in recognition of being able to send me anything you can recover which I valuehttps://www.bitmit.net/en/item/26174-i9100-faulty -j The market carried on without gox. When it reopened the adjustment was in line with the other exchanges - a good sign? 1) There must surely be a case study somewhere for a situation where a wealthy investor has shaken up a small market to pump and dump... and enough to control the market completely? 2) There are some people who assign a portion of wealth to the cause and never sell. They sold off costs a long time ago and coldstore buried those keys years ago - this is support at <$0.01.3) There are also people who just think "what else can I do with my fiat?"But, we do see bit trading and it's good to see gox attacked. Can we try trading with ripple? Maximum Keiser Sose switched to the commies for cash  That's a fair point but...  where else would you park your cash in such a liquid manner? I've investigated many alternatives and Bitcoin still has those unique properties - put the key in your head, protection from being shutdown etc etc. For some the question could be "if not Bitcoin then what?" if there was a clear alternative though.... ! Agreed. It's good for Bitcoin. The micro trading bots spamming are interesting. Very important not to react like the USSA and ban such things but to react to them in a fluid market response. Established markets also have this problem of spamming - I expect this community to be better than those trillion pound markets in the response. If it's 20k accounts a day then we have to presume that KYC is outsourced to a specialist company for this? Or is it in someone's garage handling passport scans and bank statements?  Can anyone have a cursory look over the source code and point out the changes that were needed for the portable version? Is the official celctrum portable build ready yet? (can't see in the main download dir) This is what litecoin is for of course... Ideas:- establish a standard guide for how many confirmations to wait for according to the size of transactions: What do you advise? - Mt.Gox should lower number of transactions on a sliding scale for smaller transactions. Waiting for 6 gives newcomers the idea that it's always got to be this way- publicise the confirmation speed. 10mins = 1 confirmation, 3=30mins, 6=1hr (generally)- advise the confirmation speed in tooltips on clients such as electrum- notification of confirmation by email or audio like on blockchain.info OK. Can anyone recommend an escrow provider and how to sell? Do you have some reputation or something like that? Cheers  I subscribed to quite a few sources in order to catch a flash crash, sell high and buy low. None of them called a top or forecast this crash other than to say "if it goes below the x line then sell". I don't know how automatically sell below a moving line and I was busy today so I missed selling. Not a major bummer since I only speculate with a small amount but it does make me think I've wasted my money on tech analysis - once again another failed experiment!  Do you agree?  Do you have a method for automating buy and sell? 
I think it's a good thing because now we have the possibility of headlines as "Bitcoin fails again" and so on... people may think "I thought it already crashed" and then might just get it You didn't knock on wood did you? ;^) Thanks, I'll give the rice a go. I wonder if it could have been salt from the water; seemed pretty dry but come to think of it, there has been less sun today so I was probably too hastyI wonder if jtag work can help in this situation... worth a shot later on I suppose    Took the phone in the sea in a "aquapac" but took the battery out. Got back on land, found moisture inside. Put the phone out to dry for ~3hours then tried to switch on. I expect it to be ok since there was no battery inside to short out. Nothing. No vibrate.  I think it should be possible to rescue the data onboard. Unfortunately I hadn't backed up because I was going to copy the backup in an email and became worried on the security of the email... plus the BTC value was lower back then.  I think it's rescueable. It's the photos I'm really after though - I think CM10 doesn't have the option to save to the external SD card otherwise I would have done that.  Any tips on anything else to try? Any service you recommend to fix it? How much do you think it's worth? The screen is also scratched, the gorilla glass came off.  Will see if the adverts get annoying, cool idea splitting some for charity585316-d9fe567ce8a23eeed0f177f57f4f04fd14rmk2nsmY7p4QLTcWC8q3uPfzkLnBDKSM I see I signed up for it at some point. Balance is zero. Perhaps it always was. Can't remember and there's no history. O well... deja vu, never mind :p !  Would you feel that you can buy a house directly with coins? -or do you think that you would need to show the how you got the cash? -or that you might be taxed, then fined for not declaring until nothing is left?  Do you have an exit strategy for any profits? What on earth will you do with all that money if we have $1000-5000/btc? Just wondering!  Seems people have latched onto my Transferwise tip! :-) Glad to see. And also glad to see the way to withdraw also documented - just go direct  The potential I think is very good here. You would have to craft that broadcasting according to the pattern of the network effect. Before we can do that we need to understand exactly what the network effect is - eventually to the point of a self adapting algorithm. Can anybody into Elliot waves and Fibonacci numbers or p2p network design or dynamic load balancing step in regards how we can understand the network effect more? I've listed a few papers there. Some of them include network simulation - has anything like this been used in the history of Bitcoin development?edit: to make the point stronger - yes I think Qubic is the best place to start from :-) Yes I don't think it's 100% possible in that I expect the closer you look at the more you see imperfections but one thing's for sure, it's a beautiful engineering issue!edit: I think if this was to be achieved the problem would be pushed outside the cryptocurrency network and outside. But... at least we would know that within the currency we at least have some extended safety and stability that we can't get with Bitcoin.  Consider these links:PPCoin Proof of Stake: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=101820.0Qubic IP related proof of stake: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=112676.0Network effect in cloud computing observations: http://thenetworkeffect.blogspot.com.es/2008/09/10-laws-of-cloudonomics.htmlBanking and superconnected companies study: http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdfThe network that runs the world: http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228354.500-revealed--the-capitalist-network-that-runs-the-world.html#bx283545B1Elliot waves, Fibonnaci numbers, stock exchange maths (got anymore links?): http://www.goldennumber.net/fibonacci-stock-market-analysis/Markets are networks just like Bitcoin. Bitcoin may fix the inflation problem but it doesn't address the network effect. - This is why we have MtGox so big - this is why we have a number of dominant mining poolsbut also- this is why we have such swings in the stock market- could this be the main cause of equality in the world?At a minimum this undermines Bitcoin which is supposed to be decentralised. At a maximum it means we will always see these swings in markets that destroy people's lives, make the rich richer and the poor poorer. One way to address it is to allow people to trade easily. Traders analyse the market and make a profit out of the network effect, usually in 2D as chartists. This only seems to smooth out the market bumps a little bit. I can find no information on more complex analysis applied to a network or at least just more than one stock - can you help?I think this will always be a problem unless something is done at network level and finally we have a chance with cryptocurrencies. I can't think of anything more pressing. To address this I think you need to change the proof of work to working out this network effect combined with the QubicCoin identity by IP method. It sounds complicated but I my gut feeling is that to the right person an elegant solution is entirely possible to design. That right person with the background knowledge of this might be working as a programmer in investment banking, working for a hedge fund or just themselves day trading a profit. Can you help me find any information related to this? We are not punishing wealthy people here. We are not intending to punish big nodes per-sec.

That gold is good because it is stable and does not grow like Bitcoin? Just sayin'  The problem with cashing out to a fiat currency is that you're then stuck with a lot of fiat. You might get taxed. You might get arrested for illegal proceeds. You might lose the proceeds a-la Cyprus. You might have to submit KYC to Mt.Gox. Q: If you think you're going to be so rich as Bitcoin climbs how do you cashout when there's nothing safe to cashout into? Gold? Which country do you want that gold to be in? Think about it. So ideally what you want is to spend the coins direct. There's only one guy selling his house for coins right now.  Gold is mentioned in religious texts. Bitcoin is more useful. They have both echoed each other at points, that's what the OP is getting at Some people have said that there was risk here that should have been foreseen. To that I say - when you recieve your wages or income with that institution:- how liquid is it? (how much of your money is actually retained- of the investments they make, where are these investments made? - how much exactly is the country your bank is in in debt?You don't know, do you?I've been looking for this info for a long time and it's very hard to come by. The reason - if it was easy we'd have a lot more capital flight. I know how you feel. I had my life savings wiped out when the FSA shutdown the hedge fund I was with and haven't investigated their trading history (i.e. it's suspicious) and now renamed the FCA I think I remember logging to sell an hour after the email and seeing not 2 but 4-5 red bars on the Bitcoincharts chart. Anyone else? Anybody who submits dox are surely going to be first on the list in the coming gold and Bitcoin confiscations. I still have coins stuck on the exchange but if I give out some docs I'm just going to be risking everything. Is it worth it?There appears to be no way round it. Its frustrating because I thought there was a deadline for this. A few days ago I was able to withdraw a coin. Perhaps where I went wrong was trying to withdraw more. I'll keep trying. Perhaps I can slowly release coins or whatever over a period of years. People of Cyprus I know how you feel. The sell signal appeared to be issued after the correction yesterday...  but the correction yesterday was at the same time as the MtGox DDOS...and it only went a few dollars lower, not to $55 as suggested. hmm.... perhaps it can still drop... My payment was recieved. Now waiting for Paypal send. Not sure how long this might take. Perhaps I will have coins send back if theres not enough funds?edit: is there a way to search this massive thread only? I think most likely result is that my account gets shut down for selling a digital good. could be lucky though. might get an idiot who sees the proof of delivery and acts differently!worth a shot!next time might try selling a Cassius coin!really though the problem here is the eBay/PayPal monopoly. I believe the monopoly might be broken by sites that search multiple action sites comparing results smoothly to find what you want for where you are. that way, bitmit could be more successful. the problem blocking this is that eBay can make it difficult for people to search their site through an api or by changing the site code. the only way to prevent this (I think?) is to enforce fair competition from a regulating body. this has happened with PayPal in the USA but as an example you still have to accept PayPal in the UK which I find infuriating. anyone got any more ideas? how's about a Firefox plugin or grease monkey script that automatically shows bit it results when I search eBay and also copies and listing I make to eBay to bitmit?
you think? well its done now so I will report backthe feedback is valuable there but tbh I'm thinking of going stealth with eBay someday anyway to combat the scammers and no funds on there to seize.  I did a little experiment selling half a coin a while a go (was worth a lot less). I specified only buyers from the UK and some other things but after a month I got the credit card fraud chargeback as expected The winner was in Singapore so proof of delivery didn't seem possible... I should have cut the experiment short there but well...  So, when it came to responding to the dispute I decided to file under "refund provided". Under tracking number I quoted the Bitcoin address and under tracking company I used 'other' and Blockchainexplorer.info !  Of course I don't expect this to work with Paypal's robots but I still like to do it anyway because if I was in a court room I could imagine myself doing a fair argument on it - that address is the delivery address and blockchain are indeed proof of delivery! The only thing could be the use of the word 'address' and the virtual world but I think even that could fit!  I will now do another experiment with a much smaller amount, probably BTC0.01 and have another look at the options to see if I can come up with a way to do it and not get scammed. Learnt a few things in doing it. One thing is that I'm sure I only wanted buyer in the UK but the scammer was able to put an address in Singapore... the next is regards proof of delivery - don't necessarily need a tracking number to dispute the claim! After it all I now see ways to scam anyone - so, so easy. The only difference is I have a conscious and there's no one I hate that much to screw over! This is a real eye opener because I always thought to myself "well, at least there's always ebay if I want to make some bucks"... but clearly, because ebay UK forces us to accept Paypal... it is not. That is - in a crisis people will get more and more desperate so although this scam is hot on Bitcoin if things get worse this can become more and more prevalent. Even more reason to get into a value providing business that accepted Bitcoin.

Congratulations that the service is working :-)How has it been going with chargebacks or fraud? I'm glad to hear this can work. I guess you have seen the thread on fraud, learnt from it or employed a consultant. I may well use the service one day if I want speed :-)  Recommended.  I love the menu and system :-)You can also use it just as a normal ssh tunnel too Just want to say well done on having something new with the network based proof. It's great to see a new innovation. I'll buy into this when it's ready just to support it I think. I read about this before but it wasn't clear in the main descriptions. I think it would have had more attention if that was so.  I wonder how such controls can affect other currencies on the periphery of the Eurozone; Czech, Polish, British, Turkish? - especially the high inflation ones Ah... I was going to lend some BTC because btcjam hasn't been so great but... no demand! Guess I have to wait for a falling market.  Good job, I've been looking for a lighter site to check balance Would like to try it out. How fast are payments?4MMj6EakzzzctDgMtJXHhFyuSq926Djj53 Sent a transaction. Says "Pending" and isn't seeming to be be seen on the block after 15mins so far...Still on 1.5.8... would like to update but Gentoo doesn't seem to have a better version and I know compiling will be hassle. Might look at the Chrome version just in case though that concept sounds less secure There are services out there for this but they all have bad reviews. I'm looking for someone to receive a letter for me, check it for drugs (it's from Google so should only contain a plastic tube and paper I guess) and send it to me in the UK. You don't need to have a load of good reputation since the genome service can only be used by me.  Successful trade with Projects for ~£310 of silver and BTC Thanks for the statement SynOps. I do view you as the more reliable guys.   MPOE-PR, thanks too. I was hoping I could prove that thread wrong. Strange the way all the defaults all came all in one go. I thought I had mitigated from that.  One thing I could have done was just go just for USD denominated loans. The rep building is kind of destructive too it could be argued... but perhaps not conclusively... perhaps safe just not to support it in future. I was aware of BTCJam being risky. I kind of made it my little game to try to see how long I can keep the coin going before going bust... didn't last long! I was going only for very reputable people but still it didn't go well. I had ebay links, otc ratings, phone number verifies but of course sometimes it doesn't always go to plan. For anyone interested, here's a list of my current loans. As you can see it's all very small, just an experiment. If I can get back to a level field then I can prove to myself it is possible to make money on BTCJam. If not then... it's a very useful lesson for all... kind of a sad lesson... but usury seems to bring bad luck Great site. Would be really handy for me so if you ever move out of the USA with it let us know What a good idea. I have my own method that I would like to share. It very different to what I think the OP is offering. I think the 2 things complement each other well. I have for brief moments felt the feeling of being in that moment and in demand. That's not what I want to teach here. This is something different. For me it has been more modest; ego doesn't work with it.I want to share how I met my partners because it has really changed my outlook in life. I too also don't want to charge any money for it up front. The reason for this is because I don't think there's much need. If it works for you as it has done for me you will feel so happy that frankly I can't see why anyone wouldn't want to acknowledge that happiness and say thank you. If you fancy giving this a go just send me a PM with your Skype and what kind of time to call you on UTC time and I'll talk you through it. Peace -j Less than a single BTC lost because I was experimenting with BTCJam, thinking I'd probably lose something. I kept reinvesting with just BTC1 but with slightly careful choices. Seems that wasn't good enough. Bemtje, Paranorman, SynOps all overdue. O well, experiment concluded :-) I'd like to do something like this too. Ideally something where I can get involved if I want to but there's already something to begin with. Would be great to have an income in BTC  I want to use Google's 23andme genome sequencing service. Of course, I want my data to be anonymous in case some criminal happens to have the same DNA as me! (it's actually possible - DNA is not infallible!).  So in comes a great application for those semi anonymous polish cards! The only problem is that with shipping I'm ~$30 over the limit.  Thus, I'm looking for someone to take delivery of the kit, check it for drugs and then send it on to me in the UK.  I guess I offer 2x whatever the postage costs are. I'm getting $44 with USPS so that would be your fee.  That's a really good video in the OP. It covers so much. I learnt a lot and that's saying something since I've read the book.Part of what it covers though and really blowing the lid off the myth is that generally barter didn't precede money. What he's saying is that barter did happen, but it was a very rare - you'd only use it when you met a foreign tribe and weren't killing each other. So what happened instead? - it's all on the tab. Things were different back then. Everyone knew everyone. So you'd just remember things roughly as you would with a friend or relative, and square up later on if you want.  That's the key message that this thread is trying to communicate. It's a very interesting thing because where I see this kind of trade I tend to see peace and success. I think it's a more natural system. It doesn't scale of course but I find it an interesting marker.  There's loads more in the video worth listening to in the background. I love the bit mentioning that the last case of a husband selling his wife because she cheated on him was in 1923! It's been all downhill from there!! Another nugget mentioned which I think is brilliant is how the headscarf was used in Greece to show women who are high class, married and to be respected - other women were not allowed to wear them and tended to be prostitutes!  That's a good point. Hard to say what the consensus is amongst average people. Some get it but... I'm not so sure that most get it even now? I'd like to see a survey to see what average people understand.The thing about this is that it doesn't seem to be a fix? It only guarantees a loan that isn't even enough to fix the situation. If they made it a 100% tax (which is what it could actually fall into!), I don't think even that would be enough to start again. We've seen it all in Argentina. I've been telling everyone this. No one believes me. When I say I'm putting cash into Bitcoin they all think I'm mad. It's exactly how many said it would happen.The thing is, it is possible to get away from Euro banks but it isn't easy, even now. Bitcoin is  the easiest option. Trying to find a decent bank abroad and actually getting all that up and running is even harder. It's really hard work going through financial statements to figure out just how much of your cash is in the bank at worse case scenario - even sharia banks are not a safe bet. Now what happens if everybody in Crypus starts moving cash to Lebanon and the middle east? Do we then get more flare ups there or more peace because it's hard to attack a place where your cash is?  Taking a load of savings is not so different from the fed and BoE printing loads of cash, it's quick but the BoE did quantitative easing in quite big chunks anyway. Meanwhile I read of markets going nuts this morning. I can see a lot of movement but I don't know how to put it into context of how big it is.Cyprus is kind of halted right now. No banking. No ATMs. Hope you've got some food in the fridge? That's how it started out for Argentina. But it just kept going and going until they had enough people to overpower the police and the president legged it in a chopper. I don't think this one will go that far but... it could with a run on the banks?
A couple of PPCoins would be really handy! PVUoD1xXJdiVGZTMnBTq3Sp6Q1AaSWsM3q I used to have >$100k and pretty much lost the lot. The thing is to not let it put you off but at the same time learn from it. Try to remember that actually losing real cash is different than anything you read in a book. When the reality sets in on what it means then we really understand what those numbers on the page actually mean to us. From that point on we set a motive on checking those BTCJam listings etc and exercising some discipline. Most millionaires have been bankrupted or close and come back from it, not letting it keep them down. I think in your case it sounds like you overspent and undercapitalised. You're in common company there - that's what kills most startups.  rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B?dt=4397 probably the wrong place to post it but here goes. Had a situation today where I couldn't get connected:Code:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/electrum/gui_qt.py", line 1113, in <lambda>    self.status_button = StatusBarButton( QIcon(":icons/status_disconnected.png"), "Network", lambda: self.network_dialog(self.wallet, self) )   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/electrum/gui_qt.py", line 1741, in network_dialog    change_server(host,protocol)  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/electrum/gui_qt.py", line 1736, in change_server    server_protocol.model().setData(j, QtCore.QVariant(0,False), QtCore.Qt.UserRole-1)TypeError: arguments did not match any overloaded call:  QVariant(): too many arguments  QVariant(Type): argument 1 has unexpected type 'int'  QVariant(int, sip.voidptr): argument 2 has unexpected type 'bool'  QVariant(QVariant): too many arguments  QVariant(object): too many arguments^ this happened when I switched from lite to qt and stried clicking the red circle to try another server. To get around this I had to start with gtk on the commandline and the click red circle and was able to switch to another server. Now working. This was on the out od date version 1.5.8... but I thought I'd share anyway.  Out of interest, how far did the spend get before the 0.8 chain went dominant? I take it that it didn't even get to 1 confirmation? How many confirmations was OKPay requiring at the time? 6 confirms at gox annoys me so it's a useful case study.   I always like Ripple and it's great to see it finally being used. A few things though. 1) It's supposed to be decentralized and thus protected.. but only coinInc has most of the XRP at the moment, so we are going through a bootstrapping situation... but unlike Bitcoin which had an early adopter and proof of work setup we aren't a messier distribution?2) The interlinking still makes me nervous even with the instant IOU cancelling out possibility. I'd like to see an example of this with say 3 of us users. For example, Barclays is the most connected company in the world so what can we do if we wanted to get rid of them?  Another way to describe Ripple is to call it a bit like digital Hawala. Am I right in thinking XRP aren't intended to have massive worth in of themselves and are instead intended just for use in stopping spam? -or are XRP actually valuable? Do they have a price now? -even with a big entity holding the cards and flooding the market regularly (and hopefully can continue) r82ovvXckDPTbJ7adQxqQ38dQ7MWXXW3F well, not dedicated but I don't see why currency houses don't offer it, no?  Just wondering what might be the most cost effective method for cashing out MT Gox codes or coins? Either way there seems to be a charge to send the cash at the source bank, be that Gox or another exchange, then depending on the routing it may go via an intermediary and you get another charge so it could be 2x£30.  Direct exchange on OTC is of course always a good option. But it's nice to know about the automated ways too. 1) Use the browser/vidalia Tor bundle2) set electrum proxy to 127.0.0.1:9050 - can't remember if it's http or socks. To get the proxy option you need the "classic gui" and click on the green circle bottom right This ain't Bitcoin. This is banking. Add to list:- network effect reduction (Barclays is the most connected company in the world that can't be brought down without damage... Mtgox is...?)- speculation mitigation; build exchange with another currency into the network...??Anyone who can do enough of these can rule the world If you view getting a ASIC via preorder only as an investment then it's a crappy bet. You almost double the money in a month but the certainty that you'll get to do that before others is low. You could be lucky. It's similar to the early investing when Bitcoin was young. However, if you want a piece of hardware you can run for another reason (getting involved? a decentralised method rather than exchange, bitcoin commitment tattoo) then it's maybe it's worth it.  The worst thing for me about being British is when I go abroad everyone blames me for colonialism. I can't argue with that, since since we're in Libya, Afghanistan, Mali, Iraq... and so it goes on... I'm ashamed of my nationality and trade it for something else... if the trade-off wasn't too extreme of course (i.e. not penniless and destitute...) Any relationship here to S3052's newsletter?(deliberately vague question, open for your interpretation) Yeah sorry about that, I was actually meaning to cut and paste somewhere else but someone from work came along and I hit submit and closed knee-jerk reaction! :p re: S3052's subscription. Do not use this service. If you subscribe you will find the newletters using trigger words and talking up the market deliberately. Then when a crash happens you will be informed too late in the event to profit while S3052 and his chums sell off. By trading off of the recommendations you are basically supporting S3052 gambit. It's not unfair in the same way all is fair as in love, as in war. Can I prove this ruse? It's always difficult to separate cause from effect but I believe I can. However, it would take a lot of work to show conclusively to a scientific level. Once exposed, the mistakes in giving himself away can be further covered up.  This is a different kind of accusation we had last year whereby I couldn't be sure. The benefit of the situation is that those bumps we've seen in the last 6 months - all from S3052's newsletter. It goes to show that it doesn't take much still to influence this market. It's getting better (I think this is due to buy and hold/forget that you get from people who just want to know they always have some cash - something harder to see with gold under the mattress) - but this is still a threat for Bitcoin. Fortunately the swings aren't as massive as they used to be but it shows that one actor can swing the market. Money has a number of problems. Bitcoin addresses inflation and centralisation. But it doesn't address the network effect or speculation. Q: How do we address that? Can an exchange be build into the currency itself to try to slow and mitigate price swings?Q: How was the S3052 newsletter in the early days before it become popular? Did he (I think it's a he) admit any mistakes? UK based so UK postage make sense. Some Scottish, some Chinese (who cares anyway - I'd prefer raw scrap if I could get it!)Can't confirm if they can be used to kill vampires. Bit pricey for lobbing at goths. You might need to forge them into bullets My that's an array of coins Fuzzy! Would be handy to somehow get a small selection of those without the hassle of downloading software etc Just want to say thanks Lucif. I've been very tempted to speculate on btc wildly right now. It's great to see an alternative analysis to temper a bullish opinion and this is much appreciated!This, combined with a Mencius Moldbug "How Bitcoin Dies" blog entry is a reminder to me that we still don't have a convincing p2p exchange. The point in this blog entry they make is to emphasise the importance of psychology of the exchange - that this alone is enough to tank Bitcoin - but I find it suspicious that they use the "0" term for bitcoin in a exchange d-day scenario. I feel a 2-fold+ attack would be required. It's unfortunate not to see a positive recommendation from the other analysts for anything competing with BTC. It's not good that the other analysts happen to be bearish on gold, silver and stocks. This coinsidence make it look like bias, with the effect of creating the market at swing points.   -j Not many. Having a clear-out. Silver rounds for sale. Prefer to sell a few at a time to save on postage, which will need to be registered I guess seeing I only have one feedback on OTC, though years on the forum. 
 Is there a exchange that will repeatedly automatically convert on deposit and withdraw automatically in either direction fiat-btc? I'm tired of checking for a transfer or waiting for an email that might come through at night. It would also be useful for keeping the balance off the exchange.  Or perhaps there's a way to do it with an API and a looped script.  For security concerns I guess this could be useful as the outward facing section of a forwarding chain. I've read somewhere you can chain transactions together somehowhttp://brainwallet.org/#chains  Combining internet addiction with checking emails and money, gambling and speculation   Anyone had any experience selling to coinabul? Yes I think definitely because (I presume) there are a lot of Goldmoney users. I don't think it would happen though after what happened with teh goldgrams payment thing getting dropped.Going a bit offtopic....I'm never quite sure what to make of Goldmoney... On the one hand it seems very well thought out from a traditional point of view. It's well setup legally with borders and everything. More secure in this sense than bullionvault. The whole thing is well designed. Being in Jersey is close enough to give people confidence but it is also outside of the big places and also a value tax area. However, I think the whole thing is thought up with some presumptions in mind. I can tell they think like the average guy. They expect fairness. They can't imagine a government basically invading a country and stealing all the gold. They can't imagine a government being unfair. But we've seen this with the swiss bank closing, kim dotcom and of course the more shadowy false flag operations in countries from Mali to Norway who don't want to play ball with the USA. So they don't respect borders or laws. If you say this to a goldmoney investor they will say "well if that happens, we really have bigger problems on our hands" as if 2 wrongs make a right. Also, it depends how much gold you put there. You actually need a LOT to go and retreieve it yourself. So if they find a way of stopping their trading system, anything outside the minimum needed to take possession could be lost. Any Bitcoin-goldmoney team up would be massive... and get both on the radar even more. As would any gold-btc links - I would guess a better setup would be somebody you trust (massively) using Bitcoin to buy gold overseas and vaulting it for you.  p.s. totally offtopic... blockexplorer seems to be lagging behind blockchain.info... downforme. ip resolves but can't ping or browse... It's not just the news. When you get an eye in for manipulation you can see it in many forms including:- the game of love- films- books- religion Spiderman3 was a big one for me with it being so obvious. It creates guilt in sexual confidence and links evil with male attractiveness. It then rewards you for treating women in a way that will cause you much pain. Guys who watch this will be hurt by women and possibly come out the otherside with a chip on their shoulder. On the plus side, it might improve society through less broken homes.  I like to watch the news because I like to see what's on the mindcontrol agenda. But it can be a bit much sometimes, especially when it's pulling at the heart strings in such obvious abuse of my compassion, or glorifying violence so when I'm conscripted into the army I won't give any mercy to muslims, or... whatever it is we're supposed to hate. It's also hard to catch all the tricks that are going on.  But I think you need to watch and identify it. That way if you see it on twitter or whatever you should be able to spot it.  45 'I want to link my Bitcointalk name with BTCJam's. Verification code: 15c3aacb-168a-47d2-9b9e-6b48ae9e0c7d'  OP: Don't listen to people moaning about how we had been thinking we had a Mt.Gox breach even with a Yubikey in use and that turning out not to be the case it's just good that we've been told now and can stop worrying :-)Sounds like this might have been a generic Ubikey and not the Gox one that has to be used with the site. Remember though folks, if you're trading on Gox that means you're banking. And fast and highly frequent deposits and withdrawals I don't think are feasible No balance was really intended to be on the remote site - the idea is to leverage what is already available such as identity from bitcoin-otc, but make it in a more easily assessable format that can't go down should we see some kind of bitcoin doomsday Confused... didn't think you could reload any debit card in the world with a moneypak If this guy was using a Ubikey does that mean that Ubikeys are not a reliable protection against Windows virii? It's easy to cloak logging apps and there's a lot of crackers around Bitcoin. Can this guy assume his install is cracked? How can he search for whatever may have caused the breach? Is there a Gox grabbing trojan out there we know about?Has he installed the Gox app on a phone? (I think that's a risk) Yes that's right - looking for a stealth service Bump. I believe OT,MC & Bitcoin can solve the decentralised exchange problem that Dark Exchange was trying to solve? ...and that by getting those easy installers nailed for people we can expect these projects to finally get the attention they deserve?...or would hosting the Bitcoin central code on a hidden service be a lot simpler way of doing it and more successful due to many more users likely?...until we see a website interface to OT that is extremely simple and cut down to simply "register" "offer" & "buy"http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/i356p/its_about_time_for_an_open_source_bitcoin/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=printpage;topic=87836.0 there is actually:http://orlingrabbe.com/?p=1476084340https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Moneychangerfor thisbut I think I prefer https://github.com/davout/bitcoin-centralOnce I've gathered all my info I'll post a thread in a more appropriate forum category and there should be more interest If working with a bank in fiat then Intersango has code for that:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=f099ea1d8e68e52c3bd97b686832b7b5&topic=35812.0https://github.com/dooglus/intersangoBut really what I'm looking for is something more basic - an orderbook with matching. A mix of the Intersango code with cyclos would be ideal to start. Maybe it's better to use Intersango as a starting point, removing the actual bank functionality so people can trade directly. Also, as a 2nd critical step I would hope to integrate, link in the #bitcoin-otc web of trust so that accounts on the exchange match up with that. Is there anything along these lines already developed? Just hosting something already out there like Centraw  or Bitcoinary but on a onion site would be a lot easier. People may bash Intersango but who else has shared exchange code? Oh right, ok. Other than running off tor was it any different from:http://www.cyclos.org/cyclos-demo ?(you can login and search for Bitcoin, but don't use it because it's supposed to be a demo)Can we make this better? Can we make it more automated? - check address balances automatically?- automatic suggestion of unit rate for offers and requests- automatic suggestion of most common units Upload a server image somewhere and I'll see if I can get someone to put it on a VPS somewhere for us (And ideally, does reoccuring transactions without too much bother)- walletbit Bitcoin to Danish, SEPA or International. EUR, DKK, USD, CAD- bitpay Bitcoin to ?None I know that go from fiat to coins. 
Well that's great but it's not Bitcoin - it's banking. A slightly less pure method was SMPake reducing the confirmations at gox from 6 to 3, but this was been discontinued...and 3 is still a wait. Another method could be Bitinstant adding a checkout button but would they take 1 confirmation risk... and 1 confirmation is still a wait.  Hang on... isn't MtGox checkout button... no still slow there too. The only thing I can think of is to credit something else beforehand. What about this green address thing? I had 3 phones listed on Bitmit linked to USD and below the ebay average for over 6 months... no response. Same thing on ebay and 2 sold within days - hence this thread. I really want to be paid in BTC but in order to do that I have to cater to the people who have it and that small sample experience was no good with physical goods. There are no doubt better opportunities.  Great to see. I couldn't connect though... ? Still up?  Here's an example:Code:Work accepted!Your work has been prepared!Please send a reward you want to pay for it to this address: 1HPttAE1VEXZ7ggAd8aTB3SkXGbWuaPg2eMinimum fee for your work is 0.01500000BTC.Honest fee for your work is 1.45018819BTC.If you want your work to be a priority, please pay at least 2.20000000BTC.Upon receiving a payment with enough confirmations, we will send out the work to miners to solve.You can check the status of your request hereIf no fee is paid within a week, your request will be forgotten by the system.Go backIf you like this site, please consider sharing or sending some Bitcoins over to:1YXA3E8nmyQrST9zH6S3NaEGF76ByPpPJI know it's 1.45018819BTC "Honest" but how much time does that equate to? Almost one and a half blocks of the blockchain?Sorry, I'm not a miner.  How do we convert an estimated difficulty to an estimated timeframe that it might complete in assuming the pool remains at the size it is now? Don't want to go for something too ambitious, send the coins when it will take hundreds of years to compute, no? regards highly resistent networks and radios...  what you want is something listening all the time and caching messages.... then able to only transmit shortly before moving...this could be done with bluetooth or wifi but I've never seen it done well (including serval for android) bump! ok so 30btc is $450. I'll learn how to cross compile and generate a portable version if anybody wants to give me $450Actually, if I get some free time I will learn how to do it. As long as there is a portable client out there somewhere with the disclaimer "portable tends to be used in insecure ways - only use this for small balances" This is definitely a good idea to keep updated. I agree perhaps someone trusted should be able to compile and sign the binary, and also the auto update would be better as assisted download and sign check [/quote]How can you do a SEPA transfer for £1 in the UK?Unless I am missing something as Barclays charges £15[/quote]^ Transferwise. They operate by automatically matching you with someone else or using their own reserves like Bitinstant. It's another p2p win-win where the transaction section is not really a bank :-) Love it!For those that believe in it though, it's said to be very difficult to bring things across. First, you have to make whatever it is a very strong memory. Ego is said to be the thing that make death painful. Advice is to let things go. As for trying to remember it... it's said to be similar to trying to remember a dream. Let's say as a kid you start writing numbers on a wall... parents are just going to think you're crazy !  I keep hearing the argument that inflation is necessary to encourage a country's exports. Gut feeling is that this is a load of crap. Yes, putting artificial pressure on an economy to force trade encourages exports but, exports aren't needed if you're rich. If there's no inflation then the country just gets richer. If richer, then the country is more powerful and less reliant on exports.  Is it as simple as this? For bitstamp, transferwise is a £1 fee. It should work in less than 2 hours but I usually find it's at least 24hours so yes pretty slow. I think the holdup is in the SEPA zone from Transferwise to Slovenia. p2p exchange of course has tons of advantages. I just wish people would use Gox as the benchmark more for deciding prices. I say Gox because that is widely known. I've always offered the market rate but I usually see other people trying to make a buck selling BTC at a higher rate and not getting their offer matched. Personally I wouldn't be bothered with a few $ here and there for the sake or duking it out over a few cents. Why not match to the guide rate? Use bitbargain if you can get a deal that matches the market. But if you can live with working in the banking system transferwise and bitstamp seems to be a good system for folk in the UK.  omfg... this is what makes me think maybe humanity doesn't deserve bitcoin. Maybe it's we need to generate an elite arms manufacture class , end up with the majority so poor the only option is the army to sort our lives out for us and keep us fighting against each other forever more. Too dumb for school!The point of Bitcoin is to have cash in your control. Having keys stored somewhere not fully in your control... yes that is a bank. And that's the whole thing we're trying to address! Why not just sign up with a mywallet clone? Blockchain.info went to great pains to have the wallet local in the browser to avoid this. There is multisig now. That means we can do things with a third party. A good way to have some extra security but don't take it lightly. Can that be used such that funds at an address be moved to a predefined address only? I would prefer to keep a portable card limited to spending funds and have the ability to top it up by SMS or some-such. It's better to be organized.  But it is true that one of the most important things in security is convenience - we can improve here. Would someone like to give an insight into PGP server public key revocation and expirations and whether that's a good or bad idea. The thing is, Bitcoin is cash so you have to treat it as such. Many people in the first world are used to having a company handle their finances... and get the big shock when those companies go bad once every 10-80 years. For some it will take some time to start handling finances themselves once again. I think anyone who doesn't is going to be wiped out pretty quick anyway. I find people who are poor are blocked out of financials anyway and having pennies focuses the mind.

It would be much more portable to have a VPS (or home server or Raspberry Pi) checking your drafts folder every 10 seconds for trigger commands such as **SIGN** or just scanning your inbox for .asc attachments, verifying and then labelling as such.  I tried to do this before but I've lost the code.   Good idea?   I know a lot of Bitcoin users use GPG both for emails on important things and also for #Bitcoin-otc. It would be useful to have a portable interface for this - no more risking carrying around your private key on USB and you can access gmail via 2 factor auth so this would be really handy. You are then only risking your comms with USA big corp and quangos (Google, FBI, NSA) and the private key is still on your server so that should be enough for a lot of people.  So, what would be the tool to start with that can be easily scripted for checking email servers?  I would love to see a script pasted into here eventually. Perhaps the first goal should be checking the inbox for .asc attachments I thought I'd try buying a few coins today but it's as if there are no coins for sale on there because it's not getting fulfilled. How do you tell if that is the case before you place an order? I can see the bid and asks in the order book... so why is nothing happening? I though Bitstamp was big? If it was as thin as a credit card and somehow managed to fit in a camera and eink display for QR codes then yes. If it was bigger I wouldn't carry it with me everywhere but I might have one anyway to keep at home in a safe and as a souvenir.  looked it up for you people, currently £ 9.30 instead of £8.892 at gox or less at bitstamp Found some more.

 I remember being interested in the Internet in the early days. I remember being told stories from my grandfather who in turn remembers the early days of radio.  Now I look at Bitcoin and I see a similar thing.We've been fortunate that the free internet in particular, as travel before it has catalysed these developments such that we have seen a lot more developments in recent years.  These are interesting projects all involving technology.  - can you think of other things that have come along to change society that aren't electronic?   - what is the language of these groups... is there a pattern? Are there words we see in these things that we don't see elsewhere?I find being in these areas interesting and I tend to gravitate toward them. Never have I had a central role but it's great to say "I was there" later on. For example, what was the hippy movement like when it first started for example? What about steampunk or burning man? And what do you see that is like this with a potential... but small now in those early stages? haha, yes sorry about that! I prepared this post before I actually noticed yours! open for a free sample anytime ;-)  Just wondering if anyone used to do this before getting blocked by the bookies. Maybe you still have a subscription to a surebet service. I'd like to snap up all the free offers, but I don't want to spend time wading through spreadsheets and so on or risk money on services informing of surebets.  If you can advise me or help me with access to subscription service at a sensible rate send me a PM with an email address and how your fees.Commission only technical analysis services sometimes charge 15% of profits so that could be a suggestion as to what you want to charge minus freebies.  -j Technical analysis from Bitcoinbullbear predicts gold,silver,palladium as down for 2013. I would expect a vested interest there. However I do value the forecasts that have been made there. They have been the best source for Bitcoin forecasts so far. Given this view, it would seem like a good idea to move savings from precious metals into Bitcoin. But I'm still not that bullish. I prefer to use Bitcoin as a utility with a small amount saved by just in case, and instead have savings in precious metals. But what can one invest in if those main markets are all predicted as down? I don't want to make a lot of money this way - I just want to avoid taking more than minor losses. I have some alternative ideas for investment but they seem so much more risky than holding gold (for example). What to do...?At this point I would say if you own property, invest in things like solar panels, methane generation, micro farming. But I'm mobile... Perhaps there's a way to invest in online assets that isn't centralized? Smpake, the forwarding service to improve MtGox deposits have decided to shut down just in case until clearer. No alternative implementation AFAIK This is a shame. I expected to hear of some scams but not as many as this. Mirrored to .onion or other hidden service it could be a very useful thing to have to maintain trading should restrictions bite and easier than #OTC Thanks for the help folks. I was thinking,  maybe it should be easier to password and backup the wallet. I know that's really an aspect that should be handled by the O/S but it would encourage backing up this way. I really like the way blockchain.info emails a passworded backup after every transaction. Could something like that be duplicated? Should something like that be duplicated? I noticed the differential between MtGox and Bitstamp so I transferred coins to Gox, traded to $ and then tried to go back to Bitstamp via Bitinstant. At that point Bitinstant didn't have the float to do it. When they then found some it put the price up. In the end I only lost out for about $4... but as I expected; too good to be true!  Thanks folks. I should have spotted it was v1! Time to upgrade. Big shame I'm on Gentoo though.

Background:There a are lots of projects that use the Amazon API to great effect:http://mashable.com/2007/08/21/amazon-toolbox/ In particular, there is this project which shows deals on your wishlist:http://amazondeals.ca Unfortunately they webscraped instead of API.

Perhaps pledge too? My pledge:  Great to see. For added bonus, make it for an event you would like to happen. You're basically creating a sigal, something from magick. Perhaps it will come true?! ;-) Send coins to an offline savings address - brainwallet or similar in a safe. But for miners, I think they have to have the blockchain locally for mining, no?I still think it's a problem though. That blockchain is the distributed part of bitcoin. It needs to be distributed. Light clients are fine and dandy but without the blockchain, to take the RMS attitude, it's not really Bitcoin. The hardware argument is partially valid but not complete because while capacities are expanding connectivity is a different story. There's been talk on this, especially in mobile internet like 3G in countries like the USA and the UK. Less so for mainland Europe and Asian countries like Korea. Also, it's just good to be able to run bitcoin truly on many devices. So I'm looking forward to Bitcoin 0.8 addressing this problem.  Doesn't seem to be a Elliot Wave tool like on Sharpcharts.

Do you need my <African accent>banking details??</African accent> OK folks. So...  look at what extensions and addons you have installed...  potentially any of those extensions have access to your wallet. Thanks for the proof of concept. I hope it can be improved. This has already been a worry of mine. Chrome extensions especially are very low hanging fruit for a carte-blanche rouge code in the same way phone apps are. As a minimum I will be watching what I install more, going only for open source extensions methinks. Though this is no real protection it's the most practical I can think of for now.

Alternatively,  would it be possible to make a website interface to #bitcoin-otc with the database distributed? Just something to point and click to generate your keys and identity for a start.  Such as thing could be easily moved to a tor hidden service. I say tor because that would go nicely for Silkroad users. I used to be anti gun but now I can see advantage in the Swiss approach of everyone having to own a gun by law. 20 dead kids seem worth it for the ability to defend the country from the various powers that be.  As much as I love this project I think the hassle of running i2p in addition to needing critical mass has killed it somehow?Perhaps a fully web interface to #bitcoin-otc would be more successful? - this could then be moved to a eepsite / hidden service / distribute the rep database.   Back in the day we'd dial up BBS systems. Very decentralised and very direct. Later on, I remember connecting direct onto the UK backbone via Janet before that become heavily policed.  These days, what is the most direct, or indirect connection you've used?  An example:-> WiFi -> Corporate network -> Corporate proxy -> remote ISP where the Corporate proxy server is ->  (I think there is another level here) -> BT UK Backbone -> USA -> USA ISP for Colocated servers -> YourWallet.comhmm... ->Code:$ traceroute yahoo.comtraceroute to yahoo.com (98.138.253.109), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1  * * * 2  * * * 3  * * * 4  * * * 5  * * * 6  * * * 7  * * * 8  * * * 9  * * *10  * * *11  * * *12  * * *13  * * *14  * * *15  * * *16  * * *17  * * *18  * * *19  * * *20  * * *21  * * *22  * * *23  * * *24  * * *25  * * *26  * * *27  * * *28  * * *29  * * *30  * * *How does this compare to your VPN? How does this compare to servers close to stock markets? Which exchange automatically converts on fiat reciept? I have a VPS, repeat: I have a VPS. Just no way or changing the port to an unfirewalled port since I cannot access it Do we have any estiated figures that have attempted this?Even just roughly using GDP, population, amount debased using SDR or gold,  to figure out just how much has be taken from the country over a set period such as 5 years? 2.432 trillion USD - UK GDP for 2011Cash printed - Well at first I looked at inflation figures but that's a load of rubbish so better just to look at exchange rates and bear in mind that the thing you're comparing against will fluctuate too. Very roughly £1=2.432 x 5 years = 12.16 trillion, 5 yearsAssuming gold isn't a bubble and is roughly stable over time including now we have a 155% change so £1 five years ago is now worth £0.5512.16 / 0.55 or about 2 = is about 6 trillion in gold terms. Next question, where exactly does this cash go? We know it goes to the banks but can I'd like to know it more exactlyThis can make a nice flowchart infographic I have a VPS but can't port 22 & 8080 is firewalled from here. I don't know of a way to setup a VPS with ssh running on port 443 (which I suspect is not firewalled) without access to port 22 first. The lower level serial access some VPS providers provide I found don't run through their servers. I have a few domains and I've had it running before but I couldn't get it working again for some reason before I lost open connectivity. Also, it's really nice to have someone do the whole thing for you.  Can anyone think of a process in nature that is regular with time but somehow predictable to achieve something like this? It's a pain for me to setup.Could someone set me up a new server for http://code.kryo.se/iodine/I only need connectivity, no shell. Suggested price similar to a cheap shell. Really not expecting to use much bandwidth, browsing, a little youtube maybe. Suggest a price per month in one off amounts.   A very simple example. - small company, 3 directors around the world. They can't decide whether to send the balance of their shared account to one investment scheme or another (both have Bitcoin addresses) so we call a vote How can we use Bitcoin or Namecoin's accounting system to help the board vote and how far can we go with this?  My gut feeling is that this process can actually be scaled up into complex operations with algorithms or (less ideal) - addresses with trusted parties that carry out predefined operations. This way, a kind of programming language can be built up.  Voting could be carried out directly with Bitcoins where the largest balance wins the vote.  Or voting could be carried out in combination with namecoin's accounting system.  Yes, you could link this in with contracts but really I'm interested in this as a direct accounting and direct democratic system with no 3rd party trust involvement (such as a legal system). I can't get my head around how this would work in practise but my gut feeling is that it's possible right now... I just don't have the intelligence to figure it out even conceptually. Is it possible?  Sounds like a thread or wiki entry summerising and ranking the various banks is needed. While there is a lot to cover if we can identify the least worst that will be very useful. The SEPA zone is at least a good example of competition. UK:Last seen Intersango with Metrobank following dumping Lloyds.   What would be required in order to have an exchange that holds no balance of it's own, or vastly minimizes the balance it holds? - so you send your fiat or BTC and it gets converted as soon as it arrives for example- or you pledge an trade, script something to autosend from a balance on your own computer but can still back out if you wish to cancel the process- or simply automated payout to a preapproved or locked address/account Problems I can foresee include:- slow fiat system transfers- slow bitcoin system transfer (confirmations) But it could be a good setup for people who want the cash on the exchange for as little as possible.  I still think exchanges are an accident waiting to happen or of course, have happened. Any funds you have involved with an exchange is as bad as a bank.. maybe even worse - completely against bitcoin. Any dealing with an exchange is against bitcoin.  Q: How many BTCs are held at exchanges? It could be argued that this is not Bitcoin. This is anecdotal. Chatting to a small sample of maybe 10-20 Brazilians, all have been blaze' - "It's a big place". It's taken for granted because it's home. I try to communicate that our Europe was covered in forest too - that was big too and now we have very little. Basically none indigenous, this is the last place left and we can see it happening on Google Maps at the most zoomed out level. Many Brazilians I've met though have appeared kind but also with an undercurrent of arrogance and selfishness or snobbery even I find hard to swallow - perhaps this is the difference between a less class enforced society and not so lucky. Online gamers I've only met cheating. Guess it's culture.  Nice to see a thread mentioning Metatrader4. I'm holding out for signals on LR vs BTC or other directly held currencies. Brokers can go bust. Still, fun to play with I'd imagine My 2btc - there are SWIFT payment services for £8 that you can send a FPS transfer to and they will pass on to MTGoxIn short: Transferwise seems best.

Of course law doesn't always make sense but we shall see in time. Just to clarify this. Technically the UK is in the SEPA zone. It's just a case of ripoff Britain and maybe cronies thinking they are different from "The Europeans" (you are Europeans you idiots!) Since intersango went down as long as you have cheap SEPA facility with your bank it's a good option for people in the UK.Unlike Gox I found they handled an ID / lost password request really well and personal. Recommended so faredit: Try transferwise for a £1 transfer to Bitstamp from the UK. The best option in the UK now I think. on linux:Code:[2012-12-13 11:23:55] 2 miner threads started[2012-12-13 11:23:56] Permission error[2012-12-13 11:23:56] Miner stoppedso somehow I would have to give the java plugin extra permissions?Same with chromium and firefox  All of the heavy lifting can already be provided through various means.

Nice to see :-)If only I had the cash required to make fiat trades worthwhile Talk to gold shops? I need this. What is the syntax for adding proxy to ~/.electrum/electrum.dat ? SilkRoad, BlackMarket and credit card fraud sites.Look at what they do and learn.In many countries breaking the law is a matter of survival or has grown into the culture - by this I mean in varying amounts. Visiting somewhere poor in South America could be useful research. Does any of us have any books on life for pirates in Somalia or opium growers in Afghanistan for example. Are you into criminology too? Perhaps there's a way one can buy access to a bridge and help fund the project in the process? Simply isn't supported, no? We need a new way to buy BTC cheaply with GBP now. Best appears to be SEPA transfer to Europe for ~£8 fee typically, but some banks charge £30 or only support Euro CHAPS Ah, thanks. No wonder I couldn't see that's what was happening - I never would have believed it! More mad security from the bigger financial world. Could be a new good way for many people to transact BTC but it's a real shame the login details goes trough sofort and I think I'd like to know a bit more about it. I think if I was to use it I would use an account with a limited budget just in case. I'm sure there is probably a clause in my banking terms and conditions whereby if I needed to claim lost funds they would ask "Have you shared your login details with anyone?" In fact, I remember seeing this once when I had my card cloned. Most people might say no to that not relising that sofort counts and I doubt the bank would notice sofort and use that to not pay out... but is it worth the risk?  How does this thing work?AFAIK in the UK it looks they make a Direct Debit deposit (or debit?) on the account which you have to wait for in order to verify that it's your account. Perhaps that takes a few days to come through. sofort demo page:https://www.sofort.com/payment/payment/go/transaction_summaryBlockchain explanation page:https://blockchain.info/wallet/deposit-bank-transfer The problem with the question is that there are so many scenarios. You could have a scenario like Syria, Iran or Libya, or you could have something bigger. In the case of the middle east blackouts it's probably as simple as buy a sat phone and hope it doesn't get jammed, or put a ham radio on the back of a truck and hope you don't get huff-duff located. Or carrier pigeon?  Don't need much bandwidth for an offline transaction, even encrypted with PGP.However, I've found that things rarely work out how you expect. First of all blackouts are usually unexpected. Syrian rebels were lucky and saw it coming. Still, you usually find you're missing someone's PGP key or your copy of Skype is out of date or whatever. Or the radio doesn't work because there power supply is too bad etc etc. So you could pass offline transactions to someone who has connectivity to the blockchain. But I'd like to think that Bitcoin could somehow carry on without the internet, per sec. People passing round the blockchain offline and doing offline transactions, something like a digital huwala, but the connectivity needed is so high it doesn't seem at all feasible. How's about a series of bunkers with the blockchain passively updated over radio (receive only)? Or a copy downloadable via tor?All this I think though isn't a big deal. I think a much bigger threat would be the USA outlawing/confiscating, shutting it down as much as possible, then 51% other attacks all at the same time Stunning. There must surely be a lot more than can be done with this. How can we visualise the data, how was it done? Is there anything else similar to this correlating to geography for example? I like a bit of privacy because I don't trust other people with the information. For example, when Facebook showed gay adverts and my homophobic boss started me different. Also the jealous girlfriend of course. Privacy is power like any other. Depends. I think for the most part it's morals keeping law and order together. Fear of getting caught just seals the deal. Both of these things aren't completely removed if you're invisible.  Oh dear. After this I switched to Bitstamp using my online handle name and setup Google Authenticator. I then had my phone stolen last week. They are now asking for ID to disable the Google Auth, which of course I don't have since the name I signed up with doesn't exist... it's not a small balance and it's in dollars, not BTC.   I just went to buy VPN access online. Had to wait 15mins. This is a big problem. A deal breaker I think. Where can I find more info on ideas on speeding this up?  I know we had the idea of green addresses and also this was part of the push with litecoin. What other discussion has there been? Or rather, what would you search for on the forum to find more info?  Also, what is the relationship of the transaction fee to speed? I mean... how much do we add and what can we expect back? https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees#Rules_for_calculating_minimum_fees I never got this working... Just a WoT running on Tor, I2P, freenet, or just some p2p network would be something... I've been trying to do this now for ages and just keep getting blocked on the risk API. I login every few months trying. Tried rock and virvox, both blocked. grr...  I think OpenVPN might be blocked by deep packet inspection. Still, I'll try it anyway with the Beaglebone & Angstrom.  Ah, here's a problem I found today. My 3G internet provider has ran out of IPv4 addresses so I'm behind NAT there. Combined with port forwarding to the Beaglebone I then have the double NAT problem.  I guess a DMZ wouldn't fix this as DMZ is still NAT. The router the Beaglebone is behind is a BT Voyager; pretty basic but I think it can do bridging... just not sure I want to expose the internal net that way. paraipan: Thanks for the obfsproxy link! I will set that up on the Beaglebone  Never say die!These are the things I've tried:1) Connecting to a SSTP server. SSTP is allowed through the firewall on port 443 but although it worked on another machine there is some sort of strange certificate problem on the one I was hoping to use. I think an old cert I installed is confusing it but I don't have the rights to delete it. I'd have to pay for a SSTP server since I don't have access to a Windows server. I only have ssh accounts and a Beaglebone at home. 2) ssh tunnel to ports 8080,443 or whatever. All seem to be blocked. Must be deep packet inspection. 3) OpenVPN. PPTP. Both blocked by Sonicwall deep packet inspection. 4) VNC. I think this might be allowed outgoing since VNC is installed on the machine but the connection is too slow for it (satellite). 5) Just asking admin... hmm... no. We have 2 machines for the boat and that should be enough for all 40 of us I expect would be the response. Once I ask I'd be under the microscope. So I have to keep sharing those 2 machines for checking private email that is blocked on my workstation. 6) DNS tunneling. It worked on my personal machine (thanks forum members) but requires admin rights to have that tun0 device. 7) https based website tunnels like ninjacloak. I haven't found on that isn't blocked. I don't know how to setup my own. I could plug another machine in but I prefer not to introduce a dirty machine to the network long term. I have a clean linux install I could use but only temporarily. I don't want to be seen doing this. I could also plug in an access point but again I'd rather not if possible.  One thing I could do is put a WiFi access point to allow use to more than 2 computers. The only thing then is that everyone would be on it and with no bandwidth management (CBQ/HTB/Prio) would put the connection to a crawl. 9) Satellite internet. Too slow with an omnidirectional antenna. 10) USB carrier pigeon. Can't get it through customs (upload only: they only return home!)It's not a major problem. But I feel annoyed to be defeated by filtering. We've sometimes got 2 weeks of sitting around on a boat with very little to do transiting somewhere and only 2 computers for the whole boat. I guess option 8 should be the best bet but I don't want to be defeated by it, it's a challenge, you know? There's got to be a way. I wondered about having a (passworded to avoid overuse) personal webserver running at home that reads and redisplays the URL you want a it's own https address. I can't code that myself though unfortunately, as useful as that would be.  Puppet: Any idea why the Chinese phones have such poor battery life?I searched for a long while to find a decent replacement battery for my phones: Galaxy,Droid,w850i,e71 etc.What I found is that:- generally the batteries are lithium-ion anyway now do less need to worry about getting one of those- there are so many fakes ordering from anywhere but directly from the manufacturer is risky. Certainly with common battery types. Got stung for a Nokia BP E71 battery from a shop this way. The only way I was able to tell was that it was marked as Li-ion rather than li-poly- all those "gold business batteries" aren't a good bet. Some of them can be ok but it's a minefield trying to find the ok ones. The capacity statements stating better performance than standard batteries in the same size are lies; you can't get more capacity in the same weight so weigh them. i.e. The 1700mah Mugen for the Galaxy replacing the 1600mah is a little bigger and bends the back slightly- mugen and there's another premium battery maker that does good ones but they tend to be so expensive an official one would be a better bet- there is one decent make I've found on dinodirect which I forget the name of. They sound japanese. The price is way better than mugen but they clearly put a lot of effort into producing something more classy than other battery makers. So now I wonder,  perhaps we can get a better battery replacement for the Chinese clone phones? Or fit a bigger battery? Or is there something else causing the poor battery life. Any ideas what that could be? I'm looking for a phone with a smaller screen but same size battery and thus a longer battery life. I currently have a Galaxy S, which is fine but the GPS has died and so a replacement might be a good idea.edit:XDA Thread for anyone interested in reading more about the Chinese clones:http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=33092969#post33092969   I've been investigating a ponzi scheme that was run through ordinary bank accounts. One thing that surprised us was how the various banks they used didn't investigate the large payments coming in&out of the perpetrators accounts. Further, the FSA failed to act for a long time.  Compare this to Intersango. They've gone through a ton of banks, each time the bank investigating for fraud or money laundering and each time the bank isn't allow to even tell the customer why things aren't working properly.  What can we conclude? If you have a minimum transaction of £1000 and less than 2 payments per month from the same depositor you'd be acting in the same way as this guy was and there might be less problems.  I don't know the frequency of transactions and size of deposits for the various exchanges but I expect there are plenty of people doing £50 at a time and then adding a bit more as they feel confidence. That might be the sort of thing that triggers the automatic fraud detectors.  The other thing about the Ponzi was that being a Ponzi people tended to pay in but not take their money out. That also could be another factor in difference between the way that I have seen fraud detection work. Some people did take cash out from time to time but that volume would have been lower.   on a more serious note,is there some (free?) software out there to aide setting up pay for view or call services?
Also, mathematics (someone give some details?), geometrics & patterns,probiotic medicine (still not in use today actually), different attitudes to trade and economics than the jewish & christian environment before - anyone give more info? Ah thanks buddy! I'm just searching for the equivilent of popular geek websites in Spanish so I can practice my Spanish. Sites like Lifehacker, Instructables and Slashdot.org I was kind of hoping there might be some sites out that as as big and popular but just in Spanish? I thought the A2A goldgram payments between accounts was withdrawn? Some people were wanting to trade Goldmoney GG for Bitcoin but it got withdrawn I thought? I think Turk is right in saying that Bitcoin is less tangible than gold only because:1) gold has a few uses other than currency, no matter how small(but then... you might say Bitcoin has other uses by proxy - by not mining you can use CPU for something else)2) gold is easier to visualise. The Cassius coins change that a little but not by much. Then again... what is gold if people aren't testing it properly?  However, I think Bitcoin is more tangible than Goldmoney.com - I think the private key makes it more tangible than the legal system making Goldmoney... possibly unless you have visited the vaults and meet the big minimum requirements for allocated bars.  Bitcoin's tangibility is complicated. On the one hand you have a lot of real people backing the blockchain and believing in AES256... on the other it can't really be touched can it? Sounds like what your missing is the connection between justice and due process, something we don't get when a police officer acts as judge and jury and lets the dog maul the person we are chasing - which at that point we may not have known why we are chasing them. It takes a lot of self control not to run. To disable a dog pull the front legs outwards ripping the heart. To disable a police officer you'll need cash and connections. Real criminals wear stab jackets and carry guns. Were you able to find out who the dog handlers superior was? Keep going at it and make them regret. You don't need to listen to us for approval. Perhaps the Police officer wants you to join one of these to jutify their job on such a quiet country:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangs_in_New_Zealandedit: Change of heart. Police Officers should have a bit of scope to unleash a bit of beating. But it's like beating a child; you want to aim for the minimum amount i.e. batten not dog Please let us know here if the cheaper 115 boxes become available again BTW, ideas to help improve an already good site if you want something to do ;-)1) 2 factor auth, i.e. Google Authenticator or Perfect Paper Passwords2) Ability to show ebay results side by side without having to visit that site thus we can make this our default site3) Some kind of API to enable others to achieve the above ^4) PGP key ID for those who want to transfer their ID from somewhere else 5) In the API, something to enable automatic digital delivery, perhaps an email with payment notification and a key (to avoid spoof attacks), or something more slick like the ability to actually host the thing being sold and automatically sending it.

Selling at spot the day after I bought it. just use someone else's details... id like to know more on how people typically find out about  bitcoin and how they then begin to use it. for me I think iI read about it from another alternative currency program, I think that was ripple. I was very confused at first, and didn't know what was happening. Had the usual port forwarding problem and didn't even know what the block chain was. my balance was zero so at that point iI almost lost interest. I remember just quitting the program. that was in the days of sub 10 cent rates. at that point iI didn't even know there was an exchange! aA few months later I heard about it again when the price doubled to something still less than a dollar so iI decided to buy a small amount as it might be useful for paying for an ssh account. I only wanted to buy that one thing- no speculation. I gave up on mining after about a day. I suspect a similar process happens now. People probably go straight to bitcoin.org download the client and go from there. I think the client there should have links to help people along such as where to exchange, p2p pool and block chain less versions along with why it's worth the wait to get the block chain. If someone is introduced in person to bitcoin the process is pro ably going to be a lot smoother but at the moment it's probably mostly from online. cli cidently iI asked at Brighton maker faire for bitcoin addresses and of the ~8 people iI asked none of them had heard of it. It would have Ben useful as iI ran out of cash. These are all intelligent people, I should have donated a few coins to show it off I'll take half for 50. Bit risky.... I think even if he snuffs it he gonna be up there with Lennon & JFK now. Yes, really!Worth it tho, hmm...  There's a few people looking at Bitcoin as a survivalists currency, well a small hedge in disaster scenarios along with more normal stuff. Of course it depends on the scenario.  How useful is a Bitcoin to an Iranian really? Now bear in mind how Gaddafi got on and he had a ton of Gold and Oil, both considered currencies. The difference with Bitcoin is just that the tech to track it is difference. Gold and Oil are just tracked in different ways... I'm not sure which is better or worse for different situations. Offline transactions are however, only offline...If cash goes out the window in states of war what replaces it? I read a story of a guy entrenched in a city in Czechoslovakia for a year. He recounted that gold was used but it was worth much much less than all the goldbugs might expect. Lighters and cigarettes were worth much much more. Gold simply wasn't really currency as the situation was so desperate. The key thing you need for gold and Bitcoin to work are some international trade. If you're completely cut off like you get in war (i.e. Iran now), then you can't get the other side of the transaction so that's the key.  I didn't want to get too offtopic but I guess it comes with the territory. How linked is iPhone to the typical Bitcoin user anyway? How likely does a Bitcoin trader have an iPhone?I've always thought perhaps Apple isn't well suited to the kind of user that uses Bitcoin anyway but am I making an assumption here? iOS to me makes me think more of ease of use. Android is much better now but I still have that association of iOS as easy and reliable and Android as more potential but takes work to get to a good state. For example, I use a Galaxy S1. I paid just £90 and probably available cheaper yet it runs JellyBean and that took work to do. I don't feel the need to get an iPhone. The difference here is that I am able to cheat the system this way, that's the whole reason I have the phone. I get the impression of more control on Android. Is that impression well informed though? On my Droid I have a permissions app and a iptables based firewall app. I also have all the hacker based resources to choose from but of course choosing a ROM is a part of it I which was more straightforward. Because of all ^ this I tend to think that iOS keeps all the permissions stuff silent instead, especially after hearing about the location logging thing and previously pulling Bitcoin apps from the store. So I tend to think that iOS just paints over all the problems, but is this assumption well founded? One thing I like about iPhone is the consistency but one thing I like about some android devices is the custom ROM hacking that allows a LOT more milage for the money such that I tend to think an Android device is more future proof than an iPhone but is that an assumption too in that an iPhone is more uniform so more supported in the future (look at iPhone3 android ports as an example). Bitcoin users in the Apple vs Google faceoff I think might be interested in the following questions which I've never seen addressed sufficiently in any comparison (good example: http://gizmodo.com/5921789/android-jelly-bean-vs-ios-6-vs-windows-phone-8-the-ultimate-ultimate-comparison ) review which are:- which is more future proof (Android for hackability or iPhone for consistency?)- which has the better security model now we have JellyBean?There must be a poll here somewhere asking people about what phone they have? Perhaps I should start one if we can't find one ah... it doesn't seem to work... Great idea! Would love to see other APIs support too and some fees to increase confidence to the point that it's more reliable or convienient than using a VPS.  So just to confirm, Mt.Gox only needs ID for withdrawing. If you are autotrading you don't need ID until you come to withdraw:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=86224.0;alland you can get around that by withdrawing <200BTC/day. So is ID needed for deposits too? My worry is that this should work but then all of a sudden we get a request for ID anyway.   Which exchanges have automation/API but don't require ID for bitcoin withdrawals? ID required for fiat withdrawals is ok with me, as long as I can withdraw BTC without too much hassle.   You can use a forex service to do SWIFT transfers for ~£7, losing a little bit more on the exchange rate, but only a little.  Some UK banks might offer SEPA but I don't want to open a new account just for that.  Which exchanges have automation/API but don't require ID for bitcoin withdrawals?  I recommend trays of rice to further help on moisture. Ok, I'm just gauging interest and I have a daytime job so I might be slow to service here, or it might be great and fast. Just to let you know on the disclaimer there. If you have a contract to work out if this is better try using the following rule of thumb:- divide the number of "free" cross network minutes but the price of your monthly calls. Now ask yourself, do you actually use exactly that amount of minutes each month? Now add in the ability to resell the phone they give you and whether you can if it's locked. You should find that this deal is cheaper for everyone. Try me!The suggested bundle is:- simcard. For cheaper UK mobile calls- calling card with access number. For cheaper international calls. But since the calls to the calling card are free you can also use this for cheaper domestic UK calls. - unlocked phone. I've found a nice cheap unlocked blackberry style phone. More durable, less to worry about at a festival or dropping it in an engine bayPrices all decided at point of 6 transactions by Mt.Gox £ rate:- £7 for a £5 calling card for you to test- simcard & £15 credit = £20- £25 for the phone- £5 postageSo in BTC that would be:(thanks btcticker)Using the access number, sample international rates:UK-Aus 2p/10pUK-Bangladesh 2p/3pChina 1p/1.5pIndia 1p/1pNigeria 4p/6pDirect mobile calls are cheaper than contracts too:UK-UK via access number 2p/8pUK-UK mobile without awkward access number 10pUK texts 6pVoicemail 8p/callInternet = <20mb = 20p/day but you can buy "unlimited internet" for 1 month for £10 with minutes free with that(whatever the heck that is... assuming at least 1-2gb I would hope)0800 - free; pretty damn usefulWhile on holiday in Europe is cheap too: - receive call 7p/min- send txt - 8p to UK- receive text - free as usual thank god- roaming data in EU - 69p/mb (sorry. it's actually pretty good for easy access)Need spare unlocked phone to go with it?£25 = Cheap unlocked, Chinese blackberry keyboard style phone, Very basic but has a version of Opera for Facebook and email. Battery lasts longer than the typical Android. No recognised O/S but standard micro usb charging and standard headphone socket and I've used it in Norway no problem. Much more useful to carry around than worrying about your Samsung note getting mugged & scratched at work. Only drawback is GSM 900/1800 only, can you see a gap in coverage:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_frequency_bands#GSM-900.2C_GSM-1800_and_EGSM.2FEGSM-900 I've been travelling on work for years now and this is the setup I'm using. It's taken many years to get to this point and I'm quite chuffed with it. 
The feedback is good. I think it's a fair point. 7% isn't ideal but I think it could be reliable and the best option we have right now?  I'm skeptical of the Bitinstant card. Will it come to pass and will it remain available? I had held out for the ArumXchange card that was similar and it ended up getting closed before I had a chance to even test it. I ended up ~£30 down on that anyway. I figured I don't think I'd want the risk for much less unless I was doing it in a charitable way to help people out.  Mt.Gox GBP spot rate + 7% @ time of transfer for ~6 confirmations. Postage has to be recorded to a UK address.Special delivery is currently £5.90. 2nd class recorded is currently £1.45 but you only have £46 insurance with that.i.e. today £100 = £107 for the fee, £112.90 for the insured postage x 7.1011 Gox rate =  15.7722043064 BTCAlso, I reserve the right to withdraw the offer and reverse in the event of wild rate swings >30%Tesco sell all sorts of things and everyone's got to eat so I hope this is a helpful cashout option now for UK people, especially with Intersango in flux & ID requirements and charges from Gox.  -j Wow, LondonBitcoinExchange sure is expensive. Surely there's something cheaper? I guess Gox is the only option for the UK now and that means both expense and lack of anonimity for the paranoid.There is bitstamp but it involves upto $60 transfer fee... I think asking for ID on 10% of shareholders is not KYC guidelines. Can anyone confirm? Got a reply:No.2 goes beyond a lot of corporate banking requirements and NYC and is probably an error.  I guess to maintain privacy you should be able to incorporate an additional separate company for no.2 but in practice they'd probably just ignore principles. (you can't forge a contract between a company and a natural person, only company to a company such as a sole trader). So requesting things that are associated with the natural person such as a photo is misleading, even if it is a very common mistake to see. So, how do the competition rate for KYC? Are the other exchanges doing it properly?  Alternatively,  how's about an exchange that automatically exchanges BTC to fiat and then pays it out via various (cheap) methods straight away including the UK FPS.  If paypal or Skrill didn't have chargebacks their cards would work well with this. edit: Perhaps there's a way to script/automate this? What are all the cheap methods to withdraw BTC to a card? None of them help with generating a custom image with private keys on etc How does a company prove it's identity? Does this rule out Panamanian companies?   What banks do the various exchanges use and how solvent are they? Some banks in Europe are obviously going to be pretty shaky. I wonder if Gox's accounts in Japan are any better, or whether that is just as exposed since Japan is pretty linked to the west anyway. Seeing as Bitcoin for many is part of an emergency store of wealth ready for problems with the various banking systems, and many are speculating, I thought it an important question.  Great idea. Related sites like this? The problem I've noticed with local currencies is that they usually die out when the good times come back. By the time they are useful again they're nowhere to be found. The biggest ones I've known of are in Switzerland during WWII and Argentina, Buenos Aires province, Quilmes. The Argentine one is going to this day but fallen into disuse.  AFAIK all these local currencies are destined to fail without offering a unique advantage. There has to be something to promote their use for them to go long term. In a crisis that demand is there. But if there is no unique use other than not being the main currency in the area they just get slowly sidelined. Bristol council would have to make the Bristol pound the only method of payment for some kind of bill to get it to persist. Likewise they could offer some of the advantages that Bitcoin does over conventional financials like making it easier for the homeless to register for an account or lower inflation. In Scotland they have a different looking banknote. Does this mean they have the ability to break away if they wish? All of the schemes need to man up and switch to Bitcoin as Bitcoin has the leadership they don't.  http://www.servalproject.org/I don't know about you but I'm noticing we're slowly losing the internet. i2p & tor are greaat but I think really anything piggybacking on current infrastructure is a bit of a loser. Serval is the closest thing I've found to a decentralised network. But it's far from great. The main problem for me is that afaik it doesn't cache messages. I'm surprised there isn't an app out there that can cache and forward bluetooth messages for example. Did I miss something? The subject has been mentioned a few times before:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6477.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41460.20Isn't there anything more basic out there? Something as simple as an app that scans over bluetooth sending, recieving & forwarding messages? I see the problem now. SSTP is Windows only. I wonder if LL2P can run on port 443... I pledge 5BTC for the lobby Could this be the quiet beginning of the end of the golden age of bitcoin through the first establishment of legal precedent? Or is it addressing $USD separately? None of those have SSTP. Clicking though has confirmed it for a few. Also I'm looking for opinions. I tried one VPN provider and they asked for ID even though I'd used a verified Paypal address at that point anyway.  I'm saying why not use PLN instead of GBP. It seems like the stronger currency to me....?  I've found a few VPN's offering SSTP but they all want identity or a traceable payment. I'll give in to this if I have to but I'd prefer Bitcoin and no questions asked.  Any recommendations?  I don't PLN if you're a Brit. Diversification and afaik, no drawbacks because the rate is converted on the fly and no extra costs I guess because people might finally get it
Agreed. Need guide price.  With inflation it can be very tempting.  This is what I recommend. Ride out the spikes and crashes, just ignore and carry on. It should be possible to do if you're in Bitcoin for the more solid reasons such as those in my signature Just seen Brainwallet.org Rather clever. I wonder if that (or a Bitcoin address) could be used for general encryption as well? Can a memorable phrase also be used to store a PGP key?  First, what about the possibility of being able to use a rig for something else like password cracking. Do you get that with ASIC or is that only possible with FPGA?Which boards can also be used for other purposes? I'd love to be able to switch to cracking a WiFi password if I wanted to (or vanitygen).I ended up giving up on waiting an cancelled my Paypal order from BFL because I couldn't budget for the unknown wait time.  I get free electricity in some locations but the latency could be high. Is there a graph of latency to stale shares somewhere? Can you tell us how you get on with this?  At first I thought perhaps I could just:1) buy a BFL single, 2) carry it with me, 3) plug in wherever and 4) connect over anything I can find (3G, WiFi). This would have the advantage that I can carry the miner with me and unlike gold or cash it hopefully looks like a hard drive so hopefully less chance of getting it confiscated and if things change I can settle it down somewhere more permanent. However, 1) the tech is moving so fast and preorders are now the norm I don't fancy speculating that much. 2) Only the BFL single seems portable. 3) Plugging in would also need something like a Raspberry Pi. The location would have to be secure. I don't really have my own place to put things at the moment but I do have plenty of places where I plug in a laptop and I'm allowed to use the electric because in a sense I'm paying for it already. 4) Latency I hear could be a problem... but how much? Places I might plug in include satelite (1300ms) South America (400ms to nearest pool?) and Europe (~30ms). I wonder what the likelihood of stales are. In Europe I'd be paying the most for electric but on satelite & south america I should have access to solar panels and wind power. Is the effect greater with solo mining? Why don't more patient people solo mine? 5) The tech is moving so fast I wonder if it's really worth it...?edit: Also, what's this Jalapeno? Looks like a trade-in? Too cheap? Wallet backup import worked like a charm, thank you :-)I don't feel like I need to worry so much now. I think the wallet backup is plenty good enough. The secret passphrase had me a bit worried to be honest. I thought somehow I might need the 2nd factor in order to use the encrypted backup. I guess the key to unencrypt the backup must be stored on the server, which I didn't expectThanks again -j Somebody made this guy a vid. I can't, net's too slow So... the battery fell out the back of my phone as I was about to change the SD card and I ended up having to wipe everything and do a nandroid restore. As a result I lose my Google Authenticator setting for Blockchain.info MyWalletNow, I used the email backup so I have the .json ready to restore. But how do I do this? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93040.0 mentions this but not with 2 factor auth. I've requested manually recovering but no word back yet.  BitcoinSpinner in particular to me seems very easy to use. I'd let Grandma use that. However... that isn't the client that people tend to hear about. The ease of use needs to be more prominent.

The document on what stateless is, is interesting just found RLWeb Chrome extension:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/piobcnfhopbhgpkglmfclghgjahjhalf/detailsbut how do you configure it?   Very, very true. I wish the keys from Bitcoinary were interchangeable with OTC because then that could act as an aide in setting up OTC. It's the registering with the IRC server that gets me. The drawback with Bitcoinary is that it's centralised. OTC is in less of a sense because your identity goes with the key. If it goes down you just need a backup database to reimplement it. I'd like to see another way of interacting with that rep database than over IRC; something easier. Could do with a website for it In the meantime a workaround for the tech savvy is:1. Base58 decode the string2. replace the first byte with 0x803. Base58 encode the string[/quote]If anyone figured out the Wolframalpha syntax for this please post hereGlad to see I wasn't the only one :-) Bitcoin exchanges have been experiencing harassment from investigations now for years. I remember we had the exact same thing happen a couple of years ago and it kept happening with various banks since then. I think we've gone through LloydsTSB and HSBC and Metrobank now and that's just in the UK. Yet still idiots use banks, get your funds frozen during a silent investigation... and blame the exchange. When that fails the the ego kicks in and you blame the support ticket, because the Intersango guys picked up a wrongun with the Bitcoinica shananagans. Your mistake suckers!If this does teach people the need for decentralised exchange I don't know what does. Metrobank is in a long line of banks that we've gone through. They are touted as a new bank that doesn't shaft people like most banks. For consumer banking they're doing alright on that front. But the fact remains that they are obliged by law to carry out these silent investigations. Lots of transactions that one gets in an exchange triggers exactly that. It looks exactly like laundering.I think there is merit in owning a number of accounts if not only to show that it's the bank rather than the exchange. So tell me, now that you've got burnt, how would you do it differently next time?  It goes without saying but it's good to say it. I think it's less applicable for a company though, or shared assets. Also, perhaps it's a deterrent. If they cut off one finger and you still can't give them what they want, are they going to cut the rest off? What if they know before all this that you don't have access? I agree that it might not be a solution, but, like a burglar alarm, it can be a deterrent.  There a lot of good ideas here but they seem a bit hard work for the average person, especially if you're trying to avoid keyloggers. Truecrypt and deniability is a good step but you might cave under pressure. I'd like to see the ability to use one time paper passwords and Google Authenticator as a second factor. You can already do this at blockchain mywallet. SSSS sounds good. I guess that is 2x better than splitting the key in half between 2+ people?I guess time delay could be done by block discovery. Open-Transactions is intended exactly for this situation afaik. Offline wallets sound great for this problem but they're stuck in set amounts. I guess you could always make a lot of small offline wallets... I wonder if subdivisions are possible mathematically via a third party in the calculation. That is, you could have another p2p system for subdivisions i.e. trading Bitcoin for 2 Litecoin keys in a p2p way...nLockTime sounds interesting. Kinda treads on OpenTransaction's toes a bit but I really didn't know we had that - good news"Imagine that you open an account on a website (eg, a forum or wiki) and wish to establish your trustworthiness with the operators, but you don't have any pre-existing reputation to leverage. One solution is to buy trust by paying the website some money. But if at some point you close your account, you'd probably like that money back"^ why not have this on direct exchange networks? hmm... I guess it's a form of debt though which is exactly what Bitcoin is against... ? I find this a little bit surprising given the rise of commodities. Perhaps inflation in USD isn't biting quite as hard as we think. Farmers in China I've heard have the same problem though in some sense, leading to moves to the city. Is it just economies of scale? Would it be more profitable to just live off the land yourself and save the cash on food? So if not there where is the food of the world being produced for profit?  I just wondered...  is there a Firefox addon out there that can swap DNS requests for IP requests without using the hosts file? I don't have local admin on this machine to alter a hosts file. I tried DeSopa but it didn't seem to make any difference. Firewalls I'm stuck behind are SonicWall and DansGuardian. Even parts of Slashdot are blocked... and it's one of the few things to do all day... We'd all appreciate it if you setup a EUR/GBP exchange. The Intersango code is available to start your own. Give it a go! 
 I wonder if there should be a forum dedicated just to security...I'm sure you're all familiar with How to deter?Idea 1) SteganographyIdea 2) Additional factor: Share the private key between 4 execs. 2 of the group are required to decrypt the code. 4 not 2 in case one of the pair dies. Idea 3) Time based auth. Have a factor that only becomes clear when a certain time happens. Hard to implement in practice? Could it be something such as how light falls on the earth or something stranger? How could this work in practice? Idea 4) p2p auth. Need a peer to peer network agree and get concensus to decrypt the key. Idea 5) Deniable encryption. Like carrying 2 wallets, one low value. Can't see this workingm they might be able to tell you are lying. Idea 6) Do something funny with public key encryption? Idea 7) Just bury half of the key somewhere awkward to get to. In another country perhaps. If you had a yacht and got captured would this deter or would you really want access to that for a bribe? Anything else? How to make these things more workable? Is there a way to give a 3rd party access to a wallet in such a way that they can only pay out to an address you hold? That way you could give grandma/wife half the savings and get an allowance so you can't go gambling.  ebay UK 280931705089 http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=280931705089As far as I know, can do a lot more than the usual NFC / RFID devices.  -j Ok. That's residency. People get these different things confused:- residency = where you "live" - domicile = where you pay tax. Usually but not always the same as where you live- citizenship = generally means your passport. Nationality. Possible to revoke and become "stateless". Examples are usually refugees. Britain has taken away citizenship from plenty of previous colonies too. If you are born you get a birth cert that puts you into the system. It's give and take. You get welfare, school, benefits. You give taxes, freedoms, national service etc. That birth cert has a place and that place locks you to the residency. You are "American" or you are "Libyan". You can actually be born and skip the birth cert. You can also revoke the contract that is your birth cert. But it's a 2 way contract. You have to take the rough with the smooth. Now, what happens if you rock up on a shore of somewhere with no passport etc? Well, I guess it might be best to ask Libyans etc who have done this. Each country has it's own way of determining residency. The residency is usually the first step to the other changes but not always. Domicile is where you pay tax. It can be hard to separate domicile from residency. Lets say I work on a boat that crosses from Africa into Europe. You might cross >5 borders. Each country bills you and your company for tax. You could end up with less than nothing. So we have double taxation treaties for this.  Companies and corporations in particular move their domicile to somewhere cheap because as a company it is easier for them to move. Profits can then be moved to where it's cheap. Also, as a company, governments give you a nicer treatment. In the UK you can claim back your expenses for VAT for example and corporation tax is lower. If an employee or director takes ownership of funds then that is a wage. You have to pay tax on this but those funds are safe from loss if for example the company gets sued. You can also defer profits and pile profits back into the business for more profit. This is the advantage of being a company. There's also massive scope for corruption. Employee proles think this is somehow immoral and turn a business matter into personal matters, thinking that somehow they are not a company. Well, that is NOT our the government and business treat you. Everyone with a birth cert has a company entity. If you can arrange income in a way like a company does, giving yourself a legal entity that you have more control of and you have enough cash to cover the fees you can get the rewards like a company can. That's why I ask where is the cheapest place to incorporate with favorable tax is. The ideal setup is to:- have a company somewhere low tax (pseudo-domicile) - have a second passport in a place that doesn't ask for many duties (citizenship)- live somewhere cheap on tax (resident) but, - live close to somewhere fun and cheap (tourist) How you achieve that depends on where you're coming from. The USA is one of the more difficult places to come from (banking blacklists, visas that aren't visas etc) but it's also the place where these processes have been researched the most with the most help on hand. If you're interested send me a PM saying where you're from, background, income or whatever and I'll have a guess as to what options you might have as to escaping. edit: Most of the time it comes down to economics and commitment: how much can you dedicate to this?   How much extra would you pay for a Galaxy S I,II or III with a ROM & the following security/privacy related enhancements which would never see the light of day from a major manufacturer:1) Outgoing call recording ( http://androidcommunity.com/record-calls-on-your-galaxy-s-20110225/ )2) Permissions management at the ROM level ( forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1774549 )3) Open source ROM except for a binary blob for the modem ( i.e. a bit like www.replicant.us )4) SEAndroid ( http://selinuxproject.org/page/SEAndroid )5) Tor bundled and working6) Possibly a VPN setup already and working7) Maybe some kind of alternative tunneling setup on there8 ) Backtrack5 already on sdcard and ready for testing WPA with Reaver already available9) Something to help get apps from Google Play onto the phone without having to install GApps+ possibly some pirated apps that have been thorougherly tested. I'm finding it too hard to get all those things working in a single ROM. Now I'm looking to pay. I'd pay $300 extra but only if it had all of those features setup for me and from someone reputable.  Sorry, keeping it simple so no other phones please. I'd also ask the same for iPhone but I don't think many of those things are possible on iOS, even rooted.  Which is cheapest? I think Panama is ~$1500/year for the company formation fee. I think that's the only one which gives directors privacy? Any info Bahrain & Malaysia? I find the whole thing rather interesting regardless of the tax subject The tax man should be pleased. BTC has the potential to make cash payments a lot more traceable because of it's dependance on IP for identification. Sure, you could do offline transactions but eventually you need to talk to the blockchain to confirm it. For all this talk that Bitcoin is anonymous... that it may be at the moment but I think as it gets more popular it will become less so. I just don't think it's anonymous.What is the current state of privacy with it now? - look at the various theft threads to see how far the taint has been tracked. edit: And regards mixing services - same attitude can be (will be?) taken as the traditional fiat approach. So Bitcoin I think is more of a problem for the moneyprinters aka the private Bank of England. I think the tax man and the people can be united in support of Bitcoin against this and both can experiences the advantages of it (and disadvantages).  Can anyone tell me:- what fuel does it run on?- is the high mpg with the roof down? If so, that's a record- does it have a windshield under the car to help efficiency?- in general... anything concrete and interestingI've taken an interest in fuel efficiency for a while now but I haven't been able to dig up much info on this Try to understand the dog. Get on all fours, wag your tail and start barking. Then go hunting together in the woods. There boy, she's a pretty one isn't she? muaghhhghgh!  Gaddafi would have been a good candidate. He was attempting it with gold I think if I was going for this I'd prefer to reboot into a dedicated environment. Installing Steam as root would give them carte-blanche to my system otherwise.

The guy I'm to pay seems very friendly and so forth so that's fine.  I lost nearly $150,000 one day. Pretty much everything. Nothing to do with Bitcoin. The guy went to jail but I was never completely sure if we had the whole truth. I took it on the chin. Intersango has been a useful service and Amir has done a lot for me and us. I do think action should go ahead as there is a case for it and it should change attitudes. But I also acknowledge it will be a shame to see the back of Intersango as they've:- taken risks on my behalf by running the exchange in the grey area of is-it-forex (initially for no fee), - developing the exchange software, - working on the Bitcoin code and also - campaigning in person at events like OccupyI'm not defending them. I'm just saying it's a shame. These will be the next in a line of public figures with Bitcoin where the community has turned against. A sample size of 2 is a bit early for a worrying trend but divided we are and so easily. It took a lot more work than this to turn me against the guy who was slated as spending my life savings. For a long time I felt there must have been mitigating circumstances because they were shutdown by an agency with active interests in doing so. I could see a conspiracy theory. To this day I'm not completely sure but I've decided not to break the guys legs even though he's been convicted and done his jail time. The hard thing is it's hard for me to know.  What is suing going to achieve other than finally show people a precedent that this is a serious matter and things are real. That was me saying it in a light fashion to save egos. Perhaps I should be blunt. I could say "Screw you. Get off these guys. Let me carry on using my favorite exchange. Let me continue to receive their contributions to the code base and exchange software. Let me enjoy their work at Occupy. Forgive them and shut the crap up just like I did with my life savings." I feel very qualified to say so because I have gone through the experience and it has changed my entire life. If I hadn't lost that cash I wouldn't be in this damn job, I wouldn't be in the country and I'd be with my girlfriend! But I know burning down the guys house isn't going to change anything. Now, if suing does change things and get people to take security more seriously then do it, you are doing it from a good place. But if you look in your heart and you're doing it for vengeance then I suggest step back because that in my experience usually backfires. If necessarily, find a way to do it right. I've gone out on a limb to say this for you, bear that in mind. edit:There might not be any chillingeffect though. Thoughts? Thanks. I used the backup to restore into Bitcoinspinner and it seemed to work even though I have no WiFi or 3G connectivity. So then I exported the key to the clipboard and wrote that directly into a txt file. I then copied that into the blockchain.info wallet but I get "Unknown key format". I'm using v0.6.0b but I can't upgrade it as I'm heavily firewalled. 
I've had over 35 injections of various kinds because I travel a lot. I had to have them renewed too. Rabies was the worst - 3 shots of bright red liquid straight into the arm! At one point I wanted to get as many extra as I could as I thought it was great. How's about quit fighting over the issue and fix the problem with the preservation by altering the delivery or offering a premium option for those who wish to pay where we can take the shot soon after it is manufactured?I can't track down specific problems to injections but I have experienced problems with using silver on the skin - it created a slight negative charge... which like Mercury fillings only presents a problem if it's persistent and in a place sensitive to it but you certainly won't read about this or get any help from a doctor; it took me years to figure it out! Likewise, some vaccines use heavy metals for preservative some I'm confident that those metals, where ever they end up will be causing a problem inside me somewhere. I don't think the amounts are enough to worry about but then... I'd like to know how much is in a shot so I can compare to my real life experience elsewhere. Still, I can be proud I served society, ready to lay down my health for the greater good, "Viva!"  I've seen a few threads around this but many are old and I didn't want to necrobump them. When you talk about starting a bank many give up before even fully looking into it.  There's actually a lot good pieces of news in the area:1) A full banking license actually can cost as little a ~$2m. If you base out of the right place it's very doable. However, putting banks aside...2) You can pay your £/$/ fiat wage directly into a credit union. You can also pay your bills directly too. 3) A credit union can easily issue debit cards but that's not essentialHow do you think Bitcoin fits into the picture bearing in mind the work going on with the likes of Grassroots Banking movements? I could imagine a Union which:- allows you to adjust how much of your balance you wish to keep capitalised or to invest - and unlike banks it's upfront about it! Fees cover the capitalisation- links with various exchanges seemlessly (goldmoney, various Bitcoin exchanges) - facilitates currency exchange directly between members (like Zopa)- links with other exchanges globally using Bitcoin- issues a Debit card with a QR code on one side but usable in a normal ATM machine! - automatically converts a % of your wages to a credit based currency such as precious metals or Bitcoin, optionally even transfers these funds abroadJust how many of these processes you want in one basket is another matter. Obviously something too useful for capital flight and successful would be persecuted by the banks but, this surely is a business ripe for development!Already this is possible separately but it's clunky - the mean thing is that you just need cheap transfers from Union to the exchange. That's the key, cheap transfers. If you're in the Eurozone then that means SEPA. Also, a credit union can potentially be as bad as a bank. There needs to be a union with strict controls on capitalization or it's just a bank by another name! You could even have limits on what can be deposited. The other problem of course is the fees. If you are keeping a well capitalized balance sheet then you're not investing funds elsewhere to pay for the fees. What are the overheads for running a credit union? I heard it can be <$20,000 to start in the UK, but what about ongoing fees? I would have seen this as a big thing before- people don't see the fees in banks until the funds disappear. However, now is a time when people are waking up to this. The whole thing could be non profit and tax exempt, kick started with crowdsource funding. I think any credit union needs to be careful when associating with Bitcoin. Ideally you'd want to have these things as 3rd party services but aiding automation. Also, I don't like the name "Credit Union". Personally I'm looking for just a bank with reduced involvement in credit and debt that has brought so many countries to their knees! Related thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92665I couldn't find a credit union that is 100% capitalised. I guess it would have to be 99% just to stay within the definition. For now the only 100% capitalised store for fiat other than cash is a bank in the Cook Islands; no cheap transfers.  That suitcase looks like a bomb! I like this stuff but I prefer the low tech deaddrop method of gluing a USB stick into a public place. I'd like to see the Android method done into a single neat application, could work alright when plugged in. Might need a 1m solar charger to keep it decentralised though I want to make my argument really clear so you can all use this if you need to too:I'm not against vaccines but you have to recognize that they are contained in a cocktail of chemicals designed to kill stuff and they will kill you only a little less because you are bigger.  Thanks buddy! Didn't know Blockchain.info had that! I guess the other way would be something in javascript like paper wallet but able to do transactions I made a backup of the private key and it's been given in the format:Code: bsb:(~44 digit private key here)?net=0But this fails when trying to import into online wallets like at Blockchain:Can it be reformatted to work?  I'm stuck with shared internet resources on a boat and I need to pay someone in BTC.Let's say I have a private key worth in excess of the amount I need to pay. What is the most direct way I can do this?  A lightweight client like Electrum is an option for me since I do have the ability to run an executable. However, I don't like trusting machines that can run executables without 2 factor authentication like one time use passwords. In addition, it would be nice to be prepared for the time when running .exe's is not possible. I also don't trust fully online hosted wallets now after MyBitcoin, MtGox and the others.  I think there's a case for being able to store part of a wallet locally, and/or with one time passwords, and part remotely. This can be done with a little customised hacking and the paper based javascript wallet system but it's clunky for this application. The main problem is that even if you prepare a load of private keys on a secure connection you then can't divide those amounts offline or online in a secure way without that trusted computer.  I can't use $bitcoind gethelp as I'm behind a heavily firewalled connection on a heavily restricted machine...  but I'd like to know more about that...  I have a very good friend in a foreign continent who I'd like to help send me BTC. I know how they can purchase BTC locally. However, they have no clue regarding security. They're just not very computer literate and scamming in their country is widespread. What is the best and most direct way for them to hold BTC bought at say, Intersango? Originally I would have recommended the BitcoinSpinner Android client but they have a Blackberry. Last year I might have recommended various websites but now after the problems at various places I don't fancy that.  They would (should) be using it for small amounts but even so I wouldn't want them to mess up and that to effect our friendship after I've recommended the system to them.  I guess what I could do is bypass them holding the Bitcoins altogether and get the place they are purchasing from to send direct to me... but it seems like a cop-out  Debt does allow for more complex human interactions, even to the point of a hive mind greater than the 120 person limit that we have in tribal setups.  If considering humans as machines, capable of perfect double entry accounting, there is no problem. However, there are a so many of cognitive errors that debt is involved in. Addiction & the inability to calculate compound interest are just 2 problems. Are there any here that aren't related:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases ?Putting a readied syringe next to a recovering heroine addicts bed... well they have a choice don't they, but it's not nice, no?  The whole debt thing has it's roots in religion way back from year dot. The other thing I'd say is that having the debt contract open ended is also bad. That is, if you write a contract, the end of term should be clear. With debt as we have today it's a rolling percentage. 2 strikes of bad luck and how do you keep up? Years ago you could take these people as your slaves, or their daughters. Now after a lot of bloodshed (what people don't appreciate), we now have the bankruptcy, insolvency process to stop people killing each other over it. What if the contract was clearer from the start (if X, than Y) so that if it hasn't been paid back in X years then the collateral is taken and the saga is over. Also, debt is the mechanism of war. Looking at many wars we can see an element of it. Germany's debt WWI & WWII, Napoleon, the US civil war, the kings debt in the British civil war, it's everywhere. Today we're on a GDP growth treadmill where we have to work harder and harder to avoid war. Is it really worth it?I would much prefer to get away from morals and argue mechanisms but that just doesn't seem to work. Talking about how it's killing everyone and putting everyone at loggerheads with everyone at least puts us on the same page. "I, as debtor wish to reconcile with my debtee, we are both the victims of the same problem"I'd like to see a lot more talk of psychology, network theory and the history of debt in this thread, talking like engineers solving a problem rather than pontificating labeling arm chair politicians.  Bitcoin addresses the inflation and debt interlinking that fiat has but you can still have HTC denoted loans so it doesn't address the usury problem. Usury has its roots in religious leadership but I'd like to see a more scientific look at debt. When I ask some people they sometimes say 'its just greed'. I don't accept that as a full explanation at all.I believe that debt creates a different acting network and that network flows with natural bias. A business operating in gold and credit is a completely different thing to a business running in fiat and indebted to a bank. The business indebted is not answering to the government, but to the bank. the gov answers to the bank, not the other way round. Religions have all insurrected against this effect in different ways. In Christianity Jesus went bat shit crazy in the money changing house so the Romans gave the death sentence, then we had a terrorist martyr. the network is massive and it can seem like there is no escape. but if you trade your service for btc you've immediately freed yourself from the system and if things collapse around you that can carry on. The whole thing happens again and again throughout history and its been going on since before the Egyptians. why ignore it? why not study it? I don't believe debt creates wealth I. the long term. i believe overall it enables corruption and inefficiency. by creating a network and linking it to herd mentality all you do is create flow from which we can profit or loss by prediction, overall a destructive process. don't be fooled by those who try to direct your attention into certain isolated parts of the flow.  Thanks but I know them all, I just can't decide which as they all seem to be reliant on DNS which is on the kill switch from the US gov.  Thanks. Hopefully if that was to get taken down it would be easy to mirror back to an i2p site. The confirmation link didn't work, I had to add https rather than http Great idea. We need a i2p exchange though as well though. That surely has to be easier to setup and access than DarkExchange?It would also be great if the content of the site was mirrored to a normal site with parts censored, so people can see a preview quickly.  I love Bitmit but it could be more popular if we could search it and ebay at the same time automatically. That way I could make it my default place to go when searching for something to buy. It would be great if it was added to the multi auction search websites. All we need to demonopolise ebay is to have people searching other sites as well.   I have some dollars in cash in the UK I'd like to exchange. I could try getting up to speed at #bitcoin-otc but I wondered if there's anything more resilient?  As far as I can tell Dark Exchange isn't in much use yet and doesn't look very polished yet either to me. I can't see any offers when I search. Does this mean that the i2p backend isn't connecting properly? I wish there was something to let me know if everything is connected or not.  I'd like to know what would happen if finance and politics were fully integrated; if you want to have a say you have to pay for itas for one vote per person - how many votes does a conjoined twin with 1.5 brains and no fingers get? I like the anarcho-communist call to action there in that open source has sprouted something quite big really. there are plenty now against ownership. I wonder though. there has been many against trade and cash in the past too but the problem was that the efficiency in decision making that money allows has led to that being more powerful. look at china. there is a need to address this given that democracy has been turning into a convenient method of debasement  we could do this with bitcoin right now to vote with real cash. the winning vote could effect a change in who is able to spend the cash St the end of the affair. the whole thing could be enforced with crypto. would get complicated pretty fast so let's keep it simple at first. a bunch of people vote by sending btc to address a or b. after x number of blocks the greatest account effects a change, such as a payout to a number of addresses predefined. more info and background knowledge on this ideal of democratic capitalism. remember, voting in traditional democracy requires one vote per 'person' but proving identity not least the natural person is hard and ultimately impossible because in the end we are all one Anyone have experience of this? Also, is there a way to get satellite radio in Europe and south America without a subscription? And can a sat phone be used to get sat radio... for that matter what is the most hackable sat receiver? A net book and gnu radio I suppose? I work at sea, recently on a boat with no communications or radio to the outside world. Thinking of getting a portable sat radio. Surprised there's not more phone to pups available via btc... more privacy than btc for the non technical and vast majority of ignorant users bust banks will sort the men from the boys
This is something ive been looking forward to. Phones are hard to secure - with a mish-mash of closed source programs its hard to keep track of whats going on. In this sense iphone is very failed. Android is failed in this sense a little less but has other problems. In particular i saw an exploit where permissions where broken and also every app has read/write to the sdcard. Even blackberry isnt great especially the newer blackberries. Having a separate device, whether its this or another phone ( i.e replicant android with no binary blob dmodem drivers) is the only pragmatic way to go at the moment. Certainly id buy one, especially if hackable and able to repurpose. Would buy one anyway at that price just for curiosities sake or give out as presents. Would make IOUs for family members a lot more efficient, if those family members need help with tech ewpecially. Once again, comparing to fiat and credit is silly. Bitcoin is CASH. Thats the whole point. You dont carry round your savings in a duffle bag. Here you have to do the same. Having lived in a cash society this is a culture change. When you go out for the day you have to guess how much cash to take with you. Its a bit inconvenient at first but youre so much more in control and you know exactly what you have.  Unlike cash fiat though its yours. Cash societies would understand this better. People used to debit and credit cards wont understabd until they go to pay and cant. Those are the people who need to be given these for christmas and birthdays.  send login details with password to siology.ioatgmail.com40 in BTC I'll have to pay you back becauise we're sailing out and I've only got one bar before complete internet lock down and no way to contact anyone!help please!!DNS is slow so low bandwidth! To me BCSpinner feels more reliable than any other client so I was thinking of using it as my main client. Being on a phone it seems to me like a better place to work with coins than even the desktop. I'm actually saying that I think I prefer this to the official client. The only thing is that this would mean carrying round a wallet.dat unencrypted, which is no good. 2 ways round this I can think of:1) Have a balance of zero on the phone most of the time and when I want to use it, restore a private key from a source that requires a password. This could be somewhere remote, like a ssh server, or things locally encrypted. This would work. Perhaps the process could be intregrated with APG. 2) Encrypt the wallet.dat locally. The only thing is that I can't find a wallet.dat file on the phone. This is a shame because I could automate this with tasker. Should the wallet.dat be stored on the sdcard or is it best on the data partition?or 3) Try to secure the whole phone. Seems like a lot of work... may not even be possible...4) Use app protector apps. Haven't seen a very convincing one so far.  Backup the private key and wallet off the old phone first of all. I had a problem a bit like this when my computer crashed once and it reported 0.00BTC so I thought I'd lost it all. Then some people here helped me recover that wallet.dat and I was able to then wipe all and start again and reinstate that wallet.dat file. Could be a similar thing here.   Do you guys think it's more secure to use this than a XP machine with a load of pirated software installed? I mean, perhaps it's easier to keep an Android phone locked down than it is to keep a laptop secure. - If you use whole disk encryption on Android ICS and a pin code... does that protect the wallet?- where does Bitcoinspinner store the wallet file in case we want to work with it manually? (encrypt it manually or back it up) Just to remind, if you use this be sure to note the private key because many people have a habit of updating to a custom ROM and then wiping everything.  I was thinking of having a phone purely for secure applications with open source stuff only on it. Having this separte sandbox like system of a separate phone could be more secure than trying to keep a whole O/S secure... Note that you can generate QR codes online for easy backup restore too  There's been a few times now where I've been unable to topup my mobile because of some kind of security related problem. Once I was able to trade some BTC for a topup and this got me out of a tight spot so it's a very useful service. Mobile phone companies put a lot of hassle, ID checks and everything into it as a lot of carding goes on there. Cash transactions could make it a lot more straight forward.  if I do a trade with bitcoin there's a lot of effort in the pricing.if I do a trade with gifting it comes more naturally and there's more lee-way. its more what we are used to genetically if not socially.giving is the more efficient transaction but it doesn't scale beyond 120 people. I'd like to live in a small community and trade a limited amount outside with btc, that would be a compromise  I've been fighting this for days now and it's driving me nuts. I can flash a Samsung ROM, root it, get a recovery image working but as soon as I update via a .zip file I get bootloops and I have to start all over again.  $10 for any help toward managing to get a 4.0.4 ROM on there successfully, such as an image I can simply flash straight to the phone instead of all this .zip recovery mode business.  I wonder if a phone shop might be able to help...edit to update without bump:Thanks but those 2 threads didn't seem to mention what I finally found out; that you need to apply the .zip file twice. This isn't documented anywhere for some reason! I'm gonna send some coins to the person on xdaforum who helped me via a private key & email - should convert them hopefully! Would like to see a QR code generated and shown for the payment address, that would be handy Very handy site,  appreciated Cheers,  it's a great piece of software. I think we need to document how to send funds easily from desktop to spinner. For me I copied the address to the Android clipboard and emailed it. Can it be shared via the android sharing thing. This ought to be written down somewhere perhaps. This is probably better than using desktop/laptop webcam as I guess QR code reader aren't common on the desktop.. could be a webbased one I suppose. The other thing I guess is that some websites like BitcoinTorrentz don't generate a QR code for you to pay them with. I wonder the best way to generate a QR code off that. Why do all this? Well, perhaps it's easier to keep a phone secure than a desktop and I kind of like the QR code thing and I love BitcoinSpinner that much!  I love the simplicity. One thing though,  I emailed the private key to myself because at the time I didn't know how to email the QR code. However, if I use that private key to try to generate a QR code it won't restore. I guess the QU backup codes contain more than just the private key. Is there an online wallet that can import a private key? It's a small amount just for testing  Just a warning.  Don't try and use SecondLife as a easy way to get BTC via creditcard and VirWOX. There is a very opaque risk API in place which will block nearly everyone.  In general it will only work if you already play SecondLife regularly or know someone who wants BTC but hasn't traded a lot already.  Anecdotal findings on limits could make the enforcement impossible but would require more established players wanting BTC too stick it on a drop box and mound the drop box, or a similar cloud solution, like box.netwould be good to do this with just the older part of the file. switch to electrum? appreciated. I'm actually a user looking for a command line method to do withdrawal codes,or at least a way to interact with arumxchange. I think the goal here is not to get 100% security, but rather stop someone who just borrows your phone for 5 minutes to steal your money, or give you more time to empty your wallet from a back-up in case you drop your phone.[/quote]Yes exactly that's my goal. I had a phone stolen once with a very weak password on my password vault. I haven't seen any fallout from that and I expect that is due to the thief not being too clever. That said, proper encryption would be great. But of course I just thought I'd go for suggesting hopefully something easy that code might already be out there for. Of course it would need a warning on it along the lines of "This isn't secure protection and is designed for people casually picking up your phone. In the case of having the phone stolen you would need a backup of the wallet file and act quickly"Then again, if someone knows what bitcoin is... perhaps they'd be quick enough to upload the wallet file to a server somewhere anyway right? hmm...For the moment I think I will address this by using just a little petty cash on the app and recharging it from a savings account accessed via a ssh server with:1) Perfect Paper Passwords or2) Google Authenticator installed on a different phone or with backup codes printed. In fact, being able to use either of these 2 factor auth directly on the phone would be great. Hope this helps for anyone interested in Bitcoin phone client security.  First of all thanks, I'll be donating. I think possibly an essential feature might be something to stop someone picking the phone up and emptying your wallet. If anyone would be interested in helping with that here's a code snippet for some swipe code:https://github.com/chriscoyier/Slide-to-UnlockPerhaps the most simple implementation might be a swipe pattern required for sending a payment and if the user forgets the pattern the password can be reset by a 30 hour time delay, hopefully giving the chance to recover coins in the event of a stolen phone.  handy. I got blocked after just 1 transaction Argentina is very interesting for all those places for whom are expecting a crash. What I can't understand is that if one goes to Banco Piano and buys gold and then sells it in just 3 weeks you've likely made a small profit,  I would have though that would be popular but I don't see ques of people there after pay day. Perhaps there's a tax on it.Land is popular but when you come to sell it the inflation makes it look like it's gone up in value when in fact it hasn't.  I wonder if people not exactly refuse to take part in the money machine but try to ignore it as best as possible and enjoy life as best as possible.  People just get on with life with some tenacity, I just don't fully know how. There's a lot people can learn from here. In Europe people complain at 7% inflation but here it's been 25% for years and somehow life goes on. I don't know many economies that could go on and yet this one does.  How can an economy survive at 25% for so long? What I find frightening though is that even after being shafted for so long and so many times there are still people here who have resumed life similar to before the crash, without taking precautions; using banks, accepting a fixed wage rather than establishing a business etc Protectionism vs free market is such a cyclic political thing we just can't seem to escape for hundreds of years.  I still think I don't understand Argentina but after talking to a passionate Peronismo I think I start to finally understand. Basically the idea here is that you can protect against outside market forces with protectionism. By putting a tax on outside imports you can also build a local industry to protect against the outside world. If the UK was dependant on Argentina for food like Tibets allies for China it wouldn't be able to have the Malvinas. People still don't have a massive amount in their bank accounts... it still seems like a cash society. I expect there will be a crash again... but I don't think it will be for a while. Education has all the faults in the system from Europe and America were copied but in addition haven't been updated in the same way. My girlfriend wasn't taught about electronics for example and has no clue regarding how much energy a laptop uses if plugged in, there's no financials taught and so on. Everybody here is into electronics but it's much rarer to meet someone who know's much about computers than it is in the USA. Electronics are much more of a status symbol but there's less addiction/reliance to technology (which is great). Things are changing extremely fast though and it seems like only a few years and there could be an explosion. You can get Android tablets for less than $150 even here with import controls and flicking through a flyer for mobile phones nearly all are assembled here locally so Android phones are also coming down in price. Many things are very expensive here and I have not much idea of where people get the money to buy it all from. Certainly Bitcoin is useful here now for all things digital. For example, paying for webhosting. But if you want to buy anything from abroad you're always wondering will it get across the border.Probably a good idea to write "Que es Bitcoin" on a few bank notes   Let's say you have a group of 10 people. Each person has 1/10 of the private key for an address. They pay their fees for membership the group to that address. Then they vote on what to spend the money on by sharing their part of the private key.A shared address can be used for each issue and the importance of each issue can be communicated by the value of each address associated with an issue. In this basic example I use splitting the key into 10 parts but of course you would use a better method of this using cryptography. The whole system could be polished into some kind of website which displays the results of the system and makes it easier to setup your own voting system. I would expect this to be in the form before, where did I miss it if this is so?Thoughts?
 If I click through:http://blockchain.info/tree/2893660 I can see the LinNode theft.  I can also see IP's.  Has anyone tried to contact the people at these nodes? It's a shame I can't copy and paste the IPs.   Is there anything I can do to to avoid accepting coins that have had contact with thefts in the same way MtGox does? (disgarding that this may be a philosophically flawed idea for the moment)  Is there a summary as to what happened regards the MyBitcoin and Gox thefts as well? Possibly an easier to navigate map or general commentry that is understandable to the layperson. edit, afterthought: There ought to be something that automates the whole process of watching the coins move and looking up IP addresses. This would also make the privacy situation much clearer for all Refined sugar,  because after tasting it, it makes everything taste of nothing, especially broccoli! I think it means there's an error in the PHP that is creating too many nested functions, probably going into a loop and running out of memory.But I've never programmed anything so I'm just guessing. Could be a very handy service. I hope another pay as you go service is available somewhere?  It's a shame, pay as you go one at a time is a good ideaCode:( ! ) Fatal error: Maximum function nesting level of '100' reached, aborting! in D:\mij_www\BDecode.php on line 77Call Stack# Time Memory

payment available,  but Paypal at 10% is a rather expensive surcharge.  Is there anyone accepting card payments via another means? Either a merchant account or Skrill perhaps? I'm sure there is on the DIY route but I don't fancy soldering; a few projects in the past have gone very wrong :p and this time I don't want to risk 100's! Summary of top selling boards:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68379.0 (all paypal or btc afaik) Possibly a little offtopic but I'd imagine that doing this and renting out the machine for gamers when not mining is not worth the hassle without having a full cybercafe big enough for clans because the depreciation on the hardware is so fast you have to charge such a high rate people don't want to pay?I saw a few gaming cafes running things like gta3 in Argentina recently and thought to myself "surely that can't be profitable", but does Bitcoin change that situation? I want to have a process of backing up so smooth that restoration to a new service should be within a few commands... What´s the alternative card processor? http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1SKPM_enAR434AR442&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=carrier+pigeon+drug+mule"carrier pigeon drug mule" google search request Yeah I thought that but it turns out you have to get the game (25mb download plus social stigma , then go to one of the VirWox ATMs in the game and pay the atm to deposit into your VirWox account that can then convert to BTC. I couldn´t do more than 100 lindensollars before getting blocked by risk APISo to confirm, Dwolla works with debit but not credit cards right the bummer is also that you can´t tell what the routing will be and so what the charges will be Invest USD in mining them is another one I think it would be easier to disrupt developmentThis hasn´t happened so I think bitcoin has the nod to continue from the man That's exactly my thoughts too...  but it also seems like such a coincidence that places being invaded are also the only places with a strong culture against fiat&debt How do we determine between a coincidence and some kind of genuine link?  I can't help but wonder why so much violence in the world is centred around muslim countries.  The conventional thought in the west is that it's a violent religion.  However, is it a coinsidance that Islam has 2 clear rules on fiat and debt. First, there's the rules on debt and usury. They're pretty strong and islamic banks are having a hard time trying to bend the rules on this. Then you got gold as a defense against fiat. The basic advise is only to use gold as currency. This has pretty much been bypassed and it's only now that they're trying to get this back in places like malaysia with the dinar.So 2 strong defenses against financial attacks, gold and usury laws. It seems like such a coinsidence to see so much violence around these concepts. And it's not simply the middle east. Argentina had a brief flirt with a muslim president and then coinsidently the usa bombing a weapons factory that was supplying iran. Then again there's the old jews fighting muslims thing we get bored of so quickly and the oil factor. What do you think... who's backing fiat&debt against gold and anti usuary laws  E by gum E's a goodun' E's are good, Ebanezar's good, m.m.move any mountain  I think scammer status is best as a precaution. We can remove once things are sorted. Good luck to all  Peace i'm looking to reassure customers primarily rather than actually fixing the problem properly... Though of course a solution is best. I was thinking. I could setup a separate site that takes an email address and forwards it to another. Is there some server side software written for this and if so what do i search for to find it? In fact, what's the best place to find php scripts etc? We have sites that offer temporary email addresses but is there one that forwards rather than displays on the site...Getting people to sign up is crucial but personally  i often i don't bother because i don't want to be spammed.  i'm looking to reassure customers primarily rather than actually fixing the problem properly...

thanks for the ideas. We have a potential exchange partner now in argentina at 4%.Other options included gold and sending from uruguay($60), both of these cheaper and she'll trust this more. Personally i don't trust the rate that much too.Now the problem is the other end. If i accept a payment i could be taxed at 20%. I can't see a place selling gold for bitcoin in europe. Unverified accounts such as paypal,skrill etc have a tendancy to be closed randomly and aren't fsa covered should the company go bust or make a mistake. Another way could be buying mining equipment but she won't understand that and she'll put it down as one of my madcap ideas. We don't have anywhere to plug it in anyway.  The other one of course is keep the funds here and investing. This could be a good idea But then it's a matter of finding land cheap enough.  Bump...  the reason for this is that the risk API is blocking me as soon as I try to move as little as 100 lindens to Bitcoin.   I want to assure customers that I won't spam them. But how do I do that? Is there a service out there from a very reputable company that will hold my customers email addresses for me and forward my emails for me? Or is there anther way to reassure people?  tell us which country you are fromVisa/mastercard have been antagonistic to bitcoin so often it's a case of using something local Everything I'm reading about Metrobank is fantastic. As a way of supporting them further,  be aware that they offer free cash withdrawals abroad on current accounts. They also support cash deposits at branches with coin machines. In general they're trying to be a normal, honest and simple bank and they seem to be doing well.A shame you need to get to London and be UK resident to use them as far as I know but still great news for all from knock-on market effects. I am still searching for a bank account that protects me from debt risk though.   The Mayan's estimated the date correctlyDer de dum dum this is why i went via paypal. If it doesn't arrive in 3 weeks i'll dispute and order a more dev like board Resident level 2, Business, enterprise or currency trader religion has a lot of corruption from it's power but it's still a useful resourceThere's a lot of misunderstood things in life that could  be attributed to god but can they equally be labelled as natual processes; i.e. Pray to god for something could be law of attraction rather god... Could be.For me, religion and atheism seem to fit side by side peacefully no worries with no dualistic thinking of does god exist etcSit on the fence to stay productive the gpu is Not really needed.

Try to find a woman with some values.... that's a little harder reading about SR the philosopy of the place was originally a protest as well as a moneyspinner. Things 'that do harm' were not allowed. But then i heard talk of weapons on there so i guess you just got to look if you want to knowI expect the weapons are in pieces, surely they'd never get through otherwise devil's avocate:if you have your cash in a german bank i'm afraid you have to lose it. This would cause devastation. but you can't have double standards otherwise people are going to continue putting money in places they don't understand. I called both my banks a couple of months ago to ask how well capitalised they are and they couldn't tell me.My question is, if this domino effect is followed where does the cash exit the euro zone? Cash isn't disappearing; it's moved. There's a creditor somewhere and to identify this might help unify the eeu.  if venezuela is anything like argentina then the black market dollar exchange will be to protect savings from devaluation. Best not to get too offtopic into politics but chavez is on the no.1 hitlist and economic attack must surely be a real threat. But fighting the market seems impossible to me.If i was to fly in with mining equipment what's the likelyhood of getting siezed/taxed/hassle? Also, what's the state of internet censorship over there? What's the penalty forblack market moneychanging? It's interesting to know. I also wonder what the moneychangers do with all thier bolivars once they have them.  Please PM with an email address for future reference :-)Sometimes patients can know more about a condition that doctors.

I think there has to come a point one day when it's not possible for a General Practitioner to keep up to date on everything.  Following up on the conversations on Iran and Bitcoin.  A girlfriend and I are hoping to move together to Europe from Argentina. I'm from Europe. She has savings in a bank account here which is well in excess of what the tax authorities allow her to convert. This is also devaluing at about 25% a year. Typically what people here do to avoid this is:- take cash to a neighbouring country and exchange it there- buy things like property and even cars However, the first is not a good option because there is a limit of $10,000 and also carrying and storing this is a risk too. How do we get this cash out of the country? At first I thought I could sell her something in a different currency outside the country via a webcart checkout and credit card. Add item "Being a great boyfriend for a year" and x5. But the problem with this is that the transaction will be routed through the central bank of Argentina and they convert and reconvert the currency - double conversion costs. This would be in addition to a ~4% Google Checkout fee. The other problem is that the transaction is logged to her account. If I go unverified with Paypal, Moneybookers or Google Checkout then I can have some anonimity but I've heard so many horror stories of unverfied accounts on these services. Is this worry justified? It shouldn't be a problem for someone who isn't intending to visit Argentina. The next one I thought of was just to buy a load of gold here. But then we're coming into Europe with a stash of gold and that looks dodgy as heck. Chile is close, which was where tradehill was based... shame. The second way of spending the cash on something could be an idea but I can't think of many things that are liquid (easy to sell) this way. It's not enough for a house but is enough for a car...Ideas?Regards marrying if you must bring it up... It's a complicated one. Aside from the emotional side of that, for me there's an element of marrying into a country and I don't want be associated with Argentina in that sense as this has knock-on effects. Worldwide taxation is just one example.  interesting. They had a thing like this in argentina. It's just about still going since it moved from a way to survive to less critical. The idea of a local currency is to divide off a section of the economy a little, but we know this is not a water tight thing. This way we hope if the main economy goes tits up then this should continue.Of course the bristol pound being tied to uk pound sterling doesn't seem to make alot of sense to me. The idea of most local currencies is to quartarise the damage from larger economic problems...  It's an interesting insight into people's perceptions once again. Hopefully people will access whether to use the currency and ask questions such as who is the issuing authority. It's a fantasic power play for bristol council... If they are the issuing authority. Shizzle ma nizzle it's the new brizzleYou're in the desert. You meet someone. You buy some water for $100. You think that's a transaction involving just you and them. But actually it also involves:- the currency issuer-everyone who pays, or would pay for water-anyone who is influenced by each of these parties....this tends to effect everyone... And you just wanted a drink. first thoughts:-need something like bitmarket on tor hidden service-how much is the license 'fee' throughout the world? Where is cheapest? How much is chile.-TH was based in chile, but why worry if all legit&regulated?-licensing is easier to be justified but large fees soundike corrupt anticompetition for the industry  $750 is obviously too much: http://indoorsecrets.com/?q=agencypackages There might be a better solution.  Why not use a website solution?- because the girls can see the website and are likely to go direct.  Any tips? okpay is upto $15 a withdrawalaurumxchange is also expensive (I say this as someone from the UK that gets an easy time of charges generally though)this one is still expensive so I wouldn't trust much of a balance on it, and you're right... panama means the company director names don't have to be disclosed... guess we could ask...but then... getting a card these days has become harder work presumably due to those know your customer rules, extended paperworkAll the fees to compare
article doesn't explain china. Just points out that democracy in usa is overruled by money it's already mirrored but it should be available as a one click button option on install too what are the big earners in bitcoin right now?1) the exchanges. Cavat = regulation in most countries 2) silkroad, and i'd guess weed would be most popularWhat else is there? What is the next level down and how much are they earning?   I've been playing with: https://www.bitcoin.de/r/475e9c Note: this is my referral link. I find it notable since it's OTC over the counter with ratings and so forth so as far as I can see it doesn't require regulation since it is simply enabling people and exchange. To get English you have to set it to Spainish first and then to English or login.  Fiat transfer methods:-SEPA-Liberty Reserve-Moneybookers-German bank accounts I did a search but can't seem to get a match for "bitcoin.de" even though I've seen it mentioned in a thread before. Are there similar markets to this other than Bitcoinmarket? Edit: how many of us have managed to keep our identity/banking system unlinked from out bitcoins? That is, i wonder how common it is to not have a link between bank account and bitcoins...  If it wasn't for the 2.50/month fee I'd get one just for emergencies... could be very handy. I wonder how long loading takes... A hidden service in Tor or i2p like www.bitcoin.de would be a big jump forwards Kudos to this slick answer. Easiest is probably to monitor upstream, like on the modem/router if you can't port mirror. In a more simple way you could turn all computers on, disable auto updates etc and reset the data send/receive counters on the modem. Then leave for a day and see what traffic is sent.   Chain game. Rules of the game are,  think of the most ridiculous thing you could imagine buying at something like a car boot sale with Bitcoin. It should be real and something you've seen in real life, but anything online is a good sidetrack too.  Kudos for bizzareness. I'll go first with 1) Rubber Pigeon sorry for offtopic. If i had a home i'd buy loads...don't suppose you know a nice place for reggae nights in the uk including this weekend? i was at a party with a german and a greek. To the german i said 'by joining the eurozone you signed away your soveriegnity. Greece is now part of your country and it's time for them to bring you down'To the greek i said'by joining the eurozone and adopting the uro (2 different things!), you signed away your soveriegnity. To furfil your contract you must now allow germany to bring you down'of course neither will happen. We can see that for both that it's in thier interest to welch on thier agreements. What they're trying to do is syncronise everyone breaking agreements at the same time. But if one country steps out of line it unbalances and besides, so much is at stake it's very hard to coordinate. Germany looks like a conqueror but they're just trying to protect themselves in the same way greece is trying to protect themselves. Politics doesn't make any difference in the world if it's overruled by money. The whole thing shows so clearly this now more than ever. And still people don't get it. The house of cards is falling down; b.but they're... The government! They can do anything! But no, finance overrules this. At least now we can zip past all the crud and straight to the <i>bottom line</i> Hmm... I misunderstood this at first...  inspiring me to think.... You could have hardware doing something useful as proof of work, something useful. Something physical? Can someone help me expand on this idea into something more concrete? Ideally you'd have the proof of work helping in a physical process.  Imagine oil&gas could be synthesised but required a lot of intelligence to compute. Now apply this to quantum and probabilities.  See where I'm going with this? Good because I don't! :p  So it looks like yesterday we had someone dump a load of coins and loads of other people snapping them up. The only volume we had greater than this was the mid Nov crash, and the market isn't phased.Cheers people, we have some very strong stability! A strong market.  Does it tells us that we have a diffuse number of people are supporting a base value of some kind? I bet that next week, Monday the 13th Bitcoin will 'perform' better than gold for 8 hours. (!) Thanks I'll check that out. Didn't realise but with plugging the numbers into a profitability calc even with free electric it still takes a year to get the money back:and when the block reward drops to 25 it then takes over 5 years!This doesn't make sense unless I can find a free source of electric 24/7 and I don't think that's going to happen.   There are times when I have access to free or cheap electric. The thing is, I don't want to cart a tower unit around with me. FPGA makes no sense because that's cheaper on electric anyway.  What's the smallest a mining rig can be? It doesn't need to be efficient on power, quiet or light. But small is good. I have to carry round a laptop anyway. How's about this:http://hackaday.com/2011/10/19/beefing-up-your-laptops-gaming-chops-with-an-external-gpu/How fast a GPU can it take I wonder? My laptop is on the compatible list:http://forum.notebookreview.com/gaming-software-graphics-cards/418851-diy-egpu-experiences.htmlLugging round the PSU would be a pain too.  Found this on ebay but when I look in my PCI express slot it appears it wouldn't fit (confused):http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/PE4H-v2-4a-60cm-Flat-mini-HDMI-EC2C-SPB087-ExpressCard-PCI-E-Adapter-/180808629729?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2a1908bde1#ht_3307wt_905"ExpressCard (54, 34)" in my laptop. Hope this has inspired -jp.s. Sorry if this is a silly thing to say but it should be pointed out that you don't need a client or blockchain for mining with a pool. Took me a while to figure this out as most guides mention downloading a bitcoin client +1 - easier to adapt than get the whole world to change. While they spout controls they benefot and use that cash to buy stuff in safe areasRe the charts - zoom out a few thousand years. But i agree co2 should be curbed too, since i like efficiency anyway reminder:bitcoin isn''t anonymous but can be made soI think there are premium tor nodes right?I thought only the exit nodes are slow right? ... Because they block some access, for example to the clearnet Get Bitmit to show simultaneous results from ebay... even if it's just in a new frame. That way I can use Bitmit when I search ebay but also check whether it's on Bitmit too. (If ebay was to try to block this it would be anticompetitive would it not?) I'd love to see this automated in the official frontend client - select amount, hit print. I don't like the temptation of reusing bills. Reusing instead of tearing up and making a new one really defeats much of the point of Bitcoin doesn't it. Same for holograms really; I prefer those for promotion.  So,  - how many have actually recieved something from the company after ordering? - do we have linux drivers? (couldn't seem to get the link to work on the "drivers" page)
the only way to know for sure is to get everyone.. Or close enough to everyone to withdraw... In fact the % could be worked out from funds paid out. Bitscalper would be shut down by the regulator bodies in the us and uk... When you say foriegn, do you mean either of these countries? If so that's motive to stay anonymous... But if you have a gut feeling he's from somewhere else then that's more wieght to say it's a scam. Will this thread be enough to make a run? .. Probably not, we'll see. I've seen this done with fake hedge funds. The term is not ponzi. You just take deposits and pay out; something you can do because not everyone withdraws at the same time. It's a bit like banks but there's no investing at all or the investing is bad and it's covered up. I'll give a case study on this in a few months. Bear in mind that these traditional scams involve more easily tracable payments and no anonomity. I've seen it before and i'm going to court on it.All withdraw! Let's find out! Will you be last? i don't like to upgrade all the time because i prefer to see it verified by others if possible...  I prefer to keep things as they are if possible. But twice now i've needed to upgrade else have the 'invalid address' message. This worries me a bit... It makes me feel like, what would happen if the dev site was shut down at this point and anyone mentioning it silenced.. Generally hard to find that client download... What could be done? Thankfully we have alternative places to discussWould be nice to give some more info in the client output to say 'don't panic, this client is just newer than yours' agreed - aurum or bitpay... Although i don't like mtgox codes so much and i've never found the cards on the bitpay siteI also wondered, what happens if you write a vcc virtual card to a blank cash card and calculated a pin for it ans wrote this all into the chip... good stuff Opera mobile feedback - can click the select lang to english but goes no further... Not sure if opera mobile even has javascript tho :pWill definately give it a spin when i get the chance on a proper browser tho i think they do like a bank does - keep the deposits, claim it's paying but rely on people not to withdraw so it builds. Let's place bets on when it fails1btc at 1:6 says it still works in 30 days time i don't believe you. Perhaps you think you've never pirated but i think if you've been exposed to the net it's impossinle to avoid. Consider:-accessing unlicensed software online; was that redhat server paid for-licensing; is your chinese phone fully GPL compliant-read the licensed-to box on the company copy of excel? Subcontractor copies too?I'm sure there's many moreVery good tho to be able to say this, it supports the idea that IP makes sense to see that someone has managed it so, i want to get paid in bitcoin. How do i approach the subject?Best case scenario, let's imagine I'm a subcontractor employed by a company i own that gets some of it's work from a work agency. How does one float the idea without getting laughed out the room?I know people who've had choice of EUR, USD & GBP but that's the biggest choice I've seen; it's uaully dollars vs euros.  Perhaps a bank isn't needed. A bank is useful for things like paying bills and recieving a wage that can only be paid that way. If you 've got to have this functionality a building society or credit union can also fill that role. If you don't actually need this then... why not enjoy staying off the radar? The other thing it might be useful for is building an identity, so you can show you are a reliable person with a bank account I suppose. But everything else can be done by other means. A simple one would be a Moneybookers account with a card. Same thing for a million and one other providers. You should define here what things you need in a bank account. Is it something to pay something into? If you want US dollars I believe any account in dollars gets funds routed through the US and thus has more scrutiny. You also probably get a lot of prying from the US anyway in general as well.  Hope this isn't getting too offtopic. Not particularly religious because I find it often corrupt, but I don't throw the baby out with the bathwater because of that. For me religion is humanities wisdom from thousands of years ago. Why throw it out? Analyse it, see if it makes sense and use it. Don't let current trend encourage you to throw it out like the missionaries did with all that other knowledge we had before. Look at the 12th Planet book. I'm not saying I go in for that theory but it was able to exist because our history wasn't completely erased. So every religion's got something to say on money.Here's a starting point on the major ones from a guy who lives without money (I'm not advocating this but I'm open to the idea after reading responses to my thoughts on why surely that can't work if everyone did it): http://sites.google.com/site/livingwithoutmoney/Home/all-the-world-s-religions-agree-on-this-one-thingNo witch, Satanism, pagism and naturalistic style opinion there but Taoism is there. Some of this stuff is being backed up by science now. Got any references for me? One thing common to a lot of the religions is usury. Now this is a thing I had no idea existed until I was like in my 20's! What happened there?? Until the catholic church came down everybody was being advised not to lend money and charge interest... what the heck happened? I find it a bit wierd that I was taught about this in school history, or theology and I notice I've never seen it in churches. On every UK bank note it has "Promise to pay the bearer" well, that is exactly what it says in both Islam and Christianity as a sin. They specifically advise against fiat! And we have it written on every note in the place and we never notice... wtf? Even if you've never met anyone who goes to Church you'd think someone would notice right? I think the problem with charging interest is that it's a compounded calculation - it snowballs. The human mind doesn't calculate that. It also doesn't calculate all the possibilities. Then also there's the addictive drug like effect. Hedge fund megastars will always have a lot to say about psychology... and often it's about using artificial means to enforce disipline... something people didn't have much of years ago. A set fee for a set time seems fairer. Perhaps there should also be a schedule for what happens if you can't pay - what exactly you will and won't lose. Lose your home? Donate a kidney? - if it's written down at the start at least everybody's clear on it. Are the Islamic banks actually doing this though or are the customers actually ignorant to what they're agreeing to?  just trying to get my head around a few comments i've read regarding both gov attacks and also iran:"we're studying the protocol" and "no miners, no currency"Well, the 2nd one there says no currency if no mining but surely the inflation stops at some point anyway? I was under the impression that at that point it's just clients, and then hopefully more secure against mining related attacks. People will still mine because of difficulty changes right. To be honest i thought i understood but now i'm not so sure. Also, having connectivity is important too... I don't understand the details though... I think you just need a minimum of say 4 nodes? These could be manually entered right? And perhaps even transmit the blockchain semi manually... Using rsync even i wonder... If that can do partial files...  Just wondering how secure the network is, getting a better understanding... I wonder how bad routing can get before things get shafted. For example if iran block at the borders could one wifi link over the border in theory sustain a whole country...  Awesome! All we need now is an exchange in Iran and we're building bridges! +1 for mailing the blockchain. I can provide this from a UK address if anyone needs this. How can we provide an md5sum from a third party if the size is constantly changing? The other option is pay for a VPS; it can be very cheap. I'd like to see more blockchain thirdparty hosting  Speculation... is generally one of mankinds enemy. Stablised price fluctuations on the one hand but it's generally known as a major problem in life for everything else from raising food prices to pump and dump. I wouldn't call it an advantage.  I wouldn't call it lucrative but it's worth a punt.  For real advantages see my sig.   In your opinion how much of a gaining market does it need before it offsets the fees? Also, does it reduce losses in a declining market?  Can the DNN bot actually make a profit after allowing for commission on those default values or is it there needing a tweak to the strategy? +1  I can understand why this is a better solution than solo mining psychologically but is there a technical advantage? How many people solo mine? Those people can achieve some good anonymity sending coins to an offline address and then selling the private key.  i had my cc cloned last month so my paypal stopped working. At that point i relised pp is a carte blanche link either to a card or a bank; you can't prepay to protect you funds. So it's debt based and not protecting your details. I'm looking at virtual creditcards to reduce the problem. Interesting. They have to get the balance and timing right. If they go too fast with stuff like this you breed a culture of criminality of avoidance. It's trying to lock people in. We've seen this before. It makes us go "Wow, in a western nation, surely not!". But this is normal in plenty of other countries. In Argentina those who obeyed some of which paid for with thier lives because they couldn't afford medicine. From this there was a natural evolution. It was quite subtle though. Still, when limits on currency exchange came back in people got spooked. I'd expect the same kind of influence to happen here. People don't relise at first but then they try to sell a car and suddenly relise there's a problem. Then a bank somewhere goes bust and someone they know looses money. Then they relise buying a car with cash makes some sense now... so all of a sudden you have law abiding citizens breaking the law just to survive. Then, as in Argentina you find people moving onto black market and avoiding taxes. It would play out differently but that's what we've seen before. +1 on BTC as useful for gov's - deep packet inspection and logging the exchanges potentially means we could all get a bill. But don't be this paranoid or nothing gets done. Some risks are better to take then not take and I think it's worth it In a sense debt is a threat to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is supposed to be free from the debt system. If it's like gold then you have the value in your hand. Fiat is debt based in that someone 'promises to pay the bearer'By lending Bitcoin you are replacing your BTC with a promise to repay. Further, you are probably doing it as % interest, something that is strongly advised against by every religion I can think of, and for good reason: if the person runs off with your money, you might want to track them down and make them pay. That thought of expecting them to pay IS the debt system.  When you lend or borrow Bitcoin you are undermining it and replacing it with a competing system. In many cases it could be the PGP irc WOB system. That then could lead to corruption in that system. This is the kind of thing you were trying to avoid with Bitcoin.  By all means lend to people you love and trust. Invest in business to make an impact in the world. But lending simply for the return without looking at what your money is doing is inadvisable...  Bitcoin fixes some major shortfalls of money but it's no panacea. There are plenty of other problems and debt is a big one

The payments haven't been bounced back.  i've not experience with this but,  Wild guess, sounds like the fans fell off... Or the heatsink, didn't cool it and now it's fried. Suggest selling in goods as faulty as perhaps someone has the same card and wants to take a gamble solding another dead card together  Hope this helps. Ebay dead stuff otherwise, give someone thhe chance to fix something hoes and pornstars with flagship website debut demonstration site!Pimps and fluffy suits! (Filed under offtopic as I can't see a section for Tech&Dev for stuff outside bitcoind)I'm trying to figure out how the exchanges interface with the banks. In: http://gitorious.org/intersango/intersango/blobs/gbp/bank/import_csv_hsbc.pyfrom:http://gitorious.org/intersango/intersango/trees/gbp/bankI can see that a .csv file is imported and then parsed with:http://gitorious.org/intersango/intersango/blobs/gbp/bank/parse_deposits_hsbc.pySo I'm thinking...  does the exchange owner have to export a .csv file every day?  I can't figure out how the LloydsTSB code does it; I'm not a programmer in any shape or form.  And for this matter... is a merchant bank technically essential for an exchange? Perhaps an exchange could receive payments as bank deposits (because non reversible-ish) but payout by another method. Legally a silly thing to do maybe... I don't know, but interesting to know if it's possible. I guess you could even have a one way exchange... assuming taking payments is seen by banks as not suspicious. I'm just thinking about all the hassles the exchanges have had and wondering where those result from. 2 more questions regards exchanges:1) Is it true that all USD wire transfers have to go through USA along with identity info, even if it's miles away from the USA, like Singapore? 2) Is there a way to link exchanges together... or perhaps for a bigger exchange like MtGox to do a large trade of Bitcoins for USD on another exchange for example. Many smaller exchanges have the problem of scale.  we need a meta site that searches many auction sites including ebay to break the monopoly(ebay) and associated monoplolies(paypal) from uk deposit page: "UPDATE JAN 16th The account manager has confirmed that this is a technical glitch and he islooking to get it fixed."  I think this is one of the big threats to Bitcoin. CentralBank (not to be confused with gov) see Bitcoin,  decides if you can't beat them, join them. Starts own blockchain, possibly premines a load...  and tweaks the protocol to thier advantage while... buying up a load of internet connectivity structure.  It's a threat, yeah. Fortunately it seems unlikely.  Then again, perhaps the Gnostic religion was right, there really is an intelligent robot like entity out there that is influencing humanity towards artificial stuff because it's too far to travel here right now. And Bitcoin is it's masterpiece! ***Please be aware, it's not working right now***Definitely with UK deposits. Not sure about the Euro You're not missing much:"An internal server error occurred. Please try again later."  I have used Synalabs, which are good but the price is demoninated in BTC and this has been steadily rising. Kalyhost were also good.  What's your experiences with other providers?https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Dedicated.2FVirtual_Server_Hosting - secure and private enough to trust with Bitcoin spending money - only a bit of bandwidth needed, but can always upscale if needed - yet cheap - not USA if possible (legal crap) -j I'd like to know how people with gold got on during WWII i hope the fees can scale according to btv value and decimal point placing... "UK TransfersUK transfers received on or after the evening of the 9th will be delayed.Transfers made now will bounce back to your account.Jan 12th: We will be meeting with the account manager tomorrow.Withdrawal requests will also be disabled.Jan 13th: delay will be at least until monday"SEPA might be an alternative I lost £100 to them last month (said it was recieved but still haven't credited) and the £500 I sent 3 days ago still hasn't been credited. I suggest steering clear for the moment. edit: They also overpaid me about £900 a few months ago, which I paid back. I greatly appreciate the service but I recommend other methods to trade.  this is basically cuba. Go there! It's amazing. You can preview many of the advantages and disadvantages. A big problem they had was separating the markets. It's basically impossible. Such a solution would need to be as immovable as the bitcoin protocol. It would have to be expressable as a formula. What about taking it the other way?The other way is to aggressively enforce capitalism. That is, to provide no social care in any sense. A bit like living in somalia it would be a warzone unchecked. But here's my philosopy on that: - if capitalism is the only way because it infects everything then when does it fail? A: lack of leadership. Clearly the markets fail in so many ways. They shouldn't. Would the market come up with solutions eventually? Is this why america rules the world and is it any coinideance that a market liberised china is thought to be taking over?There are some things in life we all deserve it seems. The one that gets me is shelter. Every month we pay rent or are linked in some way to something similar. It never used to be like that. This land used to be free to use. Have you ever not needed to pay rent? It's amazing how free we feel. But it's an illusion because rent is more than just rent. For every renter there's an investor. I don't think the answer is 2 separate markets. I think the answer is either to drop capitalism (live in a monestory), Or to address the market. The market is very weak in so many ways. The problem areas that the market gets blamed for are that areas where the market has been barred. For example: 1) doctors pay (qualifications ringfencing)2) politicians (accepting bribes is corruption etc)So i argue that the answer to one might be to have a public record of performance, much more information, easier choice and no monopolies. Patients are free to choose unqualified doctors. The answer to 2 might be simply voting purely with money!Socialism is not the only idea at odds with capitalism. I think the republic might be too? (the justice system) regardless of what you think on early adoption i have spoken to average people and that is the critism they make.  It's a fair critism and it's even acknowledged with the built in inflation in the protocol, is it not?The only answer i can give is that it's a fair critism but exagerated. The advantages of btc outwiegh this.Trying to say 'it will rise more' in all it's forms for me only feeds into ponzi scheme likeness, but this is what gets people most; blinded by greed they argue one thing but as soon as they stand to make some money they sell out on thier values!+1 on pointing out early adopter risks, most people didn't relise they were spending electric on bitcoins else they wouldn't have mined so it was mostly dumb luck... And many had the hardware anyway. A good title for a blog entry: "the million dollar pizza". The point of this thread is to say that the early adoption problem is still there  -bitcoin has solved the centralisation of money but that's all. Speculation and debt (especially compounded) are 2 more of the biggest monsters to humanity and btc doesn't address that. It also doesn't address network clumping. I've said it before and i'll say it again;Bitcoin is a revolution but it's still only money. Those problems of debt, speculation and clumping effect all our lives. I firmly believe that if it wasn't for this we wouldn't need to go to work every day.  Thanks for pointing this out. I am testifying against someone in court for doing just this; they said they were using forex bots when in fact they spent it on a house and horses. It's destroyed families; no one expected it. He's expected to go to jail. He simply built trust by taking and return deposits knowing that most people wouldn't cash in at the same time much like a bank. They appeared to have a track record of 2%/month and were paying out regularly. Like this fund it was advertised that currency was traded via statisical arbitridge (bots) but actually this wasn't happening. What suprised me personally is how someone can do this and fool closer people like family and friends. I know where he lives, where his family lives and i can break thier legs. Plus, when real bot stategies are available for purchase so easily these days why not just do it for real? I think the answer is that he got in too deep, something like that, snowballing. My guess is that he fooled even himself See this video for plans for OpenTransactions to support Bitcoins in what I guess I would call in layman's terms, a decentralised bitcoin bank (via pooled voting):http://vimeo.com/28142096Exciting! :-)Could this be the start of the mythical decentralised exchange?'+1 The £200,000 fee wouldn't surprise me if it includes support of some kind outside a simple drafting of contracts. What does one get for that £200k? If the answer is very little then, seeing as this is Cyprus and everytime I've been there I've been ripped off... perhaps it's about £150k too much from an opportunist. Good luck, we're all behind you.  -j Hang on, where did they get the 2.99 valuation from? 
1) Layman's way: - buy a $70 android tablet off ebay - add a 8gb SD card for the blockchain - use the official bitcoin for android client. Have it connected 24/7 and keep it charged with power - treat it like a cash register; offload funds to an offline address at regular intervals2) Geek way:- Use something like Bitpay on a phone you already have (perhaps simplecoin works for symbian touchscreen?) to connect to a server at home or somewhere.  I prefer the former method. The second method is more portable due to lack of blockchain but then you have to have a server; both are not ideal.  How's about, 3) 3rd Party Way:- use a 3rd party to take payments but have an auto payout to an address you control regularly If we plug the figures from http://cablesaurus.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=10&products_id=56intohttp://bitcoinx.com/profit/index.phpI get a minimum almost 6 year break even for UK prices and that's before the drop to 25 blocks this year (current price $5.7, 0.19elec, power 25w estimate beyond the 20w minimum, 250mhash). After the rate drop the calculator just says >10000, can't get it to work. It's not economic yet but it will probably be the future as the cost comes down.  My head's spinning and it's late. All I'll say instead is that I'd love to see a profitability analysis on this assuming no electricity is being paid for, and then the same thing with electric at a USA rate with a laptop or netbook. where is the rig & can you give me something for trust, thanks I think you're giving too much emphasis on it. It's not that of a big deal since it's not escrowed. In the end this is just a desktop client to do what OTC or bitmarket.eu are already doing.[/quote]Both of those are centralised. Escrow facility is important too though I wonder what's a fair price for Manitou 35g natural blue (no additives) for rolling with papers?And for single packets of Marlboro red x20? (£3?)  1) Swap Kenyan M-Pesa credit for a country you can fund in the USA.  2) Swap that M-Pesa credit with whatever local currency you can use. You might be able to use M-Pesa with roaming, or you might need to get close to the border. You can boost GSM signal coverage.  This is the best I can suggest for now and it's probably not as good as Wahala. Hope this helps.  p.s. I work at sea, don't invest tase me bro  -a this kind of thing is entirely possible as we have a record of transactions... But how far does the link go? If i recieve btc from a guy off silkroad that might not be a faullt of my own...  But gov laundering laws never made sense anyway... It's like cash, but much more of a threat because the network is there for all to see. Btc may solve the inflation problem but that's all. It's actually more useful for governments... Actually much less private don't you think What about other precious metals, how does Gold corrolate to other precious metals? How´s about Islamic nations where the fee for the lending is fixed and more clear while sopa brings a lot of attention to namecoin, i don't think there will be much corrolation to the passing of the bill. Above this as influence in order of expected size of impact:1)Coverage in the generic news 2)mentioning .bit3)mention on slashdot again4)sites beginning to get banned like the domain seisuresThe problem with nmc is ease of use; the lack of something you can install on windows that watches for .bit requests (could even help with even .eepsite .onion addresses) and (for example) updates windows/system/hosts in a completely easy and light way   Would anyone be interested in investing in these 2 funds combined into one? I'm not offering any analysis, I'm just offering exposure to the commodity markets by subscribing to these systems for a fee and then offering them to you.  I've selected these 2 because:1) Commodities are expected to rise with inflation. If you want to diversify your assets but remain bearish on stocks this is a great way to do it. 2) The trade interval is a matter of days for both. This reduces fees and the amount needed to invest. The fees are particularly low if the investment is pooled.  I'm just putting out feelers to see if anyone is interested in this kind of thing. Fund 1:Fund 2:I have had access to a good broker before but if there is interest I will investigate how safe this is from bankruptcy. Brokers aren't supposed to go bankrupt but one has recently so this could be a new challange to protect against. As to whether I can be trusted and everything, well I'll have to work on that if there's enough interest, giving my identity etc to those who are interested.  -j  Seeing as this is the Bitcoin forum let's talk about internet at sea first. SatPhones are expensive. Making calls via SatPhone regularly is pretty much out of the question. But is SatInternet different? I looked into this. A gyroscopic dome costs $20,000. With that you can hook up to 2 way internet. Now, true VSAT in use on commercial shipping is very expensive. Can that tech be coupled to the cheaper SatInternet designed for rural areas? In order to cut out the cost of that $20,000 I wondered if I could use an ordinary $400 satphone and just accept way lower speeds... but I couldn't figure out if the simcards would fit etc... anyone know? Even $10/mb prepay internet from a satphone might be useful to get emails. (p.s. need to sort that blockchain!!)There's also packet radio but that's a can of worms. --- Economics is the thing that stops this being bigger. Question: Might that change?I work at sea and the basic answer to everything is carry a lot of diesel. With this you get aircon, heating, refridgeration, desalination and so on. Water is still a problem. Food isn't really an issue.We are still more fish like than terrestrial animals. Our environment is the coastal environment. We should be able to survive at sea no problem. The fact that this doesn't already happen shows to me how little we know about the sea. It is easier to live in a quiet place instead. I've looking into buying a boat to live on and the mooring fees along with all the new skills were what stop me doing it in normal situations. In order for it to work you are then paying for garbage disposal, electric and water. Unfortunately I found the market for these services was not big enough to generate low enough fees. All of these can be fixed but doing it well is harder than I wanted to risk life savings on. edit: Don't want to bump but you can watch this related film from a crypto guy who lived at sea. The DVD is available if you want to give it as a present:http://www.blueanarchy.org/holdfast/download.html I'm replying here because I don't want my goldmoney thread to go offtopic. Gold and Bitcoin have similar drawbacks. Both have not much inherent value. Both have security problems. Just read of the threads on goldbug forums as they scramble for somewhere to hide thier stash from both governments and and other thieves.Is Bitcoin different in it's proof? With gold it's too easy to fake. To really do a gold transaction you need an xray machine; conductivity can flow around the outside and specific gravity has to be very accurate. It looks like Bitcoin has the edge. Both could be better. So what's the alternative?In my opinion the best thing is to have a functioning business that works regardless of economic collapse, isn't reliant on things. If you're an employee, that's you're number one problem. That is the problem you should be spending your dollars on to improve; buy assets and contribute to society, not simply buy assets and sit on them -j This effects those who, in particular, like to store wealth in precious metals and like the option to trade these for things like Bitcoin without risking it through bust banking.  -j the dynamicness of btc means even though its not a good candidate yet for storage long term its stull great to know your btc is safer than buried gold in other respects - accessible and usable in a different way. I mean, gold is a better store but what good is gold if you can't convert it or even get to It?.probably worth having a few btc stored just in case if you can risk it.I would prefer to store fuel or cigarettes: p gox limits is a good point - this needs to be fixed Ok, a very rough example.Funds to raise are $20,000USD. May be able to negoitate less by paying cash. House is on Rio Negro, Mal Del Plata, Argentina. On a straight road to the sea in Argentinas main and busiest beach resort.

I wrote a letter my snailmail to them a month ago... seems they've taken it to heart! Great!  I'd like to host the blockchain via Bittorrent, seed it from my VPS and announce on http://openbittorrent.com/ But how do I create a .torrent from rtorrent?  It's easy to do on the desktop but wasn't so clear from the commandline. I used:Code:btmakemetafile udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80 ./namecoinDatabasein the end. Links:rtorrent: http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/Transmission howto create torrent (desktop): http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/wiki/display/docs/How+to+create+a+Torrent+fileHow to do it from Windows: http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-create-a-torrent/The linux Bitcoin & python doesn't seem to be available from the Bittorrent website anymore ( http://download.bittorrent.com/dl/BitTorrent-4.0.2.tar.gz etc is 404) so I used Bittornadoedit... working on it...I guess now I have to start rtorrent and add that .torrent file? p.s. if you're thinking of doing this I suggest don't host it on the same machine as one with a live wallet. Is it working for you? edit:Already hosted here :phttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/blockchain/There should be some checks and measures and more easy for new users to import a blockchain, and md5sum checking too.

[/quote]Can't tell if serious....[/quote]They say money is the root of all evil right?I put it to you that money is a flawed technology and Bitcoin only solves some of those flaws. Already there is some evidence that Bitcoin is owned by a 80/20% divide. We weren't aiming for practically all the Bitcoins to be held by Mt.Gox, yet this is what we have. Why? It's natural, here's why:http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228354.500-revealed--the-capitalist-network-that-runs-the-world.htmland this pattern can be found again in major internet nodes and in geography with cities.You might say that the problems money causes is simply a reflection of flaws in human nature. This may be true but that's like an engineer who complains about a user who doesn't read the documentation and then makes a mistake with the design; it would be better to take the Apple iPad attitude that ease of use is as much a part of design of the tool than it is a result of poor user education. I say money as a peer to peer system has inherent flaws that need to be taken into account. I think these have been written about in peer to peer software research... anyone got any links?---My brother's an intelligent guy but he argues in favour of money printing and won't listen to Bitcoin ideas. I think what we have is a situation where people won't accept the quantum leap to accept the idea of Bitcoin because it would mean admitting we've been idiots all along. It seems just too revolutionary, too much in one go. Take Argentina. Only ~12 years ago they went though a massive run on the banks. Nobody could get money out the banks and so people staved and died as they couldn't get medicene. Also, there has been a long history of 20-30% inflation. If you hold cash in your hands for a month or 2 the next thing you know is you're paying higher prices. So what do people do about this? Buy dollars! To be fair houses and cars are also used. But you see my point? The average person cannot grasp even the simplest financial concepts. The only thing they understand is when I logged on and checked my valuation after forgetting for a year... to find I'd made £10,000. I think what you've got to do is show an example of paying in Bitcoins and earning in Bitcoins because then when they see you are carrying on as normal while they're in Weinmar Republic they'll want to copy you. There are other things Occupy can do, such as local trading and local currencies. Again it's decentralisation; making the network smaller to lower that networking effect I mention at the tpo of my post.  I'd like to see an algorithim built in to smooth out the network. The problem with money right now is that it collects into the haves and have-nots because all networks naturally form this pattern. Thus money, because it is a network always takes on a mind of it's own unless we design against this unintended property.  broadcast a few BTC explaining what it is... and see if they get cashed in! Bitcoin is a very significant step but it is no panacea. Bitcoin still behaves like money. Money as a network clumps into areas of excess and poverty. We will still have large nodes and there is no smoothing algorithim in place to mitigate the effects of money. The debt based society still exists. That is, you can open a debt against someone just the same. Still, Bitcoin is a very signifcant fix on money by some decentralisation. One step at a time.   Absolute minimum needing to purchase would be US$10,000.  If it was to go ahead you would be dealing with a registered company. If you want to sell your share you are free to do so to anyone you wish to. The shared ownership contract would be copied from an example from mainland Spain and available in English. If >$40,000USD could be raised then a rental income could be possible too.  There are a number of places to invest in depending on the funds available.  I'm mostly gauging interest right now as I don't expect to raise enough to make this work. If you are interested pledge an amount you would invest (suggest as USD), and anything else. -j In Argentina in the last few days currency controls are heavily now in place. It is illegal to swap a peso for a dollar (it is possible to do it but the tax reporting rules make it almost completely unworkable)This is needed NOW and there's massive demand.Freenet: Nobody has the knowledge to set it up in Argentina. Hard to build a dynamic site for buy & sell offers. i2p: Again, hard to setup. Need to run a server 24/7. No proxy gateway for average users (well there are generic ones but because that allow access to all i2p sites that are too slow)Orisis and Iris: Iris docs are in Italian. The darn thing is close source and dynamically compiled to an X11 so can't run on a server! Dark Exchange: Great idea but again not ready. What we need is a way to mirror the content of the market to a website. When this website gets blocked it should be easy to bring up again.  Ports forwarded (i think), only 8 active connections and syncronising to the network is has been at 1% for 20 mins? Works great on win7 and 64bit.

I looked into this. Very illuminating, all these people buying gold but no testing.Conductivity only tests surface, acid only tests surface, specifc gravity can work but hard to be that accurate in small amounts. XRay is better. Im thinking of buying one to help people test. Hope this helps  -j i work from 12-16 hours a day. I seem to need more sleep than my coworkers and it could cost me my job if we were to be really busy for a sustained enough period. So i'm going to look into this, to train my mind to REM more quickly. I suggest starting much less extreme than this and building it into your lifestyle. Nightshift understamd that an hour sleep at lunchbreak makes all the difference. If you can then eat on the job you're ok. Shift work may help to do more with it. In terms of training perhaps a 2 week holiday might be enough to do it. Take it easy when training, tiredness is a killer.  so, a cousin has a 1 year old baby...  Kind of hard to buy a present for. I remember hearing friends who had a rich uncle who invested like $100 when they were born and setup something that meant they could cash it at 18. Hmm... Perhaps i could be the rich uncle. Send a few physical coins.... Send a few BTC by email? Or maybe something more cute? I had a friend who's dad bought him a basic car when he was born. When he passed his test the car was worth a few thousand. He crashed it. Hmm... Buy a painting? Something like a painting is less money orientated but still can go the investment purpose, what do you think? Any other ideas? Security is something to think about, small enough to get in a safe deposit box might be a good idea... There is now this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50936.0(Re: [ANNOUNCE] Electrum - a new thin client )Which runs on Python but I don't see how to cross compile it for Symbian. I couldn't get CuteCoin to work on a non touchscreen phone. It all installs but no icon present... Any tips for getting it working with Symbian non touch screen phones?  I forgot to run i2p before Dark Exchange the first time I ran it. It appeared to work find though, creating a username etc. But then I noticed no peers. There should be something to monitor network activity so we know what's going on. Would also be nice to make more than one search at the same time... or search for multiple offers because I haven't been able to find any yet.   I think there should be 2 main developments on this. 1) Improve the Darkexchange reputation system. I know it's hard to scale but can't code for this be derived from previously coded p2p systems? If I know that bob has transferred £1000 before then we can expect that to work again, in a sense slowly building up trust. Sure bob can run off with the £1000 but by then the reputation based on that is worth nearly as much. 2) Get a simultaneous virtual currency exchange, or automated escrow. If this could work reliably then we have a way to continue trading BTC straight away; you could transfer to LindenDollars or another virtual currency like that and go from there. I think #2 is more important.   I was wondering... in war, why not just print a load of enemy cash and drop it over their border? I did a search but it was only used for propaganda during WW II:http://www.psywarrior.com/WWIIAlliedBanknotes.html...rather than for full debasement. Some highlights from the article though: ^hmm, we can't say that for sure though can we?Also from http://www.psywarrior.com/Vietnambanknote.html - It's a real bummer if you have a goal of not paying bills because you don't like debts or just like to keep things simple (for example)  I just read a rumour that all international USD payments get routed with an additional hop through the USA, even if it's going from (for example) an USD denominated account in say, Panama to a USD account in Bermuda.  Is this true? I think it's relevant for anyone trying to cash out BTC. I guess changing currency would avoid this right? It might explain some unexpected higher fees.edit:"Intermediary instructionsAn intermediary bank is required when sending a payment in a currency that is not the domestic currency for the destination country. For example a USD payment to HSBC in Hong Kong will need to be routed via a US Bank.Do not worry if you have not been provided with an intermediary bank for a payment. Our dealers are able to locate the correct intermediary using their banking directories"^ I wonder who Gox use and how stable the intermediary is.  I believe the 80:20 wealth distribution is a result of a network effect that we see in nature.   Esoteric maths is very advanced in technical stock market analysis. What if this model could be built into a cryptocurrency itself to redistribute wealth fairly?  Further, what if the calculation to work this out was also the proof of work?  The simplest way I could imagine this as an analogy would be a using a Forex fund as a currency.  Article on Slashdot:http://ask.slashdot.org/story/11/11/10/1748242/ask-slashdot-post-quantum-asymmetric-key-exchange""Quantum computers might be coming. I'd estimate that there's a 10% chance RSA will be useless within 20 years. Whatever the odds, some of the data we send over ssh and ssl today should remain private for a century, and we simply can't guarantee secrecy anymore using the algorithms with which we have become complacent. Are there any alternatives to RSA and ECC that are trustworthy and properly implemented? Why is everyone still happy with SSH and RSA with the specter of a quantum menace lurking just around the corner?""Some select comments so far:"There is no known attack on ECC using quantum computers.""1978 crypto is supposed to be safe against quantum""the vast majority of us don't need to keep our data secure for the next century""not all encryption algorithms are susceptible to quantum computers"" I expect that there are some limitations on entanglement""There are however non-factoring based cryptography that are not as of yet known to be vulnerable to quantum computing""You should keep in mind that although theoretically there may be efficient quantum algorithms for a variety of problems on which cryptographic schemes are based, in practice, the only one which has been found is factoring""why people aren't worrying about it, my guess would be that most people don't follow quantum computing, and the few which do may have reason to wonder if we will ever actually reach the 1024 qubit size in a functioning quantum computer""the powers that be, that need to keep tabs on you, already can keep tabs on you" aka there is lower hanging fruit"it's more than a bit futile to count on math to protect things on a time scale like that"The main thing I think is that there should be other priorities to think of first. Trojans and spying is something much bigger to worry about, totally massive. I think a non rooted phone is more realistic to secure. I'll have to have a look to remind myself what the algorithm is for Bitcoin is though still. 
"exchanges from manipulating the data"Well the idea is to have an exchange that is as hard to manipulate as Bitcoin is. "such volume would likely be so small"True. You'd have to adjust the effect of the difficulty change according to volume. As the exchange gets bigger or smaller it's influence on difficulty adjusts.  Well done & thank you :-)Android folk, you might want to check this out! "alt currencies generally rely on bitcoin for value"Hang on, does that mess it up because that would mean it's feeding into itself?  I was proposing to value Bitcoin by taking an average from all the data we can from an exchange; LibertyReserve, any fiat currencies traded, even gold.    I need to pay for something online and the merchant only accepts credit cards but I don't have a secure and reliable connection available to me. This is a perfect time to use a virtual credit card.  Unfortunately it seems all the bitcoin funded VCCs are not available right now. I don't need anonymity so I thought I'd try buying one with Paypal and then delete the card info but cliffscard.com is $40 for only $25 of credit, it's very expensive.  Any suggestions? edit: I should add that many services need me to enter in a lot of personal info which of course again is another risk - Go to http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates/- input `gold` (or another precious metal) as 'currency I have' and select '% change' instead of 'rate' (basket of commodities would be better but can't see anything like that available)- now select various fiat currencies(or countries) you are interested in You should be able to see the rate of inflation for the currencies you are viewing.Speculation is mixed into the results but if you are comparing fiat currencies to one another this is reduced.  You can learn a lot from this graph. For example,  - the Polish currency is bring printed even worse than Argentina - quiet places like Switzerland tend to have low inflation rates - USD is kind of average, fairing a lot better than the UK and the Euro - Peru has a surprisingly low rate of inflation, as does Paraguay - Libyan currencies seem to be doing just fine You can cut through so much with this.   Or another way to put it? -speculation is pretty stable now. The trend downwards is mostly the inflation built into the client I keep thinking that the infrastructure for this is already in place and that it just needs to be used. An eepsite centralised but can host databases. I don't think Freenet can host dynamic content? What about something simpler? Can pgp keys, or a hash, be commented into the comments field in Bitcoin? What about hosting a directory of files on a p2p network and going from there? -but how do you group a series of files that store pgp keys and transactions? I think it makes sense to use the Bitcoin blockchain as identification because PGP is an additional step that I think would sink any attempts to make such a thing widely used.  Yes, I'd like to see the computational proof used to reduce the tenancy of money to clump into rich and poor areas. It sounds far fetched but I think it's possible. We can map the network and we can show how networks tend to clump in areas. Investors predict this pattern in order to predict the market. If we can have that working in Bitcoin then we can solve a great many of the problems in life.  Is this the same effect as the tendency for nodes in a network to clump into patterns? If so then surely we can program in a way to mitigate this effect in the protocol? This is probably the first time in human history we would have had the opportunity to do something like this. My question to you now is,  how do we represent the effect as an algorithm? I wouldn't be surprised if doing so might require entropy. The entropy for this could be sourced from the proof of work. Further, the difficulty could also feature an influence from the current distributed exchange rate. This is very exciting. Is this no less a chance to fix practically all of mankind's problems (money)? Getting a 404 for http://www.olcso-tarhely.com/faenil/Qt_4.7.3_libs.zip -jedit (to avoid bump): Thanks for the mediafire link. I can't install now because I have no internet... perhaps I can find a utility to browse to e:\sys and run direct,still says `incompatible with phone` but hopefully it'll work anyway and show an icon when I manage to reinstall. This is a Nokia E71 with S60v3...anything I can do to help with testing? see http://fixqt.com/ Be sure to see:http://fixqt.com/Before use. I will get back to say whether this helps get it running for me.  Perhaps some sort of plugin for QRencode might be possible now.  Be warned that you can't withdraw namecoin NMC still so the funds can get stuck as there are few buyers to convert them back It seems impossible to pay but in reality there's a lot more that can happen... looking at the history books there's no limit to the inhumanity of what can happen over debt. Perhaps a group of muslim countries could buy half the country and call it Palestine! They should default ASAP like Argentina did in 2002. That will be hard too though. When Argentina did many middle class people in particular couldn't get drugs and died evicted.

This is on a VPS without X11... need to find the docs ack! Can't edit typos. I should point out that this relies on p2p currency exchange and probably best employed by an alternative cryptocurrency blockchain... perhaps some way to seed the value from a fixed point in time of BTC  What were to happen if difficulty was determined by the current exchange price from MtGox? That's just an example. What might be acceptable would be using a p2p distributed exchange and valuing BTC from a basket of currencies. Would this mitigating speculation effects?  There's nothing lite about it. They just tweaked the blockrate for quicker transactions and swapped to CPU mining.  I think this is worth a bump since litecoin. I wonder what the bandwidth of that is. I was kind of hoping it might be possible to reduce the bandwidth somehow. I wonder if a distributed system might be more efficient (distcc is the analogy). 10mb is a lot to my mind, I remember things in terms of dialup. I see the key thing is to have a quick response to the network when a block is found. Does this mean that satelite connections are not feasible... my situation is that bandwith is extremely limited but could be opened if a block is found. I solo mine. But as I understand, you have to download a new block whenever someone else finds the current one right? ...and since that happens often it means you can't just download a load of work to work on offline and then reply only when you want to claim a block? 
Not sure how this is any different to MyBitcoin... This is definately worth a bump. The fact that a culture has the foresight to disallow the promise of payment is very interesting. Bitcoin is not a promise to pay because it involves cryptographic work. Therefore it is of interest to the muslim who wishes to follow Sharia to use Bitcoin! Seeing as the Muslim world is global then there's surely got to be a massive market for bitcoin there! If you have a friend who is muslim ask them about this aspect of Sharia law. This has got to be why the Islamic world is being bombed all over the place.  Post 9/11 financial privacy is very difficult these days. But still very possible. Apparently what companies do now is register a company in one place and then bank in another. The difference is that in order to do that you have to register a company somewhere that doesn't tell the USA who the directors are straight away, and that means $1000's in company annual fees. All it's done is push the overheads up a bit making it generally too much hassle for the individual rather than a company. What if exchanges with Bitcoin were outlawed in the EU and America though? And for that matter gold too at the same time? That would be a bit like having a walled garden around the more commonly known almost anonymous currencies. The worst scanario is that you can't get money in and you can't get money out. Probably for a while a way out would be allowed in order to get the value to collapse. However, if you already hold Bitcoins then you still have that functionality available to you, how much would you pay in terms of risk to maintain that possibility? If many people say 'Well, even if I think it's going to crash to $0.01 I'll still keep $200 in there just on the offchance it might come in handy for armageddon' then we have a strong floor on the value of the currency. Which is better to have in a crackdown? Gold or Bitcoin? How anonymous is Bitcoin compared to gold? That's a case of CCTV camera vs Deep Packet Inspection. In that case Gold wins. But gold is not portable and I think harder to use in transactions in practice than many have thought about. The answer has to be a bit of both, assuming you stay in one place at a time enough to keep gold somewhere. My point is that exchanges via bank transfers are so the first thing to disappear. But there are plenty of other ways to get Bitcoin. Selling gold for Bitcoin, cash (or Hawala?). There is also the possibility of taking a risk with something that might be spotted. There are some banks in some countries that are so disorganised records just don't get recorded properly and even if they do and the USA wants to know more there's a massive beaurocratic process to go through.  But regards decentralised exchange the question then becomes how to put people in touch with each other? Then I think you want a number of ways - freenet sites, p2p exchanges and eepsites. We need this NOW and everyone on this forum to be aware of it. Does anyone here know how to make a Freenet Wiki or another way of decentralised communication?  autogen.sh can't find the necessary libcurl autoconf magic to build your configure script. Thus, instead of transforming the macro LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG into something useful, it's left as-is.Your libcurl install probably screwed up, or autogen just can't find it.[/quote]Thanks. Fixed with Code:#apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-devNow if I run Code:./litecoind -gen=0 -nolisten -daemon -rpcport=8332And test by connecting withCode:nc 127.0.0.1 8332I find that litecoin isn't listening for the miner to connect to. Sorry to bumpa thread just for this!  I can't search this thread so I guess I have to ask - linux binary miner? (got trouble with  ./configure: line 4759: `LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG(, 7.10.1, ,'), losing patient to be honest after fixing aclocal) What's your hash rate?You don't make progress when mining, you have the same chance of generating a block for every hash you generate.[/quote]Hash is approx. 2x3000khash. I understand that with probability it's not accumulative. But the chances of not getting anything after a couple of days seems a bit much? I just want to be sure everything's setup okTo the guy who compiled on linux: congrats, I had no joy on that... do we trust you for a binary now? <wink> [/quote]That doesn't mean a block has been found.[/quote]Thanks :/ Been going for a couple of days now and still nothing... I'm thinking something's wrong.... I prefer the term 'sensing' for packing. People don't fall into categories like this. When sitting in front of a computer I tend to be a mapper. If I do Tai Chi or dancing I tend to sense. There's also a complex relationship between the 2 I don't understand. That is, to turn off self thought mapping answers can sometimes just come out of the blue. The drawback of course is that sensing can't be social so you loose all the power of the network.  Are you replying to me to say that this isn't a block found:"[[22001111--110-24 09:430:-2234]  0t9h:r4e3a:d2 20]:  t3h6r1e8a dh as1h:e s3,0 20.45 0h akshhaessh,/ s0ec.47 khash/sec"  ?

It's different from the usual: Code:[2011-10-24 09:44:58] thread 0: 3175 hashes, 0.56 khash/sec No extra coins are shown in the client window as I would expect.

Running mined and connecting to the client. No error messages. Approx 2x3000khash. Also, the exchange needs a manual price... not sure what price to ask. Says 'insufficient funds' though there are funds and only one order that does not amount to more than the funds available visas are crap. Getting paid in fiat is crap. Get a biz income in btc and no more begging for a damn job. Got an idea? Pm's welcome. mtgox are fair to ask for id. But it is completely evil to let people deposit money thinking they have anonimity. Spread it on the forums, edit a note whereever you see gox - using this exchange removes privacy due to withdrawal limits that vary as limitless as exchange rates. Let this be a lesson to everyone. And a lesson for me, i thank you for the warning, especially on gov fund siezures. I lost almost all my life savings years ago when the gov froze a fund. The court case has been going on for years and by the time i get the funds unfrozen i expect the printing press would have decimated my savings. This can happen with mtgox and any other exchange so LET THAT BE A LESSON  to spread eggs to many baskets. And trust your instinct too;  before it happened i started to withdraw even though i no idea what was spooking me. If i had converted to bitcoin back then i'd be drinking a barcadi and coke in the carribean by now! Somebody through up a wiki on freenet for buy & sell offers until something automatching is made.  This article shows how networks create clumps:http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228354.500-revealed--the-capitalist-network-that-runs-the-world.html...which has led to the unbalance of humanity due to money. It happens to grains of sand on a vibrating disc and it happens to money and people in cities.  Bitcoin is no different. Regardless of Bitcoin bigger internet nodes are more powerful than less connected ones. We have the opportunity now, to build into the algorithm now measures to balance this back out. However that opportunity must be incorporated when we next find the next big improvement to match adoption, such as blockchain pruning etc.  I think we have practically all of the means to do this,(p2p exchange, distributed resource allocation I forget the name of it)it just needs meshing together.  This is very handy. I'd love to see it in the mobile client or perhaps even a standalone client that works on a provided wallet.dat , ability to send by bluetooth and SMS I love it. But an android phone worth <$100 with wallet or bitpay installed seems to superseed this, happily for most but a shame for your effort. The advantage here I suppose is that you can adapter it more with USB host mode, and also running linux code direct, and it seems like a useful thing anyway. Are you paying your programmer the same amount of Bitcoins per hour for their work as you were 3 months ago?  Will 100 BTC buy you as much computer hardware now as it did 3 months ago?The purchasing power of your Bitcoins has declined significantly. ...For most people, it's simply not as convenient to be paid in Bitcoins as by conventional means because converting them back to cash attracts fees,[/quote]Getting people actually thinking in BTC takes time because that thought in the head is competing for previous currencies. It's like going on holiday - even though you know the prices from conversion it's not instinctual. This takes a very long time. Until then it's conversion from another currency. The price can crash within days but USD can crash very quick too. Of course we now think it's less likely, especially with USD. But what about Libian Dinar, they didn't see it coming that much did they? Perhaps for them it was as unthinkable as multinukes on the USA. Of course I agree that USD is more stable than BTC but wait,  by buying USD you are giving power to the FED. It's a political action. Nobody ever thinks like this. You should. South American USA hating countries... and then they keep savings under the matress in USD. The thinker creates the world. Still, what if you're in a country with Pesos. Plenty of countries with pesos have had limits on exchanging USD and gold in the past and still have 10-30% inflation now. BTC isn't great but it isn't terrible. Next up, international transfers. If you got family in the USA and you live in the EU you can transfer to BTC via Intersango, send to an exchange with a presence in the USA and withdraw as USD. If you're worried about BTC stability then it's only exposed for 24hours. Depending on the exchanges you can also get some anonimity (such as OTC). You're getting access to the community. It's more accessible. What's the alternative? Western Union at $40 a pop when you're a migrant worker? It's extremely useful already for people who travel. Also useful for purchasing gold with some anonimity if you are worried about possible future gold confiscations. Next one I see a lot here is just being able to post donation addresses. Closest thing to that would be paypal and posting an email address. You'd have to use an email just for that as you'd get spammed. Plus we all know paypal is a pain. It seems more accessible than flattr to me. Even for the desperate survivialist who really thinks that any currency he tries to hide is under threat - gold, USD, everything right now, BTC is still a useful thing. I don't think the recession has started...Those are the killer app / unique selling points of BTC I've seen so far that I can think of right now. I haven't seen other blockchains add much. Yet.The price is in the toilet, get over it. You can look at the pattern to try to figure out why it's going down. For example, is it a case of now the rate is following mining. I expect mining to continue seeing as if people have the hardware they're probably going to find it hard to hit the off switch emotionally.  It's called litecoin... but the blockchain still grows forever. A simple tweak to block generation is all I see for faster transactions. So far all I've seen on alternative clients is simple tweaks. What happens if a new client actually contributes something significant and noticable? 
I like the idea of doing something useful with all the effort spent on it. That could be intergrated into new alt block design. There are probably other useful things that could be done with the network too.  [/quote]The problem is, it never stabilizes, it only stagnates somewhere before a big jump.[/quote]So from that we can surmise that the market likes stability more than speculation. Well said to the thread. Let's improve it![/quote]Not exactly. You can read the end of a book before the beginning, but it wouldn't make much sense. Same with Bitcoin; it has to know what happened before due to the way the block chain works.[/quote]Try deleting the first 700mb of the blockchain and literally just try it? N1: Agreed regards zipped blockchainN2: Green addresses, MtGox mobile, Offline transactions via bluetooth send. Just hope that the guy who sent you it doesn't send it again before you get to solidify it yourself into the blockchain.  Also agreed, more verbose feedback especially in the GUI. hmm... even I might be able to do a patch for this!Also re: Massive download. We should have some MD5summed mirrors. Well, something better than MD5 really Perhaps we just have to advise people like we would an investment; only convert what you can afford to lose and keep it diversified as you should with cash.  Payzone etc is great for deposits but how to do withdrawals that are truly local? get the heck down to #OccupyWhereever and hand out some paper wallets! Good grief! Any news? I found this thread and to be honest the costs in the USA shocked me; it's only ~14x cheaper than a full banking license abroad. But it's great to see them clearly listed. Before I read this I started thinking, 'What is the shortest path to achieve a Bitcoin to cash card?' Sure there are cards like AxrumExchange[sp?] that provide this. That's great but there are fees all round, especially the ~$3 charge to withdraw, which personally puts me off enough to instead use a normal debit card, thus losing some of Bitcoins advantage. So, what if there was a credit union that automatically converted Bitcoins(or gold?) to a cache of fiat that can be withdrawn, if the currency collapses you only lose the fiat cache. This credit union could be a cooperative and a credit union could do a lot to handle the current banking system. So then I thought, what are the minimum overheads for a 'bank' or credit union. Let's start with a Bitcoin only 'Bank'. We have examples of this, like Flexcoin, they'll be able to tell us more about costs but generally it should be very low cost. So practically no cost there thanks to Bitcoin. Business banking. There's going to be costs here, but I can't see much detail here on that. I'd like to know more. Company(?) accounts, registration fees etc, but again, these shouldn't be massive. Looking at the costs clearly it's all very realistic and that's good to see. But I wonder, what about a barebones alternative at first and then building things up from there? Could there be an alternative way of approaching the idea? Perhaps something fully international (to mesh with bitcoin) for example, (incorporated) in Panama with bank services elsewhere, run as a cooperative (does that fit with incorporation?) and supplying cash cards with anonyminity. Also, could, indeed should, Bitcoin be used to mesh all the existing credit unions across the world together too? edit:The read mentioned earlierhttp://thatcreditunionblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/starting-a-credit-union-from-scratch-what-would-it-look-like/Also, I'd like to see a credit union that does not deal in debt and backs all assets as hardly as possible. There is no bank that doesn't hold your money fully so there's a gap in the market for this.  I reckon if you go down to Occupy and give out a load of bitbills (and gold?) you'll get your money back later in  investments to the currency.Did a search on youtube for 'occupy bitcoin' and got 3 vids. Opportunity! Thought I'd test it. But now I'm running it and the client says ~50kps, shouldn't that be reflected on the webpage, especially if there's no complaints on getting the user, pass and machine name right? Unless it's possible that I've named the machine the same as someone elses and that could mess it up  Here's a simple idea.   Have a wallet on your own webserver, this server as locked down as possible. Have a button on that server that can only send to one address; your `current account`. For ease of use the amount could be fixed or for security, the amount limited.   Thus, let's say you use your Android wallet for everyday spending. If your phone gets stolen you shouldn't have much balance to lose.  In addition to this you can backup the private key from the phone wallet to somewhere safe. If the phone walks you would probably have time to grab the balance and send it elsewhere, especially if the Bitcoin wallet app is not too obviously accessible, I wouldn't expect a thief to know enough to react quicker than you can anyway.  It's important not to have access to the webserver logged in the phone browser history too.   What other options are there? Gold? - gets confiscated at customs (the typical $10,000 allowance is getting smaller every day)Other digital currencies - centralised. Remember eGold? Hmm... So is Bitcoin is the only option? Even if it's thought to be going down... it still has utility.  A slightly more decentralised exchange would be a good idea, something more automated than #otc   The main reason why I haven't mined yet, even though I have access to free electric, is because of the need to buy tons of hardware, because the only desktop system I have now is AGP and PCI based.  It would be great if I could just plug in something by USB and generate. Of course, that's not possible, the closest thing is http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/12/amds-xgh-external-gpus-may-soon-see-the-light-of-day.ars I just wonder if there's another way to GPU compute without having to buy CPU, RAM, mainboard & PSU. The difference is that with these things it's not really profitable but without them it's worth it. Is there a VPS provider out there that's cheap that would allow me to put a nice GPU in their machine for example? Isn't there an appliance for GPU computation that isn't NVidia for example?  Let's stay on topic and not talk about profitability for the moment please.   Would be great if it was possible to bulk import private keys dumped from another wallet, in order to merge all keys from an old wallet into a new one.  Alternatively, does anyone know how to script this from a wallet dump using grep/sed etc?edit: Also, how to check the balance of multiple addresses in one hit with copy and paste? Seems better than BiddingPond. Don't know how to cancel/end/delete and auction though. And people have started selling Weed and things on there, which makes me wonder if it could have problems later. In addition, if it does get taken down (due to the weed), the wallet and escrow could go with it. It might be better to have had securecoin.cc intergrated but still able to function as a separate site too? Don't think so:^ awkward silence doesn't really work over email.  So, how do we actually make this happen? That is, we can register somewhere and time send an email to the future but if we ourselves have that knowledge, we can also cancel the sending. So how do we make the command without allowing ourselves to undo it? hmm...  MtGox want to send me a Ubikey. I don't need one so I guess I can sell it here. $18 (usually $30) via Bitcoin with rate at bitcoin USD spot rate.  My username is well known here and around.  -j I migrated the wallet and now have access. I'll have to import that key somewhere and when I do I will send back the coins. I've just found the same problem again but on v3.24b; it effects $bitcoind but not the $bitcoin GUI and this is on a different box. Bit worrying to be honest in a way Great to see something for Symbian, although I got non touchscreen E71 so it's not working for me. Sent a few coins to say thanks. 
Hey! Still the same here. I only get the problem on one specific machine:Code:user@(removed):~/bin$ ./bitcoind sendtoaddress 0.1 1PyrrD1EnHminnFPipPGyve4HiVyJPKmGy test2error: {"code":-4,"message":"Invalid bitcoin address"}user@:~/bin$ Thanks for the coins - can't we send much smaller coins than 0.01 for testing though? There must be something wrong with this particular client even though I can see the balance and everything else looks fine. I will try exporting the wallet into a new wallet and try again... Perhaps instead of PGP you could divide the key into (2?) parts, sending the mail to 2 different people. People are more honest when there's another person there. Send these mails to a second group in case one of the original pair loses their email (i.e they were one of those idiots who used a non portable email from their ISP). Alternatively perhaps it could be written into a Will and sent out by mail on death. Also, do we know of more reliable email scheduling? This thing might have to survive for hundreds of years. I think it's got to be very useful for protection from extortion too if it can be designed so even us ourselves don't have access. For example putting half of the key out of reach to us somehow? With an address made just now:Code:j:~/bin$ ./bitcoind sendtoaddress 0.0001 1PyrrD1EnHminnFPipPGyve4HiVyJPKmGyerror: {"code":-4,"message":"Invalid bitcoin address"}j:~/bin$ ./bitcoind getinfo{    "version" : 31900, from version 3.2.xxxish to any address from bitaddress.org. It sends fine from newer clients. I've noticed that if an older Bitcoin client tries to send to some address we get `invalid bitcoin address`. Thus we are dependent on being able to access the later release in order to send coins? Or just to send coins to newer addresses?  I eventually found an email from support and after forwarding this it was sorted. Now what I want to be sure of is, is the "SWIFT intermediate code (optional):" = routing code that the bank specifies?edit:Reading through the account history I can see trades for exactly 62.53900000 BTC, starting with 2x2btc from a user called rap*rap*rap* (replace * for e), every minute until over a thousand BTC are completely gone. What does `spent` mean? It is different from `out`. I guess it is redeeming a gox code. I'd like to read more on the hack. Darn shame; looking at the account history I can remember transferring out a few coins but leaving a lot in the account because I thought it would be safer to keep coins with them - so I transferred only some to mybitcoin! -and both got hacked. My life might be completely different if I had known about offline wallets back then! Back on topic, I think it is really important to improve Bitcoin and I'm glad to see the paper. I think if starting again is necessary then I am prepared to risk a lot of my coins to achieve improvements.  In general, in the paper there are still a few too many arbitrary numbers that need to be replaced by carefully weighted and balanced formulas that adapt according to market conditions. We need to replace arbitrary values with maths.  Can some of the changes proposed can be added to Bitcoin.  I particularly like the idea of being able to subdivide the network.  I'd like to see the possibility of hiding communications. All these extra functions I'd like to see in forked clients, I'd like to see another less popular but more hardened network in place should there ever be a problem with the Bitcoin network, ideally that network would run more like a virus, not just over tcp but also other protocols, Bluetooth and radio.  I know people don't like forks because it costs money but I'd rather have progress and protection of core Bitcoin ideas of decentralisation.  PM me if you want to sell for a little lower, as in price matching the ebay average. Where in the UK are you, perhaps I could drive to you  I think I may have funds of some kind at Mt.Gox but I'm not sure because I can't remember.  1) I don't know 100% which of my 4 possible email addresses I used but I know that it has to be one of them2) I don't know for sure that I have funds there, but just in case, I'd like to recover my account! 3) I have an address I use rather a lot. Looking through Blockexplorer with that, can that help determine a possible balance? If I knew what addresses Mt.Gox might use, or could determine that, that would help. Being able to rule out other exchangers would be good too. 4) I can't find a single email from Mt.Gox in any of my accounts. I am searching for `Gox` yet I find nothing at all, yet I'm sure I used Gox at some point. What did buy and sell notification emails mention so I can search for them? Or should I just try to submit a claim with just the password, email address and IP used? I don't want to paste private info on a public forum to help navigate block explorer. Perhaps there is someone who has a good reputation who I can employ to help?  I'm looking for a pre built rig in the UK. PM me if this or anything else is available Would prefer a cheaper card but yeah Same here.... let's look in the logs to see what dll it wants... I also get the array problem, but then I need to install to non GPU systems and GPU systems of many different kinds.  Is there anything else out there as an alternative to this?  The first value is whatever you bought in at, which is different for everyone. Thus, if you bought in a 1 dollar than that´s the value it is for you. Sorry to state the obvious. What if we look at everybody and try to average. Of course that´s the million dollar question. Personally I think it´s way less than a dollar but I heard about Bitcoin years ago when the value was at that so my group perspective is influenced by my individual perspective.  I guess I could cash out what little I have left after losing most of it to mybitcoin but its more use to me in it´s present form... thus no matter how low it goes I don´t feel inclined to sell up. To reiterate, I´d rather risk losing money because I find the utility of bitcoin useful enough to justify the risk. Somewhere in this is the real value of bitcoin. Make sense? Devil's advocate. Bitcoin is a currency. The issuer is the original miner who generated it. The only difference is that the issuers are distributed. 2. "electronic money" means electronically, including magnetically, stored monetary value as represented by a claim on the issuer which is issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of making payment transactions as defined in point 5 of Article 4 of Directive 2007/64/EC, and which is accepted by a natural or legal person other than the electronic money issuer;"Word definitions... What is monetary value? A house? A car? Something with the word 'coin' in it?Gov will respond somehow. This will effect bitcoin value somehow. Up as well as down i'm sure. Hard to predict. We all expected this to happen but we didnt know when. Im sure some people woild have hoped a more quiet developing time rather than an explosive and rapid news events. Different governments can respond in different ways. One gives it ligitimacy and outlaws it, and gives itblegitimacy and recognises it; both are rocognising the currency.  Is the pin for a cash card stored in the chip or is that functionality somehow involved in the transaction an ATM makes? I wonder if a pin could be added to a virtual card.  Generally card vendors charge ~$3 for each cash withdrawal. Bummer. Here's a few that don't:- Schwab (USA)- Norwich and Peterbourgh (UK)- Metrobank (London) Are there any more? Of course, it's a shame none of them have any anonymity. Darn shame the virtual bitcoin2cc cards couldn't somehow have a pin built into it... [/quote]yes, what will make the ATM's even more desirable will be when they can actually buy your BTC from you and give you cash on the spot. Until that happens, I think there will be a strong market for local buyers of BTC who can give you cash minus their transaction fee.[/quote]Agreed. I don't know about you but having something to the effect of a Bitcoin cash card would be absolutely amazing. I guess it could be scripted by auto logging on to an exchange, sending coins around to auto top up a normal account. But it could be better than that;  a bitcoin credit union card. The union issues you a cash card and converts coins to cash balance on the card as the balance is depleted.  I had a balance with mybitcoin. I filed the username and password reclaim and sent to securecoin. Before the site reported something like 100 coins, down from 200. Now it says "This account has a balance of 0. There is no need to file a claim. If you have already filed a claim you can disregard this error."But no coins have turned up. Darn shame I don't know my original bitcoin address on mybitcoin! I got the impression that it's the first time the exchange has dealt with people's sensitive documents and I had a hunch that it wasn't thought through because the focus would have been on getting the cards up and running first. Although I didn't search that hard I couldn't see a mention of the data protection act stuff. As a user you tend to just go on 1st impressions and hunches and it seemed more like just a guy sitting at home rather than a company handling thousands. First impressions for me to hand over ID have to exceed that of how Paypal was in it's 3rd year. That's a big ask. Perhaps there's a 3rd party holding company out there to help SME's and small businesses for this situation that could be employed for handling docs / ID verification. 
I'd definitely do it if I could generate my own. But I don't trust you that much and never will I flicked to a page about Kevin Mitnicks life on the run and it mentioning `tweaking the hash` ... tweaking a md5sum so that the hash remains the same even after alteration...  might this effect this somehow? Is there anything we can do to help? Can you show us a typical result of what happens, perhaps a screenshot? ...to help me think of ways round it Update:: Aurumxchange are now offering cards rechargeable direct with a MT Gox code. But they are expensive (loading fee, withdrawal fees & more). They also need a copy of enough of your documents for it to be an ID fraud risk. This risk is both in getting the documents to them, them storing the docs and then them sending your docs to the bank. Your ID could be intercepted at any of these points. It's great to see the service but Aurum don't have much reputation to go on for securing your data both physically and digitally.Alternatively there is Moneybookers. You can trade BTC for Moneybookers and cash out with thier card. Again there are withdrawal fees but also the German bank they use is about to go bust.Somebody could step in at any point, forming a credit union to take BTC and linking that to a card... either the easy way with reselling a prepaid card designed for credit unions or the hard way, trying to find an issuing authority from Panama etc   I suggest keeping everything on the commandline, such as scanning QR codes. Then, if need be, building it all into an Android device first of all, as a step towards something independent.  You can already do lots of this with a cheap Android device (like http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=160630685772&fromMakeTrack=true&ssPageName=VIP:watchlink:top:en ) or a phone you already own.  Once you got that stage you can then scale down the size for something independent and therefore more secure because we planned ahead and the previous developments can run on embedded linux rather than simply Android.  So I suggest starting with just making Bitcoin on Android really good first - QR codes and everything really easy to use. Just make sure to keep it portable to a smaller form device later on - keep your QR code readers commandline etc. Also I suggest making the whole thing portable/adaptable to work with any future bitcoin-like projects.  First I lost money with ice save when the Icelandic economy went tits up. So I switched to an unregulated US hedge fund. They got shut down by the FSA. So I switched to some gold. Some of that went missing in transit. I claimed on insurance but decided to check out Bitcoin. I saved some with mtgox and mybitcoin and my own client. First mtgox got lost (couldn't remember my balance), then mybitcoin had this problem. Terrible!This is just a reminder that this is nothing new. In this case I feel I blame myself for using mybitcoin as a store rather than just for spending. I've lost a lot in one way but... When I signed up it wasn't worth what it is now! Oops!I stay forever hopeful with bit coin because I've experienced first hand greater losses. It could be a lot worse - I'm glad I'm not starving this time and take it as a lesson - spread those eggs into different baskets! Would you like to buy some coins for effectivo?I'm know someone in centro, PM me Tax. It's what you're supposed to do. Like a said, it's not very safe but it might be better than having all eggs in one basket. In theory if one goes bankrupt you can lose it all (even trace the blockchain, in theory...) but with a pension it at least has the notion of safety, like you get a little of with a house. My current view is to put 5-10% of savings into it. Not the 30% we're supposed to. But I wondered what other people think.   Great ide and I was going to try this out but then I thought,`If I print to paper then I need the source to read it again. If I'm printing to paper for longevity ten I need to store the source for how to read it as well` And that's the thing -will the program to decode it still be available in 30 years time? I suppose I'd write a note with it giving as much info as possible, perhaps even the sourcecode too...  but then you might need to skill/effort to compile it. That might be possible, certainly if there's lots of money involved... but I can see myself getting frustrated with it. Perhaps if a very basic structure was saved with it as to how the data is encoded.  Only a couple of years ago I had some stuff on cassette saved from a Commodore Plus4. In that case I could have searched the community for info but in practice I couldn't be bothered. That's the thing, we don't know how much it will be worth the effort in the future.  It's a good point though, media types. Isn't there a more mainstream solution? Like double archive quality CDs?   I had a pension offered to me at work. hmm!Pros:- although it's not that secure it's still a diversification of funds- the employer matches what you put in in the UK... so if you don't pay anything in you don't get that cash- perhaps the future will be full of caring people after the unravelling financial devastation- seemingly tax safe- can convert to 3rd party funds. In theory this could even be physical gold or bitcoin(!)... but to do that it has to be done through a financially regulated company. I think it is possible though. Wouldn't it be great if it was as physical gold stored at your provider? I think it's possible... more info? I expect something like this wouldn't be allowed, the man probably prefers to keep the money in the country... but I've seen emerging markets funds so I think it's possibleCons:- probably be raided to fund a war, or pay off a debt- has been raided in the past, have been badly managed in the past, could be raided by just buying a load of certain shares and then cashing out- probably die before the thing pays out Whattayathink?  Let's put a bounty on for the source. I pledge a BTC  Yeah, definitely don't mention something like Bitcoin. Carrying gold is hard enough. I think you're lucky they didn't detain you until you gave over your coins. Customs had seen some intention to take something over the border without declaring it.  They just want to know you can support yourself and you haven't sold everything to get here. It's similar for many other countries. South Americans really don't like the way they're treated this way because it's specifically The Man countries, if you catch my drift; wherever the new world order has gotten it's fingers into, never the places at war with.  I try to avoid America for passing though, it's the worst. Not as bad as I heard but definitely worth avoiding.  Thanks for the warning. I will continue to crap my pants at borders for no reason :-) Great project. I'd like to propose either an extension to the project, a completely new distro or ideally both. The reason I say a completely new distro for offline backup is to keep things simple and secure. The mockup would be like this.Code:Welcome to The Bitcoin Offline Savings Account GeneratorYou generated address is "khghgkjhkjhkjlhkjlhWHATEVERklj87686gk"1) Print wallet.dat to paper (printer is... `online`)2) Copy wallet.dat to USB drive3) Create digital wallet.dat file from scanner and save to USB drive4) Create digital wallet.dat file from image on USB and save to USB driveThings to include would be:- saned (for recovering a wallet.dat backed up as a printed imaged)- cupsI would suggest a minimal ncurses based menu at first, with options to backup to a file on USB but also to create a .png image and print it, checking that the printer works first. You could base the distro from http://tiny.slitaz.org/ or http://mirror.slitaz.org/pizza/ -j  I thought I'd try generating a wallet and sending to it as per instructions around. However, the distro I tried to use, being cut down, didn't have the libraries needed or makeutils. I ended up chrooting into my normal install. At that point I thought `is this liveCD much use`? So, would DSmallLinux be a better bet at only 50mb? I'm extremely tight on bandwidth here.   I'd like to get married one day but I'm not into sharing everything. No matter how close people are we're still 2 separate people. In my experience sharing without being clear about things is where the arguments starts. Thus, if I do get married I'd like it with a prenup, not to protect my wallet, but to protect the relationship by keeping money out of the relationship.  Does this make sense?   I know I used Mt.Gox once, but I can't remember if I left any funds with them, so I haven't bothered trying to hard with account recovery. But I'm not sure so I thought I better have a go. I also can't remember what email I used to register with or username! Oh dear.  Perhaps you can help me whittle it down a bit. 1) When Mt.Gox send a `Thank you for registering with Mt.Gox` what words do they put in the email so I can search my emails to find that, to determine which email address I used2) Is the username allowed symbols like $ & _ in them? Or is it just numbers and small case letters. This will help me be more sure of my username. 3) I'm in the UK, but I think I only used the site last year... so I don't think I could have used their UK bank deposit system because that didn't exist. For account recovery they are asking for "<11>Send the account number(s) and amount(s) you used when depositing into your Mt.Gox account." what is this referring to? Does it mean the account number of where the funds were coming from? I'll have to figure out how I did it. I had my phone stolen and I think stuff like this must have been noted on it. Albeit encrypted, let this be a lesson to me!  Wow!!hmm... so I guess one could purchase a virtual credit card and quite easily write the info to a blank card... sounds very sketchy though; this is exactly the equipment card cloners use...It would be in use at ATMs, that have cameras so there is a record. I wonder if the magnetic stripe needs to be written or if a chip needs to be supplied too. That's a good point, how would the pin be specified for a virtual card...From wikipedia:^perhaps this isn't a problem if only used for cash machines.   There's only SilkRoad and there's not a lot going on there at all. I don't expect big drug players to take to the technical side. That is, if they got the money they wouldn't trust it.  Sure, small time ganja growers and even cottage industry labs probably use it but I just got a feeling that any use is going to be new people to the trade rather than big gangs. Then again maybe they really did look into it and decide that the way they already do it is better because Bitcoin is alot more traceable than this, and while this could be worked around maybe it's best to play safe and stick with however which way they already do it.  I haven't seen much drug trade at all. Has anyone else? I have seen tax dodging and bypassing border controls. I think that's the big one, but that's not USA specific so I expect it gets missed. All this of course most conjecture too. Like I said, please keep it real. That means no charts, no hype, no hysteria,  just keep using it for everyday things. Bitcoin isn't a panacea, it's still money, with all the problems that money creates. Money is like digital in an analogue world. No matter how accurate you try to bring the resolution up, trying to transmit thoughts and feelings with it, it doesn't fit, magnifying and resonating the communication. Like a sandy bottom in the sea it resonates into waves on the surface of nature.   When travelling cash is often king. It would be great to have access to the visa/link ATM network. Already prepaid cards are available especially for this from people like fairfx. Certainly too there are other firms like Entropay and Paxum/Payoneer that can be used for this goal too, but the fees in all examples are very expensive: https://www.entropay.com/entropay-fees-straightforward-charges-no-surpriseshttps://www.paxum.com/payment/fees.php?view=views/fees.xslThere are banks in America and the UK who charge no fees for withdrawing cash and use the reference conversion rate (I wonder if there's any in Russia or China like this). The problem with these of course is that you have no anonymity and all your cash is in one basket. I have even seen situations where more than the balance has been taken, sending the user into debt. This is where cycling cards like virtual credit cards would be useful.There are other companies especially for people who can't open bank accounts... I feel it very harsh that these are the very people who have to pay the highest rates! Some have to pay per domestic cash withdrawal and on purchases!Before Bitcoin was invented I wondered, why isn't there a egold to cash card? It's a global market I thought, surely a bank in Panama etc could offer this?With some research I found that there were people offering them but it was all very dodgy, and how it works was very hush-hush. One way a cash card might be able to be achieved is to write a card with virtual (debit) card details... but this sounds sketchy, especially as we don't know much about the virtual card system. What I'd like to know is how do these cards work? What does it take to be a reseller?I have a gut feeling that if one has a bank one can do it... but visa/mastercard can block it at any point. One way I can think to do it would be expensive and without any anonymity - register as a credit union and purchase cards for members from ...I forget the name of the company now... they were associated with Caxton...... but unfortunately these cards charge ~£3 per withdrawal. I wondered what it would take to go direct to VISA instead.I'd just like to know more about how things work (would be nice to know what happens to our money when it comes out the wall right?) but like most things related to banking, all the information is hard to come by, either for security of due to the people who know keeping the info to themselves because they profit from it. 
"credit requires something bitcoin cannot supply at present: stability"Thank goodness for that, debt as we're seeing is a pain in the butt. I think there can come a point where centralised banking and money printing is fixed by bitcoin but all the problems we had before (now) come back just the same. Still, if you wanted to do this you could store reserves in gold and just do the transactions in Bitcoin, or perhaps prepaid debit cards denominated in fiat.   I'm just researching because my traditional bank charges no fees for withdrawing cash worldwide. If the same thing was available as prepay I'd switch. At the moment the best I can find is about $2.50 per withdrawal. Can you beat that? Also, what about identity checks?   I remember finding a website where you can put an offer to exchange a currency you have for another. It was pretty basic; no automatic pairing and the reputation system was pretty basic.  I can't find it or remember what it was called... can anyone help me find such a thing?   I've read a few articles saying the driving forces between value increase have been:- international trade, - illegal trade- merchant use- speculationWell hang on! This is completely forgetting about why I personnally bought a load of Bitcoins - I love it. All these infernal speculators and none of them ever consider love and passion for a project as a driving force. I'd say that's a driving force - hope. People want to believe in something. That's the first thing. The second thing I see missed in these analyses is personal utility. A migrant worker can send funds home without WesternUnion or whatever. Travelers a no longer reliant on the VISA & Mastercard ATM networks, travelers cheques or cash. Paypal users... well we all know about that. Love and hope I think can drive BC price to any level, it just depends on how brave people are feeling. If a law is passed somehow destroying it in one country, do people soldier on? And that's the difference until now - was that crazy bubble spike pure speculation? I don't think so, the price that lead to it I don't think was. That's what I find striking now about reading the grassroots opinion from the new investors and more mainstream media - they care and look at the price as a source of data, when really it is a reflector of data. Thus, the market looking into itself can find no new knowledge. To that end Bitcoin has really made the woes of capitalism clear. They are so obsessed with greed they can't see see the humanity behind the price. When I read the news that BC was 200x more now I should have been unreactive. Instead my eyes spun like fruit machines. Very enlightening.  To be honest I think I need a proof of concept or a diagram to understand this. I can't see how the private key isn't needed, or is generated... Even so, I guess if people can memorise phone books perhaps they could memorise wallet.dat! Would be great if we could put a reference when withdrawing. That way we can pay off things like credit card bills directly. In the same way the meaning of the word `Hacker` has changed meaning, so the word `Anarchy` means something completely different. Why not coin a new phrase for goodness sake! If you had a choice between losing a bank account or your facebook account, which would you choose? For some(many?), a facebook account is more valuable than a bank account.  Could bitcoin be used for a lot more for democratic processes? Could bitcoin be used to inspire something better? This could turn into a meandering stream-of-consciousness thread but here goes.The first thing I notice is that:- identity isn't absolutely possible because everything in life is always changing, but a working compromise is- sure, the number of bitcoins and transactions is distributed but the number of nodes is not. That is, there is little control over the number of nodes. Perhaps a major flaw but let's stay on topic. Lets say we have a island community with no ties to the outside world (for arguments sake). Without tax for services people start donating for things like fire, police, much as jewish communities do. If this was done with bitcoin this would allow for new developments because of the nature of the system. Micropayments can bring markets to smaller areas. So instead of having to choose one fire service, the possibility of more possibilities is now possible! :p Internal accounting can be used to document ones goals but the difference is that this can be directly linked to the world. Can true democratic leadership be created this way, where people pay directly for their services? The key is leadership and then we have a problem. For a society we need to share or not. You can't have it both ways. But could bitcoin do a better job of it - an overtly capitalist system rather than the present (increasingly less) covert system. To be exact, most people when they think of democracy, think of each vote being ties to a single person. If a rich person manages more than one vote then it's capitalism not democracy. Does bitcoin change this as we think it does? Like I said, because identity is constantly moving thing that doesn't exist, no it does not. However, a better compromise than the current system is possible. Let's imagine this island community is now making transactions, the money being used to vote on changes. What is the difference from the system we have now? That is, the system is abused so that voting is used to make more money. In that sense there is no leadership in a capitalist society.  I think bitcoin could be used for help more things because it has value like money. For example, in a company employees generally don't trade salaries to get the best desk. But why not? The force of circumstances means that if things `want `to be a market perhaps they should be allowed to be so, and encouraged.  Ticket touts? -legalize and encourage. The market, if working well, goes in and ultimately fixes the problem. In the case of ticket touts the distribution and faulty pricing structure is fixed (the vendor is outsourcing the problem but really they could profit more by auctioning...). I got a feeling if the antitrust powers were much more effective that could be the biggest impact on the world than anything else. That's the thing, capitalists want it both ways - to have the freedom for their profit but others to not have that freedom. Time for technologies like bitcoin to shake that up. A market can be applied to pretty much anything. Think about this in the next political discussion. Somewhere in the argument (and the problem) there will be something that isn't traded properly. It seems markets don't come naturally to people. The markets need support, but for that we have to recognize either how useful they are or turn our backs on them. Is it that in the same way that knowledge flows like water so do market forces? So this is my philosophy:That one has to work with the market, never against it like protectionism and communism. And that problems related to the market, like herd mentality, monopolies and elitism are actually caused by gaps in the market where the market does not operate.Thus to correct these problems we have to support the market in the areas that are causing problems. For example, doctors are too expensive - drop the training requirement to less than so many years, allow foreign doctors. For example, phones are too expensive - drop the minimum needed to be a network operator, and so on. It can sometimes be hard to identify what area the market is causing a problem but I am developing a gut feeling that this can solve any problem potentially and that it is only human nature that holds it back. For example, when we buy something we don't think about where it came from or what effect that action has had in the world. I doubt I am the first to think this. Is there a name given to this liberal market philosophy? Or indeed, is there a name given to the idea that instead of censorship (which doesn't work), the answer is to flood the offending knowledge with more information (aka propaganda, which costs money, but is more practical). What if we were all subcontractors and not employees? Every small action with a price. What if instead of voting for people, we just pay directly to get things done through pooled investments? Clearly that is not who we've been raised to be. Think about it - tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor. Where's the freelancer or business option? Ultimately capitalism is the thing beating every other philosophy if it is given a chance, including bitcoin. If money is to be accepted, why not go further with it? Ideas:- try running an experimental network where the number of nodes slowly increases along with the money supply, or something like that. Whoever discovers a new node permission gets to bind it to their ipv6 address... incidentally.... where can I bid to own an ipv4 address outright?- a network running on something that isn't the internet would be good! Like bluetooth or wifi dead droped cashing networks. Or ultra low bandwidth packet radio- the blockchain needs to be improved. That is, it is unwieldy now and the ideas above involving more clients are wiped out by this. If it looks unwieldy now imagine how bad it would be if the stock exchange was bitcoin only; it would be unworkable- the almost instantaneous speed of transactions is fantastic. Already lots better than standard banking where physical cash deposits are often used for used cars! That's a key feature and I can't help thinking it could bring bitcoin into something major somewhere in of itself- there should be more experimental networks forked and inspired from bitcoin. For example, the ability to choose to be anonymous or not. Not being anonymous has advantages and different uses. Being more anonymous has advantages too. Running bitcoin not on top of tor/i2p is really neither one thing or another; you feel you have anonymity but really you do not.  i run with gen turned off but still the laptop server fan spins up only when running bc, keeping me awake.How do i safely shutdown the commandline client? Thanks for the suggestion... but it results in a zero balance (!)

The only thing missing is the copy to copy buffer command at the end. Just reading that link tcatm.... oh my goodness! No I didn't know about that, that's fantastic, great work, couple of coins on the way to thatLooks like no.2 is solved then.   Problem: You wish to pay a friend with Bitcoin. You have saved your password for MyBitcoin.com except for the last 3 letters into your mobile phone memory to save time, but the Bitcoin address is still very long to type in. How can this be better?  Barcodes. There are 2 sections to this problem:1) Generate a barcode for a bitcoin address. 2) Read a barcode using a mobile phone camera. There are apps that can read barcodes (http://scan.jsharkey.org/) but what I'm looking for is one that runs in the background and types in the barcode number into the webbrowser. I haven't found that yet. Here's a starter on how you might make that:You don't need an Android phone to make an Android app. See this article:http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Run-Android-Applications-on-Ubuntu-115152.shtmlYou can run an emulator on your linux or Windows box straight away, including using a PC connected webcam (see http://scan.jsharkey.org/ )Somebodies already on the barcode scan API:http://code.google.com/p/zxing/It should be a simple feat to use that for copy the results from zxing into the copy/paste buffer for easy copying into the web browser. 2) Making your own Bitcoin address barcode. Here's the list of barcode types useable with zxing:    * UPC-A and UPC-E    * EAN-8 and EAN-13    * Code 39    * Code 93    * Code 128    * QR Code    * ITF    * Codabar    * RSS-14 (all variants)    * Data Matrix    * PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)    * Aztec ('alpha' quality) I'm now looking up how to make these.... Thanks for the info. I think this should be more prominent in the linux client, why not list the current address in use in Code:bitcoin getinfo too, well, that's where I expected it to be but my intuition on that might be unusual  I use the free hushmail forms and put it in my signature so anyone I email can reply to me privately if they wish. No one has ever used it.  GPG works well if you're sitting on a linux box with mutt. However, if you're traveling the world logging in from Internet cafes it's a little different. For that the only solution I've found to really work is logging in with a one time password over ssh.  Compare that experience with gmail and it's not great. It's a shame firegpg is discontinued with gmail.  I tried setting up my own webmail with squirrelmail to help the process and just something to do. I found that in order to get an SSL cert I had to give my name (`the natural person` - can't use a company), or pay. How a real person can be represented by an SSL cert? I don't want my voice to be used by a machine if possible, because I could be sued for libel if someone says something someone else doesn't like on my wiki.  Basically because I don't have my own computer with me all the time I find it very hard to use PHP/GPG. Especially with a mobile phone. Then of course you have the problem of the person at the other end not using PGP either.  ^ all this took a lot of finding out. I generally don't send anything protected or signed anymore until I can find something better.  Hope this helps someone out there though.   Now we have Android on the way this could be much more feasible. I think better to have a completely separate network this way than trying to shoe-horn Bitcoin into this. A completely new design.   The main difference here being the intermittency of the network. However, such a network would be as interesting as Bitcoin because it would be completely separate from Bitcoin. In fact, it would be usable in places where there is no internet... or phone system.  Have we heard of any attempts to make a cell/peer-to-peer/`mesh?` network over bluetooth like this? The usefulness of such a network and the fact that this doesn't exist says a lot to me about how pervasive centralization is these days. Big opportunity to make changes here.  Si alguien aquí es de América del Sur por favor ponerse en contacto.Ha habido un montón de problemas bancarios aquí y si conocía a una sola persona para ayudar a effectivo cambio de bitcoin esto podría salvar vidas.Parece bitcoin es único en América del Sur?
