What we all have to eventually realize is that if Bitcoin spreads to a large enough audience, government is going to catch on and shut it down.Since the currency exchange involves USD at the moment, I'm fairly certain any such transactions still fall under tax laws. Even if you tried to rectify the transaction of Bitcoins for physical objects as 'gifting', items that are given to you for free are still subject to taxation by law, even though nobody I know includes every gift they were given on their tax forms it's still technically required by law.This information is based on my experience, so correct me if I'm mistaken. The whole "Let's use it on Facebook!" idea being pitched around is making me really queasy.Most of these browser based games already have their own model which is already tied to cash in some way. Personally, I believe it could boost the usability of the BC as currency, but IMO people are a lot less likely to take BC seriously if being used in this manner. Adding a new one to my stack.Donations greatly appreciated: 1J7aZ1ay5ZJvWBc1EhbNAh5HpCzN8dtW6o In what way, madhatter2?As in you can take them and use them wherever? For mine I don't care, use it how you like, just try to give credit if possible. Took a crack at a very basic low-profile icon.EDITLet me try that again...I like these a lot better!
