is mizery a thief?  yes.does the doc suck ass?  yes.is this a mountain out of a molehill?  yes. My email is via Google Mail.  Nothing showed up in the Spam folder.  I don't know what sort of RBL/other spam filtering GMail performs.Yes, the issue has been resolved.  Thanks! The one listed at http://www.privacyshark.com/order.php: send money, then send email.Sent money and detailed email Sat, 8am.  After hearing nothing by Mon, 5pm, sent follow-up email. Hey, thanks for responding There are a couple of issues, of which I will follow through in private message:After following the ordering instructions and sending money, not even an automated acknowledgement was received.  This leaves the customer hanging for days, wondering what happened to their money.The email sent on Sat @ 8am included several basic questions, such as "procedure for DNS updates?" and "what security/auth is employed to prevent others from updating my domains?"  That email, and my follow-up on Mon @ 5pm "hello? are you there?" both remain unanswered, and it is Tue @ 1am as this is written.Therefore, I respectfully submit these suggestions for the future:a) provide an automated acknowledgement of an order in-process, so that [potential] customers know their money didn't simply disappear into the ether.b) answer your email  Taking this to PM now...   just trying to help the bitcoin economy succeed, one customer at a time!  I understand there will be bumps in the road, as everyone figures this out.  Looking forward to doing some business with PrivacyShark. Has anyone has any dealings with PrivacyShark.com?  Is this a scam?They were sent 1,300+ bitcoins for some DNS hosting, and have not replied after several days.One problem with bitcoins -- without an intermediary, your money is lost in situations like this!
