For the JSONCode: { "pair": "BCUSD", "buy": true, "sell": true }, Please specify, does "buy" true mean the site buys BC paying USD, or that the site buys USD paying BC?(Also note the HTML at the site shows invalid JSON -- missing quote after the sell field name and before the colon.  Use jsonlint.com to check your JSON.)Probably better to break the pair up into both parts, you may not be able to tell how a string can be broken into two currency symbols.  Especially when using non ISO currency symbols.  MaybeCode: { "pair": { "first": "BC", "second": "USD"}, "buy": true, "sell": true }, And one more thing, most folks here seem to be using BTC as the currency symbol for Bitcoins-- bc3
