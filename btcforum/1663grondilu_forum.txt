François Asselineau au sujet de l'obligation vaccinale :https://youtu.be/y8mU4QyUGHk Kind of fun to see such an old post of mine popping up. You know what, I feel like learning esperanto again.  Using Duolingo for that seems like a good idea. Le globalisme progresse à grands pas, donc il viendra tôt ou tard un moment où la fuite ne sera plus une solution parce qu'il n'y aura plus nul part où aller.La Suisse, comme la Suède, finira par rentrer dans les rangs.EDIT.  Ah, au temps pour moi, on dirait que la Suisse est dans les petits papiers de la Chine.https://cms.zerohedge.com/markets/secret-agreement-allows-chinese-spies-roam-free-switzerland-was-exposed-weekElle aura donc peut-être le droit de garder un statut particulier. Olivier Delamarche interrogé par TVlibertés.  Il mentionne bitcoin et lui trouve comme principal défaut le fait que selon lui les cours sont manipulés par "deux ou trois gros détenteurs".  Je ne partage pas ce point de vue (je pense que c'est beaucoup plus difficile qu'on le croit de manipuler un cours) mais pour le reste de son analyse sur la situation économique et géopolitique mondiale, je suis très d'accord.Je pense comme lui que le grand reset est une manuvre des pays occidentaux pour se dépêtrer de la cavalerie monumentale dans laquelle ils sont embourbés depuis des décennies.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKvkBwr0YHk "Bonjour, je voudrais un kilo de farine, mais après réflexion je vais plutôt prendre mille grammes, ça revient moins cher, non ?" "A part le bitcoin, des cryptos on peut en extraire des quantités infinies.  D'ailleurs le bitcoin, même si on ne peut pas aller au delà des 21 millions d'unités, on peut subdiviser le bitcoin en autant de millièmes, millionièmes, milliardièmes que l'on veut, donc chacune de ses unités peut voir sa valeur augmenter ou baisser fortement."Non mais il est crétin ou il le fait exprès ?  Un millième de bitcoin peut voir sa valeur augmenter ou baisser, mais ça sera toujours un millième de la valeur d'un bitcoin.Je sais bien que pour lui l'école primaire ça remonte à longtemps, mais tout de même. Je ne vois personnellement pas du tout l'adoption universelle comme l' "ultime étape" ou même un but en soi.  Je pense qu'un tel objectif est illusoire.Déjà si on peut avoir des plateformes de change performantes, fiables, dignes de confiance et libérées de toute entrave excessive venant des gouvernements, ce serait bien.C'est un vieux débat sur le forum, et je ne sais pas trop si un consensus a été atteint, mais moi je reste persuadé que le mieux qu'on puisse espérer c'est une forme de liberté monétaire, s'appuyant sur le marché des changes, et impliquant dans les faits la fin du seigneuriage (ou plutôt sa démocratisation, mais c'est une question sémantique). A ma connaissance, sauf cas très particuliers tu n'as pas à déclarer ton patrimoine.   Personnellement en ce qui concerne la fiscalité des cryptodevises je ne déclare que mes plus-values de cessions.  Donc pas de cession, pas de déclaration.  elle veut rien dire cette phrase, c'est un lapsus peut-être ? Salut Landryl et tous les autres.Bientôt dix ans que ce fil est ouvert, et je vois qu'il est encore actif.  Ca doit pas être loin d'être un record sur le net   Aujourd'hui je lisais un article de zerohedge qui comprenait un diagramme interactif pour comparer les chiffres de divers pays.  Bizarrement, la Suède ne peut pas être sélectionnée (pourtant les autres pays scandinaves le peuvent, eux).https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/world-suffers-deadliest-day-yet-modern-says-covid-19-vaccine-data-ready-live-updatesPar curiosité je suis le lien vers la source utilisée (le centre européen de prévention et contrôle des maladies), et un fichier excel est disponible, avec au moins une métrique commune.https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/hospitalicuadmissionrates/xlsx/ L'anonymat du vote ne sert pas à grand chose si le processus qui permet à un candidat de se présenter permet l'intimidation, l'ostracisme ou la persécution.  Avec ce genre de méthodes on se retrouve rapidement avec une élection dans les règles, mais avec un seul candidat ou un seul parti.https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_uniqueJe ne suis personnellement pas surpris qu'une telle proposition émane de lextrême gauche. Hi, I'm French and here we are explicitly forbidden to go out unless you wear a mask and fill a form to justify why you leave home.I'm told you guys are basically free to live your life more or less normally, is it true ? Avec des "si" on mettrait Paris en bouteille.Cela dit c'est vrai, sans le confinement on aurait eu droit à une hécatombe.  Il suffit de regarder la situation en Suède.  Là-bas les dirigeants ont fait preuve de la plus grande inconscience et n'ont pas imposé le moindre confinement.  Du coup les cadavres s'empilent à tous les coins de rue, la population implore son gouvernement de prendre des mesures totalitaires contre elle, la panique s'installe, c'est terrible.Les autres pays Européens devraient intervenir, d'ailleurs.  Il faut envahir la Suède sur-le-champ pour faire tomber ce gouvernement irresponsable et imposer un confinement à la population.  C'est une question de vie ou de mort, donc une obligation morale. Drôle d'idée.  Vérifier des signatures de citoyens c'est plus difficile que de vérifier 500 signatures de maires.Par ailleurs ça va à l'encontre du principe d'anonymat du vote.  D'accord c'est pas un vote, mais si des citoyens lambdas sont poussés à afficher leurs opinions politiques, c'est clairement une pente glissante.Si le vote est anonyme, y'a une raison.  On sait ce que les partis aux extrémités du spectre politique on tendance à faire avec des listes de noms. Apparemment la popularité du président de la république est au plus haut depuis trois ans :https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/entry/la-popularite-de-macron-au-plus-haut-depuis-presque-deux-ans-sondage-exclusif_fr_5fa527dfc5b660095698d5fdJ'avoue être un peu surpris.

Toutes ces questions portent sur le moyen de paiement, pas sur la monnaie elle-même.Le principal point qui importe à mes yeux concernant une monnaie, c'est la création monétaire.  Qui est capable de créer de la monnaie et sous quelles conditions ?  Quels sont les dispositifs permettant de vérifier la quantité globale en circulation ?Pour Bitcoin, ces questions sont clairement répondues par le code informatique.  Pour l'euro "digital", apparemment ces mêmes questions ne sont même pas posées. Talking about brainwallet, if I'm not mistaken it's basically using BIP39, right ?  That is, it will give you a list of words, called a seed phrase and you're supposed to memorize it.The thing is, to memorize a seed phrase people usually invent a story, called a memory peg.Maybe it's me lacking imagination, but I don't like having to come up with a story from a bunch of words.  What I was wondering if a language model could not come up with such a story for me. Those seem like useful links, thanks.I knew about Fabrice Bellard's work but somehow it didn't occur to me that text compression is basically the same problem.  Silly me.  Well obviously the idea would be to generate a text that is friendly to the memory.  A poem, typically.  Memorizing poems is something people have been doing for millennia.Anyway, thanks again for the links, notably about range encoding.  I had never heard of this before. These days, artificial intelligence is all the rage and the latest kids on the block are transformer models, and with them language models such as GPT-2 and most recently GPT-3.These things are pretty cool, with them you can create texts that are often indistinguishable from a text written by a human.This leads me to wonder if these models could be used to improve on BIP039.  I wouldn't feel confident in using BIP039 to memorize a private key.  The generated words are very random and uncorrelated, it seems to me the risk I forget them, or forget their order, is very high.That's why I wonder if it's possible to use a private key to seed the word completion algorithm of a language model.That doesn't seem obvious to me, as the probability distribution for each new word is not uniform, so we can't just pick say the residue modulo ten to pick one word out of ten possible ones.Yet, my intuition tells me it has to be possible to sample the words while respecting the probability distribution.  I just can't quite figure out how exactly.If someone sees how this can be done and can provide a demonstration with GPT-2, that would be fantastic. PS.  I mean think about it : GPT-3 can generate poems, for instance.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could encode a bitcoin private key in a poem ? At this point it is getting more and more likely that none of the two parties will accept the results.  Trump might contest the results because he doesn't trust the mail-in votes (and who should, tbh?).  The democrats might contest the results because of their TDS.BTW saying "what if Trump doesn't accept his defeat" can be interpreted as a way for the democrats to prepare the public opinion for a counting disagreement: if the margin is thin they'll say it's actually pretty clear and accuse Trump of being dishonest.Things are getting scary.  More and more people, like for instance Tim Pool, think the US is heading dangerously close to a full on civil war.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFB3WTDFYSA China is facing a demographic collapse.  Is that not going to impede on any plan to dominate the World ? You can learn it online.   And before Internet, people used to learn it in clubs or with books.   It was a hobby like any other and people were forming associations in order to learn and use it. « Le nombre de bitcoins devrait progresser lentement jusquà atteindre un plafond de vingt-et-un millions dunités en 2033. »Je crois qu'il font l'erreur de chercher à partir de quand le nombre de bitcoins par blocs sera inférieur à un. You just can't explain bitcoin like that.  Not seriously I mean.Schiff just has to read Satoshi's paper if he really wants to "get" bitcoin.  There's no real way around it.   All other methods of explaining bitcoin are basically wave-handing. ça n'est pas si simple, je crois.Si tu parcours 160 bits tu es sûr d'obtenir au moins une collision sur l'adresse bitcoin.  C'est à dire que tu trouveras une paire de clefs dont l'adresse bitcoin est la même que celle que tu veux "casser".  Je ne me souviens plus très bien, mais je crois que ça n'est pas toujours suffisant pour dépenser une transaction.  Il existe plusieurs façons de dépenser une transaction, selon le script utilisé.   Certains scripts requièrent une adresse bitcoin, et donc là une collision suffit, mais d'autres mentionnent la clef publique, et là tu n'as pas le choix:  il te faut trouver l'unique clef privée associée, dans l'espace de 256 bits.Ceci étant, 2^160 reste un nombre très élevé.  Comme je l'ai indiqué sur l'article Wikipédia, c'est à peu près le nombre de molécules d'eau sur Terre. salut et bienvenue,Ahh ça me rappelle des trucs.  Je suivais ce site dans le temps.  Content d'apprendre qu'ils sont encore actifs.  Tu peux nous donner le lien vers l'article où ils parlent de bitcoin, si tu veux. Well, nobody forbids you to use it.But really, it seems simpler to use SI prefixes. I'd be more interested in a debate between Schiff and Keiser, since those two were among the guys I was listening when I was hoarding gold. About three days, during which I had been reading Satoshi's paper about ten times.But to be fair I was thinking about digital currencies for quite some time before that.  So I was already very open to the concept. Agreed, but it's not even because of bitcoin.  I've always thought the intrisic value part of what defines a currency is dubious.  And it seems to me that, from an anthropological point of view, there are plenty of examples of currencies that were genuinely fiat.  In the bitcoin community, we've been using one of them as an analogy for quite time (I think the first one to mention it was Gavin) : You don't need to add extra things.  Rather use the same tech to transfer other assets (like stocks, bonds and what not).

No wonder.  In the pharmaceutical industry, research involves a lot of repetitive process based on trials and error.  I'm not surprised it can be easily automated, it requires much more brute force testing than brain power.I add to my TODO list that I have to increase my position on Biomerieux. Saying that a ball weight 10 pounds on earth and 2 pounds on the moon is a misleading vulgarization.   It begs the question:  what is a pound, then?    The truth is that a pound is a unit of mass and it does not depend on the gravitational field.  The gravitational force, expressed in newtons, does depend on it, not the mass.As for the energy, it's even worse.  If you begin using different definitions of the Joule, you lose the very purpose of the definition of the Joule.  You'll invent new units called Joule-beach, Joule-desert or Joule-moon.  You just make things more complicated and more difficult to compare to one another.   If you want to compare a Joule-desert with a Joule-beach, you'll have to refer to an ad-hoc conversion table.   Why would you do that?  It defeats the purpose of having a standard unit for energy. You're deranged.  I'm done talking with you. Then we'll talk about it in 25 years, ok? You'll kill people that don't agree with you about how resources should be used and/or allocated.Or maybe you'll just kill them for watching smuggled TV programsFortunately, you're almost probably just a poor idiot whining for free money, so you're very likely harmless. I don't know why we keep paying attention to this guy who advocates for the end of money and yet has an ad in his signature saying he's selling a motherboard.  Why the hell doesn't he give it away for free?Anyway:  money is useful whenever people need to trade stuff.   Because money is much more efficient than barter, for very well known reasons that are probably not necessary to recall here.So, do you think in your RBE fantasy people won't have any need to trade anything?  If so, then sure, money will be useless.  But I have very, very hard time imagining a society where I would not have to trade things (unless we're talking about going back to stone age, hunter-gatherer level).   If you can, then you probably have way too much imagination.   Or you're just completely delusional.But above all:  if the utility of money must decrease, this should be translated into lower prices.  Ultimately, in a moneyless world, the price of things would be zero.   So I'll say it again:   just let the prices fell down to zero if that's what the economic reality wants. Debian GNU/Linux, unstable branch People should realize that having a job is not the only way to earn one's life.   When they have a job, they should put more efforts into saving money and turn it into capital so they can receive money when they don't have a job.    IMHO He'd better educate himself first, but I'm afraid the level of brainwashing he's received from the ZM does not leave much hope.One of his last message was:which is a VLOG suggesting that "revolt" is the only solution against capitalism or something.  Does not seem very peaceful to me.Personally I just wish they do revolt and get their ass kicked.As compared to what?  Communism?  You can't be serious. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-12/miner-to-pay-in-bitcoins-for-work-at-tungsten-project.html Yep, and it still does:SEOUL  North Korea publicly executed around 80 people earlier this month, many for watching smuggled South Korean TV shows Well, some demographs have made comprehensive studies about that, studying the trend on the fertility rates in developing countries, and they made a different conclusion from yours.   They tend to observe that the reproductive behavior of developped countries is being followed by developping countries.I rred this here few years ago.You can have an opinion by saying 'Globally, I think it averages out", but I'd rather believe those guys who have academic formation and made a several years study about the subject.Well, there are countries already where the rate of natural increase is negative, the most famous one being Japan, but also Germany and Russia, IIRC.The truth is that nobody knows what happens exactly after a demographic transition.   You seem to think that the population stabilizes, but it can also crash, if women chose not to have more than two children, as it seems to happen currently in Japan.   There are very serious demographs who even fear a global demographic crash sometimes called the demographic winter.   Anyway, it really seems to depend much more on our reproductive behavior than on our ability to extract resources. I think gravity is an experimental phenomena.   There are, however, theories that try to explain gravity, such as the Newton's universal gravitational force, Einstein's general theory of relativity, or more recently Eric Verlinde's entropic gravity. I'm a pot virgin, but I'm not really open to it.I will probably try all kinds of drugs though, but only when I'm so old that I have only a few years to live anyway. Well, I disagree.  I think the main reasons are modern contraception and women rights.   Those things did not exist at Malthus time, so no wonder he could not include them in his population model which basically postulated that we reproduce like rabbits. Having a symbolic, transferable token for energy would certainly be useful, though I suspect the practical difficulties behind this concept are quite overlooked.I'm not sure why we should consider it a currency, though.  It would rather be a tool to make the energy market more liquid, that's all.   If the total amount of energy available is not constant (and it is probably not), it is not a great unit of account, nor a good reference of value.Also, energy eventually gets lost into heat, i.e. it is something that is consumed, like food.   History has shown that consumables don't make great currencies. Demographs do study all this, and their conclusions differ from yours.   It's not just fear that prevents people from having large family.  To some extend, it might even be inverse.   Fortunately it is not necessary to try to guess why people chose to have many or few children.   You can do statistics, and infer demographic projections.   And several of those tend to predict a stagnation of human population during this century, followed by a possible decline.http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/population.htmhttp://phys.org/news/2013-04-world-populations.html  Go tell this to German, Russian and Japanese people.   The lack of resources is not the only way a population can stop growing.  As a matter of fact, populations in developed countries tend to decline not because of a lack of resources, but because of a tendency women have not to have more than 2 children, thus being unable to renew generations (in order to renew the population, women must have statistically at least one daughter, which means at least two children).The Malthusian model of population dynamics is overly simplified, and does not fit well in current demographics and reproductive behavior. So the guy is basically restating Gresham's law.Nothing new under the Sun. Pas mal.   J'aime bien ce qu'il dit à la fin sur la diversité monétaire.   Comme quoi elle existait avant et donnait plus de résilience au système financier.Ça me fait penser que quand on est passé à l'euro, l'idée d'une monnaie unique séduisait parce qu'on se disait que quand on passe d'un pays à un autre, on n'a pas à passer par un bureau de change à chaque fois.   Ça paraissait plus simple.  Seulement de nos jours avec l'informatisation des moyens de paiement et l'internet mobile, changer d'une monnaie à une autre devrait être quasi instantané.   En 2000, c'était pas évident.   Si l'euro avait été proposé dix ans plus tard, pas sûr que tout le monde aurait trouvé que c'était une bonne idée.
I wrote it was the historical definition.  I'm not interested in discussing the oddities of the calendar and time definitions, due to the mismatch between the current, physical definition of the second and the astronomic dynamics of the Earth around the sun.What is the point your trying to make, exactly?   That neither a second, a minute, a day or a year are units of time??   Yes they are.   It's not because their definition is complicated that they are not units.   The devil is in the details, but fortunately we can ignore the details most of the time. I'd say that's rather the definition of an hour (the historical definition anyway, since the second and thus the hour is no more defined with any astronomical concept, nowadays), being 1/24 of a solar day.    And yes, a day is the time Earth takes to turn around itself.  A solar day is still a day, it's just that the rotation of Earth in this case is relative to the Sun, not distant stars.And it is a unit of time.   Not the most accurate one, sure, but it is still a unit of time. Both are days.  You did ask what a day is, without more details.  The general answer is that a day is the time Earth takes to turn around itself.  In a solar day, the Sun is used as a spatial reference.  In a sidereal day, distant stars.  In anyway, both concepts fit the definition of "the time Earth takes to turn around itself", that's why we use the same word to name them, and distinct them only with an adjective (solar or sidereal).And no, I don't need Wikipedia to know that.  I've learnt that at elementary school and you probably did too if you paid any attention.   This is fucking basic common knowledge. I don't need Wikipedia to know what a day is, thanks.  But it's useful to show it to you since apparently you failed elementary school.  Of time.   Jeez.For Pete's sake, it's not because something is not defined with absolute extreme precision that it does not exist.  A day is the time Earth takes to turn around itself.  It minutely slows through time, but for all intends and purposes, it is constant enough.  A little bit of pragmatism, please.I don't know where you're going.   If think there is nothing wrong with bitcoin being a unit.  It's a bit polysemic, but that's fine. I agree.  People should mention SHA-256, or at least "cryptographic hash function".   There is no reason to assume the public is too stupid to learn a new word. That was a quote from Wikipedia.   Obviously for some things the world "physical" has to be taken metaphorically.   Also, I'm not sure "physical" means "material".   Time is a physical concept so I would not be surprised if it could be considered as a physical quantity, thus making the second a physical unit (few people would doubt that, anyway).As I wrote, things would have been clearer if Satoshi had used a different word to call the "substance" and the "unit"  (as I imagined, with "bitgold" and "bitgram" for instance).  He did not, so "bitcoin" has several meanings.   It's a bit as if we were using the word "water" both for the liquid substance and for a standard amount of it. He chose to use bitcoin, didn't he?Please feel free to go live in a cave, a desert or an island if you're not happy with economic reality.You are the one who want to coerce people.   You think machines could do all the work, but right now they don't.  Whether you like it or not, there are still humans required for a lot of production in the world.   And those humans are not your slaves.  They don't work to please you.You want machines to work for you?  Design, build or buy some.   What have you done to advance towards a fully automated society?  Probably nothing.   I mean, you keep advocating for technology, but are you even a scientist or engineer??   Do you have a PhD?  What are your recent technological accomplishment?  The corporations that you communist people dislike so much (because they are part of the "system" you are denouncing) have done much more:  they hire actual engineers and they did build these machines and thus offered products with lower and lower prices. You did nothing and yet you keep whining about how you receive nothing.  You should be ashamed of yourself.Again:  if you think we're going towards a society where everything is free, then just let the prices fall down towards zero.   No need for an abolition of the market.I mean, you guys often mention free stuff that emerged from the open source community and stuff like that.  Like Wikipedia, linux and all.  Those are free stuff that somehow could be considered as a model of a future society where stuff are free and people don't work for money.   But these things (Wikipedia, linux...) do exist now and yet they did not require a political intervention, nor did they require the abolition of the current market system.  So what about we keep on like this, just letting things that can be free become free, in a natural way?? A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a physical quantity.A bitcoin is a unit for an amount of bitcoins.   It sounds like a tautology, but it's not.   A satoshi (10e-8 bitcoins) is an other unit for the amount of bitcoins.    Had satoshi called his system "bitgold", he could have called the standard unit a "bitgram" for instance.  Things would maybe have been clearer.   He did not, so that might confuse some.  The thing is that there is no other word to call the "electronic substance" that can be transferred with the bitcoin software.Whether bitcoins as a whole can be used as a measurement for value (in the sense "commercial value") is a very different matter.  Whether it is true or not does not change the fact that bitcoin is indeed a unit. Could you please stop being so condescending, basically calling people stupid and all?   Have you considered that maybe -- maybe -- you are the one which is ignorant and should learn more about stuff?RBE, Venus Project and other Zeitgest movement piss me off big time.  I hate those guys.You want to have machines work for you so that you can do things you enjoy instead of doing stuff you dislike just to sustain yourself?  Hell, so do I  !!   Everybody does.   The difference with you fucking stupid morons is that I don't think that this should be a political issue or anything.  If I want machines to work for me, I just acquire them, and the simplest way to do so is to build or buy some, not to wait for politicians to give me some.   That's why I own shares of companies, so I own a part of the machines used in the companies, and I have the right to receive dividends from the production.  As a result, I don't have to work.   Why don't you guys just do that?   You don't have money, maybe?  Well, how the hell do you manage to still be alive now, then?  How can you fund those many documentaries about your lunacies on YouTube??   Put your fucking money where your mouth is, and do acquire or build those machines you dream about.  But no, I guess you prefer let real, actual scientists and engineers build those machines, only to blame them later for not giving you the product of their hard work and talent..Screw you.    Your dream of a fully automated society where machines would do all the work is great, but this is a technological goal, not a political one.  Until technology reaches that point, the market economy still makes sense.  Actually, the market economy is the only way to measure the advancement towards this goal, via the price system.  You want a society where everything is free?   Fine!  Just let the price of things drop down until it reaches zero.   Until then: get a job, you lazy communist bastard. He's got a point.  It's totally not cool to respond to him like this.  I mean, if he really got such feedback from bitcoin users, it's absolutly not acceptable.Can't we just respond to his article with actual arguments?  It's not that hard.For instance, he wrote:  "Unlike gold or dollars or other things that have widely accepted utility, Bitcoin's price is determined entirely by what someone else is willing to pay for it. "The price of gold and dollars  also is determined by what someone is willing to pay for it.   The difference is that with bitcoin, we are sure nobody is capable of forging some in secret (as compared to dollars) and we can transfer them other internet (as compared to gold). Those journalists are unbelievable.  It's like they talk about bitcoin only when its price is at historical high.  Otherwise to them it's like it does not exist, thus the recent "bitcoin is back".   Yet it didn't go anywhere! I liked the point he makes at the beginning, about how the technology behind bitcoin will eventually be used for asset registrations.  Although it is not a new idea (we've been discussing it on this forum several times), we don't hear this often enough, imho.I own company shares on the american and European stock market, and I surely would like these markets to be decentralized as bitcoin is.I also liked what he said later about the separation of identity and asset ownership, and the possible economic innovations that it may bring.Also this:« The technological cat is out of the bag.  Even if the currencies themselves shutdown overnight, the core technology of distributed consensus, the core idea that actually the bitcoin and cryptocurrency model is credit transfer rather than direct debit, there is a key insight to key technologies that can be applied to how we build other systems or how we solve the clients problems. »The tech behind Bitcoin has deep implications and this guy understands it. This.   Definitely this.   Now can we please stop this annoying thread that keeps popping in my "new replies" link?RBE is nothing but revamped communism.  Get the fuck out of here. Glad to see the dev team is on this.   That's definitely the kind of stuff the bitcoin foundation is useful for. Haven't read everything yet, but here's a remark already:« We assume that miners are rational; that is, they try to maximize their revenue, and may deviate from the protocol to do so. »If they want to maximize their revenue, they may prefer not to attack the system, since it may compromise the whole bitcoin system, and thus the value of bitcoins.   I'm not sure the author took this into account.PS.« Selfish miners achieve this goal by selectively revealing their mined blocks toinvalidate the honest miners work. Approximately speaking, the selfish miningpool keeps its mined blocks private, secretly bifurcating the blockchain and cre-ating a private branch. Meanwhile, the honest miners continue mining on theshorter, public branch. Because the selfish miners command a relatively smallportion of the total mining power, their private branch will not remain ahead ofthe public branch indefinitely. Consequently, selfish mining judiciously revealsblocks from the private branch to the public, such that the honest miners willswitch to the recently revealed blocks, abandoning the shorter public branch.This renders their previous effort spent on the shorter public branch wasted,and enables the selfish pool to collect higher revenues by incorporating a higherfraction of its blocks into the blockchain. »So that's basically offline mining.   Hasn't this been discussed many times already?  Anyway I don't see why an offline chain would be longer than the online chain, unless the offline miners have more processing power.  The author seems to do very complicated maths to explain this.  Haven't read it yet. For some reason the PDF on ArXiv can't be read.Here is an attempt to compile the source on writelatex.com:https://www.writelatex.com/478960jtrzzx WTF?

Quand je lisais "on ne sait même pas qui est derrière", j'ai cru un moment que ça voulait dire "on ne sait même pas qui est derrière bitcoin".  Auquel cas ma réponse c'est:  il n'y a personne derrière.  Y'a les développeurs qui rédigent le code, mais on n'a pas à savoir qui ils sont.   La seule chose qui importe, c'est le code qu'ils produisent.Maintenant si ils parlent de la fondation bitcoin, ça me parait encore moins pertinent.  C'est une fondation qui justement cherche à être reconnue, donc on sait qui sont les membres et les dirigeants.  Enfin moi je ne sais pas, mais en tout cas l'information est publique pour qui veut la chercher.  C'est comme les associations en France j'imagine:  elles sont déclarées et les fondateurs doivent donner leur nom et leur adresse.Ou alors je me méprends complètement sur ce qu'est la fondation bitcoin, mais de toute façon dans la communauté dès le début son importance a été jugée très relative. "Sa gestion est complètement opaque, on ne sait même pas qui est derrière"Ce genre de citation est affligeante.  C'est incroyable quand même.   Est-ce si difficile de comprendre que bitcoin est un logiciel, que le code source est libre, et que donc ça n'a rien d'opaque?  Et il n'y a pas besoin d'avoir un être humain pour gérer le système.  On n'est plus au XIXème siècle, quand même.La gestion est automatisée selon un protocole tout ce qu'il y a de plus transparent. « When I ask for his name and nationality, hes so spooked that he refuses to answer any other questions and we lose contact for a month. »Unfuckingbelievable.   You gotta be seriously dumb to ask a drug dealer his name. That's not too bad a way to find a global minimum, because if someone ever finds it, he will always find a better path than the existing record.I'm not convinced by this "offline processing" argument.  It's not too hard to evaluate the pertinence of a Lagrangian, for instance with the existing performances of the path proposed so far.   Say you make your offline processing on your secretly chosen Lagrangians.  Once you found the  global minima, you publish the Lagrangians but keep the paths secret.1.  since you keep the optimal paths secrets, some other miner can beat the paths you proposed at anytime.2.  your set of lagrangians is probably only a tiny subset of all the accepted lagrangians (unless you have a really huge computing power, or your Lagrangians are really easy to solve, in which case honest miners will ignore them)3   whenever you publish your paths, assuming your Lagrangians are interesting, then you will provide valuable info and if you are rewarded for your offline work, that's totally fair.But more generally offline work is probably not a big threat against any cryptocurrency.  It's quite unlikely that a lone miner could outperform the rest of the collaborative network and come out with a better chain made on his own. There is not just one lagrangian in my proposal.   Computing a Lagrangian for a given path is fast and straightforward.   Finding the path that gives a local or global minimum is the hard part.Basically there would be a public database of known optimals for a whole bunch of Lagrangians.  Whenever someone breaks the currently known record, he gets the point.

That's enough already to debunk what you said about him having made  « pretty much all of his money by using the state against us ». Get lost.  Buffet has no lesson to receive from you about business and free market.« Even as a child, Buffett displayed an interest in making and saving money. He went door to door selling chewing gum, Coca-Cola, or weekly magazines. For a while, he worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school he was successful in making money by delivering newspapers, selling golfballs and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. Filing his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.[17] In 1945, in his sophomore year of high school, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in different barber shops. »https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_buffet What are you talking about and who is "us"? Buffet is known for bashing gold as being a sterile asset.  So it was quite obvious that he would not like bitcoin.Still, he's a great guy and an inspiration for all investors.

Ce débat sur la cigarette électronique dont il faudrait se méfier car on ne sait pas exactement quels sont ses effets est assez intéressant, je trouve.   C'est en gros le principe de précaution je suppose.Or le comble, c'est qu'à la base la cigarette électronique se présente comme une alternative à un produit dont on sait pertinemment qu'il est lui, bel et bien toxique, reprotoxique, cancérigène et corrosif.  Donc si je comprends bien on se refuse à utiliser un produit dont on ignore s'il est toxique, et à la place on préfère continuer à utiliser un produit que l'on sait parfaitement toxique.Intéressant, non? If you really worry about food, there are much cheaper ways to make tons of it on earth.  The problem with food is that people who need it don't have money to pay for it.  So I very much doubt the way to make it available to them is to make it even more expensive  A simple poll to see what bitcoiners think of space exploration in general and SpaceX in particular.I like this prediction because it's very easy to settle.  Whenever EM will have finished living (as late as possible as I don't wish him no harm), we'll know. Cool!  J'étais à la Réunion le mois dernier.  Sympa de voir qu'il y a des utilisateurs de bitcoin là-bas.Par contre pour le minage, je me demande bien comment tu fais, vu la chaleur... A priori non, tu n'as rien à déclarer dans ce cas.Si c'est comme pour les actions, tu dois déclarer les plus-values cumulées sur l'année, encaissées en euros, quelles soient conservées sur ton compte ou dépensées.Si tu fais des aller-retours bitcoin-euros, c'est le montant des plus-values en euros que tu dois déclarer.Si tu changes tout en bitcoins vers la fin décembre pour racheter des euros en début janvier, j'ai bien peur que ça ne suffise pas pour masquer tes plus values.  Ça ne marcherait pas avec des actions, par exemple, vu que tu es sensé déclarer toutes les plus values effectuées, même si tu réinvestis ces bénéfices.Attention je dis ça mais c'est juste mon opinion en tant que détenteur d'un compte titre depuis quelques années.  Pour bitcoin c'est probablement différent.  C'est sûrement comme pour le change, donc demande à un cambiste, leur problématique est très similaire. It's a great service for people who like to download TV series.http://eztv.itSo far they've "only" received 2.69 bitcoins or something.   Consider donating if you haven't already! Oui pareil, je trouve aussi que l'article ne vaut pas vraiment la peine qu'on se fatigue à y répondre. Il était un peu bête cet article des échos, franchement.  Il y a plusieurs lignes qui montrent que l'auteur n'a pas compris ce qu'est bitcoin exactement.  Comme par exemple quand il écrit:Que l'on connaisse ou non l'expéditeur n'a pas grand chose à voir avec bitcoin.  C'est orthogonal.  Par contre c'est vrai que bitcoin permet à des gens de faire des affaires sans se connaitre (comme sur SilkRoad).  Mais c'est pas obligatoire.Et puis que je sache quand on achète un truc avec de l'argent liquide (ça existe encore, il me semble),  on ne sait pas non plus à qui on a affaire.  ça n'empêche pas la transaction d'avoir lieu. Ce que tu as en tête je pense, ce n'est pas un système de Ponzi, mais plutôt un schéma de vente pyramidale.  Ça ressemble beaucoup, mais c'est pas pareil.Quant à savoir si certains utilisent bitcoin comme un système de vente pyramidale, ça me parait difficile à nier.   De toute façon à la base d'une vente pyramidale il y a un produit.  Selon que le produit a une réelle utilité ou non, le caractère pyramidal du marché est plus ou moins flagrant.  C'est pas toujours évident.   Pour un truc qui est sensé servir d'unité monétaire et donc destiné à être revendu tôt ou tard, c'est clair que la suspicion est compréhensible.  Mais dans ce cas une telle suspicion peut être partagée pour n'importe quelle monnaie, pour le marché de l'art, ou des pierres précieuses.    Ou même pour les bouteilles de vin.  N'importe quel produit susceptible d'engendrer un phénomène de mode peut faire l'objet d'une vente pyramidale.   La frontière est floue.
Moi je mettrais ça dans "cession de valeurs mobilières cotées ou non cotées".  La liste donnée dans cette section ne correspond pas à bitcoin ou à tout autre devise mais elle n'est pas sensée être exhaustive.Edit:  j'imagine que les cambistes débutants se posent souvent cette question donc en cherchant "cambistes déclaration impots" j'ai trouvé ça:http://forex.actufinance.fr/fiscalite-forex.html Les symboles les plus difficiles à comprendre là-dedans, ce sont les chandeliers japonais.Le reste ce sont j'imagine des moyennes mobiles et des graphes cumulés des bids/asks.J'ignore ce qu'est la ligne verte sur le dernier graphique, par contre. Non.Moi ce qui me gène le plus, c'est l'aspect "média de masse".  On parle de bitcoin à la TV, sans entrer dans aucun détail car on s'adresse à un public ignare, et ce sont des milliers de gens d'un coup qui risquent d'acheter des bitcoins pour les mauvaises raisons.  Parce qu'on en a parlé à la TV, parce que le cours a monté récemment, etc.   Et ce sont ces mêmes gens qui auront le même comportement moutonnier lorsqu'après avoir créé une forte hausse ils créeront une forte baisse.   Et ensuite on blâmera la forte volatilité du bitcoin, volatilité qui est donc pourtant due essentiellement au caractère ultra-centralisé des médias généralistes.Tu dis que les gens "normaux" doivent s'intéresser à bitcoin et je ne suis pas d'accord.  Bitcoin est suffisamment complexe pour qu'il soit normal qu'une personne qui n'est pas capable de comprendre l'algorithme ne s'y intéresse pas.  Je ne verrais aucun inconvénient à ce que bitcoin soit une monnaie utilisée uniquement par les gens qui s'y connaissent en informatique.Et puis tu n'as pas à faire simple ou à résumer ta pensée.  Tu dis ce que tu as à dire, et c'est au journaliste de faire la synthèse.   C'est son boulot. S'il n'y parvient pas et si du coup il ne peut pas diffuser le sujet, alors tant pis.   Ça n'est pas ton problème.  Quant à la mise en scène, c'est tout à fait inacceptable aussi.  Aux dernières nouvelles le journalisme ça n'est ni du théâtre, ni du cinéma.Aussi, ne le prends pas mal mais: pourquoi as-tu accepté de faire ce reportage?  Ils t'ont payé ou ils ont juste exploité la déplorable tendance qu'ont les gens à accepter de faire ou de dire n'importe quoi pour pouvoir passer à la TV? Je me sens obligé de réagir à ça:La stabilité du cours est une chose, mais la confiance dans l'unité de compte en est une autre.   Le bitcoin est l'unité de compte pour les bitcoins en circulation.  Et à ce titre, ils sont extrèmement plus fiable que les euros.  L'euro vaut que dalle en tant qu'unité de compte pour la quantité d'euros en circulation.  Parce que la quantité d'euros en circulation est en gros un mystère au sujet duquel on est sensé faire confiance à la banque centrale qui publie un obscur rapport sur le sujet tous les mois environ.Les transactions en bitcoins, elles, sont publiques et donc on sait à tout moment exactement combien de bitcoins circulent.  C'est donc, pour cette raison, une bien meilleure unité de compte que l'euro. Nice script.My first advice: don't use tempfiles.  They always mess up your directory as you always forget to remove them.Just make proper unix pipes:  reading stdin, output to stdout.Code:#!/bin/bashtotal_articles=1760decrement=40function scrape {  curl "$1" | sed -rn 's#.*<span id="msg_[0-9]+"><a href="https://bitcointalk\.org/index\.php\?topic=[0-9]+(\.0)?">([0-9]{4}-[0-1][0-9]-[0-3][0-9]).*</a></span>#\2#p' ;}{    for ((x=total_articles; x>40; x-=decrement))    do        scrape "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=77.$x"        sleep 5 # This is here just to be kind to the server, remove for speedup.    done    scrape "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=77"} |sort |uniq -c |sed -r 's/^ *([0-9]+) (.*)/\1,\2/'Not tested yet but this should work as well as your initial code.Update:  Second advice:  provide your parameters as arguments to your script, with default valuesCode:total_articles="${1:-1760}"decrement="${2:-40}" Writing a price on something is pointless.   Prices emerge from markets:  offer and demand.   Not from a numerical label you put on something.If I write 10$ on a one once gold coin, it does not mean I can actually buy it for 10$.The coin analogy is actually very accurate.  In numismatics, there is what we call the "facial value".   Often states mint precious metal coins and they try to give them an official value by writing an amount in fiat currency on it.Usually when the coin is created, the facial value is close to the gold value, but very soon the facial value becomes obsolete and nobody pays much attention to it.   Try to buy the above coin for 50$, for instance.It's not just because of the former gold standard in US.  Recently in Europe they tried to do something like that with euro gold coins.  They emitted some at a facial value that was only slightly higher than the price in gold at the time.  Since then the price of gold has increased and the facial value is now just a silly number on a coin.  That's what a facial value is:  just a number that does not mean much.What you are suggesting is to put a facial value on a bitcoin block.  It's very silly and I would certainly not run a bitcoin fork that would do that. The price has been volatile lately because of a Panurge sheep style behavior induced by mimetic journalism on TV and other mass media.It's not bitcoin which is at fault.  It's the obsolete centralized information system. That could give you a number to which you think it would be good if the price of one bitcoin would be close to.  But how do you plan on making the actual price closer to this number?  You can't really control the price unless you control the amount, either by creating bitcoins or the other currencies at will, or owning a huge bunch of them. Avec ou sans hotesse ? (ok je sors  )  I was about to say that this is ridiculous, but I'll be diplomatic and suggest you tell us more about what kind of algorithm you have in mind exactly. Well, if MK thinks the price should be around 100$, all he has to do is to sell his bitcoins whenever the price is above 100$, and buy them back whenever it is below.Everyone has an incentive to sell when the price gets higher anyway.  So there is a natural feedback loop.  No need for a supreme entity, whether it is the bitcoin foundation or whatever, to fix the price.  The market will do.I doubt the bitcoin foundation owns enough bitcoins to perform price control, anyway. I have very hard time believing Max can have written that. Maybe this article is related:The problem with predictions: Speaker says peering into future remains an imperfect science Gardez à l'esprit que les informations que vous donnerez aux journalistes seront soigneusement sélectionnées, de telle sorte que plus vous parlerez, moins ce qui en ressortira aura des chances de ressembler à ce que vous avez voulu dire.Rien ne vous oblige à collaborer avec les journalistes.   Je conseille à tout le monde de faire l'impasse quand l'un d'entre eux vous demande de l'aider à faire son boulot. Well, he's probably not the only one, is he? Duh.  Had they been willing to hide their income, they could have had the server generate a new address for each HTTP request.

I happen to have discussed this in the phys.org article about it.  I could not get anyone to tell me what exactly is supposed to wipe us out in less than 1,000 years, because it can't be an asteroid impact.According to two academic studies mentioned in the Wikipedia article about impact winter:"mankind would likely survive an impact of any size".So I guess Hawkins must be talking about something else. Yeah right, in your dreams.  Like Franz Reichelt who was sure he knew aerodynamics enough to fly.Delusional. All this is true if the impact was happening next year, but as I said, a civilization sufficiently advanced to sustain a colony on Ceres would probably be sufficiently advanced to mitigate all this.  They'll build shelters precisely for this purpose.  It certainly won't be much more difficult than building a "dome on Ceres", as you wrote.  Also Ceres is such a small celestial body:I have hard time imagining people on this thing helping the whole rest of humanity.Anyway, all this is just bad science-fiction.   To be willing to take part in an attempt to make anything like this come true in our lifetime is delusional, imho.  This was my point. And this would certainly be better than whatever you would have on Ceres.Also as I said, whenever we'll be able to sustain a colony on Ceres, we'll be so advanced that I doubt an impact winter would really kill millions of people.  We would probably find ways to mitigate it, for an Asteroid is much a tougher environment than even an impacted Earth. You realize how unlikely it is for the impact to actually occur on the exact location of a technological base, right?Also, Earth in glaciation time is still paradise when compared to any other place in the Solar system. Sometimes they do, but most of the time they don't.  They are just crazy, and you don't remember crazy people who didn't change the world.Take Franz Reichet, for instance.  This guy thought he could safely jump off the Eiffel tour with just a self-made suit.   He died of course.  Now, some people did jump off the Eiffel tour after him, but it was much more difficult than he thought, as it required a modern parachute and lots of training.IMHO the death of Franz Reichelt is very similar to this mars-one project.  Look at the people on the video who watch him.  They don't try to dissuade him, they just wait for him to jump, and then they watch him die.  Maybe they sincerely believed it could work, maybe they shared a dream.  Some of them might have said:  "Franz Reichelt is crazy but it's crazy people like him who change the world!".  If they did, to me it's clear they were all delusional.It's the same with this mars-one project.   The crew will die there and we are all going to watch them die, in the name of a delusion fueled by science-fiction.It's sad, if you ask me. Sometimes they do, but most of the time they don't.  They are just crazy, and you don't remember crazy people who didn't change the world.Take Franz Reichet, for instance.  This guy thought he could safely jump off the Eiffel tour with just a self-made suit.   He died of course.  Now, some people did jump off the Eiffel tour after him, but it was much more difficult than he thought, as it required a modern parachute and lots of training.IMHO the death of Franz Reichet is very similar to this mars-one project.  Look at the people on the video who watch him.  They don't try to dissuade him, they just wait for him to jump, and then they watch him die.  Maybe they sincerely believed it could work, maybe they shared a dream.  Some of them might have said:  "Franz Reichet is crazy but it's crazy people like him who change the world!".  If they did, to me it's clear they were all delusional.It's the same with this mars-one project.   The crew will die there and we are all going to watch them die, in the name of a delusion fueled by science-fiction.It's sad, if you ask me. If mankind is advanced enough to sustain an inhabitable environment on Ceres, I'm pretty sure it won't have much trouble dealing with any large impact on Earth. If you seriously believe in interstellar travel in any near future, I think it's safe to say you're delusional.So the adjective delusional has no meaning, maybe?If I was telling my family that I plan on building a house and live on the tip of the Everest, on deep oceanic floor or in the middle of Antarctica, everybody would tell me that I'm nuts.Living on mars is just about as crazy, only much, much more difficult. Tu n'es pas le seul, si ça peut te rassurer.Voilà.   Rien à ajouter. This movie and others have done a lot to manned space exploration.   I'd even say they played a prominent role.This should make us think, though.  Had there not been such a huge SF fiction literature and cinematography about space, people would not give a crap about it, as they would see space for what it is:   an almost perfect vacuum, extremely hostile to any life form, where it is very difficult to go and where there is pretty much nothing to do.Manned space exploration enthusiasm is basically delusional.  Couper internet est à peine moins impensable que couper l'électricité ou l'eau courante. Les ministres des Finances des pays du G20 ont "exhorté" vendredi la communauté internationale à s'attaquer au secret bancaire et relevé que l'économie mondiale avait évité des "risques majeurs" mais que la reprise restait "inégale" à travers le globe.http://www.boursorama.com/actualites/le-g20-exhorte-la-communaute-internationale-a-s-attaquer-au-secret-bancaire-512392e24050d28c20eb6d0b7706647c Malheureusement quand l'Europe tombera, ça ne sera pas vraiment dans la joie et la bonne humeur.Les exemples de pays ayant sombré dans le chaos après la chute d'une dictature sont nombreux.  L'Europe n'est pas vraiment une dictature, mais elle n'est déjà plus tout à fait démocratique.  Donc amha ça risque fort d'être similaire. Je ne fume pas, je n'ai jamais fumé et je recommande à tout le monde de ne pas s'y mettre.Quant à ceux qui fument malgré tout, je leur conseillerais d'arrêter, ou de se mettre à la cigarette électronique.  D'ailleurs si quelqu'un découvre un site qui permet d'acheter des cigarettes électroniques ou leurs recharges avec des bitcoins, merci de nous le signaler.Le tabac, ou plutôt la cigarette, qui contient bien d'autres choses que juste du tabac, est certainement la pire chose pour votre santé que vous puissiez acheter légalement.

It is definitely a weird article.  At some point at thought the author was using irony to advocate for bitcoin. I'm impressed.  That's exactly the age I had when I learned about bitcoin. He seems to be deeply related to bitmint.com, for what it's worth. Confiscation differs from theft in a sense that with confiscation, you don't have to try, you can just do it.   It's effortless. What a great sentence.  It's kind of indecent to say something like this.   I think it's the first time I actually read it in such a blunt formulation. There are some great quotes in this article:Indeed.I agree!Hang on.  Isn't he saying:  "bitcoin is a great technology but unfortunately it's not ours.  Therefore we need to make it illegal so that only WE can use it." ?? It would be seriously difficult for a government to confiscate bitcoins.First, you don't know who owns bitcoins.Second, assuming you know someone owns some bitcoins and you want to take them from him, you need to scare him into giving you his password.  It's quite different than, say, confiscate a house.  Unless the owner is heavily armed, you can just basically take the house and kick the guy out.Now sure, you can put the guy in jail until he gives his password away.  Or you can torture him.  But then you just make it clear that you're fascist. I mean, there is a statistical analysis to make about this "trust a set of servers not to conspire against me" concept.  Has it been done?Let's say there are 100 servers and people are requested to select at least 10 servers.Among the 100 servers, there might be 10 of them that are actually secretly controlled by a super-villain.     He plans on the odds of a user picking exactly his ten servers in his list.What are those odds?  If a user picks 10 servers randomly out of the 100 servers, there are 456440 ways to do that.Doesn't that mean that the super-villain can screw one user out of 456440?  If there are a large number of users, this number might not be negligible.Now, I picked some random numbers, but the generic case should be studied.  One should wonder what proportion of the total number of servers a villain should control in order to be able to screw a given proportion of users randomly selecting a list of servers. How can I know about which servers will not conspire?  I can just make a wild guess but unless I know people who run them IRL or something, I have no clue.  Maybe lots of servers really want to screw the system and will actually conspire. We must pick a set of servers, not just regular users only running the client, right? To confiscate =  To use one's authority to lay claim to and separate a possession from its holder. Also try to remember that when Satoshi started bitcoin, nobody knew about this thing.  He could not have knocked on the doors of these organisations and say:  "guys, I know how you will receive your fundings from now on.  I will give you some electronic tokens that are not backed by anything and you will use them as money".  They would have smiled at him, told him they are not interested and politely showed him the way to the door.How do you plan on convincing all those organisations to be involved in such a project?  Again, if you can do it, please be my guest. I don't trust charities with money.  It's easy to create a fake one just to get government subsidies and stuff like that.Anyway I think what you're suggesting is much more difficult than you think.  But if you really think it can be done, be my guest!   Prove me wrong and do it.   After all, bitcoin is free and open-source software so anyone can fork it. It might be fair but it would be centralized, thus probably not trustworthy: you would need someone to do the distribution, and you would have to trust this person.  Also, you would have to do stuff much more complicated than running a software.   Verifying people's identity, organizing reunions, and so on.  It would be a totally different affair, a major pain in the ass, and it would look like some kind of operation from a socialist party.   It would suck big time.Also, you mention a lottery but that's basically what mining is.  Every nonce is a lottery ticket.  And the winner is whoever can check the most lottery tickets in ten minutes.
It's not that different.  If electric cars were more efficient and faster, people would probably use electric cars for racing.   The goal is to go fast and to have fun.  Burning fossil fuels is only a mean for doing so.   With bitcoin, the CPU race is the way to decentralize the system.   The goal is to acquire a distributed, incorruptible currency.  Could it be done without a CPU race, everybody would gladly use it instead of bitcoin.  But until Ripple or any other alternative is proven to fulfill its promises, there is no other way. There is no need but there is a will.  I mean that bitcoin could work with much lower a difficulty, but people race one an other to get new bitcoins, thus they increase the difficulty.   This is not a need, but the result of individual freedom.Consider for instance car racing.  I've always thought these kinds of sports are stupid, as it just consists in driving again and again in circles.  I could say it's a ludicrous waste of energy and money, but it is above all the result of freedom.  People do foolish things and sometimes it involves spending lots of money and energy.  We just have to deal with it.I agree that the fact that new bitcoins go basically to whoever spends the most energy is not the greatest aspect of bitcoin.  But that was the first ever solution to the double spending problem.  I'd love to see an other scheme, such as one where computing power could be used to actually crack real-life problem (I've opened a thread about protein folding for instance, but as far as I know nobody succeeded in implementing something like that).  The consensus system Ripple is supposed to use could be a nice alternative, if it works and if it is robust, which is not clear imho.Anyway, as I said bitcoin will not trash the world, for the reasons I've explained above.  It hasn't so far and it won't. The heat recycling argument is weak, imho.   As long as mining is profitable, miners can perfectly not bother using or recycling heat.   That's what many industries do.  They often don't give a crap about their waste products, as long as their main activity generates money.   That's one of the main reason why pollution exists, imho. The energy production capability does not matter because bitcoin mining is a race.  Bubbleboy's point was that the cost of mining would rise up to the market price of bitcoin, whatever the energy production technologies are. Cxu vere?  Kie?  Kiam?  Cxu estos videofilmo cxe YouTube? It's a weird reasoning though.The initial assumption is that bitcoin becomes the world currency in a not too distant future.   Then it is concluded that bitcoin mining would be a prominent part of world's energy consumption.  This would obviously raise energy costs, and thus would make lots of people unhappy.    But since bitcoin is a voluntary currency, this means that those unhappy people would stop using bitcoin.  Which contradicts the initial hypothesis.Is it to be concluded that bitcoin can not be successful in a near future?   No, it means that the initial hypothesis is wrong:  bitcoin can not become the world currency any time soon.    Not so surprising.   People do not agree on what money should be anyway.   When I was a goldbug, there were quite a few people around me who told me that saving gold was ridiculous, that gold was a Ponzi scheme, a barbarous relic and so on.  So if even gold could not gather a consensus about money, surely bitcoin will not either.  This does not mean it can not be successful.   To me, bitcoin is already pretty much successful.  It does not have to be used by every single human on the planet, after all.  As long as enough people use it to provide a satisfying liquidity on the exchange market, it will be successful as a currency, imho.What could happen, for instance, is that as bitcoin gains value, more and more bitcoin users feel concerned about the enormous energy consumption.  Those people would either decide to use an altcoin, or fork bitcoin into an alternate chain with no more mining rewards or a much reduced subsidy.Anyway, imho what will happen depends much more on social and psychological aspects of human behavior than on technical factors.  It's very difficult to foresee. Rogers was one of the guys I was regularly listening to when I was a gold bug.Gerald Celente, Max Keiser, Jim Rogers, Peter Schiff, Marc FaberLooking forward to Marc Faber's opinion on bitcoin but I'm not optimistic.  Those guys are brilliant but quite old. If Ripple really works as advertised, it would be even more revolutionary than Bitcoin.Not everybody agrees on what money should be.  But everybody agrees on how an exchange works, what an IOU is, and I'm pretty sure everybody would be happy if all this could be done on a unique decentralized infrastructure.   Everybody except for the brokers of the Forex, the New York Stock exchange and stuff like that, of course. OkYour point about bitcoin leading potentially to a massive consumption of energy is right, but the way you seem to conclude that it would lead to some kind of feudal system where early adopters subject all others is not clear.  Bitcoin is a voluntary currency:  I can't force anyone to accept it if they don't want to.  So bitcoin does not give any special power over anyone.The point about energy consumption is definitely interesting, though.  I admit I hadn't thought about it enough.  So far I was just thinking that in a free world people have the right to use as many energy as they want, but when this energy consumption is a race to obtain some valuable resource (monetary symbols, for instance), the amount of energy involved can be humongous, indeed.   It's not clear to me which proportion of the total power consumption that would represent, though.  The idea was not to recycle generated heat into electricity, but to use this heat for what it is.  Heating is one of the major usage of electricity. The current daily mint rate is not 0.03%, but 0.017% (25 * 6 * 24 /  21e6).  And it halves every four years.It seems that you're more or less right, though:  if bitcoin was to replace the US dollar now or in the next few years, it would give an incentive for people to put a huge amount of energy into computing power.It would be as if the government was paying people to consume electricity.  The more they would consume, the more they would get paid.  No wonder the consequences would be disastrous.So I have to admit that you made a point. I did not understand anything.  Maybe I'm tired or something. If they don't want nor plan on making any comment about the market price, I'd be fine with that. Not too bad an article.   This 2013 bitcoin-mania was indeed a bubble inflated by mass media coverage. Those are basically the same issues there are with any free and open-source software. Have you tried with Justin Bieber? Just use reddit. This would give a lot of power to the gateway, since it could create fake accounts. Well, to be fair it might indeed not matter much.  Lots of ripple proponents advocate for it in opposition to bitcoin, which they see as a speculative asset.  They also seem to think that hoarding is bad, so a currency should lose its value with time.  Therefore people might not be trying too hard to acquire ripples, so the amount of "cheating" might be low.I has to be tried anyway. Sounds too rhetorical, imho.PS.  Actually I'd be embarrassed if I had to answer the question "who runs internet?".  If we set aside DNS, internet is basically an implementation of TCP/IP, which is a network protocol.  So basically internet is run by anyone who is capable of administrating a TCP/IP network.   So I guess internet is run by network administrators all around the world. Good point.  It would also have solved the problem of initial distribution, which I still don't know how OpenCoin intends of solving.  Just saying "we'll give ripples to everyone" is not very serious, for if XRP gets any monetary value, lots of people will fake identities in order to get as many ripples as possible.   Instead of the CPU rule there will be a "cheating" rule.Or OpenCoin could just bluntly sell ripples to the public, without giving any of them for free or at least not systematically.  But such a strategy would not seem compatible with an open-source project, as anyone could sell a similar product as soon as the source code is released.I think it's a conundrum.  It's too bad because I really appreciate what they are doing.  We really need a distributed IOU market as it permits the decentralization of the exchange.   The software seems very smart and well written but there are a few aspects that seem to not fit together very well.
Nice analogy.  The beauty of this is that we can't even be blamed for that. When asked "who runs bitcoin?", I wish Berwick had thought of answering "who runs the Internet?" instead of mentioning the Federal Reserve.Though I guess the journalist thinks internet is run by Google or Facebook...    Not too too bad, for eventually Berwick managed to give the correct answer to the "nobody knows who runs this" argument: You mean Stacy, right? At least they could issue a currency with a total transparency.  I mean, a currency whose total amount in circulation could be verified by anyone at any time.  That could almost deter me from bitcoin. Well, I guess I missed that part. Sure, but has it been tested?? On ripple.com/bitcoiners I can read:It's difficult for me to consider this as an honest statement.  The server of the source code has not been published, has it?   Then we are not even sure their method for decentralization actually works. Why?  I may have rred this article quickly, but I don't think they meant the transactions would be publicly broadcasted on internet or anything.The network would be distributed, but it would still be private. Finally it seems that the page is actually getting updated: If they use the idea of gathering transactions in blocks and validating them after a proof-of-work  is applied to them, they basically use bitcoin.  Not the currency, but the payment system.We imagined they might do something like that very early in this forum. Il n'y a pas urgence pour l'instant vu que les articles suscitent peu de réactions.  Ceux qui veulent commenter un article peuvent ouvrir un fil dans la section principale en attendant qu'une section dédiée soit créée AMHA. C'est surtout qu'à la radio il faut faire court donc ils ont tendance à tout mélanger. The XRP/BTC rate has been exploding lately on Ripple (bitstamp BTC IOU anyway)I suspect this is related. I doubt there is such a thing as a mathematician that knows how to program in C++ so well.A professional mathematician does probably not have time to learn a programming language as complicated as C++.Also, maths in the bitcoin protocol are not really advanced.  It's easily comprehensible for any software engineer.  I've never considered him as a journalist, actually. I agree, but I'll play devil's advocate and say that then they'll mention the free rider problem.They'll say that since spending is necessary for a healthy economy, by refusing to spend your savings you benefit from a healthy economy generated by others, but you don't contribute to it. The free rider problem is the magic argument to defend any socialist/Statist view of the world, anyway.There was a nice rebuttal of the free rider argument somewhere on this forum I think, which was titled "I am a free rider" or something.  The guy was mentioning all the things he selfishly uses all the time without paying one cent for it:   Wikipedia, free software, scientific knowledge, public domain art and so on. 2013-04-13:  Keiser report  (I know the KR has been about bitcoin everytime lately, but this one is very interesting, though)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=176610.0 A very extensive episode about bitcoin and gold, with James Turk as a guest.  Turk says very interesting things about bitcoin, notably in relation to the regression theorem.  Also, he points out one very important feature of bitcoin:  "it can not be confiscated", as he said.http://maxkeiser.com/2013/04/13/kr431-keiser-report-bitcoin-bubble-buzz/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3cQhPBPl6w "fear based money":  nice expression. They don't.  They merely give people choice.  I stick to bitcoin but if someone wants to switch to an altcoin who am I to think this is wrong?You're being Procrustean.
You're getting excited about nothing.  The "problem" you mention won't occur (if it does) until a few decades, and yet you want to "attack" honest monetary competition *now*.   Chill out. Well, Satoshi gave us one (transaction fees), but you are not convinced it will work.  Or worse: you seem convinced it won't work.That's fair enough, but we have nothing else to give you, I'm afraid.  Well, I doubt the difficulty will decrease that much as to make bitcoin being weak.  But that's a fair concern, I give you that.The truth is that nobody really knows if the fee-model will be enough to replace the subsidy model.  But that's no big news.  That's part of the reason why bitcoin is still considered as an experiment, I guess. Then the difficulty will decrease, and other people will mine.   Problem solved.  Also, you seem very sure of what will happen.  It's not so obvious at all.  We'll see. Not really a startup, but I like Dan Pink's description of Wikipedia:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y&feature=player_detailpage#t=967s And here I don't understand at all what you are talking about. The correct analogy is:  gold is superior to silver because it's shiny.  And it is.  The fact that gold is yellow matters a lot for the value of gold as a currency.  That's why gold is still more important a currency than platinum, for instance.  Yet platinum is more precious.I don't compare bitcoin to gold on such a criterium because it would not make sense.  I compare bitcoin to gold by the fact that bitcoin can be transferred directly via internet, while gold can't. Of course, but if you add more altcoins, then your reasoning applies to previously created altcoins as well (not just bitcoins).  So it's not proportional.   Basically, you can indeed add as many altcoins as you want, but they won't have as many supporters and their price will therefore not be infinite.Indeed when people prefer to use altcoins rather than bitcoins, it does reduce the value of bitcoin, but same as when people prefer to use gold, silver, freshly printed dollars or whatever.  Just creating altcoins does not ensure any success selling those altcoins.   And I doubt PR is that effective in making people think as you would like them to think.Again, there is a convention in bitcoin which states that the valid chain is the one which has the most enclosed proof-of-work (I simplify).  All altcoins have lower proof-of-work and are therefore dissmissed as inferior by all true bitcoiners.   You can create as many altcoins as you want, this will not change. Amazing quotes.  Unfortunately, you know what people say about quotes on internet, right? I do not pretend my prediction is necessarily better than others.  It's just mine.   Also FYI, I'm a former goldbug.Not sure I get your point.  Could people decide to start an other blockchain because they think bitcoins are just too expensive?  Of course it's possible.  It's basically happening with altcoins, if you ask me.  I just don't think it's a threat in any way.  It's even healthy, imho.  As far as I'm concerned, I'll just stick to bitcoins. I don't understand why I should count this as an extra.  It's not the same currency.  Otherwise, should I consider that Bernanke also debase bitcoin whenever he prints dollars?  Does not make sense. I mean that I suspect they are happy showing a 39% crash but would be reluctant to show any increase. I suspect they will update it whenever bitcoins goes back below 75.51$ (if it ever does) Bitcoins have been evolving aside with an altcoin ever since the very beginning:  the test chain is the oldest altcoin, and I don't fear it hurting bitcoin in anyway.Also, every time the blockchain forks (here I'm talking about the "normal" forks, due to simultaneity of block discovery from different miners), some kind of an alt coin is created.  Yet it does not matter because we all agree to consider only the longest chain.What I mean is that for the same reasons that people agree to consider only the longest chain as valid, people will agree on considering only bitcoin and not altcoins.  Well, at least I will, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.Altcoins are fine though.  If people prefer them to bitcoin, I have no problem with it.  I just don't share their preference.  And that's all good. That's great, but I'm looking forward to see them actually update their data, because I've never seen anything buton this page. I have a great idea in order to do something that would have the same effect.Instead of encouraging people to spend their money, let's spend it for them!  So here is the idea:  we steal a bit of everybody's money, and we use it to fund all sorts of stuff.  What we do does not matter much.  We can just build stuff like roads or schools.  Those things are always useful so nobody will complain.  If there are already roads, schools or hospitals, we'll just destroy them and build new ones.  We'll just say they were too old and needed replacements.  And if we still need to spend more, then we'll just hire young people as soldiers and we'll send them to war abroad.How does that sound? The blonde girl says that she would not like to hold bitcoins because they are not insured.  There is nothing preventing an insurance company from offering an insurance for bitcoin holdings.  There is nothing preventing a bank from holding her bitcoins and be regulated in exactly the same way as it currently is when holding US dollars.  All of these are merely a matter of laws and insurance services.  It's just a decision that can be taken, or not.So what I mean is that those concerns are not idiosynchratic to bitcoin.   Pretty much everything the current banking system does, bitcoin could do it as well, except letting a minority of people secretly mess around with the total amount of money in circulation. Seems complicated, but also looks like serious work.  I will need some time to understand it.It seems to me they overestimate the need for full anonymity, though. I wish someone could make a study on how much energy and/or money is spent with the bitcoin network as opposed to the current monetary system.Among the factors that should be included are the wages of the banking staff, banks real estate and basically all these resources that are used to have humans do a work that machines do in the bitcoin network.  I'm not sure bitcoin will lose the comparison. It's not really about showing that he did not made himself rich (he did actually, as you noticed).  Showing that there are no pre-mined blocks is a way to prove that Satoshi does not hold a "destruction key", i.e. a secret unknown longer chain (it's quite unlikely today but it would have been a possibility earlier)
Is that the website of the newspaper that was quoted by Satoshi in Genesis?PS.  Good article, btw. Try to remember though that any exchange system is debt-oriented.   A Mt-Gox account for instance is a measure of Mt-Gox's debt to you. That's why Ripple is useful imho:  you can't avoid debt completely. This is not a problem because they bought these bitcoins from people who sold them voluntarily.  Blame these guys if you want to blame someone.Also, manipulating a market is much more difficult than you seem to think, especially when you don't have a printing press.  Central banks would need much more than 1% if they wanted to do it. They don't "own" the market.  Sure, right now there are lots of people who own a lot of bitcoins, but there is nothing we can should do about it if we want to respect economic freedom, and normally it should get more and more difficult to acquire lots of bitcoins as the market expands. I have no issue whatsoever with these guys buying bitcoins.  They did not steal them, did they?Also, I did not know about them before I saw this article, but a quick read of their Wikipedia bio and their arguments about why buying bitcoins let me think they are basically the same as us, only much smarter and richer. It did reflect economic information, from the Cyprus crisis to the fragility of the bitcoin exchange markets. If it is completely open source as promised, a fork will emerge with a different way of preventing spam (since the ripple as a currency is designed just for that, if I understand correctly) Nice summary   The prominent objective of most central banks is price stability.   I think this is wrong, just as wrong as price control is.Sure, price stability for any entrepreneur is convenient and desirable.  It's very much necessary in order to plan for the future, decide wages, choose investments and so on.But the very point of a price is to vary in order to transmit economic information.   If the prices are stable, it is supposed to mean that the economy is stable.  Now look at the world around you and tell me:  does the economy look stable to you?I understand that price stability is something people can desire.   But so is nice weather.    And yet everybody knows that we need crapy weather and most importantly rain from times to times.   Prices are not supposed to be something we control, like in some communist country.   Price is something that is supposed to tell us something about the state of the economy.When the price of all things increases, it is supposed to mean that for some reason the economy is not doing very well:  producers have difficulties responding to the demand.  As a consequence, people start to save things, to consume less.  They spare means of production and reduce their demand.  Also, entrepreneur think harder on how to increase production.   This reaction provides a negative feedback which tends to counter the price increase:  the system then tends towards equilibrium.When the price of all things decreases, it is supposed to mean that for some reason the economy is doing fine:  producers are easily capable of meeting demand.  Stuff are easy to make.   Or it just mean that people don't need what producer are producing anymore.  Then factories hire less and that can lead to unemployment.  But that is economic reality:  there would be no point hiring someone if it is to produce something that people don't want.Anyway, my point being:  prices are an economic indicator.  Messing with money supply in order to artificially make this indicator stable in time is very wrong, if you ask me. Oops, sorry.   Wrong video.  I had this thread confused with this one I wonder if people who believe that have ever wondered how OpenCoin will make sure nobody gets more than its share.Some people will create hundreds of accounts just to get as many ripples as possible.   Those who can program will program bots to open these accounts.  Those bots will require CPU and bandwidth.   So in a nutshell, the more computing resource you'll have, the more ripples you'll have.   Reminds anything?    Starting to see why it makes sense to distribute initial money based on CPU?   You can't avoid it.Ripple is a great tool for decentralized exchange and payment system, but it sucks as a crypto-currency. This guy pissed me off a lot. Ripple is a nice concept at least for decentralized trading, but the source code has not been released yet, has it?  Also, the method for decentralization has not been exactly proven yet, IIRC. Pas lu l'article mais rien qu'au titre je dirais que si les gouvernments étaient capables de détruire bitcoin rien qu'en l'interdisant, alors bitcoin perdrait beaucoup de son intérêt.Donc l'interdiction par les gouvernments me paraît être une mise à l'épreuve peut-être pas inévitable mais quand même utile si elle survient. Phys.org:  Wild, unregulated hacker currency gains followinghttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173168.0 With $600 stuffed in one pocket and a smartphone tucked in the other, Patricio Fink recently struck the kind of deal that's feeding the rise of a new kind of moneya virtual currency whose oscillations have pulled geeks and speculators alike through stomach-churning highs and lows.Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2013-04-wild-unregulated-hacker-currency-gains.html#jCp Ce genre de montant n'est apparemment pas rare. Les frais de transactions sont sensés prendre le relais avec le temps.  En outre, si le nombre de mineurs diminue, la difficulté diminue aussi, de telle sorte que le coût peut s'adapter à la rétribution.  C'est sensé atteindre un équilibre. This has pretty much been their strategy against gold (acquiring lots of it and locking it in jail), and it worked relatively well.Yet with bitcoin it will be difficult to justify to the public (a lot of people would find outrageous that the central bank can print money and give it to random people against worthless virtual currency) and difficult to control (there are not really derivatives market and delivery is much easier with bitcoins than with gold so it will be much more difficult to lie about the amount of bitcoins you actually own).Corners usually don't work, but to be honnest if someone can succeed in organizing one, it is certainly a central bank. Agreed.  CFD are quite peculiar financial instruments.  CFDs are very abstract derivatives, there is often no exchange of the underlying asset in anyway whatsoever.
Nouveau pic ce jour:  C'est simple:  le site te demande un certain montant X en bitcoins.Renseigne ton ordre d'achat pour X bitcoins à un prix limite P tel que P soit supérieur au plus haut bid actuel, afin que ton ordre soit exécuté rapidement.   Mais pour ça il faudra que ton compte bitcoin-central soit alimenté d'au moins X*P euros. So in a nutshell, next time someone asks you what you can do with bitcoins, you can answer:  "Send a man to mars!" Anyone would like to photoshop an astronaut on mars with a bitcoin flag in the ground?    After all, some of us are so full of bitcoins that the idea might not be completely ridiculous   We could also create our own fund.     Possibly the bitcoin foundation would hold the private key. Don't they have a public bitcoin address so we can see how much they received?Also, there is an other project, with quite a different approach: http://www.marsinitiative.orgIt's much more like a prize for whoever goes to mars first.   So it's not really in competition with mars one. Si je devais choisir d'utiliser une cryptodevise alternative, je pense que je choisirais namecoin, vu que si je me souviens bien elle offre aussi une alternative au DNS.En ce qui concerne litecoin, je ne suis pas convaincu du concept techniquement, d'après ce que je lu sur le sujet. Bitcoin like Justin Bieber?Not quite yet: Je suis quasiment sûr que ceux qui minent actuellement n'ont pas de super-pouvoirs. Un site plutôt sympathique je trouve:http://www.listentobitcoin.com/ as you wrote, it CAN change the world.  It is a possibility, not a certitude. C'est une possibilité qu'on ne peut pas écarter d'un revers de main, en tout cas.  C'est difficile de ne pas remarquer l'apparente corrélation entre le graph de bitcoin sur Google trends et le cours.C'est possible aussi, et dans ce cas l'emballement médiatique serait une conséquence et non une cause.  Difficile à dire. L'une des possibilités est que la hausse récente est essentiellement dûe à des achats par des acteurs qui ne comprennent pas vraiment bitcoin et qui achètent uniquement après avoir entendu parler de bitcoin à la TV.  Ils voient que le cours a monté et du coup ils achètent de façon presque Pavlovienne.   Dans ce cas on est dans une phase tulipomaniaque et un crash suivra dès que l'emballement médiatique retombera.Sur le fil spéculation j'ai écris un post comparant le traitement des sujets journalistiques à un feu de foret.  Or, un feu de forêt finit toujours par s'éteindre. Paul Volcker is a prominent figure in financial markets.  He's the guy who suppressed inflation and killed the gold boom in the 70s, IIRC.   I'd be very interested in hearing his thoughts about bitcoin. Bienvenue!  Ca a l'air bien ce site, je le mets en favoris  Today I've edited a Rosetta Code task about forest fire, and by doing so I've learnt about the Forest fire model.How is this related with bitcoin?   Well, later in the day I was browsing the press coverage section on the bitcoin forum, and I thought how silly journalists were, to copy one an other in such a ridiculous way.  It seems clear to me that they are, consciously or not, in major part responsible for the current bull market in bitcoin.As I was trying to find an analogy, the forest fire naturally came to my mind.Here are the rules of a forest fire model:* A burning cell turns into an empty cell* A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning* A tree ignites with probability f even if no neighbor is burning* An empty space fills with a tree with probability pIt's easy to relate to journalism, isn't it?A newspaper will certainly not make its headline about the same subject several times in a row.  That's rule 1.When Bloomberg makes its headling about bitcoin, the Financial Times somehow thinks it just has to do the same.  That's rule 2.Rule 3 and 4 are similar, but introduce parameters which are largely unknown for journalism, but we might infer them with historical data, I guess.If we add to this model other parameters, such as a to-be-determined relation between the price and media coverage, I suspect it must be possible to predict the end of the current rally.Anyone would like to give it a try? C'est effectivement hors-sujet mais ça tombe bien: on a une sous-section "hors-sujet" dans la section francophone Un fil consacré aux autres cryptodevises me parait approprié s'il n'existe pas déjà.

2013-04-07,  Phys.org:  As Bitcoin virtual currency soars, bubble fears do toohttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=169980.0 Some call it the most famous pizza purchase in history: In May 2010, a programmer called Laszlo asked an online forum if anyone would buy him a couple of pies in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoins, an experimental online currency launched in 2009.Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2013-04-bitcoin-virtual-currency-soars.html#jCp Saying bitcoin is a fraud is dishonnest, imho:  everything that is to be known about bitcoin is public.  The source code is open, and every transaction is public.  So in a sense it's much more tranparent than any national currency.We do not know exactly who is Satoshi, or more precisely we don't know what is his real name, where he lives and stuff like that, but we don't have to know.  It's none of our concern. What do Pac-Man pellets and bitcoins have in common, exactly? Difficile à dire.  Seul un développeur connaissant bien les différences entre la 0.8.0 et 0.8.1 pourrait te répondre, je pense. Radio ou TV? C'est une question récurrente mais comme tu l'as remarqué, ça ne concerne pas la section francophone.   Personnellement je n'ai pas les pouvoirs nécessaires pour changer ça.  Il faut que tu convaincs les administrateurs des sections anglophones. Bragging often consists in stating facts:to talk with excessive pride about what one has, can do, or has done. In Cyprus, people were deprived of something they thought belonged to them.  It is true in one sense, but false in an other.I'm not sure what I am going to say describes the exact semantic difference between "property" and "ownership", but that is how I like to think about it anyway.  Even if I'm wrong about the words, the notions I'm about to talk about still exist and if the words are not correct, there should be other words because the notions are useful, thus they need words.Anyway, what I want to say is that there is a fundamental difference between property and ownership.As Thyrion Lannister puts it:  .When you have some money on a bank account, this money is your property.  But you don't hold this money.  Your bank does.  It does it for you, on your name.  This means that only the bank has the capability to actually do anything with this money.  You only have the illusion that you have such a capability because the bank normally obeys you with this money whenever you request an operation.Property is an abstract concept:  it's a word that describes some kind of legitimacy to enjoy ownership without necessarily owning the thing owned.With euros, one way of both owning and having property on money is to own bank notes that have been acquired legitimately.   It's a bit more complex than that, but that's a good approximation.But with electronic euros, there is no way, unless you are a bank, to own euros that are your property.The Cyprus theft shows how fragile is the concept of property when it is not reinforced by ownership.   The money in your bank account is yours, but not as much as one might thought.With bitcoins, the difference does exist as well:  if you trust a third-party wallet or exchange, you do not own the bitcoins that are supposed to be yours.  And just as in the Cyprus case, this property is fragile.But the crucial difference with bitcoin is that it is the only electronic form of money that anyone can, if he wants to, actually own on his computer.  And that is a very important proof of concept for electronic finance. A vu de nez je dirais que ça vaut le coup d'essayer; surtout compte tenu du fait que tu as accès à de l'électricité bon marché.Ce qu'il faut que tu fasses surtout c'est mesurer le nombre de Hash que ton matériel est capable de calculer par seconde.   Divise par le coût de ton électricité et compare avec le résultat d'un calcul similaire obtenu avec les données concernant les ASIC (sûrement dispo quelque part).Cela dit ça peut vite devenir compliqué:  le mieux c'est d'essayer.   Mais dans ce cas je te déconseille d'essayer en solo parce que si ton matériel est insuffisant tu ne t'en rendras compte que très tard et alors tu auras gaspillé pas mal d'électricité pour rien.   Donc si j'étais toi, je rejoindrais un pool, ce qui me permettrait de faire rapidement une estimation de ton rendement.  Si alors tu es convaincu que ton matériel est rentable, quitte le pool et mine en solo.Attention je te donne ces conseils mais je n'ai jamais miné un seul bloc ni rejoint un pool.  Ce n'est donc pas un avis éclairé. I have no idea if that is technically possible, but could a lightweight bitcoin client be integrated in a mastercard chip? That's awesome.  Now I just wish this will have some success and actually be used. Homomorphic Payment Addresses and the Pay-to-Contract ProtocolWe propose an electronic payment protocol for typical customer-merchant relations which does not require a trusted (signed) payment descriptor to be sent from the merchant to the customer. Instead, the destination "account" number for the payment is solely created on the customer side. This eliminates the need for any encrypted or authenticated communication in the protocol and is secure even if the merchant's online infrastructure is compromised. Moreover, the payment transaction itself serves as a timestamped receipt for the customer. It proves what has been paid for and who received the funds, again without relying on any merchant signatures. In particular, funds and receipt are exchanged in a single atomic action. The asymmetric nature of the customer-merchant relation is crucial. The protocol is specifically designed with bitcoin in mind as the underlying payment system. Thereby, it has the useful benefit that all transactions are public. However, the only essential requirement on the payment system is that "accounts" are arbitrary user-created keypairs of a cryptosystem whose keypairs enjoy a homomorphic property. All ElGamal-type cryptosystems have this feature. For use with bitcoin we propose the design of a deterministic bitcoin wallet whose addresses can be indexed by clear text strings.http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3257 Le problème c'est qu'avec Paypal il n'y a aucune guarantie pour celui qui te vendra les 30 BTC.La méfiance ça marche dans les deux sens. I spend a lot of time on phys.org and similar websites and I see many articles about various advancements in several fields.  I often wonder what kind of technological achievement is the most important for humanity.  Here is a poll proposal to try to figure it out.As far as I'm concerned, I voted for computing power because it is the key to further progress in other directions.  Computing power brings simulation of physical systems, thus ease development in engineering.  It is also one of the paths to artificial intelligence, which is the key to everything. Sure, and there are literally hundreds of billions times even more in the whole Milky way.  But it does not matter:  what matters is the amount easily available.The Oort cloud is extremely far away from us.   We will never bring anything from there.  (Or when we can, we will probably be so advanced that we won't value precious metals that much) Lemme guess:  you would like a currency that everybody receives equally, at regular interval and till the ends of times? Bitcoin is not just a currency:  it's a decentralized payment system.   That's no small feat!With a bitcoin-like software, you can allow internet users to exchange account units, aka amounts of stuff, in a purely decentralised way.   This normally should blow the mind of anyone interested in finance.Think stock exchange.   A decentralized, almost anonymous, 24/24, 7/7 stock market, with almost zero brokerage costs.  Wouldn't that be awesome?   A stock market that governments would be incapable of taxing?    Now try to think of all the diversity of financial instruments.  It's just the same.If you don't think bitcoin is a good idea as a currency, you should at least acknowledge the fact that it is a proof that one does not need a centralized book keeper in order to transfer accounting values.  Not anymore. I know they did.  Then why do you whine about a possible corner of bitcoin? Je commence à regretter de ne pas pouvoir être présent.  L'actualité est vraiment chargée ce mois-ci donc ça risque d'être animée, cette rencontre.
You miss a lot.Let's say I manage to buy ten million bitcoins.  Now, tell me: how exactly can I force you to wipe my shoes if you don't want to?  Nobody forces you to accept my bitcoins as a wage for your work!!People could just say:  "this guy has gathered pretty much all the bitcoins.  Screw him, let's start an other chain from scratch!" Imagine a group a people establishing on a deserted island, trying their best to survive and eventually actually doing more than survive.  They build a mini society with plenty of social interactions and so on.  At some point they'd need to reinvent  many of the things they were used to when they lived on the continent.  In particular, they'd have economic relations between one another and they re-invent money.  They'd use whatever was scarce on the island and pretty much useless and they used it as a token as a medium of indirect exchange.Now, a sailor arrives in this island and he would find all this perfectly normal.  A group of people organizing each other in order to create their own currency.  Nothing new under the sun, right?Now tell me:  why is it that for some people it is so much difficult to understand that with internet and the abolition of physical frontiers, such a concept can emerge again?  A group of people with similar cultural background, organizing each other and agreeing about some sort of a token to work as a currency?   Why is is different from the perfectly normal situation of a group of people in geographic isolation? Also, the wealth of this person would existsonly because some people would be willing to offer goods and services for those satoshis.  Therefore talking about "anal slavery" is totally inappropriate.   A slave is someone who is forced to obey, not someone who willingly contributes to an economic exchange. The OP should learn about what a corner is and how it is not as easy as one might think. bitstamp.net,  bitcoin.deTu peux aussi demander à être contacté par message perso pour une transaction en vis-à-vis. It might sound nice and cool to say that bitcoin is backed by economic freedom, but it's more rhetoric than anything.  Let's be practical, shall we?Also, gold was a mean for economic freedom much before bitcoin.  Alan Greenspan himself wrote it long ago: http://constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm This is not exact.  The physical properties of gold are not that great.  In ancient times, many other metals were much more useful, especially considering how strong metals and allows were important to forge weapons.  Gold is soft and pretty much useless in metallurgy.  After all, we talk about iron age, bronze age and all for a reason.  We don't talk about golden age, apart from figurative speech.Gold indeed had useful properties, but precisely those properties made it ideal as a medium of exchange.  It's easy to make gold coins, gold is almost absolutely inert chemically, it's rare and it is easily distinguishable.  All this made it the best tool as money.  Not because it had amazing properties for non-monetary uses in the first place.  It just hadn't. There is a fundamental value for bitcoin:  Silk Road.  For bitcoin is the only currency that can be used there.  To me, Silk Road is to bitcoin what jewelry is to gold. Sur bitcoinwatch.com tu as une liste sinon exhaustive du moins assez complète de tous les sites de change.Pour l'Europe il y a notamment bitstamp.net, bitcoin.de, bitcoin-24.comJe ne me suis inscrit que récemment sur bitcoin.de mais je peux déjà dire que ce site paraît intéressant:  ils ne tiennent des comptes qu'en bitcoins ce qui fait qu'il sont assurés d'être dans la légalité je pense.  Par ailleurs ça réduit une part de la confiance qu'on doit leur donner.  C'est un peu une solution hybride entre un site de change classique et bitcoin-otc.com.  Bref ça mérite le coup d'oeil amha. Si vraiment ça te parait trop compliqué je te suggère d'utiliser electrum (http://electrum.org) jusqu'à ce que tu comprennes vraiment comment bitcoin fonctionne. Un petit sondage concernant la hausse récente Ce que tu dois regarder surtout c'est la longueur de ta chaine.  Compare-là avec celle que tu peux voir par exemple sur http://bitcoinwatch.comSi tu vois que ta chaîne en local est aussi longue sur ce site, et que pourtant tes bitcoins ne sont pas visibles, alors là tu peux t'inquiéter.Une façon de se rassurer aussi c'est de relever le numéro de transaction et de vérifier qu'elle circule bien sur le réseau.  Ou encore de consulter la balance de l'adresse en question sur blockexplorer.com ou blockchain.info What is he talking about? French people will get it.For others, it's a french minister who had to resign because he had to admit having a swiss bank account after having denied it for months. great quote Have you tried gnash?

Fail.A bitcoin is a unit for an amount on an account.  It does not satisfy any more complex mathematical equation that a USD amount on a bank account does.What does satisfy a complex mathematical equation is the transfer of this bitcoin from an account to an other.

Why on Earth would anyone give money to Obama? Ah j'ignorais. Quantum computers would be so awesome (according to David Deutsch, a 300 qbit QC could simulate a whole universe), that the failure of bitcoin would be a tiny price to pay.In a way, you can even see bitcoin as yet an other incentive for scientists and engineers to build a quantum computer. My thoughts exactly.I've stopped listening to Jones Eons ago.   This guys has lost his mind. Non ça n'est pas la même chose.   En confiant tes clefs privées aux mainteneurs du site blockchain.info, tu t'exposes à la possibilité qu'ils plient bagages avec tes bitcoins un jour ou l'autre.   Ou qu'ils prétendent avoir été victimes d'un hacker.Maintenant tout dépend de ton niveau de paranoïa.  Chez les anciens bitcoiner, il est plutôt élevé.  Moi par exemple j'utilise toujours le client standard.

Le 14 avril je ne pourrai pas, je serai en outre-mer (île de la Réunion), et c'est un peu loin de Paris.   Je serai de retour en métropole le 25, au cas où la date serait reportée. I was naive enough to think this had been tested thoroughly.   Why wasn't this released as 0.7.99 or something?  It was clearly not ready for such an even version number.
Today I learnt about a new Wikimedia project called Wikidata.I need to read more about this thing. Does that really surprise you? That's because bitcoin-qt does not create it by default.  You're required to make one only when running bitcoind IIRC. Just make one in your .bitcoin directory. You're not very clear.  You're talking about moving your data to an other computer.  Are you trying to use NFS or something?   I doubt so.  I suspect you're talking about mounting your .bitcoin directory on an other partition.  Which is the simplest solution to your problem.  If you do so, you can also use symbolic links to store your wallet somewhere else.Also, it might be necessary to define the new location for your datadir in bitcoin.conf (which must be present in both destination, I guess).   Though just on command line should be enough, normally. Well, in my particular example, the government finally stopped supporting the minitel and started offering the same services on internet.Also, I'm no expert on monetary history but IIRC the dollar originally was a currency used by people, derived from a german silver coin called the thaler.  The word "quarter" for instance comes from a piece of this coin, that was cut in four. Often we hear from bitcoin opponents the taxation argument.  In a nutshell:  « USD has value at least because you can pay your taxes with it.  You can't do that in bitcoins. »I'll try to forget a minute that I'm not too happy about having to pay taxes on my income, as I think there is a much less political way to tackle this argument anyway.  Basically, it just consists of reminding people that the Law, and how the government works, is supposed to be something that we agree on.  It is not supposed to be some external power we should comply to with no control whatsoever.   It's not a force of nature like earthquakes or asteroids.  It's nothing more than a convention.Let me take an exemple.  Before internet, in France there was the Minitel.  It was a neat invention for the time.  It was mostly a governmental project, and as such among the main uses of this thing, were many administrative, public services, like telephone indexes, meteorology, access to public data and whatnot.  And among those things, I'm pretty sure there was the possibility to declare your income in order to pay income tax.As a matter of fact, the Minitel was so useful for lots of stuff that it was still used by lots of people much after everyone realized it should all be replaced by internet.  Actually, it was still used at the beginning of this century (I personally used one to get some results of an exam, for instance).Anyway, my point:  when the internet came in, some people could easily have said:  "This internet thing sucks.  You can't do X with internet, but you can with the minitel."   Just replace X with whatever service was available on the minitel on that time, but not on internet (believe me, there were plenty).   Whoever was making that claim was right in a sense, but totally wrong in an other.Such a person would totally have failed to understand the meaning of the verb "can".  Even if some service was not available at this very moment on internet, the technological features of internet made it so clearly superior to the minitel that it was quite clear that at some point, those services would eventually be available on internet.Now, if people really love paying taxes, and if bitcoin becomes popular enough, there is nothing, at least conceptually, preventing the government to start accepting bitcoins as a payment of income tax.What the government does or does not is something that we decide.   The government does not dictate the direction society should take.  It should merely follows it.  And to do so it often has to adapt. That's pretty much the point I was trying to make with this thread.  Instead of invoking the weather, they'd rather not try to justify themselves at all."We print money because the weather was too bad"  Come on. It is a factor in the economy, but it's ridiculous to deal with it by printing money. Les virements bancaires mettent de un à trois jours ouvrés pour aboutir.    Et aujourd'hui, on est samedi. Thanks so much for pointing this out.  I really wish socialist-minded people could understand that:  ownership is not a static process, it's dynamic.  If you give something to someone, he might very well not know what to do with it and then he will sell it to someone else.  In the end, stuff end up belonging to people who are the most willing to own them:  those who are willing to pay, notably.  This is true for resources and means of production.   Giving them to people on an equal basis would only lead to a unstable economic situation which would rapidly end up back to the current situation again, at the cost of having confiscated stuff initially just to eventually fail to change anything. Merci pour ce rappel.D'ailleurs du temps de l'étalon-or, d'autres métaux étaient utilisés pour les transactions qui ne pouvaient pas raisonnablement se faire en or.    Argent et cuivre essentiellement.   Un point intéressant aussi est que ces monnaies secondaires émergaient souvent du fait d'initiatives privées, pour répondre à la demande en signes monétaires que l'état ne parvenait pas à satisfaire.Une conférence intéressante de Georges Selgin sur le sujet:The Private Supply of Money | George A. Selgin To be fair, there is a logic behind this.  I guess, in some perverted way, you can indeed solve any problem by printing money.Let's say you want to find the Higgs Boson  (random example).  How could it be possible that you can do such an extraordinary accomplishment by just printing money?Well, it's easy.  First, you need brain power.  And this, you have.  Thousands of people all around the word are smart enough to imagine a way to detect a Higgs Boson.  The problem is that it's difficult for them to convince other people (workers, engineers,...) to build a machine capable of doing that.The solution:  just print the money and give it to the smart people.  They will give it to workers in order to convince them to build the machine.  The workers don't know that this money has been freshly printed.  Or they don't care, as long as they can give it to someone who will not care either.   At the end, people accept to work for a money that has been devaluated, and I'm not sure they always realize that.  Basically, the whole thing is either a fraud if you disagree with it, or an illusion if you think it's just the magic of monetary policies.To me, it's a fraud, nothing else than money counterfeiting.   It should be a crime, even when the FED does it, and even if it's smart, good intended people who benefit from it. It's indeed a legend that during any speculative bubble, whenever the peak was close, we were hearing stories about some people having sold all their belongings and borrow tons of money to buy the speculation asset.   And indeed it was often interpreted as a sign that the crash was close.One difference is that I'm not sure all these stories happened in the internet age.  We live in a sea of information and the story of the OP pops up very easily.  We would never have heard of him so fast, had we used only telephone and physical mail to communicate.Now, does this thread nevertheless mean we are near a major correction back to 20$, 10$ or even less?    I don't know.   You tell me. Of course.  And obviously the solution to solve this is to print money.       Paper is magic. I'm naive enough to think it's possible to be interested in monetary alternatives, and then end up on the bitcoin Wikipedia article,  which is not supposed to promote bitcoin, just to inform about its existence make information about it available.That's how I got to know about it anyway. Also, I totally understand this guy and I think he proves a point I had tried to make several times.Basically he says that he had began suspecting bitcoin to be a Ponzi scheme whenever he started to receive tons of emails and other messages inviting him to learn about bitcoin and buy some.  I totally understand how it may have looked to him:  precisely like members of a pyramidal scheme trying their best to recruit new suckers.So I'll say it again:   please stop bitcoin proselytism. One can make a Ponzi scheme out of anything.  You basically just have to try very hard to have as many people as possible buy it at a higher price than the one you paid.  Don't do that with bitcoin.   Let people who need it or want to use it chose to do so by themselves. Never seen this exactly like this.  Quite an interesting point of view.  Thanks. Before I knew about bitcoin, I was a gold bug.  And I can assure you that on the forums where I was hanging out, there were quite a few people that indeed were trolling this idea that gold is a ponzi scheme.  I'm not exagerating in any way whatsoever.  I'd give you links but these forums were not in english. On the other hand, I think the Ponzi scheme accusation is a fair one, and that's why I think we really should stop promoting bitcoin as we too often do.  It's really too easy to interpret such noise as a way to bring new incomers in order to raise the price.I think for instance of the way some of us keep harassing Wikimedia to accept bitcoins, or Rick Valvinge's recent article making a prediction for a price at about on hundred thousand dollars or something.   This inevitably attracts skepticism and make the thing look like a scam.  Stop it, please.Just let people get to know about bitcoin by natural ways (the wikipedia page exists, after all), make their mind about it and use it as a medium of exchange whenever they need it.   We have perfectly natural, commercial and not speculative use cases for bitcoin:  gambling, Silk road, money transfer, IT services, donations and so on.   There is no need to blow whistles and ring bells everywhere to attract the random internet user. I've watched the video and what really pissed me off was the claim that six millions bitcoins were mined before the whole thing went public.Someone correct me if I'm wrong but Satoshi published his idea, with the source code about one month after he mined the first block, didn't he?  It's not his fault or any other's fault if very little people paid attention at this time.
Don't bother posting more indeed, what you wrote is a nice summary and it should be good enough. First time I read this, and yet I'm sure we've all thought of it at least once. Ok mais qu'est-ce qu'un "wallet" exactement?   Dans le wikipedia anglais il est écrit:« A wallet, or billfold, is a small, flat case that is used to carry personal items such as cash, credit cards, identification documents (driver's license, identification card, club card, etc.), photographs, business cards and other paper or laminated cards. Wallets are generally made of leather or fabrics, and they are usually pocket-sized and foldable. »Clairement un wallet c'est pas juste quelque chose conçu pour contenir des sous.  Ca peut contenir n'importe quel document qui a une forme "plate", d'où la traduction française de portefeuille, mais en faite porte-document serait presque aussi valable.L'aspect "feuille" c'est à dire "plat" de ce qui est contenu n'est pas très pertinent comme anologie pour les documents numériques.  Par contre, le concept de clef, lui, existe aussi bien dans le physique que dans le numérique.  D'où ma préférence pour le mot porte-clef. First, bitcoin exchange markets are not all bitcoin activity.  It's only one part of it.Second, you already provided your answer:  anyone can set up an exchange.  It's true that having a prominent exchange has some advantages in terms of liquidity and efficiency.   But it's up to you to come up with a solution to this if you think it's a problem.  Also, consider using bitcoin-otc or Ripple then.   They are the only decentralized exchanges that I know of. Je ne suis pas sûr de l'avoir déjà fait donc dans le doute je reposte cette idée.Je voudrais plaider pour l'utilisation du mot "porte-clef" au lieu de "porte-monnaie" ou "portefeuille" pour désigner le fichier "wallet.dat".C'est plus éloigné de la traduction littérale mais je trouve que ça évoque bien mieux ce dont il s'agit.Je sais aussi que ça relève du détail, mais bon, je tique à chaque fois que je lis "portemonnaie" ou "portefeuille". I can't help thinking this guy may have been hanging around here, possibly reading a post where I made a similar analogy I don't get your reasoning.       How exactly do you think this siphoning happens and why do you think nationalizing resources would change anything to it? Yep,  BTC-only tables would be much more of a significant step. Wow.   Is that the first mention of bitcoin in literature?   (though I guess the definition of what is and what is not literature is a bit blurry) http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-30/fed-maintains-85-billion-pace-of-purchases-as-growth-pauses.htmlWhenever you want to print money, any excuse will do. Bienvenue!Sinon, je propose une règle supplémentaire pour ce fil:  faites-nous savoir si vous comptez prononcer bitcoin à la française (comme dans "coin de table") ou à l'anglaise.  Personnellement, ma préférence va à la prononciation française. Exactly.We all knew from the very beginning that anyone could create a fork of bitcoin at anytime.  I'm not sure people even need to be reminded of that considering how obvious it is once you understand it's fully free and opensource software. Today I learnt about a pretty smart idea to prevent a password from being guessed by looking at the movements of the hand:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NmTPSgQjDs Ceci étant je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit très intéressant pour miner des bitcoins.  J'imagine que l'overclocking c'est utile surtout pour les jeux, mais le mining se parallélise très facilement donc il est probablement beaucoup plus efficace d'augmenter le nombre de cartes, plutôt que de chercher à accélérer celles dont on dispose. Salut.Et bien on en apprend tous les jours !   Je n'aurais jamais envisagé qu'on puisse faire tourner un PC en le refroidissant à l'azote liquide.  Tiens nous au courant dans la section mining et hardware. Je ne pense pas que tu as besoin de transférer des euros très rapidement.  Ni même des bitcoins.Si tes avoirs sont suffisants sur les deux sites, tu dois pouvoir arbitrer avec un compte consolidant les deux.   Si jamais tu atteins un seuil sur l'un des comptes, tu peux prendre le temps nécessaire pour équilibrer.  Ça n'a pas à être aussi rapide que les transactions en temps réel, seulement en moyenne.Attention je dis ça mais je n'ai jamais pratiqué personnellement, c'est juste mon avis. Lorsque c'est possible, en général il y a quelqu'un qui le fait.  Ça s'appelle l'arbitrage.Les arbitragistes font disparaître les opportunités d'arbitrage, de telle sorte que pour quelqu'un qui n'est pas habitué à le faire, tout se passe comme si l'arbitrage était impossible.   Ça s'appelle l'hypothèse des marchés efficients, je crois. It does work but for some reason the bitcoin forum software keeps adding http in front of the adress, so you need to type it manually:Code:ftp://ftp.disi.unige.it/pub/.person/MoraF/MaterialeCTC/UNLINKED/CohenFrey.pdf Do you have the authorization of the authors to post this? Damn it I wanted to post that.Of course the Hurd.  Anyone who wants to experiment with exotic OS should try hurd.Also Haiku.  Never managed to make it run but it seems interesting.
No, I confess I did not.    I just read the part when you said you would use your student loan to buy some bitcoins. It's not just risky and retarded, it's irresponsible.  You will borrow some money for you to gamble with.  So in a nutshell, in case your plan fails, you intend to tell you creditor:  «  Sorry I lost everything, I can't pay you back. »   At some point in history some people would have broken your legs for that.Just look at the 2011 crash and think again. Yep.  The amount of ass wiping and kneeling in front of international bankers is probably enormous. I'm in and I bring the beer: C'est effectivement le credo derrière de nombreuses conceptions libérales, en effet.Ripple c'est très bien en tant que système de paiement et d'emprunt.  En tant que monnaie j'ai des doutes, à cause de l'aggregat total quasiment aléatoire.  J'ai ouvert un fil sur le sujet dans la section "Hors-sujet".Edit:  oops je m'aperçois que tu es au courant pour le fil sur Ripple puisque c'est avec toi que j'ai discuté sur ce fil.  Désolé j'avais pas mémorisé ton pseudo. Indeed, after all it's not like a new form of money is created every year.  Rather once in a millennium. If I were to guess, I'd blame young men working in the financial sector.   They do it quietly and slowly, but they do have lots of money to spend (after all, the fact that they get lots of money easily is part of the reason why bitcoin exists in the first place).     When bitcoin reaches 50$, wich at current speed might be just next week  ,  I'll sell a bit of my stock, take the plane to Amsterdam and spend it all in champagne, weed, prostitutes and cocaine. And you?    Il me vient une analogie à l'esprit.Imagine que Satoshi Nakamoto arrive dans un village au volant d'un camion de marchandises.  A l'intérieur, pleins de trucs que les villageois pourraient désirer.  Disons des petits pains, pour fixer les idées.  Parce que Nakamoto est quelqu'un de super cool, il décide de donner ses petits pains aux villageois, sans rien demander en échange.  Il y a au moins deux manières de faire ça.La première méthode est un peu laborieuse.  Il se débrouille pour réunir tous les villageois autour du camion, et il procède à une distribution.  Un petit pain par personne.   Il fait la distribution lui-même, et à chaque fois qu'il donne un petit pain, il marque la main du villageois avec une encre spéciale, ou un truc du genre.  Comme ça aucun villageois ne peut faire la queue plusieurs fois pour recevoir plus d'un petit pain.La deuxième méthode est plus radicale.   Satoshi ouvre grand les portes du camion, prend un mégaphone et lance:« Petits pains gratuits:  servez-vous! »L'une des méthodes est-elle plus injuste que l'autre?  Je ne pense pas.  Non, pas "équitable".  "équitable" vient de "équité", lié à la notion de justice.  Il n'y a rien d'injuste dans le fait que quelqu'un possède plus de bitcoins qu'un autre.Parle de répartition inégale si tu veux, mais pas de "inégalitaire" ou "inéquitable" qui ont clairement une connotation.   Le fait que la réparition des richesses est inégale dans le monde n'est pas nouveau, et il est loin d'être évident que ce soit injuste.C'est une question plus intéressante qu'il n'y parait et qui mérite un développement.  J'écrirai sur le sujet un de ces quatre.En attendant, tu peux rechercher "Stéphane Laborde" sur Google.  Ça va te plaire amha. Nothing prevents that.  But at least everyone can do something like that.  So it's "fair".Yes, nobody can foresee which data will be included in the future genesis block.  Not even me.  As I said it will be the hash of the first bitcoin block for this day. D'abord, il n'y a pas à proprement parler de "répartition initiale", car les bitcoins ne sont pas attribués d'un coup d'un seul, c'est un processus continu qui a encore lieu en ce moment.Ensuite, toi tu écris "inégalitaire" et je ne suis pas d'accord avec ce qualificatif.  Les règles sont les mêmes pour tout le monde, donc pour moi c'est égalitaire.On ne donne pas à boire à un âne qui n'a pas soif.  Donc je ne vois pas comment on aurait pu faire en sorte que tout le monde possède des bitcoins au départ.   Les gens ne s'y intéressaient pas au début donc ils n'en avaient pas, puis avec le temps et le cours qui monte ces même gens rappliquent ici et se plaignent de ne pas en avoir.  Y'a comme un yatus, là.Edit:   Tiens, ton post m'a motivé pour publier une idée que j'ai depuis un moment:  une annonce de fork un an à l'avance. I'm kind of annoyed by all those people who keep complaining about the initial distribution on bitcoin, how it is unfair that early adopters get rich as the price of one bitcoin climbs up etc.   So, what could be done about it?Well, here is an idea: a one year announcement of a bitcoin fork.  Let's call it "faircoin".Faircoin is a fork of bitcoin.  Exactly the same software, just slightly modified so it does not interfere with bitcoin (different port number, version number and stuff like that).The most significant different part is the time at which the genesis block would be created:   one year in the future.  Starting from today.  So in other words:  on march, the 5th 2014 midnight UTC.I will create it and I will put the block hash of the first bitcoin block of this day, just as Satoshi used the title of the Times newspaper.  So nobody (not even me) will be capable of premining faircoins.Everybody should let everyone know this will happen (or not, I'm just suggesting the idea, I don't plan on actually doing it).  So all those frustrated morons should get ready to mine their faircoins.I have reasons to believe this would fail, or at least it would not meet the requirement of "fairness" the frustrated morons would hope.  But I don't feel like explaining it to them.  I might as well let them figure it out by themselves. No need to defend yourself.   There was no irony in my remark. Interesting comparison. Point valide.  En tout cas tu noteras que ça ne se résume pas à "être là au bon moment".Déjà discuté maintes fois.  Un système dans lequel la monnaie serait distribuée à part égales entre les individus serait complètement différent et très difficile à mettre en oeuvre, car il faudrait empêcher que certains puissent recevoir plus que leur part, ce qui impliquerait une sorte de fichage drastique de tous les individus.PS.  Je viens de vérifier:  j'ai créé l'article Bitcoin en octobre 2010 et un lien vers cet article dans la section "voir aussi" de monnaie électronique le même jour.  À cette époque, un bitcoin valait dix centimes d'euros environ et il était encore possible de miner avec un matériel informatique standard.  Alors s'il vous plait épargnez-nous l'argument selon lequel l'information était limitée aux initiés ou aux anglophones. Qu'est-ce que tu entends par "être là au bon moment"?  Satoshi a publié son annonce à tout le monde.   N'importe qui pouvait être au courant dès février 2009.  Il fallait juste s'intéresser au sujet et reconnaître la pertinence du concept.On ne peut pas forcer l'information dans la tête des gens.  Il est logique que ceux qui vont la chercher en disposent plus rapidement que ceux qui s'attendent à ce qu'elle vienne à eux toute seule. Moi je trouve ça plutôt rassurant qu'on ne puisse pas polluer la chaîne avec de petites transactions faites comme ça "pour du beurre".  Encore une fois, l'acceptation des transactions est entièrement laissée à l'appréciation des mineurs.  Si parmi eux certains décident qu'il est important de laisser passer les micro-transactions, alors ces mineurs-là se spécialiseront.Et puis tu as essayé un milli-bitcoin et ça n'est pas passé mais je suis presque sûr que les centi-bitcoins passent de nos jours (cad des montants de quelques centimes à un euro) Oui il y a quelqu'un mais bon ta question est quand même drôlement pointue donc sois patient.
This led me to supernumerary nipple where I saw this:And yes indeed it's exactly how it looks on my torso.Now all I need is to find a golden gun   You like programming?  You have lots of spare time?  You've always been interested in biology, genetics, evolution and whatnot, but you never actually took any course in these fields?Then check-out http://rosalind.info.  It's free, it can be fun if you like puzzles, and who knows, you might actually contribute to the progress of science. I actually have 3 nipples.  Yes, like one of the bad guys in some James Bond movie I can't recall. Faut relativiser quand même.  On parle du change, là.  Les transactions en bitcoins ce ne sont heureusement pas que des échanges inter-devises.  D'ailleurs, MtGox a déjà été infiltré et bitcoin a survécu.En outre, tout utilisateur de sites d'échange devrait garder à l'esprit la possibilité d'une défaillance du site ou d'une intrusion, et par conséquent ne devrait jamais laisser une part significative de ses avoirs sur ces sites.   Si tout le monde garde ça à l'esprit, une relative centralisation du marché des changes n'est pas un gros problème, comparé à l'avantage que ça apporte en termes de liquidité. D'accord aussi, mais concernant les marchés il y a un phénomène dagrégation qui dépasse largement l'économie.  Un individu a plus de chance de faire de bonnes affaires s'il joint un groupe où il y a beaucoup de monde.  Du coup encore plus de monde s'y réunit et y'a comme une sorte de rétroaction qui pousse à une centralisation de fait.Comme je le disais dans un autre fil, la centralisation en soi n'est pas mauvaise, du moment qu'elle n'est pas imposée. Je ne vois pas de quoi tu parles, là. Je n'ai pas vérifié ces chiffres mais ça ne me parait pas aberrant.MtGox ne fait pas dans l'amateurisme donc oui ils gèrent ce genre de montants. Isn't that the business model for any commercial activity?  You make something and you hope people will want to buy it? Then you don't talk about "world currency", rather about an efficient international exchange market.  And yes, it would be great and again, ripple is going in that direction.  But it's not something that bitcoin should do, since bitcoin is not designed to do that.  It is something that should be done by whoever/whatever can do it. The difference is that bitcoin does not plan on being a unique world currency.  It's a liberal currency so it is supposed to compete in a free monetary market.A decentralized exchange market would indeed be very much welcome, and Ripple seems to be a serious step in that direction.  I don't know why you say it would be a world currency though. WARNING:  no direct mention of bitcoinCompanies struggle to popularize mobile moneyMobile money may seem like a hot concept, but consumers aren't warming to it. At the world's largest cellphone trade show, here in Barcelona this week, the 70,000 attendees are encouraged to use their cellphones instead their keycards to get past the turnstiles at the door. But very few people took the chance to do that. The process of setting up the phone to act as a keycard proved too much of a hassle.Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2013-03-companies-struggle-popularize-mobile-money.html#jCpI've made a comment mentioning bitcoin. If nobody forces me to wear one, and if they are fully open-source, I'm not sure why it would be a bad thing.Instead of centralization, I'd rather talk about specialization.  The more difficult a task is, the less more specialized people do it.  It's a perfectly normal process that has existed pretty much since neolithics.   What matters is that everybody has the right to specialize in whatever field they want to invest their time/energy/brain in.So as long as bitcoins remain a public and open-source protocol, there's nothing to worry about.If it was that simple to control bitcoin, Silk Road would have been shutted down long ago.  Un truc à savoir concernant grub et linux sur USB:  c'est en général une bonne idée de laisser de la place en début du périphérique pour que Grub puisse y loger l'amorce du noyau.   Donc la première partition doit être placée quelques megaoctets après le début du disque.  J'ai récemment du déplacer toute ma partition avec gparted à cause de ça.Sinon, je doute un peu qu'un OS minant des bitcoins puisse faire l'économie d'un accès fréquent à un disque conventionnel.  Même pendant la recherche de la preuve de calcul, le logiciel doit recevoir les nouvelles transactions et les vérifier.  Donc je ne pense pas que tu pourras faire en sorte que ton disque se mette en sommeil. Une transaction est sérialisée en une séquence binaire.  La taille de cette transaction est simplement la longueur de cette séquence.En pratique, cette longueur dépend surtout du nombre d'entrées et de sorties, et éventuellement du script (toute transaction comporte un script écrit dans un langage propre à bitcoin) si celui-ci est un tant soit peu exotique. QUAND L'EUROPE SAUVE SES BANQUES, QUI PAYE ?50 milliards d'euros en Grèce, 70 milliards en Irlande, 40 milliards en Espagne : au sein de la zone euro, les États se sont vus contraint les uns après les autres - moyennant des sommes astronomiques - de venir en aide aux banques pour compenser les pertes subies suite à des prêts pourris. Mais qui sont les bénéficiaires de telles opérations ?C'est en posant cette question très simple qu'Harald Schumann, essayiste en économie et brillant journaliste, sillonne l'Europe. Et obtient des réponses pour le moins sidérantes. Car ceux qui ont été "sauvés" ne se trouvent pas - comme on tend à vouloir nous le faire croire - dans les pays en détresse, mais surtout en Allemagne et en France. En effet, une part importante des sommes débloquées finit dans les caisses des créanciers de ces banques sauvées. Quant aux financiers qui ont fait de mauvais investissements, ils se retrouvent protégés contre toute perte aux frais de la collectivité. Et ce contrairement aux règles de l'économie de marché. Pourquoi ? Qui encaisse l'argent ?(Allemagne, 2013, 52mn)RBBhttp://videos.arte.tv/fr/videos/quand-l-europe-sauve-ses-banques-qui-paye--7340782.html It takes a bit of time sometimes to update. An other way would be to use XRP as a proxy but right now I guess the spread in the order book is too large for you to make it without losing a lot of money.I'm currently trying to fill the order book of bitstamp's BTC/XRP,  but I'm not used to these kind of stuff so I only do very small amounts. Si je ne m'abuse, de telles transactions peuvent être acceptées mais les mineurs ont tendance à les ignorer donc ça peut prendre énormément de temps.C'est une mesure de base pour éviter le spam.   Encore une fois, si vous voulez faire joujou avec des milli ou microbitcoins, utilisez le réseau de test. Vous pouvez utiliser le réseau de test pour ça.  Une fois connecté, vous pouvez demander des testcoins sur le canal #bitcoin-dev de Freenode. La transaction est touchée par le validateur du bloc.   N'importe qui peut valider des blocs, mais les chances d'y parvenir avant tout le monde sont proportionnelles à la puissance de calcul disponible.   Il faut en général disposer d'un matériel spécifique.
Je ne sais pas ça fait un bail que je n'ai pas utilisé µtorrent, mais j'imagine qu'il doit y avoir une entrée dédiée dans la section "File" de la barre de menu.Sinon, la vidéo semble toujours disponible sur le site d'arte:http://videos.arte.tv/fr/do_search/videos/recherche?q=bitcoin No you're not being carried away.  If Ripple works as it claims, it's really revolutionary.  It's to credit what bitcoin is to money.But I have some doubts about the non-colluding idea for solving the double spending problem.  And also about the size of the database.   Overall, about the robustness of the technological aspects.I guess we have to try it to see if it works. Au risque de me répéter: Ripple est bien plus un moyen de paiement (dans n'importe quelle monnaie) qu'une monnaie.  D'ailleurs, à la base la monnaie ripple a pour unique but de servir à taxer les transactions pour éviter les abus:« The Ripple payment system also contains a virtual currency called ripples (XRP). These are the internal currency used by the system to protect the network from abuse. By requiring a fraction of a ripple for every transaction, the network prevents an attacker from creating too many transactions and overloading the system. »Comme les transactions sous Ripple visent à être plus rapides que bitcoin, j'imagine qu'il fallait une monnaie propre au système.C'est possible au moins en théorie, mais amha ce serait compliqué, et lent.   Si je me souviens bien Satoshi lui-même s'était penché sur le sujet et en a discuté sur ce forum je crois.  Il faudrait utiliser le système de script interne pour faire bien plus de choses que ce qui est fait déjà.   La base des transactions est déjà assez grande comme ça, je te laisse imaginer si il devait gérer des IOU sur d'autres monnaies et des carnets d'ordres.   Pour beaucoup, mais pas pour tout le monde.  Je ne t'apprends sûrement rien si je te dis qu'il y a des tas de gens qui souhaiteraient une version avec inflation par exemple.  Ces monnaies existent déjà d'ailleurs:  freicoin, litecoin, etc.   Les adeptes de bitcoins sont en général favorables à la notion de liberté monétaire, et dans un contexte de liberté monétaire, une infrastructure distribuée pour faire du change serait un outil formidable pour que malgré nos divergences sur nos conceptions de la monnaie, on puisse quand même faire affaire ensemble.Et puis moi ce qui m'intéresse surtout avec Ripple, c'est qu'à terme on peut espérer pouvoir l'utiliser pour échanger n'importe quel actif financier, pas seulement des monnaies.  Je pense notamment aux actions et aux titres de créances.   Le Ripple en tant que devise monétaire n'est vraiment que la partie émergée de l'iceberg. It may be a very heuristic rule, but it might very well be true    It's tough and tedious to put all possibilities in one poll.  I tried to put just the main lines.Edit:  added a "this poll sucks" answer. Only 37 votes.  Come on guys; Oui bien sûr.  Mais ça n'a pas grand chose à voir avec ripple.  Je comprends mal où tu veux en venir.Bitcoin et Ripple sont tous les deux à la fois une monnaie et un moyen de paiement.   Ils diffèrent dans leurs qualités respectives pour ces deux aspects.Tel que je vois les choses, Bitcoin est une excellente monnaie, mais pas extraordinaire comme moyen de paiement.  Tandis que Ripple est un excellent moyen de paiement, mais pas terrible comme monnaie.Et puis surtout, Ripple a un système de trading décentralisé intégré.   Et ça, si ça fonctionne vraiment, c'est révolutionnaire. Personne.  Je pense qu'il est important de rappeler qu'un prêt existe au moins implicitement dès lors que tu as un compte quelque part.Par exemple, l'une des passerelles (gateway) de Ripple est actuellement Bitstamp.  J'ai ouvert un compte chez eux pour l'occasion, et j'ai déposé 0.7 BTC.   Ça signifie que je fait confiance en Bitstamp pour me restituer au moins 0.7 BTC à n'importe quel moment.   En d'autres termes, je leur ai prêté 0.7 BTC.Ripple permet de transférer cette confiance.   Si d'autres utilisateurs de Ripple font aussi confiance à Bitstamp pour un montant égal ou supérieur, alors je peux transférer au plus 0.7 BTC vers un autre utilisateur de Ripple.Maintenant imaginez que tous les sites d'échanges de bitcoins utilisent Ripple (j'espère qu'ils le feront très vite).  Alors ripple pourrait être utiisé comme une infrastructure de trading décentralisée et universelle, les sites d'échanges n'agissant plus que comme passeralles.Bref, quand on dit que Ripple est un système permettant le prêt de personne à personne, il faut entendre "personne" dans un sens très large.  Je n'ai aucune envie de prêter ou d'emprunter de l'argent à un particulier, fût-il un proche ou un ami.  Par contre pouvoir le faire avec les établissements financiers avec lesquels je fais des affaires, je trouve ça très intéressant. There are at least two meanings in the word value:  there is the "numerical" value, which I was referring to, and there is the "exchange" value, which indeed is subjective. I'm not sure I see where you want to go here.  My point anyway was that to me money must have a fixed total amount, otherwise it does not make much sense.If I receive a note of 10 XXX and I have no idea how many XXX there is in total then this 10 number means really nothing.  There could as well have been written "blue" on it, it would have meant the same.What money does is what matters.  Like inches and centimeters.  They are two different units of measures, but they do the same thing, measuring lengths.   Now if some people want to use an elastic to measure lengths, they can, but to me it's silly. Anyway, I think this project is awesome because at some point, all markets could work with such a system.   Imagine the bond and stock market being democratized like this. No.  It's not the actual nature of the the work that is stored in money, it's its value.Your hour of programming was exchanged against something, usually a salary.  Those two things are thus considered, at least temporarily, of equal value.   Exchange defines an equivalence relation.   Now, an hour of programming from a better programmer would have been paid better.   This defines an order relation.  Equivalence and order relations are the basis of the concept of quantity.So in a nutshell, money quantifies the value of exchanged goods and services.  That's why as a tool for measuring quantities, a fixed amount makes sense. Yes, that's why credit is useful even in a economy with a commodity-based money.  And that's why Ripple and Bitcoin can work together.   But a credit has to be a promise to pay something at some point, something that is not a credit.  Otherwise the whole thing does not make sense.   C'est plus compliqué que ça je pense.  J'écrirai un texte sur le sujet un de ces quat'.  Et sur un autre fil de discussion. Oui et d'ailleurs j'ai posté mon addresse Ripple.  Mais je n'ai rien encore reçu. Yes, we can agree on that.This is indeed a big question mark.   I would say that when the FED reserve gave up on the gold convertibility in 1971, the price of gold did not collapse.   So I guess a commodity money such as bitcoin will still make sense.  I will stick to it for long and medium term savings, anyway. Ben je vois au moins deux risques:1.  des IOU, on peut en émettre autant qu'on veut.  Donc la quantité que je possède n'a aucune valeur en soi, elle dépend totalement de la quantité totale en circulation, qui peut varier de façon imprédictible.2.  le risque moral.  Les IOU sont des promesses de paiement, et les promesses n'engagent que ceux qui y croient. Good idea.  I was also wondering if the trust system is persistent or retro-active. Here you are:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=146555.msg1555215#msg1555215 I think it could be even better than that.  As I wrote on IRC, this is the closest thing from a decentralised banking system I've ever seen.
Ben oui.  Et les premiers (360 XRP),  on me les a gracieusement donné sur IRC.  C'est pour ça que je ne comprenais pas ta remarque.  N'importe qui peut avoir des Ripple dès maintenant.La preuve que non.  Il y a déjà plein de gens qui l'utilisent.  Il y a au moins le carnet d'ordre des IOU de bitstamp qui est plein. My take on a Ripple opinion poll. I'll make a poll, because I suspect this is going to be a bit controversial. Bah, pour la même raison que je ne suis pas multi-millaire en bitcoins, j'imagine.  Je suis trop timoré dans mes placements.En plus j'ai fait une erreur de trading et depuis je suis retombé à trois mille ripple et des poussières.Tu es sûr qu'il n'ont pas lancé quelque chose d'équivalent ailleurs?Moi en général quand on m'annonce que demain on rasera gratis, je suis sceptique. Where is the thread where I could tell everyone how awesome I think this project is? What do you mean? Bienvenue.Je redécouvre Ripple en ce moment.  Avant je connaissais en gros le concept mais je trouvais ça très théorique et j'avais des doutes sur la faisabilité.  Mais là depuis que j'ai essayé la beta je trouve ça vraiment bien fichu.Par contre je ne sais pas si on peut parler d'alternative.  Ripple permet d'échanger des IOU et c'est extrêmement utile pour les échanges d'actifs et de devises.  Donc notamment le trading.Par contre en tant que monnaie... hum...  Pour moi il est hors de question de conserver une part significative de mon épargne dans des IOU. Je comprends mal ce point de vue.  Moi j'ai déjà plus de 9,000 XRP: I can't give trust to bitstamp:And then:What am I missing? It seems to me this thing could make bitcoin-otc obsolete.  Am I wrong? I'm currently trying to get Ripple BTC IOUs by using Bitstamp as a Gateway.This is actually quite fun. ok let's do this. Yes and no.Yes, because indeed the exchange system in Ripple is P2P, so it's very difficult for the government to stop it.No, because Ripple is also vulnerable, at least because of its Gateways.  However, I presume if Ripple is successful, then the internal fiat currencies could be used per se and then the system would not need gateways anymore. I'm ok to receive your 0.1 bitinstandUSD, but I can't establish any trust right now, as I'm told:« You have to be funded before you can grant a trust » Pour ceux qui veulent discuter de Ripple en français,  c'est ici.Perso je viens de découvrir le système.  Il existait déjà avant je crois mais j'avais jamais vraiment compris comment c'était sensé fonctionner.  Depuis peu c'est beaucoup plus clair.Le point le plus original du système ça me parait être le système des validateurs non-concertant. (non-colluding)  En gros l'état de la base est certifié par un ensemble de noeuds qui est différent pour chaque noeud.  Chacun doit sélectionner des noeuds pour lesquels il est estimé qu'il y a peu de risque qu'ils mentent de façon coordonnée pour tromper le système. Je trouve ça assez malin.Ce qui est séduisant aussi c'est l'idée de transférer et d'échanger n'importe quel actif au sein d'une même infrastructure.  C'est un truc qui manque cruellement au bitcoin.Bref, à suivre de très près si vous voulez mon avis. From what I understand, such an attack would be successful only if the bots are capable of convincing other humans (or even other bots) to elect them as validators.  Humans will probably chose other humans as validators, so those bots would need to pass a Turing test.Of course, the attack could be done only with humans but then it would require quite a lot of human work.  Here I am:rpuebQXsR7kAst5yidD6fmGmJHD4niXzbo Just read the wiki page about Consensus.   Basically it's a system where each node trusts a particular set of validators who are believed not to collude to about the ledger.It seems quite smart.From what I understand, one needs to find people to trust not to be the same person or working together to screw you, though.  It should not be too difficult, I guess. rpuebQXsR7kAst5yidD6fmGmJHD4niXzbo Tu peux, mais faut coder.  En gros tu dois intégrer un client bitcoin (ou utiliser des RPC) dans le fonctionnement de ton serveur.  C'est sûrement pas très compliqué mais ça demande un peu de boulot.Si tout ce dont tu as besoin c'est de vérifier qu'un client a payé, je suppose que tu peux simplement utiliser bitcoind et l'une des commandes getreceivedbyaccount ou getreceivedbyaddress, selon que chacun de tes clients est identifié par un compte ou par une adresse.Tu peux voir ici une aide complète sur les commandes de l'API:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list
Don't tell me that.  I only use free software.  My sources.list has no "non-free" entry whatsoever. I think the OP was not trying to claim he intended to realize such a scheme.  It was rather a way of pointing out proprietary bitcoin clients which could indeed be following such an evil plan. Ok.  Maintenant là où je ne comprends pas c'est pourquoi tu as besoin de faire appel à une société pour l'encaissement. Perso je ne comprends pas grand chose à ton problème.  Je ne saisis pas bien ce que tu entends par "activer les comptes utilisateurs".Normalement si tu ne souhaites pas accéder au marché des changes pour convertir tes bitcoins vers une monnaie nationale, tu n'as pas besoin d'utiliser les services d'un tiers comme Bitpay ou coinbase.  Avec un peu de code, tu peux tout faire toi-même.  Agreed.  Creating a new country is not just about having a territory.  It's much more about being able to defend it. Oui en effet.  Mais le fait est qu'ils acceptent bel et bien les bitcoins, c'est déjà ça! It would be a bad thing if an old transaction is totally forgotten, indeed.  It's quite unlikely to happen, though.  Say the probability for one client to forget a given transaction is p.   Then the probability for all clients to forget it, assuming the probabilities are independant, is p^N, where N is the number of clients.   So it is quite unlikely.Normally, yes.   But I'm not sure it's absolutely necessary.  If a spent transaction has been forgotten by all the network it means all clients have agreed to acknowledge this transaction to be valid and the bitcoins spent.  So you have to trust the network as a whole, as you do when you suppose that a majority of the computing power is honest.Such servers would not be "central" since anyone could make one at any time. This++Last time I checked, in a supposedly free country, what is not forbidden is authorized.

N'hésitez pas à laisser vos évaluations sur bictcoin-otc.com When too much noise is made about bitcoin, detractors are prone to point out that bitcoin users try to attract new users to whom they can sell their bitcoins at a record high.  So media noise about bitcoin really makes it look like a Ponzi scheme.It's much better if media shut the f..k up about bitcoin and let bitcoin users use it with serenity.We should aim at going forward sans tambour ni trompette (without trumpet or drum), as we say in french. I do hoard because the amounts of bitcoins I own is not that big.  Were I to sell my bitcoins into euros, I would have no idea about what to do with this money.  I already have stock holdings and I'm not confindent enough about that to increase my positions there.I can sell a few bitcoins from times to times to buy stuff.  But the most of it, the only reason I could imagine to sell it would be if the selling could allow me to afford buying real estate or something.Otherwise, there is no way I stop hoarding bitcoins and start hoarding fiat instead.   I don't know what so hard to understand.In a nutshell, can someone tell me why hoarding bitcoins is bad, while selling them so I can hoard euros would be good??If hoarding is bad, it should not matter in which currency it is done. Freemoney can not buy anything from you since you don't value bitcoin.  He can only get value from his bitcoins by selling them or buying goods and services from people who willingly accept to give that much value into bitcoins.  So it's really not unjust in any way.As for LTC (litecoin iirc?), I don't know much about this thing but if you think it's better than bitcoin for whatever reason, go for it. Quite an interesting article today in phys.org:http://phys.org/news/2013-02-self-repairing.htmlExtract from the PDF:« In the past century, continuous advancements in the fieldsof electronics and computer science have made moderncomputers extremely powerful computing machines. The vastmajority of their architectures are loyal to the conventional vonNeumann design which has now reached well over half acentury in age. Unfortunately, nature is organized in aninherently different manner, without any sense of program ordata memory and certainly without a sequential state machinetraversing through well-defined states. In order to moreefficiently model natural systems, the serial, deterministic andcentralized design of conventional computers should bereplaced with a parallel, stochastic and distributed architecture. » It's the same kind of impact (atmospheric impact), but Tunguska was much more powerful.  We can see on videos that trees were standing still, while in Tunguska square miles of trees were laid down. http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/15/breaking_huge_meteor_explodes_over_russia.htmlAs far as I know, it's the first time such a big meteor is so well documented. Memes are not something to discuss.  You create them, you release them in cyberspace, and you let them live or die. Blame the web.   Let me tell you why.There are at least two ways someone can learn about bitcoin.1.  you are concerned about the global economy and monetary policy so you do some personal research about currency and modern alternatives.  Then eventually you find out the Wikipedia page about bitcoin.2.  you find an article about it on your preferred website.  It's pure chance as this website usually don't speak about this kind of stuff in particular.If you were in the first case, there is no reason why many people should have learnt about bitcoin in the same time as you.  Because you learnt about if from your initiative.  So if you start buying bitcoins it won't change the price much.In the second case, it's very different.  An army of registered readers will suddenly learn about bitcoin more or less in the same time.  Even if only 10% of them think it is a good idea, it is still a lot of people.  And of course, they will all rush to buy a few bitcoins.  And here you have an effect in the price.  Had those people stretched their purchase on a slightly larger period of time, the price would probably not have been affected.   But no, they had to act all together, like a hurd.It's not our fault if people behave like cattle. Speculators are not just throwing money randomly everywhere.  They try to see what the future will be like, usually with a rational analysis.  By doing so, they propagate price information in the market and this price information has a lot of economics value.  It is basically intelligence that can be exploited by economics agents in order to foresee what will be the future needs and trends. To me the image is just fine as it is. The face of this guy on this picture is epic. Guys, the top comment is a defense of the current monetary system by Hank from the scishow:« Real currencies don't add capital at a weird, algorithmically defined time, they add capital when someone takes out a﻿ loan, creates value exceeding the worth of that loan, and pays the loan back...thus the capital added corresponds to the value added. Removing actual value addition from the equation seems dangerous to me. » Found this one on reddit:Probably initially made by a bitcoin hater, but still awesome!!          By the way, as anyone ever suggested Satoshi makes a AMA on reddit?If he really wants to stay anonymous, I guess he could use ToR. Just one short mention of bitcoin.http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/xkcd-style-comic-generator/ Instead of using BitPay, I'm pretty sure they'd rather copy them and offer a similar service if it appears to them that BitPay is totally safe juridically.   I think that's why it's called "panic sell".  It's emotional, not rational. Isn't "below 10$" and "single digit" the same answer??
We know Eric Schmidt knows about bitcoin and likes the idea.   I suspect their concerns are juridic. I wonder if he's gonna put a bitcoin donation address from now on... Not really press, but this happens to be one of my two prefered YouTube channel.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_9R45RLNR0 No mention of bitcoin here. Sure, but unfortunately it's not mathematically fully convincing according to Brian Greene for instance.  Otherwise all physicists would be Everettian. Doesn't Bitpay make this information public? Oh, I missed that part.  Well, maybe for them it's a start, and they plan on turning it into a currency later.PS.  IPO is a different matter.   In an IPO, it's the capital of the company that is distributed.  Whereas if a company creates its own currency, it's usually as a unit of account for selling its products.    Very different. There is no reason why this currency should fail, as it makes total sense for a company to emit its own currency.In fact, when one believes in monetary freedom, private currencies like this are something one should expect and look forward to.  By any means, I think it's good that big companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Amazon and so on emit their own currency with their signatures.This with a free and efficient market exchange between all these currencies would depict the perfect picture of a libertarian notion of money. Come on guys.  It's not so hard to understand.If you propose to donate money but only in a currency they feel skeptical about (for whatever reason), it's easy for them to think it looks like a nigerian scam or a foot-in-the-door technique.They've known about bitcoin for quite some time now.  We've tried many times to convince them.  So unless you have new arguments, let it go.Were they inclined to accept bitcoin, they would have done so long ago. This is silly.  Stop harassing them guys.  I'm pretty sure it's counter-productive. I've been waiting for this stuff for quite some time.  I'm happy someone finally had the means and will to do it.Hopefully they won't just do pizza.  There is a whole market for online shopping for plenty of stuff, including groceries.  All this could be paid with bitcoins thanks to such a broker service. Well, it's kind of a good thing, isn't it?    I mean, bitcoin is a tool.  Here we talk about it.  Elsewhere, people use it. Interesting example, though it is probably indeed exaggerated.I guess journalists don't care much about concepts.  They want results, facts. « Bulgarie, .. , Pologne, République tchèque, Roumanie, Slovaquie, Slovénie, » ??Je veux bien croire qu'ils ont 2% de francophones, mais de là à les lister dans les pays francophones, c'est un peu tiré par les cheveux, quand même. Survivalists gather lots of stuff, store them in a nuclear shelter, and protect it all with heavy weapons.So I don't worry too much about their gold.  First time I ever see the word "bitcoin" used as a verb.   Sounds nice.Next time you want to ask someone if he's bitcoin aware, just ask him: Do you bitcoin? Sure.  Inviting him could not hurt.  But I'm pretty sure he'll decline politely.Come on guys, let's face it.  If we want Wikipedia to accept bitcoin donations, it's much more for bitcoin than for Wikipedia.  You know it would be a big advertisement for bitcoin.  We can't be partial about this. Can anyone remind me why noone has made a bitcoin-friendly fork of Wikipedia already? Everett's interpretation is actually quite popular amongst physicists IIRC.http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1069See question 12.Copenhagen 42%Information   24%Everett         18%  Amazingly enough, I had never thought of this analogy before!
Sure, but in socialism you don't have the right to sell your share or to buy some.  In liberalism, you can.  Shares are then conveniently called "shares" or "stocks". A nice quote from Peter Sunde in the Pirate Bay documentary:« They know how to make money before and they don't want to change.  They're like the Amish.  They don't want electricity.  They know how to make do without electricity. »Somehow, I think the comparison is a bit related to bitcoin. Le problème c'est qu'il n'est pas facile de discerner la cause de la conséquence là-dedans.  Tu dis que le manque d'informations en langue française est la raison du manque d'intérêt des francophones, mais je pourrais aussi dire que c'est l'inverse:  le manque d'intérêt des francophones est la cause du manque de sources en langue française. Would this include a rule such as "Ok guys, from now on and during four years, we will obey to XXX" ? But the issue with anarchism is that the rule is that there is no rule.  It's kind of an oxymoron.  Anarcho-socialism only makes it more obvious. Oui.  C'est le risque de marché, je crois. /mode sarcasme ONLa France est, avec Cuba et la Corée du Nord, l'un des derniers bastions communistes.  Sa population active est majoritairement constituée de chomeurs et de fonctionnaires, dont les revenus dépendent directement de la capacité de l'Etat à emprunter de la monnaie.  Il est donc normal que les français voient d'un mauvais oeil toute initiative non-étatique dans le domaine monétaire./mode sarcasme OFF I also noticed the marxist phraseology, especially when he claimed that free trade was a mutual exploitation of the needs of each trader.   But I didn't mind.  Being marxist is not a crime, and I do not completely object this idea of a mutual exploitation instead of a mutual cooperation.  If you exploit someone, you do it for your own good.  So if two people exploit one another, in the end they both do it for their own good.   It's more of a point of view than anything else.  It seems to me that Adam Smith was saying the same thing but differently when he talked about the invisible hand acting for the good everyone from the pursue of selfish individual interests.Anyway, what I liked in his text was the description of how bitcoin works, and his thoughts about money and private property.  I especially liked his analysis of money, which he concludes as money being an expression of social conditions whereprivate property separates means and need.  Quand tu achètes un truc au supermarché, tu demandes toujours de voir le directeur pour lui demander quelles sont ses marges?Si le banquier te prête de l'argent, c'est pas pour te rendre service.  Il ne fait pas ça pour tes beaux yeux.Ce qui détermine le taux d'intérêt, c'est compliqué.  Il y a les frais, le recouvrement, le refinancement, que sais-je encore.  Une chose est sûre:  il n'y a pas que le risque de crédit, loin s'en faut.   Et bien sûr il y a les politiques des banques centrales parce que non, les banques ne peuvent pas créer de la monnaie arbitrairement non plus.  Elles ont des comptes à rendre aux banques centrales.  Et là la transparence est totale, du moins en théorie. He wrote somewhere that the fixed amount could have some appeal for libertarians, something along this line.  The way he used the third person and the conditional to talk about them suggests he is not a libertarian, though he probably sympathizes with the ideology. La notion de "besoin" est une notion très vague.  Moi si je suis sans emploi et que je dis que j'ai "besoin" d'avoir une voiture, est-ce que mon voisin doit travailler pour m'en acheter une?N'importe qui peut devenir actionnaire.  Ok y'a un peu de paperasse et je comprends que ça peut en rebuter certains.  Mais c'est pas pire qu'aller remplir un formulaire pour toucher une quelconque aide sociale.Le gens sont sensés être responsables de leurs actes.  Les banquiers, comme tout commerçant, font de la pub pour leurs services et cherchent à te convaincre de signer leurs contrats.  Mais ils ne te mettent jamais le couteau sous la gorge. La dette totale n'est impossible à rembourser que si tout le monde cherche à rembourser sa dette en même temps, ce qui n'est absolument pas nécessaire.Par ailleurs, dès lors qu'il existe du capital, il peut exister des créances sur ce capital.  Dans un système de liberté économique, c'est absolument impossible à empêcher.  Et pour diverses raisons, l'utilisation de ces créances comme monnaie fait sens.Ça fait plus de trente ans que le budget est déficitaire.  Donc les services sociaux dont tu parles sont financés grâce à la dette, justement.Nul doute que si tu ne payais plus d'intérêts, tu n'aurais plus de prêteurs, et là les services sociaux, tu ne pourrais plus du tout les financer.  Donc si tu veux des services publics, la dette c'est plutôt ton amie. Un excellent texte critique de bitcoin (bitcoin fait l'objet de la deuxième partie) défendant les banques, la monnaie-crédit, le système des réserves fractionnaires et les banques centrales.http://monoskop.org/log/?p=7347Comme je l'écrivais plus haut, le système monétaire actuel est plus subtil qu'il n'y parait et il serait même plutôt intelligent s'il était appliqué honnêtement. It may be a criticism of bitcoin, but you gotta admit it is a great text.The description on how bitcoin works is one of the best I've ever read, for instance.And the part about money, credit-based money, capital and central-banking is also very good.In other words, he makes lots of good points. I confess I don't get it. Apparently, there is a species of squid that can fly:Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2013-02-bird-plane-squid.html#jCp Duh.  Of course that would drive the price up.  I don't think $2.5 bn are enough to corner the market. Who knows?  Maybe he plans on buying bitcoins  Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2013-02-google-chairman-bn.html#jCpEdit:  remember that Schmidt has been aware of bitcoin for almost a year now (at least):Schmidt also revealed that Google wanted to create a rival to Internet peer to peer currency Bitcoin. The company planned to call it "Google Bucks." Though Schmidt said peer to peer currencies like Bitcoin are "a great idea," Google Bucks never got off the ground because these currencies are illegal in many countries.  Agreed.  Also, Law is not supposed to be some external force we should obey blindly. It's supposed to emanate from the will of people.  If people want something to be legal, then it should become legal.
Bienvenue.   Ne sois pas surpris si le logiciel met plus d'une journée pour télécharger et vérifier la base.   C'est en cours d'optimisation mais actuellement c'est très long.   Heureusement ça n'est à faire qu'une fois. Pourquoi faire?  Quel intérêt de créer une pool avec uniquement des français? Sorry,  I can't. It is not a vote because the result of a vote is supposed to induce a decision that will concern all participants.   It might sound trivial to remind this, but when Obama was elected, people who voted for Mitt Romney did not gather in a part of the USA to make a separate state.Also, a vote is basically a question that is asked to you, and your answer is taken into account with the answers of others.  When you download a software, or when you just use it, you don't have to tell anybody.   People might care about you using it, and your choice might in the end support the developers in some way, but there is no accurate accounting of the number of users and it does not directly affect the decisions of developers.   Really, it has very little to do with what a vote actually is.   It might look like it, but it's more of a metaphor than anything else.  I thought it might be a fun exercise:(Phys.org)Geneticist Theo Sanderson has written a simple text editor that allows a writer to use only words from a list of the 1000 ("ten hundred" since "thousand" isn't on the list) most commonly used words in the English language, to describe things. He calls it the Up-Goer Five Text Editor, in honor of a comic created by xkcd, to describe a Saturn V rocket, using only the most common 1000 words in the English language. Sanderson has made the editor available online for free, which intrigued bloggers, Chris Rowan and Anne Jefferson to the extent that they've set up a Tumblr blogger page called "Ten Hundred Words of Science," where they display the results of a challenge they've issued to scientists to describe what they do for a living using Sanderson's text editor. The results are thought provoking, interesting and quite often humorous.Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2013-02-up-goer-text-editor-restricts-writers.html#jCpEdit.  I tried it in order to describe what a hash (or maybe a checksum) is:« Say you have a note that you want to send to a friend.  For some reason, you can not be sure the note will be exactly as it was when it was sent.   You would like to find a way to make sure it is.Here is how to do it:  you put your note in your computer.   Your computer do some stuff with the note and give you a short word back.  It's not a simple word but it is short enough so you can tell it to your friend and be sure he will get it exactly as it is.Then your friend does this:  he puts the note that he got from you inside his own computer.  And his computer also gives them a word.  If this word is the same that the one you told him, then your friend knows he got the same note than you. » Hoping for a society where people are smart, educated and have independent minds sure is a noble and fine social goal, but it has nothing to do with democracy.   You're just using this word to describe something that is not related.See, that's why we disagree.  You now asks "What good is that if...", when I was arguing with your initial question "How can it be a democracy...".  I wasn't trying to discuss whether democracy is a good or a bad thing, I was talking about whether or not people not having independent minds changes anything to the nature of a democratic process. The logic is very simple.  You wrote:« How can it be a democracy if peoples minds aren't independent and free. »The two points of my argument are straightforward:1.  their vote is not the problem.  It's A problem if the vote induces poor decisions, but it is not THE problem of deciding whether the process was democratic, which was the problem suggested by your question ("How can it be a democracy").2.  You don't know what's in peoples mind.   You talk about people minds being independent and free but that's an external judgement and you can't know for sure.  And no, if someone enters a supermarket, it's not necessarily because he's hungry.  He can have many other motives (like he works for someone and does his shopping).   Anyway fortunately, you don't have to analyse the motives of a vote to consider it valid. A and B are not necessarily a person or a government.  They can be a decision.  You were talking about drone strikes.  There is nothing in democracy, even in a direct democracy, preventing a drone strike to be voted by the majority.You can regret the outcome of a vote, but if you say it results from people being not independent or free, you basically say that they are stupid, ignorant and that you know better.  Which you seem prone to do, btw.  And anyway it does not change anything to the fact that the vote was democratic.It's not because a democratic process results in decisions you disapprove that it's not a democratic process anymore.Again, you wrote:Democracy has nothing to do with whether or not people minds are independent and free.   Democracy is about giving an equal power of decision via vote to everyone.  It is not incompatible with people being dependent and not free. Ok it's on youtube now:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6kRZo63IPE God damn it.  "It's none of your concern" is an idiom.  Don't take it like that.You were saying something like "how can there be democracy if people are not independent and free?".I say democracy consists in letting people contribute to decisions via vote.  Why they vote for A and not for B is not the problem.   You can't know that anyway as you're not in their mind.  So it doesn't concern you if you worry about this process being democratic.  That's what I meant.Of course if the candidate you didn't vote for is elected, you can feel sorry and thus concerned, but that's an other matter.  You can feel concerned about the poor decisions made by your government, but those decisions do not change the democratic status of this government.The very point of letting people vote is to accept their opinion without discussing it.  Otherwise we wouldn't vote, we would have eternal debates on internet forums. http://s3.amazonaws.com/reasontv-video/reasontv_video_178145.mp4Wow.  I think that's the most positive TV talk about bitcoin I've ever watched.I'm putting it on YouTube.  It will be here once uploaded. I was trying to make you realize how unacceptable your argument sounds like.I was saying initially that you are not in people's mind, so you should not question people's choice and vote.  If A vote for X, you can't say his vote is worthless because A had not a "independent mind" and is not truly "free".It's like saying someone is too stupid to have the right to vote.The reasons why A voted for X are none of your concern.  He did vote for A and that's what matters. It's just that your argument "real democracy can't exist if people are not independent and free" pretty much sound like what a communist would say to justify totalitarism.   Like you know better what's good for people. I'm tired of these stories about Robinson Crusoe and the value he gives to things he finds on his island.Money, not just bitcoin, not just gold, is pretty much useless when you're alone.   Lots of things are useless when you're alone.  Basically, communication tools.  Had Robinson Crusoe found a mobile phone, it would be the same (assuming he has no network, of course).   A phone is useless if you can't call anyone nor receive calls.And yet, has anyone ever claimed that a mobile phone has no intrinsic value? You're not supposed to judge whether or not someone has an independent mind.   You're not in people's mind so don't you deny their capability of making choices and having opinions. Saying that using or not using is equivalent to a vote is far fetched.   It is not a vote.     Great quote. Maybe I have too a restricted idea of what democracy is (no sarcasm here), but to me democracy is a system where divergences of opinions are resolved via vote, not secession. NGC 4172 was missing in this photo, so here it is:Now we can go on with number 4176. Above all, democracy should happen where it is needed, and there is no need for democracy in free software.  The code is free: if you're not happy with it, fork it or don't use it.
Ten years ago, I was the kind of SF-fan guy who didn't like Star-Trek.  I even had some kind of contempt for it.  It seemed way much more fantasy than science-fiction.And yet now I have stopped enumerating the kind of things that modern science come up with and that was depicted in Star-Trek.  Can you solve the Navier-Stokes equations with a pencil and thus predict the weather next month?If so, please contact the Clay institute:  http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Navier-Stokes_Equations/ The metamaterial is an actual device that allows to simulate stuff on a table top.   That's a neat bonus as we still can't efficiently solve the differential equations of general relativity.From http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1130:« Such metamaterial models provide a table top realization of metric signature change events suggested to occur in Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum gravity theories. » I'm kind of sick of graphene.  It was exciting a few years ago but now it's just annoying.   There is a new article about some new amazing property of graphene pretty much everyday in phys.org.Yeah, graphene will be awesome.   Someday.   But I fear it will be the material of the future for several decades. I just whish I was a bit smarter so I can understand all these amazing stuff:http://phys.org/news/2013-02-metamaterial-similar-3d-minkowski-spacetimes.htmlJust check out the titles of the papers of this guy:http://arxiv.org/find/gr-qc/1/au:+Smolyaninov_I/0/1/0/all/0/1"Modeling of causality with metamaterials""Quantum Mechanics of Hyperbolic Metamaterials: Modeling of Quantum Time and Everett's "Universal Wavefunction" Could you imagine what hassle it would be to keep a track and verify the names and addresses of all bitcoin users?  I'm not even sure it would be possible to do this in a decentralized way (some have tried with alternate systems, and it's not much convincing).So basically bitcoin is anonymous because it's much simpler this way.   Also, nobody prevents you from publishing all your bitcoin addresses and to refuse payment from anyone who does not give his real name. Gavin kind of struggled when he had to respond to the "bitcoin is not democratic" argument.I think the very concept of money is actually not democratic, or it should not be.What I mean by that is that money should be like any thing that can be exchanged in a market.  So like any consumer product, it is not democratic because its use does not depend on some decision made after a vote.Money is democratic only in a system where only one form of money is allowed.  The decision of which kind of money and how it should work MUST then be taken and the democratic way of making this decision is the vote.But in the liberal way of dealing with the concept of money, there is not limit in the number of competing currencies in circulation.   In such a system, a currency is no more democratic than any stuff that can be exchanged on the market.   Is the iPhone for instance a democratic product?  Well, in a way it is, since it is used by a lot of people.   But in the pure sense of the expression, that is in the political sense, it is not democratic at all.Same with bitcoin.More generally, digital technologies offer more choice to people, and this increased number of choices decreases the need for a normalization of the way of doing stuff.   Democracy was a way to fairly organize this normalization.  With more choices, the need for democracy decreases because less normalization is needed.    So in a way digital technologies make democratic concepts more obsolete.  That's a point that was missed in the debate imho.  Tu dois te baser sur la réputation de ton acheteur.  Si c'est un parfait inconnu, exige de recevoir les bitcoins d'abord.  Sinon, par exemple s'il a une bonne réputation sur bitcoin-otc, alors tu peux éventuellement accepter d'envoyer les pièces d'abord.Mais en général c'est toujours l'envoi physique qui a lieu en dernier.   Je suppose que c'est parce que ça a plus de sens de commencer par la transaction la plus facile et la plus simple à vérifier, en l'occurence l'envoi des bitcoins. J'ai vendu des 50F hercule à un membre du forum mais c'était avec envoi par la poste, pas avec une rencontre physique.Les frais d'envoi sont raisonables donc c'est à mon avis bien plus efficace que les rencontres physiques en un lieu particulier. En cherchant un échange avec une rencontre physique tu réduis énormément le nombre d'acheteurs potentiels. Well, I guess this thread will eventually become the oldest living forum thread in the internet.   Marche pas ton lien.  Une rapide recherche me montre celui-ci par contre:https://archive.org/details/ModernMoneyMechanics Stop harassing every single organizations about bitcoin.   I'm pretty sure it's totally counter-productive. So true.  They even invaded Europe and killed thousands of germans in 1945.   (I'm trying to be sarcastic here in case you don't get it) Bonjour et bienvenue!N'hésite pas à nous raconter ce qu'on peut bien dire ou ne pas dire sur bitcoin dans le milieu financier (profs, camarades de promos, collègues, etc.).J'avoue que ça attise pas mal ma curiosité. I've spent the last year or so learning Perl6 and while doing so I've heard a lot about Haskell in very good terms.I definitely need to learn this thing. "monnaie élitiste":  drôle d'expression.Une "monnaie élitiste" serait une monnaie que tout le monde n'aurait pas le droit d'utiliser.  Autrement dit une monnaie dont l'utilisation serait conditionnée par un critère quelconque, genre un examen ou un truc du genre.La hausse du cours du bitcoin par rapport aux autres monnaies n'exclue personne.  Quand le cours monte, tu peux acheter moins de bitcoins, mais tu peux toujours en acheter.   Et surtout, ça ne change rien à ta capacité à les utiliser pour acheter des trucs, au contraire. Well said. Someone made this comment:Not sure there is much more to say.They can indeed prohibit BTC exchanges, but I doubt they'll use such a lame excuse. I'll try to summarize my opinion on Ripple like this:Ripple is to debt-based money what Bitcoin is to gold.So really Ripple will destroy bitcoin if it can convince everyone that a debt-based money system is better than a commodity-based one.
Je ne suis pas expert mais je doute fort que toi en tant que client tu sois dans l'illégalité.Contrairement à Boussac (qui fait partie de Paymium et est même l'un des fondateurs je crois), moi je ne te déconseillerais pas d'utiliser plusieurs sites de change, ne serait-ce que pour diversifier ou même éventuellement faire de l'arbitrage.   Sois prudent par contre, tu n'auras que peu de recours si jamais un tel site décide de plier bagages et de disparaître avec la caisse.  Personnellement j'ai perdu quelques bitcoins comme ça avec bitcoin7.com.   Ne laisse jamais très longtemps une grosse somme sur un tel compte.Ne crois pas non plus qu'utiliser un site déclaré légalement et protégé par la loi soit une solution miracle.  Le législateur peut très bien changer d'avis sur bitcoin du jour au lendemain:  tu échanges donc juste un risque moral contre un risque juridique.  Et puis il y a aussi les considérations fiscales... +1Indeed it's hard not to interpret such non-sense as a desperate attempt to dissuade people from using bitcoin. I think that's part of the reason why the holographic principle is called a principle.   I'm afraid you missed the point of this thread. I don't get this whole thing.  Can't goldmoney be transfered from one goldmoney customer to an other goldmoney customer?  If so, it should be easy to exchange bitcoins into goldmoney in both ways, via any currency exchange service.  So to me there should be no need for GoldMoney to deal with bitcoins in any way, as long as they provide internal liquidity for their customers. Bigre, justement j'ai prévu un déplacement en Belgique la semaine prochaine.  À Bruxelles par contre.  Liège n'est pas vraiment tout près je crois.  Dommage.Ce sera filmé? January 17th, and we're almost at 15$ already. My guess is he will NOT accept bitcoin and I doubt he will even mention it during this conference. It's indeed a very profound and revolutionary concept.  I would lie if I tell that I understand it in any substantial way, but the very little I know is very appealing.  In particular, I like the fact that it is related to the very interesting work of Erik Verlinde and his entropic interpretation of gravity. I wrote zero-latency but I don't quote them on this.   They target at a very low latency, low enough that it seems smooth enough in a gaming context, anyway.  And people who tried it seemed totally convinced.I'm not sure about the price but I read somewhere that the price should be about 300$. As far as I know, it's the first virtual reality headset design by gamers for gamers, with a full, zero-latency immersion target in mind.And early tests by tech reviewers on CES 2013 are very enthusiastic:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJo12Hz_BVIhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3003UjOWt2chttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBylGcvRuekhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpV7qq1vyd4A decisive milestone towards a Matrix-like gaming experience IMHO.

Then don't heat the metal parts.  Only heat the graphite target at its center, somehow.  It would melt if it has to melt. You don't really have to measure temperature if you really can't.  You can infer the temperature from the physical model and the amount of energy you put into the system.Duh.  At this point doing everything in an inert gaz is a minor issue.Yes, microwaves or any concentrated radiation are a possibility.  I don't know, I was thinking about ultrasounds or something.  Anyway I'm pretty sure there are lots of ways to heat a localized point inside a big chunk of graphite.I'm not saying in this thread that making diamonds should be easy, so please don't be a smart ass.  I'm saying that I'm surprised and kind of disappointed that not much efforts seems to be put into it, when compared to other stuff.   There are also things I don't know about the issues, so I asked in the hope that I could learn stuff.  In particular, I have no idea about how metals behave under very very large pressure.  Assuming they don't heat enough to melt, what can happen?  Do they shatter like glass or something?

Indeed.  I think that's the kind of things you could do with smart-contracts. Because an exchange is always, to some extend, a lending system.  Two people exchanging stuff have to accept the idea that one of them will have to "pay" first and wait a bit until the other one pays his part.  It can never be simultaneous.   So there has to be some trust at some point.  In a centralized exchange, this is more or less solved since the central server acts as an intermediary, but it does not solve the fundamental problem, it just moves the risk to the third party.Bitcoin-otc is a decentralized way of dealing with this, basically using a reputation system.Ripple goes beyond that and generalizes the whole concept by allowing debts to be transferred.  It's more or less like the existing debt-based money but it is decentralized.I think they are right when they say that Ripple is both a complement to bitcoin (since it can do what bicoin-otc does) and a competitor (since it proposes to replace a commodity based money with a debt-based money). Nobody here talked about any "hyper" whatever.The total amount of bitcoins is constant.   It's not like it's decreasing in any substantial way.  I don't see how this could lead to a hyper-deflation.It doesn't even have to lead to deflation.  It really depends of the economic context.  During economic growth, the amount of goods and services augment compared to the monetary aggregate (which stay constant), so prices gets lower, and you have deflation.  During economic recession, the amount of goods and services decreases, and you have inflation.   To me it does not seem absurd to imagine that an equilibrium could be found.  And if it doesn't, well it would just be economic reality.  You don't have to try to control it with the monetary tool.   Same as you can't control weather with your barometer. People should not want that.  Prices are supposed to vary according to economical reality, not according to our assumption or desire of stability.Otherwise, I have a great idea to solve global warming issues.  Since we would like the global temperature to stay more or less stable, let's change the definition of the temperature to cancel out the effect of greenhouse gazes.Also, I would be very surprised if Jane or Joe was unhappy about a decreasing price of a sixpack. Amazingly enough, this might actually be true.  Don't forget the img tag: The word "anarchy" would not fit indeed since it would conflict with the very existence of these rules/principles               
 Wow.  Someone actually voted #1.   Suite à une digression de ce fil au sujet des banques et de leurs pratiques abusives, j'ouvre ce fil pour discuter du sujet.Je ne tiens pas particulièrement à défendre les banques mais c'est vrai qu'en général ça m'agace un peu quand j'entends quelqu'un casser du sucre sur leur dos de façon un peu facile, en reprenant les points caricaturalement dénoncés par exemple par la fameuse vidéo "l'argent dette" de Paul Grignon.  En l'occurrence j'ignore si c'est une référence à laquelle Boussac pense quand il parle de "création monétaire illimitée", mais c'est l'impression que ça me donne en tout cas.   Je cite d'emblée cette vidéo car je sens qu'on va m'en balancer un lien dans ce fil donc autant dire tout de suite que je l'ai vue, que pendant longtemps je l'ai trouvée pertinente mais qu'avec le recul je la trouve simpliste.Bref, pour ceux qui voudraient participer à un éventuel débat:  qu'est-ce qui cloche avec les banques, de nos jours?  Y'a-t-il quelqu'un sur ce forum disposé à défendre le système bancaire et monétaire actuel?Pour moi, le principal problème avec les banques, c'est qu'elles ont montré pendant la crise qu'elles représentent un risque moral.  Si elles font des bêtises, les gouvernements peuvent indirectement leur sauver la mise en jouant de leur influence auprès des banques centrales.  Du coup, il n'y a rien qui permet de s'assurer que ces soit-disant bêtises ne sont pas en fait intentionnelles.  D'où le risque moral.Quant au système monétaire, y compris celui-basé sur les réserves fractionnaires, il n'est pas si idiot.  Il serait même assez intelligent si il était appliqué sérieusement et de façon moins monopolistique. The crazy marsone project is about to start the astronaut selection process.http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/mars-astronaut-requirements/ In the "details" section tab, I'm told that your extension can access my data on all websites.What for? Indeed.  Similar issues occured with electrum, but it is not that important here since this is not a critical application.  It's only a convenient way to display bitcoin addresses.  One should not rely on it too hard. I do.  I buy stocks to get rid of my euros.   Seriously.Also, honestly I'm not a native English speaker and I just don't know how to say "get rid of" with a more neutral tone.But I see your point and it is valid. I can't believe this has not been done already.  I had no idea the risk of collision could be that low with just four english words. Whenever you invest into something that is not FED notes or USD-denominated bonds, you get rid of your dollars.  It's as simple as that and it is not just rhetoric. Where did you get your 24,000-words list? Before bitcoin, I bought some gold because I did not trust the national currency for holding any value.  It was not just because of the long history of gold as a storage for value (after all, it's easy to notice how the price of gold had a slow but very real decrease from the 80s to the end of the 90s).  If I bought some gold, it's because I knew that at least, it's not something central banks can print like crazy.For bitcoin, it's the same.  Indeed no-one can know if bitcoin will hold its economic value in the long term.  You are totally right about that.  But I don't need such an empiric argument.  All I need is to run a version of the bitcoin software where the total amount of bitcoins is written in the code.One bitcoin will always be a twenty-one millionth of the total amount of bitcoins.  That's what I mean when I say it can not be devaluated.  It's a fact written in the code.  It does not need the proof of time to be considered true.  Makes me think of a word I learned today, in the last Vsauce vid:  cyberbalkanization.Though I understand the need to avoid being overwhelmed by insignificant or silly comments, the karma system really sucks as it only makes you talk with people who think  more or less like you.   Kind of miss the point of talking with people. Nice, they've already received 12.5 BTC.  Not bad.http://blockexplorer.com/address/1GATA3hUsxq3DmAhpACBHvB4r7u32xBRur There will always be people like me who will always be reluctant to accept any currency for which we don't even know what is the total amount in existence.The greater fool is the one who accepts to keep such a currency for any significative amount of time.  So unless you are poor and thus have no savings whatsoever, you want to keep stuff that are not constantly devaluated.   Bitcoin is undoubtly one of these stuff. Why are there so many bitcoin haters on slashdot?  I don't understand. Moi personnellement, non.  À moins que tu sois disposé à payer sensiblement plus cher que le marché.Je te conseille Instawire.  C'est d'une simplicité déconcertante. Sur les marchés, les plus gros intervenants sont les investisseurs institutionnels.   Les banques (ou leurs filiales de placement et investissement) interviennent surtout en tant qu'intermédiaires (arbitrage, courtage, etc.).  Certes, elles se font des tas de tunes au passage mais ça reste faible par rapport aux autres intervenants.Et cesse de parler de création monétaire "illimitée".  Dis "abusive" ou "excessive" mais si tu dis "illimitée" comme ça t'es pas crédible.  Il y a des limites. Not sure you guys can make use of this but just in case:New algorithm for message dissemination in decentralized networks faster than its predecessors and guarantees delivery   No need for proof, it's common knowledge.   Just look on the top right.
And again, it is not a descending process.Even if your transaction has an hundred inputs, you'll have to verify that each of these input point to an output of a valid transaction, but you won't go further, for the same reason as described above.  There is no exponential growth of the number of required checks.Also, the number of inputs and outputs is more or less proportional to the size of the transactions, or the average size of the block.  I've already calculated that for 10k transaction par block it was about  8kB per second, iirc.  However you look at it, processing 8kB of data per second does not seem like such a tough task for a computer. It's a cumulative graph and it looks quite linear.  What looks linear in a cumulative graph?  A constant!Also those are "destroyed" bitcoins.  Therefore they represent transactions that could be "forgotten".  So if this is of any relation with this thread (which is not obvious), it really does not seem to prove your point at all. It's not a descending process.Coinbase transaction A is spent by transaction B which is spent by transaction C.During database loading, you verify each block and you say:- ok A is good,- (you process more blocks)- oh B spends A so B is good and I can forget about A- (you keep processing more blocks)- oh C spends B so C is good and I can forget about B.Now if a transaction D comes and spends C you don't have to go all the way to A because you just need to remember that C is good.All you have to do is to put C (and not A nor B) in an index or something so that you don't have to do this everytime you run the client.PS.  Of course I oversimplify here because there can be chain forking which requires that you don't forget spent transactions too easily.  But even so, "forget" is a bit too strong a word since it just means you don't put it in RAM anymore. It's still on disk. I've never ever used binary newsgroups to download files.  And yet I tried at least once, but I couldn't figure out how to use this thing.  I've always used P2P.Are binary newsgroups still used by lots of people nowadays? C'est quand même très caricatural, comme point de vue    Les banques n'achètent rien ou presque pour leur compte propre.Mais j'espère que t'as raison, ça fait cinq ans que j'attends que les banques centrales provoquent un rallie sur les marchés actions.  Salut,bon, un truc que tu dois comprendre d'abord:  bitcoin est un système monétaire décentralisé.  Donc il y a autant de moyens d'acheter ou de vendre des bitcoins qu'il y a des gens pour mettre en place ces moyens.Donc pour répondre à ta première question, pour acheter des bitcoins par CB ou Paypal, tu dois trouver quelqu'un qui est disposé à t'en vendre par cette méthode.  Ça peut être un membre de ce forum dans le cas de Paypal, ou une société qui propose ce genre de service si tu veux payer par carte bancaire (la plus connue étant Instawire).Concernant ta deuxième question, essaie d'être plus précis car il est difficile de voir à quoi tu fais allusion exactement.Enfin, le mining est le processus par lequel les bitcoins sont créés initialement.  50 bitcoins ont été attribués toutes les dix minutes au cours des quatres dernières années.   Le processus d'attribution est analogue à un tirage au sort dans lequel tes chances de gain sont proportionnelles à ta puissance de calcul.   C'est ça qu'on appelle le minage, et de nos jours compte tenu de la concurrence entre les mineurs, c'est devenu très difficile avec un équipement électronique grand public.  Depuis un mois environ la rétribution est passée à 25 bitcoins.  Ça passera à 12.5 dans quatre ans, et ainsi de suite. Being a national currency does not mean that the currency belongs to a nation.  It just means that this nation officially uses this currency.Same as the english language is the official language in Great-Britain, and yet english is not only used by british people. xxd is part of the Vim package.   To avoid this dependency you can use perl as mentioned earlier in this thread.To spare you the hassle of looking for it:Code:checksum() {    perl -we "print pack 'H*', '$1'" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    perl -we "print unpack 'H8', join '', <>"} Well, anarchy is not always fun, to say the least.     Notice that xxd might not be present on some Unix system.An alternative is to use the 'pack' perl function.  Perl is always present on any decent GNU/linux/Unix system:Code:checksum() {    perl -we "print pack 'H*', '$1'" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    perl -we "print unpack 'H8', join '', <>"} Agreed.Bitcoin might very well bring anarchy to the world.  For better of worse. I once heard someone ranting about how bitcoin does not make sense because its total amount can not be adapted to follow the amount of wealth created.  To me this is as absurd as if someone decided to change the length of the meter because young people are statistically taller than their parents.Money is several things, but amongst the things it is, it is a way of measuring quantities.  It is a unit of account.  And one does not change a unit of measure.  You can use an other one, but you don't change it.   When computers started to have disk space above thousands of mega-bytes, we did not decide to change the amount of bytes in one mega-byte, we used an other multiple of bytes and we talked about giga-bytes.   That's how we use units.An amount of bitcoins is a number.  But this number has no meaning per se.  It means something only when compared to a total amount.  One bitcoin is truly one twenty-one-millionth of a fungible virtual set of things we call "bitcoins".Now if these bitcoins are supposed to be used as an accounting system for the worldwide wealth, should the amount of bitcoins be increased when wealth increases??  Hell no, otherwise how do you even know that wealth has increased in the first place??Really it's exactly as if we decided to increase the size of the meter because we noticed that young people are getting taller and taller.  Being fix is the very purpose of a measure unit:  because thanks to this we can compare it to things that are variable so we get an idea of how those things have changed.Am I oversimplifying or something?  Traduc:« Désolé mon français est si mauvais que je n'essaierai même pas.Radio France International vient de mentionner Bitcoin dans notre bar à Berlin (à partir de 09:30) et j'ai pensé que ça pourrait être posté ici.http://telechargement.rfi.fr.edgesuite.net/rfi/francais/audio/magazines/r155/accents_d_europe_20121227_1240.mp3D'après le peu de français que je connais ça m'a semblé plutôt positif, vos commentaires en tant que locuteurs natifs sont bienvenus.Salutations,Joe»La transcription de l'introduction du reportage:« Et en ces temps de crise des initiatives alternatives se multiplient,  à Berlin on peut payer en bitcoins dans certains Bar.  Une monnaie virtuelle qui existe depuis 2009.  Les médias ne donnaient pas cher de sa vie pourtant le bitcoin a de plus en plus de succès comme a pu le constater Déborah Berlioz dans la capitale allemande: »Remarque personnelle:Reportage assez neutre qui laisse la parole au propriétaire du bar en question et à d'autres enthousiastes.  Mais il laisse surtout le dernier mot à un économiste qui ne manque pas de nous dire que bitcoin est condamné à échouer compte tenu de son caractère déflationiste. I can agree with that.  But there was someone in this thread barking that "your computer will just die"   Well, if bitcoin becomes so popular that it generates 10k transaction per minute, then I guess most users will make bitcoin transactions more often than once a week.  I mean, supposing that bitcoin meets scale difficulties and yet that users use it very sporadically is a bit contradictory, isn't it?  (it's an interesting question, though...) All is fine as long as your PC can verify those 10k transactions in less than 10 minutes.From data on bloc 215475, I can read that a transaction is about 528 bytes long.   So 10k transactions will be about 5.28MB of data.  In ten minutes, that's an average of 8 kB per second.   It might require improvement of existing software, but really it does not seem so difficult.  Especially considering that consumer electronics keeps improving with time. Why not?   Computers are quite powerful and humanity is not that large. I'm not talking about a header-only version of the client here.  I'm talking about which part of the index it is useful to load in memory. There is no security flaw in this.  New transactions are not supposed to try to spend an already spent transaction.  So it makes sense to remove spent transactions (only once buried under a few blocks though) from the index.  They will still be in the database, but accessing to them will take more time.Though I'm no database expert, I'm pretty sure an index does not have to be exhaustive.
You know that spent transactions can be ignored, don't you?  I'm no expert in databases but it seems to me you don't know what you're talking about.  Can someone confirm or infirm? Not necessarily bitcoin related.  Any FOSS project you're interested in. I'm talking about projects that currently exist or not.If they don't exist (as far as you know), they are projects you wish someone could start.If they exist, they are not mature enough and you are looking forward to see them become more complete.For me:- Perl 6.   That's by far the FOSS project I currently feel the most enthusiastic about.- Minetest.  The FOSS Minecraft clone. It currently pales when compared to its model, but it progresses fast.- Tribler.  It currently works well enough to have become my main P2P client.  Yet there is still lots of room for improvement.  And many other functionalities could be imagined  (a decentralised web architecture, for instance?)I may forget some, but those three are the one I think the most about these days. Still, even for people who don't like Ubuntu (I myself run a vanilla Debian distrib), I think it's still a good news because it might give an incentive for constructors to ensure their hardware is FOSS compliant.In other words, Ubuntu can be another troyan horse for free software.Again, I'm no expert in these things but that's how I see it anyway.   This is going to be quite off-topic.In my entire life, I think I had never ever heard of this Calvin & Hobbes comics.  Today I heard about it twice.  The other one was in this Vsauce video, talking about the Calvin&Hobbes search engine. How weird. I don't know much about GPS but to me it seems quite clear, from a purely geometric point of view, that there are two solutions to this problem.   Since you probably try to locate a point on the surface of the earth and not in space, it's likely that only one of the two solutions is acceptable. I'm no expert in Smartphones but I suspect this might be important:Wired:  Ubuntu Linux Comes to SmartphonesCouldn't this be an opportunity for bitcoin? Crap I voted 1 but truly I meant 2  (you take away 2, so you own 2 now, right?) A music festival??  Love power and all this crap?   Seriously?Are you a time traveler from the 60s or something? You might want to reconsider this.It's not because you don't need to be fighting that you should not be prepared for a fight.  Si vis pacem... I know a future market where people put money where their mouth is would be a better indicator, but for those who would like to speculate without actually risking to lose anything: here you go, you can bet about the exchange rate for next year here! IIRC, there is no speed limit on german highways. Maybe because of the extensive (edit:  my bad, just one actually.  But still) use of the adjective "unfair" in the freicoin webpage? It's not like they are forced to work, either.   Last time I checked, workmen in factories are not tied to their workplace with iron chains on feet or something.  Oh, and they also happen to receive something that they are supposed to have agreed to receive in exchange of their work.  It's called "SALARY".  What does he mean by "deprived"?  And "their own means of production"?  Were these means of production their property in the first place? Have they been stolen?  If so, those workmen should ask for justice.  Theft is a crime even in anarcap-land.Let me ask you.  Is it unfair that an unemployed workmen receiving his weekly unemployment subsidie from government?  Isn't that also a rent?   Why would such a rent be acceptable when the person who benefits it has done nothing to benefit it except gathering in flocks and use political threats and physical bullying in order to get it from force?Yeah, having and using sound money is a good economic move and it does indeed provide an economic advantage other people using shitty money.   Yes, being smart pays.  I don't understand why you think this is unfair.You didn't quite get my point.  To me saving and exchanging are really the same process.  They just happen on different time scale.  So there really is only one function, it just that it is very elastic as far as time is concerned.I don't understand why you keep talking about interest rates and capital yield when bitcoin is not about that at all.  Bitcoin is jjust a currency.  It does not say anything about credit and investments. What about "infinite wallet"?   By this I mean an analogy with "infinite lists" in programming languages.Infinite lists can also be called "iterators" or "lazy lists", so the same idea could bring "lazy wallet" or "iterating wallet". "pre-determined" sounds terrible.  People would immediately think that there is someone, somewhere, who can recreate a copy of any such wallet.I actually agree.  Deterministic should be fine imho.  But if we really want something less technical,  I like the crystal metaphor.What about "reproducible"? It's not just the word "proletariat", although it is indeed a very good hint:  generally whoever pronounce this word is either a communist, or a capitalist mocking communists.First:  "unfair economic advantage of simply being wealthy".  Why is this "unfair"?   Being wealthy is not a privilege: it's the result of an open competition.  In the past (and still nowadays in some countries), some people could not practice some professions or own certain things, whatever they do.  You had to be born in a certain way.   That was what one might call privileges.  But it is not the case anymore in most countries. Second:  your idea of money is just wrong.  People do not just work to survive.  Most of them, and especially people who work A LOT (like chinese people working to build the stuff we use all around the world), work in order to save money SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORK ANYMORE IN THE FUTURE.   Sorry for using high caps but I really wanted to stress this.Storing value is a perfectly normal and economically sane use case for money.   Storing money is really a mean of buying and exchanging stuff, it's just being done with a much longer time scale.Third:  nowadays most people don't work anyway.   At least because of the high unemployment rate.   So talking about the 99% of "producing" people is just weird.There are way too many economic assumption I don't agree with in this reasoning.  I just can't debate it.  I disagree with pretty much every single sentence. Finding a name for E1 is quite challenging if "deterministic wallet" is too nerdy.What about a rather poetic image?   I have two in mind:1.   "Crystal wallet".  Because it can grow from a small seed (just like crystals)2.   "Phoenix wallet".  Because if you lose it, it's not a big deal since you can recreate it from its ashes (well, kind of)PS.  I have a big preference for "Crystal wallet", which sounds very cool and is a good metaphor imho.
Well, yes it does.Economics solves the resource allocation problem by giving a price to resources.  So people who have more money have bigger a weight in the resource allocation process, because they are capable of paying a higher price.  Rich people weight more in the market, and that makes sense.  Rich people are supposed to be people who have shown in the past that they are more capable of producing wealth or of evaluating the real value of things.  They are more efficient economic agents than poor people.  So it's totally logic that they have more influence in the price mechanism. I just read this sentence again:« In fact, the unfair economic advantages of simply being wealthy are diminished with Freicoin »That's so awesome.  Isn't that a great pleonasm?  I mean, doesn't "being wealthy" consist, by definition, of having an economic advantage?   And what  exactly is unfair with this? Sure, but in a way we should be happy about this thing.  Because Freicoin is the answer to most of the ranting we've been hearing ever since the beginning of bitcoin.  Instead of trying to convince them on how wrong they are, we can just tell them:  "well you can just use freicoin, then".As a bitcoin user I still have to use fiat currencies everyday, anyway.  Between USD/EUR/Whatever and Freicoin, I'd rather use freicoin. Stopped reading here:« In fact, the unfair economic advantages of simply being wealthy are diminished with Freicoin. In the current system of money, including the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and other national currencies, money is and always has been used to store valuemoney seen from the point of view of the holders, the wealthy. Freicoin emphasizes instead the view to that of the producer, the proletariat, the 99%: money as a means of buying the goods and services necessary to sustain life, and the capital required to create improved living conditions. »It's clearly a currency designed for communists or communist-friendly people.  Not sure they even try to hide it.   They should call it "redcoin".Well, communists have the right to exist so I guess it would be a good thing if they had their own money.  But as far as I'm concerned, I don't want any part of this.

You go fetch on internet a backup you've made of your wallet, maybe? I was obviously talking about backwards time travel.  I don't consider forward time travel as genuine time travel.  We travel to the future all the time.  And we can make it faster by sleeping. Even if you consider all humans to be AIs in a simulation, multiplayer time travel is still tricky because in order to allow just one player to time travel, you'll have to create a fork of all other players.  You can't just delete the other instances, otherwise you would have privileged a special point of view in the game, which would be as if the game was single player imo.   So you have to create a new universe each time one player time travels.  This is consistent with the multiverse version of time-travel, but it is not reasonable from a computational point of view.  Moreover, I would still not consider this as multiplayer.  It would rather consist in several single player games running in parallel, but quite independently.  Imho, genuine multiplayer time travel simulation can occur when two players traveling back in time can meet in the same universe, i.e. in the same event log or something.It might be possible if the computer attempts to simulate the self-consistent version of time-travel.  But it would be even weirder. Yeah I was obviously talking about backwards time travel.  In a game, you can time travel in the future by just not playing.  « The Bitcoin program is under licensing by MIT, the globalist-controlled think-tank college. » I guess whoever wrote the article has never even looked at a MIT license: Ah, merci du rappel.  Je mets le lien bien en évidence dans le message de tête.    Du coup ce fil perd un peu de son intérêt, mais au moins il redirigera ceux qui atterriront ici sans connaître le wiki francophone. Simulating a large number of interacting systems, not just neurons, is difficult.  It requires a lot of CPU.  You could have mentioned fluid dynamics for instance, which is also tough to simulate accurately.Simulating time travel in a video game does not require lots of CPU.  It's much more a matter of design and conception.  You could imagine for instance that your computer reproduces the recorded actions of other players, but then the time-traveler could not interact with these NPC players(*).  Or if he could interact, then everybody would be time traveling, which is not the hypothesis.   However you try to even imagine it, it all gets terribly messy from a logical point of view.*:  unless you imagine that the NPC are capable of convincingly reproducing the behavior of other players, which is way too strong an hypothesis, and it brings other issues anyway. Well, "proof" is probably too strong a word.  "Strong indication", if you prefer.  Kind of like the Fermi paradox.
I've just watched an other science fiction movie about time travel and it made me feel like writing this idea I have for some time:   video games are a proof that time travel is not possible.As far as I know, there is currently no multiplayer video game that is capable of convincingly simulating time travel.   We're capable of simulating words where we can do pretty much everything we want, including violating the laws of physics.  And yet for some reason we seem to be unable to conceive a game engine where one player could go back in time in the game.  It would just not make sense at some point.   I suppose the very idea is logically non consistent or something. lol, pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas:http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=that's+what+she+said« The most versatile joke on Earth."I think we can fit that in with the rest of them."

I'm not a fan of credit either, but this is just no exact.The word "credit" comes from the latin "creditus" which means "to believe, to trust".  We may not "deserve" things, but we do expect stuff to happen.   It's based on the ability for one human being to express his future motives and actions, and for an other human being to hear about it and thus predict what will actually happen.  It's not just humans.  I'm pretty sure all primates are capable of anticipating the behavior of other members of the group.    Same for many superior mammals and also for plenty of birds, who trust each other when they let each other take care of the eggs in the nest, for instance.The universe has lent credit as soon as he invented a sophisticated central nervous system. Great news.Apparently they make this move quite loudly.  I just had a pick on /b/ and I saw a large red banner saying:« You can now purchase 4chan Passes using Bitcoin.  Click here to learn more and purchase. »4chan may be a freaking mess, but it's a website of considerable audience. the video does not work for me.  Any youtube lnk? It really much does not look so as you presented it initially:But let's assume you are right and that it is not a chain of payment but a chain of credit, whatever difference that could possibly mean.  Well, then it could be a chain of payment.  By this I mean that there is nothing preventing a member of the chain to expect to receive a payment in order to pay hi own debt, possibly gaining some benefit in the process.  That would be some kind of credit rate arbitrage and we all know this will happen. Yeah, one might call this the domino economy.  As long as everyone stands straight, everything's fine. If someone in the chain does not pay, then everyone else does not get paid.   Sure, everyone who has not been paid knows personnally whoever did not pay them, but still, the probability of not getting paid does not depend anymore only on the person you lend money to.  That's what I meant when I wrote that the risk is distributed. I guess this is not much different from how lendings actually work, but to generalize this and to make it purely software P2P is actually kind of scary. I don't see the point of the whole thing it the network is not supposed to percolate.  And if it does, then the risk exists for potentially everyone. D'ailleurs il y a une option pour faire ça avec la version en ligne de commande du client vanille (bitcoind):Code:$ bitcoind signmessage <bitcoinaddress> <message>$ bitcoind verifymessage <bitcoinaddress> <signature> <message>https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_bitcoindCa permet de prouver qu'on possède un certain nombre de bitcoins, mais il est plus difficile de prouver qu'on n'en possède pas plus.   J'ignore à quel point ça pose problème pour le fisc.Détenir des bitcoins et ne pas les déclarer est une fraude j'imagine, mais c'est de même nature qu'une non-déclaration pour un montant en espèces, une oeuvre d'art ou un compte en Suisse. Je ne suis plus l'actualité française depuis des lustres, mais des fois je tombe sur un article et ça me fait souvent marrer.François Hollande:  « certains dans l'UE doivent "réduire leurs excédents commerciaux" »http://www.boursorama.com/actualites/hollande-certains-dans-l-ue-doivent-reduire-leurs-excedents-commerciaux-d94457b4a1be1ad7fd92ba32edcd666b  Ce n'était pas ce que je voulais dire.  J'entendais par là que la fiscalité pourrait mettre en péril votre business, un peu comme pour beaucoup de sites de jeu en ligne, par exemple.Mais bon d'un autre coté c'est pas comme si le marché des changes avait été créé l'an dernier non plus, donc à priori ça devrait marcher. Vous ne craignez pas de vous faire matraquer fiscalement? I'm not sure any poll about the quite controversial recent announcement from bitcoin-central has been created yet.As far as I'm concerned, at first I was enthusiastic about this news but after having read a few comments I'm not so sure.  It's kind of complicated. It's not about bitcoin being regulated, it's about bitcoin exchanges. Damned,  she makes some good points indeed.« Asking for the State to bless Bitcoin businesses in an attempt to induce its birth is not the way to grow adoption. Anyone who is impatient for it to grow needs to be learn patience and write more software, not run to the State to cripple the baby before it is born ».I'm confused now.  You guys might actually be right. This seems to be a good article indeed.About the linux comparison:  GNU/Linux do coexist nowadays with MS Operating systems.  Pretty much in the literal sense of the expression.  Many, many linux newbies started with a so-called double-boot.  And there are also plenty of tools that allow a MS user to get accustomed to GNU tools, such as Cygwin.  In the other way around, there is Wine.  I believe those tools are strategically very important for the success of FOSS, because they provide an easy transition for people who have been educated to work with MS or Apple systems.  Without this, the learning curve would probably be much too steep and fewer people would manage to learn GNU/Linux.I believe it's pretty much the same with the idea of a bicoin-friendy bank.  Even people who don't want to use something like that should realize the tremendous amount of people this can bring into bitcoins.   Really this can't be bad.Imagine a very big and famous bank such as Goldman Sachs, Barclay's, BNP-Paribas or whatever started to offer a bitcoin exchange to their customers.  Any of their client could, when accessing his online-bank account, convert some of his money into bitcoins and execute bitcoin transactions, for instance in order to retrieve some of his bitcoins into his local wallet, or in order to pay someone using the bitcoin network .  Would you consider this a bad thing for the bitcoin project?  I would be very surprised if you would.In other words, imagine the guys from bitcoin-central were not coming from the bitcoin community, but from the banking community.   It would be pretty ironic if one way for evil banksters to hurt us, would be to actually join us, wouldn't it? Indeed Ripple and Bitcoin can be complementary.   Ripple is to credit what Bitcoin is to money.    Banks have so far been dealing with both concepts in the same time and bitcoin challenges them only on the money part.  Ripple could challenge them on the other one.Though I'm not sure how Ripple works exactly, especially regarding whatever can be done whenever someone does not pay his debt.   In other words, I wonder if a credit/lending system can work without any kind of recouvrement (sorry I don't know the english for that). Ma proposition de réponse pour:  « Qui possède les bitcoins, "au départ"? »Les bitcoins sont créés initialement avec les blocs de transactions.  Un bloc est créé toutes les dix minutes environ, et ce même lorsqu'il n'y a aucune transaction à déclarer.  Il y a un certain montant de bitcoins générés pour chaque bloc (50 pour chaque bloc les quatre premières années, puis 25 les quatre suivantes, etc).   Ceci permet l'introduction initiale de bitcoins, qui peuvent alors faire l'objet de transactions dans les blocs suivants.N'importe qui peut générer un bloc, et donc acquérir des bitcoins "tout neufs".   Mais la difficulté augmente avec le nombre de personnes qui tentent de le faire.  De nos jours il faut donc un matériel dédié pour y parvenir.  Mais si la démarche demande un investissement technique et/ou financier, elle n'en demeure pas moins ouverte à tous.
J'aimerais une réponse précise (avec le bon vocabulaire juridico/bancaire) à cette question:« - Est-ce que le bitcoin-central est une banque? »Si la réponse est de qualité je l'ajouterai à la FAQ et à l'article Wikipedia sur bitcoin. Well, that's why wherever there are minimal wage laws, there is often also a "welfare" state that deals with unemployment by paying people for doing nothing. This is a dangerous question.  I won't answer it.    I'll just say that this question has the same nature (though it's a bit of a caricature), than the question of whether or not the State should take care of disabled people.No, I believe a free market can totally price wages to their accurate (and thus "fair") economic value.  I just think this value might be lower than the maintenance cost of a human being.  In other words, from a purely economic point of view, I think many human beings are non-efficient machines, i.e. they have a negative net profitability:  they cost more than what they can produce. I'm going to be the advocate of the devil here (I mean that I'm going to defend the idea of a minimal wage, even if I disagree with it).If you allow wages to price labor to its real economic value, then many people might end up earning less money than what they need to sustain their life.  Because they have no skill whatsoever, and no real economic value.  They'll be destitute or at least very poor.   Then they might either die or chose crime in a society where they have no economic place.The idea of the minimum wage is to prevent that, I guess. It's not for you to decide what would make the life of other people more comfortable.   Bitcoin does need this kind of proselytism.Do you know that there are a lot of people that know that bitcoin exists, and yet reject the idea and don't want to use it?  If one of this person happens to own a commerce, you might want to buy stuff from him anyway.   Thus you'll have to exchange some of your bitcoins against USD/EUR/Whatever.   And to do so  you might have to use the banking system. I don't mind at all if a merchant do not accept bitcoins.  It is, in the pure sense of the expression, his business.  It's just the same with gold.  I own most of my wealth in gold, yet I don't care if I can't buy anything directly in gold.  Most of the things I buy, I buy them with euros I freshly converted from a gold sell.   I only convert what I need when I need it, so I don't have to hold the silly money the merchant wants during too a long time.Hell it's even great that merchants want me to pay them with crappy currencies.  Because they are so cheap!With a bicoin-friendly bank, I could convert my real money (gold and bitcoins) into shitty money (USD, EUR) in an even faster, more efficient way.  What's not to like? When you want to buy something in a grocery store that does not accept bitcoin and does not even know what it is, what do your "full measures" consist of, exactly??   Forcing the marchand to accept your bitcoins anyway?  With a gun or something?This is silly.   Bitcoin is about monetary freedom so if you like the idea you must accept that a lot of people will NOT know about your currency and/or will NOT accept it.   Hence it makes sense to have bridges between different currencies.   A bitcoin-friendly bank would be a very efficient way of accomplishing this. I don't understand people who dismiss this news.  I mean, assuming you did not get completely out of the banking system once you acquired your first bitcoins, of course a bitcoin-friendly bank is a great news.Between a bank that is not bitcoin friendly (or not even bitcoin-aware), and a bank that is, the second one sure is a better place where to have a bank account.  And usually people do indeed have a bank account, because unless you live on an island and have no social/economic life whatsoever, having a bank account is still useful nowadays.My only hope now is that the initiative from Paymium and Bitcoin central will inspire other banks worldwide to do the same thing. Wow.  Big news indeed. Bienvenue.  Quel magazine par curiosité? Ahhh pardon j'ai édité ton message par erreur (je ne suis pas encore habitué à mes supers-pouvoirs de modérateur  )  Je pense l'avoir remis tel qu'il était.Sinon pour revenir au sujet, choisir un site comme exemple est toujours un peu délicat.  J'ai édité mon message pour ne pas faire de publicité pour un site en particulier. Ma réponse pour:Pour acheter ou vendre des bitcoins, il faut trouver quelqu'un qui est disposé à en vous acheter, ou à vous en vendre.Il y a plusieurs méthodes pour cela.   L'une d'entre elles consiste à s'adresser à la communauté d'utilisateurs, par exemple sur IRC ou sur ce présent forum, et à faire une annonce libre du genre "Je veux acheter des bitcoins, qui veut m'en vendre et à quel prix?".  C'est très artisanal, mais ça ne marche pas si mal.  Cette méthode a été semi-automatisée et développée de façon assez complexe par le réseau bitcoin-otc.  Plus d'infos sur http://bitcoin-otc.comSinon il y a les sites qui organisent un tel marché.  Les acheteurs et les vendeurs s'y retrouvent et ils utilisent le site comme intermédiaire.  Personnellement j'ai des scrupules à faire de la pub pour un site en particulier, donc faites une recherche avec votre moteur de recherche préféré, vous trouverez facilement.Un moyen simple de trouver des sites d'échanges, est http://bitcoinwatch.com.  Ce site consacré à bitcoin existe depuis longtemps et affiche continuellement les cours de divers sites d'échanges, avec bien sûr les noms des sites en question. D'abord, sachez qu'il existe une FAQ sur le wiki francophone:  https://fr.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQEnsuite, si malgré tout vous voudriez poser une question supplémentaire, discuter un point particulier ou autre, vous pouvez le faire sur ce fil.Les meilleures questions (ou les meilleures réponses) seront sélectionnées pour figurer sur le message de tête.Les réponses longues sont acceptées mais si possible une version courte sera utilisée avec un lien vers la version complète.EDIT:  finalement pour faire simple et court, au lieu de recopier les réponses ici, je crée des liens vers la réponse dans le fil qui me parait la meilleure (si vous n'êtes pas d'accord avec ce choix, n'hésitez pas à donner votre avis sur ce fil).Qu'est-ce que bitcoin?Qui est Satoshi Nakamoto?A quoi ça sert?Où puis-je acheter? en vendre?Est-ce que c'est une pyramide de Ponzi?Qui possède les bitcoins, "au départ"?Qu'est-ce que bitcoin-central et/ou Paymium?  C'est une banque?Etc. Ok je m'en charge.Bah maintenant que j'ai un accès complet au net, oui je veux bien, merci. Dans un ordre général, je crois qu'il devrait y avoir plus de fils épinglés.En particulier, il devrait y avoir un fil "FAQ".   Tous les newbs pourraient y poser leurs questions et le message de tête serait édité au fur et à mesure pour y afficher les meilleurs couples questions/réponses.Le fil de Boussac sur la revue de presse francophone devrait être épinglé aussi. Ahh j'étais parti sur des considérations générales et j'avais perdu de vue qu'à la base on parlait du présent forum et de ses concurrents.On pourrait déjà commencer par créer un fil "Vos propositions d'amélioration du forum", et l'épingler. Ça c'est quand on peut se mettre d'accord sur ce qui constitue une amélioration.   Ce qui arrive souvent, heureusement.  Ce serait bien si c'était toujours si simple.Le problème évoqué plus haut se pose quand il y a désaccord sur le fond.  Du coup certains proposent, mais d'autres disposent.   Alors il y a scission du projet en deux, ou création d'un petit nouveau à partir d'un petit groupe de rebelles.  C'est extrêmement commun dans le logiciel libre, par exemple. Ahh ça me fait penser au fameux xkcd sur les standards.  Il suffit de remplacer "standard" par "forum francophone":Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait une bonne solution à ce genre de problème.  Le mieux c'est d'accepter la diversité et de laisser le choix à chacun. I'm sorry but I'll disagree.  It's totally normal and expected from a journalist to at least attempt to explain how things work. It's just that this particular journalist has made a terrible job. Assuming we can neglect RIPEMD-160 collisions, there are 2^160 ~ 10^48 possible bitcoin addresses.As a comparaison, there are about 10^47 molecules of water on earth.You can forget about bitcoin address collisions.
Bonvolu helpi la plibonigadon de la esperanta artikolo de Wikipedio. Le problème n'est pas tant le manque de francophones, mais le fait que bon nombre d'entre eux préfèrent discuter en anglais.  Tout simplement parce qu'il y a plus d'audience.D'ailleurs en tant qu'espérantiste, c'est un truc que j'ai fini par admettre:  le poids du nombre a une importance considérable pour les langues.  Il y a 360 millions de personnes pour lesquelles l'anglais est la langue maternelle, et à peu près autant pour lesquelles c'est la deuxième langue.Sur internet, si tu te limites au français, tu restreins énormément le nombre de gens avec lesquels tu es susceptible d'échanger.  Il y a nécessairement un effet dagrégation qui pousse les gens, et j'en fais partie, à utiliser l'anglais sur internet.Moi par exemple la totalité des canaux YouTube auxquels je suis abonné sont anglophones.  Pareil pour les forums auxquels je participe.D'ailleurs c'est un sujet assez proche de bitcoin, quelque part.  Parce qu'il y a un phénomène un peu équivalent avec les monnaies.  Une monnaie est un outil pour commercer avec des gens.  Donc plus une monnaie est utilisée par beaucoup de gens, plus elle est utile.Pour qu'une monnaie minoritaire remplace une monnaie majoritaire, il faut que ses avantages intrinsèques (et bitcoin en a beaucoup), surpassent l'inconvénient lié à la faible utilisation.   C'est donc pareil pour les langues.   Je ne pense pas que le français ait des avantages intrinsèques par rapport à l'anglais (plus le temps passe, plus j'ai l'impression du contraire en fait), donc je ne serais pas étonné si l'usage du français sur internet diminue de plus en plus.Enfin bon, c'est un vaste sujet. Ah oui en effet, j'avais pas vu ça comme ça.A l'époque quand j'avais mon site je voulais garder des bitcoins pas seulement parce que je pensais que le cours allait monter, mais aussi parce que c'était quand même assez pénible de s'en procurer.  J'imagine que de nos jours c'est différent et qu'on peut facilement se réapprovisionner quand on est à cours. Je ne suis pas de Paymium et cie mais j'imagine que c'est pour plus facilement gérer les stocks et calculer leurs tarifs.Dans le temps j'avais un site où je vendais des bitcoins et j'avais installé une formule où en gros mon prix de vente augmentait avec la quantité demandée.  Tout simplement parce que je ne voulais pas épuiser mon stock trop facilement.Or, ça peut surprendre un éventuel client de voir que pour un bitcoin tu dois payer 10 euros, mais que pour dix bitcoins tu dois payer 120 euros.  Donc un moyen simple d'éviter de faire peur au client, c'est de limiter le montant pour chaque commande.  Au besoin tu ajustes ton tarif entre chaque commande. It's not that complicated.  Come on.Honestly, I had to read Satoshi's paper several times to understand it.  So yeah, in a sense, it is complicated.  But there are lots of things even more complicated than that in life, and people deal with.  The example of driving a car mentioned above is an good one.Here is an other:  bicycles.  When bicycle were invented, lots of people were bashing the idea and say that it could never be useful because it was too hard to drive, it required too much physical strength and so on.  It was too complicated. I tried very hard to make the Wikipedia article intelligible.  But at some point, I'm not sure it is worth the effort to do more.Lemonde.fr is the electronic version of a journal that has been one of the main daily paper since 1944.  That's old.  People who read this on the internet age are seriously narrow-minded. The RE announcement has been relayed by Wired:http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/11/reaction-engines-hypersonic/Somehow, I feel like making a comparaison with bitcoin.Both Bitcoin and the Skylon''s SABRE engine have something in common:  they have found a solution to a problem that has been known by specialists in the field for a long time.  I mean, they are both not a revolutionary concept, but rather a technological breakthrough.For bitcoin, that was the double spending problem.  Before 2009, it was not difficult to imagine the idea of a P2P currency.  Just because we knew P2P networks existed and worked.  There was just this double spending thing that prevented the idea to become quite real.  Then Satoshi arrived.With Skylon, it's about cooling air.   For some complex thermodynamic and aeronautics reasons, it was difficult to fly a plane other Mach three or four.  Nobody knew how to cool air fast enough.  Alan Bond and his team figured it out.  And this might have huge consequences.  Congratulations to them.I really hope I'll see a Skylon fly in my life time.  How knows, maybe it will be possible to buy a ticket with bitcoins    Comments on this article are quite surprising.Basically they all complain that the article is too difficult to understand.  Then they say they went to the french Wikipedia and still they did not understand.Since I am the main author of the french Wikipedia article, I don't think this article is difficult to understand.  Rather, I suspect that people who read "lemonde.fr" are just not very smart. Hum...  interesting.  That's the second article about bitcoin on lemonde.fr, in a few weeks. http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/news_updates.html« Reaction Engines Ltd. can announce today the biggest breakthrough in aerospace propulsion technology since the invention of the jet engine. Critical tests have been successfully completed on the key technology for SABRE, an engine which will enable aircraft to reach the opposite side of the world in under 4 hours, or to fly directly into orbit and return in a single stage, taking off and landing on a runway. »For those who don't know what Skylon is, just watch this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daBKojdOAgs It's easy for people to accept  Fed's notes because nobody really gives them much of a choice.For someone to start to accept bitcoin on the other hand, (s)he must  decide to do so.  That's a totally different mental process. Bon il n'y avait personne d'actif sur #bitcoin-fr, par contre sur #bitcoin on a bien déconné.  Le moment fatidique était un grand moment de délire total. It very much depend on the size of tropical islands.  Indeed lots of them are too small to provide fresh water for any human.   But I think (though I'm not sure), that where Colomb first landed, there was water, coconuts, vahine and everything.There's lots of water in sahara also, if you don't mind digging deep enough.   For some reason it doesn't help making the place less hostile, though.   I wonder why it should be different on mars.

But once there are regular Mars flights, you can get the cost down to half a million dollars for someone to move to Mars.

Le truc c'est que y'en a sûrement qui se disent exactement la même chose et qui du coup pensent que ça vaudra le coup de continuer puisqu'il y aura moins de concurrence.Ceci dit c'est vrai que je suis curieux de voir combien de temps on va mettre pour passer de 210 000 à 210 001.

Works for me: Thanks! By the way I've created a rosetta code draft task for validating a bitcoin address:http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitcoin/address_validationDon't hesitate to put your solution in your language.   But please make it short. Has anyone written a test-suite for key generation-validation?I mean, a text/json/whatever file where you'd have a couple of address/private key pairs?And in all possible formats (test network, compressed/uncompressed and so on...).That would be useful. At least I agree with this:« He added that it would be a fun adventure to watch, even if you aren't planning on going yourself. » Si le cours monte à 100$ pour l'occasion, j'en serai  Honestly I'm not sure we should worry that much about this kind of "concurrence".This is all about payments system, and bitcoin is not just about that.  Bitcoin is also a currency and it could make use of any payment system. So, first the U.S. loses the war against those natives.  As a result these natives got total ownership of the land.  The place was even supposed to be "closed to all whites".Then later, the U.S. found a strategic method to counter-attack:  they kill all buffaloes in the area.  So the native could not rely on this as a resource for food, shelter and clothing.   So finally, the U.S. won.And now, almost two hundred years later, a white man complains on TED.  How weird.When you lose, it's done.  Game over.  Complaining is not an effective way of turning a defeat into a victory. Agreed. That's what I meant.  Humans as an organic species will probably disappear but human culture will survive through the machines and AI it will have created.  Transition will happen more or less peacefully, not in a man-vs-machine war. I obviously meant "no other planets we might consider colonizing" I'm not sure it's so obvious.Light takes a few minutes to travel from mars to earth.  It's the same order of magnitude than the target delay between bitcoin blocks.  Does that mean earth and mars could not mine the same blockchain?  Not so sure.Time delay would not be an issue for each planet, providing they don't wait for confirmation from one another before starting mining the new  block found locally.  And that's pretty much how the current protocol already work, isn't?Surely it would increase the amount of chain forking, and it might take more time for them to resolve, but nothing would be very different from how bitcoin currently works.Well, I think so anyway. I don't.  I was merely talking about "large animals", which is a non-scientific, subjective expression. Indeed they are looking into it,  but honestly I don't understand why.  If you really want to mine stuff, I'm pretty sure it would be cheaper to mine sea floor than asteroids. Wrong editing of my post. Well, it is not certain for all megafauna, but it is pretty much sure for a lot of large animals, such as aurochs, Moa, thylacine, and so on.   Many fascinating creatures have been wiped out by humans in the last thousands years, and that is kind of sad indeed. Does it, really?From a philosophical point of view, it's not obvious that we should make lots of efforts into preventing our extinction.  After all, if such an extinction happens, it will only concern future generations.  I'm not sure I understand why preceding generations should bother.Assuming perpetual exponential growth of human population is silly.  In several developed countries people don't even renew generations.  It seems that the more advanced civilizations are, the less children they make. There are no other planets.   And extra-solar is just too far away. I don't think humans will ever establish a long term settlement on mars, but I love the idea that some people try.Here is a recent talk of Elon Musk about it:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB3R5Xk2gTY You need to put dark energy in front of your spaceship and nobody knows how to make some.  We don't even know what is this stuff.Well, we try to find them with SETI, but no results so far.   There are also reasons to believe that it will be impossible to contact a civilization if it's more than about an hundred light-years away (the radio signal would be much too weak).   We would be very lucky if more than one technologically advanced civilization had developed in such a small neighborhood, and in the same time frame.Earth will stay inhabitable for about five hundred million years.  That's a lot.  IMHO, humanity as we know it will almost certainly NOT exist in ten thousand years.  Or if it still exists, it won't matter much because it won't be the most intelligent life form anymore.   Humans will be over-powered by machines, who might just keep them as pets or something.  And for a machine, the concept of being "inhabitable" is much different than for a human.Human will not live on mars or the moon, for the same reasons nobody lives in Antarctica, Sahara or on deep ocean floors.  We're just not built for that.  Why would you like to spend tons of money to settle down in such an hostile environment, anyway?We don't need to send humans for exploration.  Robotic probes will do it as they currently do.  If we send humans, it will mainly be symbolic, for fun essentially.   Spatial hiking will be some kind of a very expensive leisure activity.
Of course you won't mind.I mean, it would be used for commercial exchanges between mars and earth and goods would take months or years to ship anyway.  So it won't matter if payments take a few hours or even days. Come on.  ISS is in Low Earth Orbit.  So about 400km above sea level.   Using internet through such a distance is no big deal.  And internet signals pass through space all the time anyway, since they are often relayed by communication satellites. They could need Earth money in order to buy stuff from Earth. So what?The very point of bitcoin is to be able to overcome synchronization delays due to network latency. I'm pretty sure the oxygen levels at that time were not much different than today.  I think it was during Paleozoic that they were much higher.It's true though that before Holocene there used to be all kinds of large animals everywhere, but on the other hand the largest animal who's ever lived on earth still lives today. D'ailleurs quelle est la position de bitcoin-central sur ce point? Today I've learnt that about 34 millions years ago, there used to be two-meter tall penguins living in Antartica.http://phys.org/news/2012-11-argentine-experts-giant-penguin-fossils.html TED stands for Technology, Entertainment and Design.This talk is only about history and politics. Peut-être dans cette section du bitcoin-wiki?Je ne sais pas si on a quelque chose d'équivalent en français. Oh j'ai bien fait de poser la question alors.  Je n'ai jamais songé que la contrefaçon puisse être un domaine d'application pour les marchés anonymes.

Bonsoir et bienvenue,l'essentiel pour acheter des bitcoins c'est de trouver quelqu'un qui accepte de t'en vendre.Pour ça tu peux utiliser bitcoin-otc.com par exemple:http://bitcoin-otc.com/vieworderbook.php?type=SELL&nick=&thing=&otherthing=EUR&eitherthing=&notes=Mais si tu veux un site avec un teneur de comptes tu peux essayer bitcoin-central.net There is nothing wrong with big businesses.  Why so much hate against them?Big businesses created and promoted liberarianism, you say?  Yeah, that would not surprise me if people who succeeded in their economic life promote economic freedom.  What's your point exactly? Ce n'est pas tout à fait ce que caveden entendait par "voler le client", amha.  Ce que tu décris ne permet absolument pas au serveur de s'approprier des bitcoins reçus au préalable. It's amazing to see how little they worry about giving Silk Road a lot of publicity with those articles   « More and more people I know in Brighton are now coming onto Silk Road to order their stuff. Its just so much easier and I know the quality of the stuff I order isnt going to be compromised. »Awesome.   It's funny that nerds and clubbers are the most likely kinds of bitcoin users. I was indeed talking about anonymity here, not pseudonimity. That's one drawback of anonymity, indeed.   But it does not change the fact that it allows you to do stuff without fear of judgment or punishment.    It removes the carrot AND the stick.   Please explain. As I wrote in my post, on internet you can easily get rid of an identity and take an other one, and nobody will be able to know it's the same physical person behind it.
Well, people who use anonymity on internet are not all stupid people.   Some of them are talented programmers, specialized in cryptography and P2P systems. Today I watched an interesting documentary series about "prophets of science fiction".The episode about H.G. Wells and more specifically the part about his "invisible man" novel made me think of something.I'm not sure I had realized before how this story is more of a moral tale than a science-fiction one.   The main issue of this book is about what would happen if men are given a way to avoid having to face judgment and punishments from other people.  What if people could do whatever they want without having to fear retaliation from others?   In other words:  is anonymity compatible with moral values?Today we are very far away from creating something like an invisibility cloak or something like that, even with recent developements in metamaterials.  And yet I believe the "invisible man" is still a pertinent story to illustrate some of the issues about information technology.  Because on the internet, you can be invisible.There is even a popular website who's title pretty much states that, http://www.howtovanish.com/and it's no surprise that this site has been bitcoin-friendly very early.So even if a man can not (yet) be invisible in the physical space, he can indeed be invisible in the cyberspace.In cyberspace, you can use TOR, a hot-spot access, or some other IP obfuscation method in order to make sure that whatever you do on the internet, nobody will know who you are, either IRL (meaning that noone will know your name and address) or even virtually (meaning that you'll be able to connect later and nobody will be able to link this connection with the previous one and know that it's the same person behind).On internet, we can have no face whatsoever, if we want so.Considering how many important things happen on the internet nowadays, it's really a societal issue.   Commerce for instance is not excluded, and so now it is possible to buy anything you want, or at least things that you would not normally by in public, either because it is illegal (downloading copyrighted material, buying drugs on Silk road) or shameful (buying sex-toys, watching porn or trolling people on forums).The power of invisibility is quite a thrilling idea, even if it's just in cyberspace.  Quoting the main character of Wells' novel:"To do such a thing would be to transcend magic. And I beheld, unclouded by doubt, a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a manthe mystery, the power, the freedom. Drawbacks I saw none."The freedom he's talking about is obviously not the kind of freedom we are supposed to get from law-organised, ordered democratic societies.  No, it's the freedom that happens in anarchy.  The kind of freedom that can scare you.Anonymity is probably not compatible with law.   Why should I obey the law if I don't agree with it and if I have nothing to fear from a judge or a police officer? lemonde.fr:  La plateforme Wordpress s'ouvre au bitcoin 2012-11-19https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=126781.msg1345879#msg1345879 Yeah, french people are not totally dumb  There is a contagious disease that turns people into vegetarians.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg7Yf_sZghUIt is permanent, there is no cure, and no, it is not even a joke (well, according to this video). Notice than you're the one who talked about curing cancer.Anyway, my point of this thread was that to me, making a big diamond at least looks simple.   Just like falling dominoes:  you just need a lot of dominoes.  It seems to me that to make diamonds, you just need a lot of water and steel. You're too squared.   People don't think like that.   The notions of "Fun" and "Cool" don't fit in your economics views.I've shown you a useless machine already.  Here is the world record for falling dominos:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E7Ep3U06NcWhy did all these people spend so much time preparing those dominoes instead of searching a cure to cancer?  I don't know, but they did anyway.I have very little doubt that if it was possible to make a car-sized diamond, someone would make one, regardless on whether it would cost more or less than the market price of the actual thing. Yeah I mentioned already that the tank (or a structure below that supports it) would need a better shape than just a flat surface. Like a V-shape or something: Well, I know pretty much nothing about resistance of materials.  But I have many difficulties to imagine that a steel rod would be the first thing to break.  After all, isn't steel stronger than graphite?  So in my mind the graphite would turn into diamond first and then shit would happen.Or maybe we could use tungsten.  I don't know.  I really would like to simulate it, but I'm no mechanical engineer. What would happen exactly?  The piston will break apart?  Where?  It will be in the chamber anyway.  Cracks might appear but the matter will still be here to transmit pressure.I guess the part that will not be in the chamber can buckle:But we don't need a long section out of the chamber.  Considering the difference of density between diamond and graphite, if we want to turn a 10cm high cylinder of graphite we need to reduce its height to only about 7cm, iirc?  So we just need 3 cm motion out of the chamber.  I doubt a 3cm high, 10cm wide steel cylinder  would explode, buckle or anything.  Above this, the section can increase so that pressure can be withstood.Not so high.  About 1,000°C.  Temperature is not really the problem.I'm pretty sure I've seen this documentary and yet I'd like to know what would happen in the simpler experiment I've described. It's just a water tank. Because it is not the same.  In the first example all the water mass rests on the rod, and there is much more water mass.We're just not talking about the same mechanical structure.  I'm talking about a rigid tank resting on a narrow rod.  You seem to be willing to talk about pressure on the bottom of a deep pool. Yes I do.  Please stop now.  I just use water to have a cheap large amount of mass.   Replace it in your mind by sand or stone bricks if you want. No.  It rests on the rod.Possibly inside a fixed structure that limits its motion to a vertical movement, though. Funny thing is that this question is actually pertinent.  There are several very different ways in which a website can deal with bitcoins.- not dealing at all.  No single mention of bitcoin, and everything priced in national currency ;- pricing in national currency, but a link provides means to pay in bitcoins, with the price being calculated from real time exchange markets, and bitcoins instantanously turned into national currency, possibly with the help of a third party like bitpay ;- double pricing, customers can pay in the currency they want.  The website receives and stores bitcoins ;- bitcoin pricing only, customers must manage to get some bitcoins on their own (like with Silk Roard or some poker sites).A more serious analysis of the different possibilities would be usefull, I think. There is no water under the plate.  What I drew on the lower part is the steal rod.  But I guess I should have drawn this:|                                ||                                ||                                ||__________________|               |  |                              |_|Notice the separation.

Wordpress will use bitpay and will not held any bitcoins.  That's fine, but it seems to me that bitpay is going to attract attention from authorities.  Were it to be shutdown, I hope their clients will not give up on bitcoins and start accepting bitcoins without turning them into USD immediately. Diamonds don't have value just because they are scarce.Imagine you actually could make some as big as you want, and at will.  Would you refrain yourself from doing it?  I bet you wouldn't.  You'd make some because diamonds are cool and pretty.Humans love to make things, regardless of whether it has value or not.  It just has to be fun, cool, or beautiful.  And because sometimes the value is not in the product, it's in the act of making it.If someone could figure out a way of making a car-sized diamond, I'm pretty sure someone would actually do it.
Nothing forces them to hold to their bitcoins.  They can convert donations into national currencies as soon as they are received.Anyway I expressed my opinion about the Wikimedia foundation already.  I believe we should NOT donate anything to them.Though Wikipedia is a great project (possibly the best ever that came out of the internet), I think the failure and disappearance of the Wikimedia foundation would be a good thing.  .  Nice analogy. Probably for the same reasons that the EFF stopped accepting it.Those might be wrong reasons, though.  Several other organisations do accept bitcoin and they have no problem with that. Well, last time I checked, Silk Road hadn't been shut down.So yeah, one can be anonymous on internet. Thanks so much for mocking my initial thread.  No hard feelings  My initial idea was rather:- gather a large amount of metal, concrete, or whatever strong material you have, and make something like a big cylinder about 2 meters high, 15 meters radius ;- drill a deep hole in the middle, about 10 centimeters wide ;- fill the hole with graphite ;- make a long steal rod that fits in the hole.  It will act as a piston.- build a large spherical water tank.  About 12 meters radius.  This one will do:- use some kind of rails so that the tank can only move vertically, and put everything above the cylinder.- fill the tank and let it press on the piston.- wait a bit.- empty the tank, take it away and retrieve the diamonds in the hole.Where would it fail exactly?? This is a question that naggers me sometimes.  It's about diamonds.  Ever since I heard about Neil Stephenson's book "The diamond age" (Haven't read it yet, though), I keep wondering why we are not capable of making diamonds in a industrial way.Some methods for making diamonds exist already.  Check out wikipedia if you don't know about them.So why is the biggest known diamond on earth still a natural one??  What's so hard?Also:  what about using a brute force method?   I mean, a diamond is made from carbon with pressures around 6GPa.  Fine, can't this be done without using explosives or stuff like that?  I mean, with a purely mechanical device?6 GPa.  That's 6 GigaNewton per square meter.  That's about 600e6 kg weighting on the same surface.  That's 600 Kt  (Kilo metric ton).   One ton is a cubic meter of water.    So 6 GPa is the pressure at the bottom of a 600 kilometers deep ocean.  That's deep.But I don't need a 1 meter-sized diamond.  I'd be happy with a 10cm one or so.  That's one hundred times smaller a surface than a square meter.  So I just need a 6 Km deep ocean, providing that I can manage to have a one square meter water column weight on a square decimeter one. Hell I can reduce the height of the thing by an hundred factor if I use a wilder column.  So, a ten-meter per ten-meter section column need to be 6 Km / 100 = 60m height.So here is my question:  isn't it possible to build a 10m x 10m x 60m pool (or a 11.27m radius spherical water tank) and have it weight on a 10cm x 10cm area? It's funny to see how difficult it is for some to accept Bitcoin for donations, despite the fact that it is technically ridiculously easy.The main obstacle seem psychological.  It's probably not easy for some people who have been bashing it few years ago.  I discussed in an other thread about how to use a more "usefull" algorithm for proof of work.Folding protein would be a good candidate, but as I mentioned it's not easy to tweak it into doing what SHA-256 can do.The key difference is that SHA-256 (or any other digest algorithm, for that matter) allows the miner to identify himself into the digest.  By doing so, it is not possible to "steel" the work of other.Basically with digests the hash of the coinbase transaction is in the proof of work.   So its author can publish it and noone can use it to forge an other proof of work with an other coinbase transaction.  It's tough to imagine something similar with protein folding.Yet I proposed something.Let imagine we have a list of polypeptides whose we are interested in knowing their three-dimensional structure.  I guess this basically consists in knowing which conformation of their rotational angles (because from what I know there is a rotational degree of freedom for each peptid link, right?) gives the lowest energy.My idea is that instead of working on each of these polypeptides brutally, as if there were all as important, each miner takes a preference list order, which would be the exact translation of the coinbase transaction.So he tries to find a lowest geometric conformation for each polypetide (as compared to the previously known lowest ones), but with a amelioration factor (the ratio between the new lowest divided by the previous lowest) that would decrease in the exact very order of the list mentioned above.By doing so, when publishing the result, it will be difficult if not impossible to re-use those results, since they are computed in a very specific performance order.  They will be usefull for scientists (they do indeed give a better known geometrical conformation), but useless for other miners willing to create an other proof of work for an other preference list order. Oui.  Mais bon en général les gens ne s'amusent pas à jeter l'argent par les fenêtres donc ils font attention.  Ceci dit il est clair qu'il y a déjà des tas de bitcoins qui ont été perdus.Il y a toutes raisons de penser que ça reste négligeable.   Comme l'or perdu au fond des océans du temps de la flibusterie.Et même si c'est significatif, ça n'est un problème que pour ceux qui ont perdu des bitcoins. Weren't you the one who was accusing of projecting human aspects on artificial intelligence?Creativity is the capability of creating stuff.  Whatever method is used to do so does not matter.Did a Computer Bug Help Deep Blue Beat Kasparov?Creativity often hides serendipity. Indeed creativity is not necessary for autonomy.  My bad.  Yet it is usefull.  And humans use it, so if machines are to do as good a job as humans, they might need to use it too. Empirical evidence is not the appropriate tool for inferring the possibility of things that do not exist in the present. Creativity is necessary for autonomy (because autonomy means you can adapt to unexpected situations, and to do so you need creativity).And autonomy is necessary if you want a system where no human labor is necessary (which is the main objective of RBE proponents, iirc). I'm no expert but it seems to me that you're talking about twentieth century style AI.   Nowadays computing engineers for AI use genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks and stuff like that.  They don't program the behavior of the machine.  Not with "if then else" lines anyway.   Moreover, your brain also has "parameters":  the maximum number of neurons, the physical laws they obey, and so on.   A computer might actually have more degrees of freedom than your brain can ever have.  At least because your brain is trapped in your skull and can't grow bigger than that. Yeah I mentioned that earlier.  You need intelligence so that your machines can be autonomous and creative in their decision-making.But you want to avoid self-awareness because you want to make sure they will obey.Consciousness is only desirable if you want to create a computational replica of your mind.  If you want immortality or something. Why wouldn't it be possible?  Why your brain would be so different from a machine?  It's just a bunch of cells, with a chemico-electric behavior that can be modelled. Indeed it does for some people.  I was just asking why.  Why would anyone worry if humanity doesn't exist in one thousand years?   Carpe diemNot at all. I'm gonna be a bit provocative here, but here I go:Why do you care so much about humanity surviving in the long run??  You will probably be dead anyway.For instance, there is a serious hypothesis that decline of fertility might worsen in coming centuries so that humanity might vanish "peacefully".  Is that really a bad thing?  Nothing is supposed to be eternal. If you send a transaction on the bitcoin network with a 0BTC fee, do you ask for charity? No, I just said that the price will be zero, because of the definition of the price as the last observed transaction on the market.  Nothing to do with a relation between labor and product.Yeah I was just thinking about that.   It's kind of far fetched, but in a sense, yes.   Except that we all know that normally if you want to eat a sandwich you just can't rely on charity (I don't think so, anyway).
Don't put double quotes around a phrase I did not write.There will be no fixed price (you can not prevent someone from buying something that could be free if this pleases him), but since we know there will always be at least a few transactions occurring for zero, then the price is zero.  Again, a bit like transaction fees in bitcoin. Well, the price is the last observed amount exchanged for a transaction, isn't it?Some people will manage to buy at zero, but if I don't agree with this price, I don't have to sell it at this price.  There sure will be other transactions for different amounts, but the lower, the only one we can talk about here, is zero. No.  Because as I wrote, "you might find someone" who will give it away for no payment.  I wrote that he will just order one of his robots to make it.  Some people would accept to do that for free (I'm pretty sure at least one will).  Some others won't.  It's subjective.It's like for bitcoin transactions.  There is no fixed price for transactions, but to me it's zero.  Because I'm pretty sure there will always be a miner that will accept to process my transaction even if there is no fee.  It might just take a bit more time. Indeed you're going into moral issues.  I don't want to talk about it.  I enjoyed the SF discussion but the rest is much less interesting.I might not care.  But I'm pretty sure someone would.  Whether or not the proportion of people caring about people not owning means of production could be enough to ensure that everyone owns means of production is contingent.  And I'm not interested in discussing it. You're annoying.  I don't know.  It's just as if you asked me if I give to beggars in the street.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  What I decide to do or not to do on these matters is my business.  There's nothing preventing them from doing what I did, anyway. See considerations above about the power of the sun compared to a possible maximum number of human beings.You might not need it, but with self-replicating machines, it can emerge. If someone is willing to pay, and if money is still useful, sure, I could sell some.   I'm not sure I would value money much in such a situation.  Remember that we're talking about robots capable of manufacturing almost anything.  But I guess there would still be some stuffs that only money can buy (maybe land on earth, for instance).  So you have a point. I'm not sure I could sell it if anyone is capable of doing what I did.  But if I were to sell it, it would not change the fact that I initially received it for free.If your point consists in saying that there could still be some people buying stuff, sure, it's possible.Kind of like free software.  It's usually also free as in "free beer", but for one reason or an other, you can buy or sell some as well. That's my business.  And that's a totally different story. Damn.  You got me here.  I wrote "they work for me for free", indeed.  But what I really meant is what I wrote just before that:  they don't ask for any payment.In other words, they come to me, they give me the product of their work, and they don't ask for any payment.  So what I received is free.   Not because of some logic consequence from some theory of value, but just as an empirical fact:  I received something and I didn't pay. You wanted facts, I gave you one:  the robots do not ask for any payment.  So they work for me for free, by any definition I know of the expression "working for free".  I have no other answer to give you. I like the way you say "must", as if it was some kind of moral issue.  The fact that it is free is not the result of a theory or even economics reasoning.  It's just the result of the fact that the robots do not ask for any payment.  It comes from the master-slave relationship between me and my robots.  I don't have to justify it.PS.  This raises an interesting question though.  Is it, from a purely theoretical point of view, possible to create an artificial intelligence smart enough to control and exploit self-replicating robots, and yet not smart enough to rebel against its creator/owner and refuse to work? I'm fine with paying someone if it is justified/needed.  Again, I just don't see who I should pay.  Those robots work for me, they work alone and they give me the product of their work.  I don't see where in this process I should pay anyone.  If I think it's free it's not because I don't work (I indirectly do via the work of my robots), it's because I am the only human involved.  If there were other humans before the beginning of the process, they have been paid already as I already discussed when talking about marginal cost. Well, a post-scarcity economy does not have the pretention to allow you to do anything.  I don't think so anyway.  And humanity is not necessarily going to spread on a "cosmic scale".At least from a theoretical point of view, you can create matter out of pure energy.  The sun emits the equivalent of about two million tons of mater per second, iirc.  And again, the feasability of a Dyson sphere is probably too a complex subject, but some smart people think it can be done.  So, why not.  And as I said, I think the power of the sun is so big that we don't even need to get all of it, anyway.It's not really because I don't have to work that I think it would be free (And even so, it would be a particular case, not proving a general idea).  If I think it would be free, it's only because I see noone I would have to pay.  The sun does not demand any payment.   My self-replicating robots won't either, providing that I can manage to keep them from rebelling against me. Sure, again nobody said that we were currently a type II civilization. Again, same type of arguments I hear from people who play lotery.What number would it take for you to consider that humanity will never need that much power??  Do you think the power consumption of humanity will keep increasing exponentially ad vitam aeternam?  Do you think the march to a type I, II and III civilization is inevitable?  That we are condemned, during our growth, to have only just about enough energy that we need, and no more? Again, in "resource" there is "source".   When we talk about the quantity of the resource, we don't necessarily talk about the water.  We can talk about the sea, as a source of waterCan we both use this source of water in the same time?  Yes, we can.But ok, you win.  What I really meant was that "the sea is an abundant source of water".  Which made me reluctant to say that sea water is something that can be considered scarce.(I keep thinking it is a terrible use of the word, though) Sea                         <=>      Planemolecules of water    <=>      seatspeople                      <=>     passengersJust think about a very, very big plane. I'm sorry but I have a lot of difficulties to admit that sea water is something that is scarce.  It's just silly.  If you isolate a cubic meter of it, sure, you only talk about a cubic meter of water so yeah, it is scarce.  Since you chose to ignore the fact that there is a whole sea of it.I'm sorry but it is you who is dense.  Sea water is not scarce because there is a LOT of it.  You don't make much sense.
Labor theory of value is a terrible economic fallacy, iirc.  It seems like an other common point that Zetgeist/VenusP has with communism, also. Why on earth would you be willing to take the actual very same cubic meter that I just took when there is a whole sea available??  You won't some sea water, right?  It does not have to be the actual water that I just took, does it?If you isolate the cubic meter as you do, then we are not talking about a sea of water anymore.  We are talking about a cubic meter of water.  You act as if the sea has just vanished away.  No wonder you conclude that this water is scarce.  You make it sound as if there was only one cubic meter for you and me.I don't understand your logic way of thinking.  It does not matter if you can't use the part of the water I took.  What matters is that there is still some water left for you to take.  There is much more than enough water for you and me, because the amount I took is very much negligible compared to the size of the sea.The sea is a water resource.  Using it consists in taking a small amount (necessary small compared to the size of a sea) of water from it.  We can both do it in the same time.  So it is not even scarce by your definition.It's as absurd as saying that any vehicle, no matter how big it is and how many seats it has, can not transport more than one person.  You'd say that on a plane for instance, if someone is using the seat number 42, you can't use this seat anymore.  So a boing 747 can only fly one person at a time.Haven't you noticed that in the word "resource", there is "source"?  We don't have to use the same water, but we use the same source of water.  So this source of water is not scarce.  So sea water is not scarce.  But maybe a more accurate to say it would be that the sea is not a scarce source of water. BTW there is something I don't get in this whole RBE/Zeitgeist/Venus thing.  In a post-scarcity economy, why would you need a political system to distribute resources??  Isn't that contradictory?  People (sometimes) need to ration things precisely when they are scarce.  If there is no scarcity, why don't you just let people build whatever they need when they need it? What do you mean exactly by "no matter how much demand there is"?.Let's go back to solar energy.  I said that to me it is abundant.  Or at least we can imagine a civilization in which it is.  Because there would be enough devices to convert it into electricity or other more practical form of energy and that would make a tremendous amount of power for ten billion humans.Now, you could say, "yes but if there are on thousand billion humans, the sun power might not be enough".  When you say "no matter how much demand is", do you include the body count of population?   If so, then to me nothing that is material can be abundant.  You can always imagine a number of people big enough so that the quantity of the material per human becomes very small.  In which case, the very notion of abundance looses much of its meaning.«- Look, there is plenty of cake for my birthday party!!- How many people are coming?- Ten. Why?- So there is not enough cake at all.  Because one hundred people might be coming.»(kind of look like a Lewis Carrol dialog, but it's what inspires to me the idea that Sun's energy is not abundant)The very notion of abundance has to depend on demand.  To me it means:  "when offer far exceeds demand".  Otherwise it does not make much sense. Indeed.  I see what you mean now.   You're probably right.  Reminds me of the typical examples we give to define non-rival goods:  sreet lights and bridges.I definitely prefer the "non-economical" definition of scarce:  «uncommon, rare; difficult to find; insufficient to meet a demand.»  It seems more consistant. Here's a funny remark.   Let's say "scarce" really means finite (or that whatever is finite is also scarce).Something that is abundant can very well be nethertheless finite.  After all, as mirkhul pointed it out (and even underlined it):  infinitiy does not exist (I don't think that's true but let's imagine it is).So something can be abundant and yet finit.  But if it's finite it is also scarce.Conclusion:  something can be both abundant and scarce.I'm sorry but to me, there is something wrong here. Well, there is a limited number of seats in the theatre, isn't there?  And only one person at a time can seat on a seat.  So it's not the movie that is rival (that's why there is such mess about copyrights anyway), it's the seats.  What's your point exactly? With this sentence I guessed that Obama was reelected.  I just checked on wikinews.  I was not wrong. The definition of rival fits into a road, as long as you consider a single use not being for the whole road, but for the actual surface on the road where your car is.   You can't stack cars one on top of an other, that's why the surface of the road is a scarce/rival ressource.  No.  I just don't live in a big chinese city.  The fact that pollution exists does not mean that air is scarce on earth.  Just as the fact that my bedroom is a mess doesn't mean that my town is not cleaned up often enough.At most, you can say that air is scarce in some areas of China.  We talked about that already.  You can always make something scarce locally, sure.  But it would be a serious abuse of language to conclude that air or see water are scarce commodities. Is see water scarce, according to you? I thought this was the definition or rivalBut ok, let's say "scarce" means "rival".  I'm not sure this world is used in the economic sense in english but it really is in my language, so that may be a source of our disagreement.  Also, in my language, "post-scarcity economy" is translated into "économie de l'abondance", so to me it was natural to think that scarcity is the opposite of abundance.There is a problem with this definition, imho.   Scarcity *does* depend of quantity.  You just can't say  "regardless of its quantity".  If a resource is abundant enough, then it can be used by several people at the same time.  Not the same actual atoms or molecules, sure, but still the same ressource.If I can dig into a stock without significantly consuming the stock, then this stock is still available for other uses.  So it is not scarce, by your definition.   Don't you agree that your definition can be understood this way? It'd be interesting indeed.  Yet all plants suddenly disappearing is quite a extreme hypothesis.  I don't worry about it happening any time soon.  So I don't worry about the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere.  To me, it is abundant and it will likely stay so for a long time.   I can breathe it without stealing anyone.If my robot does the work with the energy it gets from the sun, to me there is no cost.  There is the price I paid for the robot (and again the robot might have been built by another robot, we talked about it), but this has been paid already.  The aditional value is free (zero marginal cost).You can, locally, turn any normally abundant resource into a scarce resource.  Nothing fancy about this.  It happens in some particular situation.  Water in a desert, oxygen in a spaceship, and so on.  That does not mean you can say that the concerned substance is a scarce substance per se.  It has been made so by a very particular situation.  In a sealed room, I also would worry if you're with me breathing some air.  But that doesn't tell you anything about the scarcity of oxygen on earth. You wrote:  «because it is continually replenished by plants».  So you were talking about present plants.  I stressed out that current levels of oxygen are mainly due to prehistorical heritage of the plants activity. If all plants were to disappear, the oxygen levels would probably not drop to zero in a few days (yes, I'm exaggerating here)Lol.  I'm not on Ceres myself.  I'm not even in space.  I stay on earth and I let my robots do all the work.I'd like to ask you the question again:  do you seriously worry about other people breathing your oxygen?  Are you really going to insist on saying that air is a scarce commodity? I can't help noticing from your signature that you provide a conflict resolution service.  If the above quote is representative of your way to deal with conflict resolution, I find it quite amusing.   Not long in a sealed room.  But outside, I don't worry about you breathing oxygen.  There is a LOT of oxygen in the atmosphere, not just because of current plants activity, but because of the Great Oxygenation Event which occured 2.4 billion years ago.  I've never made the calculous, but I bet that if all plants were to disappear right now, all humans will die of hunger much before they die of suffocation.  So no, I don't consider that when you breathe you steal some of my oxygen.  Well, technically you do but I don't care at all because I consider oxygen to be abundant enough not to worry about it.Self repairing systems need material indeed, that can be found in environment.  It does not vanish in the ether.   Organic life uses and recycles dead bodies.  It just needs energy to transform it into something that can be used again.  And once again, there is plenty of energy available.   If life can do it, machines could, at least theoretically, do it as well.  They'll do it themselves, which means that you won't have to sustain or help them, which means that there will be no cost.   Q.E.D. This scenario is perfectly compatible with an infinite universe.It's a common mistake to think that the big bang theory means that the whole universe was at some point concentrated in a singular point.  It was not necessarly.  All we know from the cosmological observation is that galaxies move away from one another according to Hubble's law.  By extrapolating this law in the past, we can deduce that about thirteen billion years ago the universe was extremeley dense and hot.  But it could very well be still infinite!   It could have been hot, dense, and yet still infinite.  However close you go to the crucial moment, it was getting hotter and denser, but always staying infinite. No, I reject the notion that it matters as much as you think it does, or that it can be interpreted as a loss or a cost.  If we are enclosed in a 100m^3 room I can understand that the air I breathe might be a loss (or cost) for you, but this loss is twice smaller if we are in a 200m^3 room,  ten times smaller in a 1000m^3 room and virtually null outside.Indeed I neglect them.  Marginal cost for extracting sun's energy might be so low that I wonder how you would take account for it.  Say this cost is 1MBTC.  After everything is developped and something similar to a Dyson sphere is functional, you create 1TJ of energy per year.  You can neglect maintenance cost since the system self-repairs.   So the cost of your annual production is 1mBTC/J after one year.  After two years, this cost has halved (because you produced twice the energy for the same cost).  Ater n years, the cost is 1/n mBTC/J.  The more time passes, the less is the importance of the initial investment in the cost.  Because you paid for the construction of the production system, you don't pay for the energy it produces. I never said that a post-scarcity economy was certain in the future.  I just said it was possible. I'm afraid I just ignore it because from what you've been describing I just don't agree with the idea.  You tell me I have to understand it but maybe I do and I just think it's wrong.   To me, not winning something is not a loss. (PS.  and also, as mentionned earlier, the fact that if it's a cost, it's inversely proportional to the amount of the resource, so it's virtually zero for an abundant resource such as air).Yes, a lot of matter is needed indeed.  Maybe using the entire mass of Jupiter would not be enough.  I don't know.  But we weren't discussing the feasibility of a Dyson sphere, we were discussing whether it would make sense to use the energy of the sun to build it if it were possible.  I think it does providing you have enough matter and that your machines can self-replicate (yes indeed I insist on that, because it's totally necessary imho).I genuinely don't know.  But again, it seems that the more advanced a society is, the less children it makes.  Will humanity keep expanding exponentially for centuries?  I don't know.  But it's absolutely not certain. You've probably already seen it, but just for reminding:The sun is big and powerful.  I know that humanity is kind of egocenric and megalomaniac, but hell, I think it's a reasonable assumption that we will never need more energy than what the sun can provide. Also, myrkul initially wrote, and even underlined:  "Infinity does not exists".   Then we tell him that it is very much possible that the universe is actually infinite.   So yeah, infinity might very well exist and saying that "it does not matter because we can not measure it" is very much contradictory with his initial underlined statement.Plus, there are plenty of infinite things in maths and physics.  I actually wonder what myrkhul means when he says that infinite does not exist.  If there was no Planck length, I'd say that any distance contains an infinite number of subdistances, for instance.
It doesn't require much for a self-replicating machine.   Consider a tree seed.  It's just a tiny thing which costs almost nothing.  Put it in the ground in a place where it has room to grow and a few years later you have a whole forest.  It would be the same with a self-replicating machine.  It could gather a substantial fraction of the sun power (with a dyson sphere or something) with very little initial investment.I don't understand what you mean, here. Indeed.They are not even fringe theories, either.   We tend to forget it since Einstein has accustomed us to curved space times, but a globally flat, euclidian and thus infinite universe is totally compatible with current cosmological knowledge.Last time I heard someone defend this idea, it was Brian Green in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkoUSFk9lM0 Reminds me of a discussion I had once about lotery.  I was trying to convince someone that playing lotery is just a waste of money.  He kept telling me that as long as there is a chance, however small it is, to win the jackpot, it is worth playing.  I asked him if he would play if the odds to win was one against one billion.  He would.  one thousand billion?  He would.  I didn't asked him but if I had mentioned a googol, I guess he would have played as well.Sometimes when numbers are really big, it makes sense to consider them infinite.  Physicists do that all the time.Demographics prospective, based of empirical observation that in developed countries, the fertility rate tends to decline below the replacement rate.  It seems that being educated is not much compatible with having children. 4e26 Watts.  A nuclear power plant is about 200 MW.  So the sun has the power of 2e15 20th-century-technology-styled human power plants.  That's two million billions power plants.   Let me remind you that there are currently seven billion human beings, and there are several reasons to doubt humanity will ever count more than ten billion members. So the sun could, in a type I civilization of 10 billions human beings, provide the power of almost one million power plants per inhabitant.Tell me:  is there a number for which you think it is reasonable to consider it is infinite?  What power would it take for you to consider that humanity would have more than enough?  A whole galaxy? I don't buy this.  Yes, that reduces the supply of that resource, but by a proportion that is all the more negligible that the resource is abundant.  When people around you breathe, do you honestly think they are reducing the amount of oxygen available to you?  Does it really bother you?Energy is not the issue.  The sun is insanely big.   For all intents and purposes, we can consider that it provides a free and infinite source of energy.LoLI was just thinking that if I send some robots in the solar system, I could worry about my robots being stolen by some other crazy guy, so I could give them quite a bit of artificial intelligence and an evolutionary algorithm for reproduction so they can defend themselves.  But if I do so, they could became self-aware and start wondering why they should obey me in the first place... So that's your opportunity cost again.  I definitely don't get this thing.  Maybe I miss something and I'll read this wikipedia article someday.  But right now, to me there is no cost as long as you don't exhaust the resource.  Even if I make a lot of robots, I probably won't exhaust resources in the solar system.  Not because I can't (I probably could), but because I don't have to.  So in a nutshell, there is no cost since there is enough resource for everyone(*).Hell, even if I did mine all the asteroids and planets and moons of the solar system, the matter is still here, in the robots.  I'll probably have more than enough (jeez I know human greed is enormous, but not that much), so I won't bother if other people destroy some of my robots to build some for them.  But well now maybe someone will try to destroy all of them and we'll have a crazy interplanetary war, so in this case you might be right.  Yet I don't think the solar system is not big enough to satisfy all human greed.Oh yeah, the grey goo, funny concept I heard about recently, I forgot where.  IIRC, I heard or read a conclusion from a scientist on this subject, according to which there is nothing to worry about.  Won't happen.*:  PS and again, at least from a theoretical point of view, you can create matter out of pure energy.  The sun radiates about 4e26W, that's four million tons of matter per second.  A very advanced civilization could make lots of stuff with that. Say I buy an autonomous, post-scarcity-style robot for 100 bitcoins.   I tell him:  "go and figure out a way to multiply yourself".  Then the robot starts extracting minerals from the ground, builds a factory and make copies of himself.  Then they build a spaceship, travel to the asteroïd belt (I know this is wild SF, but that's the subject),  extract more minerals, build even more factories, more spaceships and so on.  After ten years one million of them come back to earth, waiting for my orders.It's just as if I had bought, with only 100 bitcoins, one million robots.  With a ten years delivery delay, though.   Notice that it's an exponential law.  If I give the same instruction to each of the robots now, ten years later each of them will have created one million new robots.  So in twenty years I'll have one thousand billion and one million robots (10e12+10e6).   That's much less than a satoshi per robot.What I mean is that once you have self replicating machines, the price (or cost, if you want) of the initial units does not matter at all.  By allowing the machines to multiply themselves, you can make the price per unit arbitrary low.   And to me, when something is arbitrary close to zero, it is zero. This is possible, but not certain. The production capacity can very much exceed human needs and desire. Because I didn't read this part sorry. Let me ask you, just to make things clear:  do you seriously think that air is a scarce resource??   If air is scarce, I very much wonder what is not.I did not need/want this wood for anything but to build this boat.  So it really does not cost me to use it. Really this argument you're making is weird.  I don't get it.Let me remind you that current technology is not "post-scarcity".  From a theoretical point of view, there is nothing preventing a solar cell to repair itself, or to be repaired by autonomous robots.   Basically just as organic life has been doing for three billion years.  Post-scarcity economy will happen when inorganic, man-made artifacts will be able to extract energy and seemingly maintain a low entropy has life does.  It's not for no reason that many people mention the self-replicating device as a key point when talking about post-scarcity.Cost can be zero, imho.  This clearly is our main disagreement. Not really, you were not.   Compressed air is not just air.  Same as diamond is not just carbon. Yeah except that when something is "0 price", I, like many people on this planet, say it is free.  Not unpriced.I don't know this notion well, but from what I see, it seems far fetched.  Sure, it costs me some time (during which I could have done stuff), but just as much time as if I had stayed sited doing nothing.  To me if something costs the same thing as if nothing happened, it pretty much means it costed nothing.Energy itself can be free.  It comes from the sun and the sun doesn't ask me any payment.Sure, I need an energy conversion device to convert the solar radiation into usable energy, so you're going to tell me that this energy has a cost.  It's just not true.  The cost of the production unit is fixed, but the amount of energy it can produce it proportional with time.  And a production unit can make other production unit.  What's the cost of a production unit if it has been created by an other production unit?  Tell me exactly how you calculate that.   I think you can't, or that if you try, you'll come to realize that it will tend to zero.  So to me, energy can perfectly be free.Cost is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for a price.  Things can be very expensive to build and yet nobody will want to buy them (because the people who build them were just wrong about what the market wanted).  And things can be dirt cheap to build and yet very expensive (because they are rare, purely artistic/intellectual product, I'm sure there are plenty of examples). If a concept is true but « only » during a few billion years, it doesn't mean it is false.   If you want, yes, you can say that a post-scarcity economy can not last during more than a few hundred million years.Yes, and I don't see why those "extremely low" prices could not actually reach the zero limit. LoL  I am very close to libertarian ideas myself, you know.  Actually, I usually agree with most of what Myrkul write iirc.  But not on this, apparently.And anyway, I still think the Zeitgest movement or Venus project stink, since they seem to be willing to use politics in order to realize an hypothetical transition to a resource based post-scarcity economy.  This is wrong, as if this must happen, it has to be via technological progress and free market. Yes, that's what I meant when I mentioned air.  Honestly I don't know what this obsession about infinite amounts is about. I'm sorry but what I meant with free is not "unpriced".  There is a price.  It's zero.If by cost you mean "what you need to provide to produce something", then yes, there is always a cost.  You need time and you need energy for instance.  But to me it is not incompatible with the idea of something being "free", as in, again, you don't have to pay anyone to have it. To me if I can build a boat by myself, using wood I found in a forest, this boat is "free".  I did not pay anyone to use this wood and I used my own work.  And if one of my robots does it for me it's even clearer since I didn't even work, I just ordered him to do it.It is priced.  If you want something that you can not produce yourself (because you don't have any robot, in which case you'll probably ask for a robot), you might find someone (at least one person), that will give it to you without asking any payment (because he will just order one of his robots to make it).  By definition, it will mean that the price will be zero since at least one transaction can occur at zero.It very much depends on the size of the human population in coming centuries.  The power of the sun can totally be enough, as we don't have to spread through the galaxy.  Growth is not inevitable.Post-scarcity economy does not pretend to violate mass-energy conservation and things like that.   The fact that production capacity has to be finite does absolutely not mean that it can not overwhelm human needs and desires.  You keep talking about infinite production.  I wonder why.   Free doesn't mean infinite.  It means you don't have to pay anyone for it.    You own machines that produce or transport anything you need.   And you use the energy of the sun.Assuming the energy of the sun and the total available amount of matter (which can at least theoretically be produced from the energy of the sun anyway) are much enough to produce and power the machines used by the human population, it is very much possible that both energy and transportation are free. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scarce«Uncommon, rare; difficult to find; insufficient to meet a demand.»Prices exist only where there is a market.  And there is a market only where transportation is not too big a problem.    EDIT:  I let myself guided in a wrong direction.  This is not the issue.  We are in the hypothesis where transportation and production are free. But yes, at least from some local point of view there will always be areas where there will still be scarcity.  At least because the speed of light is finite.  We talked about it above in this thread.  If you travel through interstellar space, you can only use what's in your spaceship and the bigger it is, the more energy you need to move it.  So there is little chance that you can avoid scarcity for this.I don't think that denies all pertinence to the post-scarcity economy concept, though.   If a group of people travel to the desert, the most valuable thing for them is water.  That doesn't say much about the value of water for the rest of the world.   Traveling through a desert or through interstellar space are very particular human activities. We lack the means to transport air and sand where we need it.  Indeed some people might need air in spaceships for instance, and yet this will not make me tell that there is a lack of air on earth!I repeat my point:Scarcity happens when the total amount of what's available is not enough to satisfy demand.Post-scarcity economy will happen if at some point in the future production capacity far exceeds population growth.  Which is totally possible.There is no need to talk about infinity anywhere in this debate.  It's about what's needed or desired and what is available or can be produced. Absence of scarcity does not mean infinite amount.  There is no scarcity in sand nor air, and yet the total amount of these things is finite:  huge, but finite.Scarcity happens when the total amount of what's available is not enough to satisfy demand.Post-scarcity economy will happen if at some point in the future production capacity far exceeds population growth.  Which is totally possible. Talking about post-scarcity economy does not mean you have no more desires.In a post-scarcity economy, you can still have the will to have more stuff.  But in order to acquire those stuff, you don't have to compete with other people.  You can make those stuff yourself (i.e. with your machines) without bothering anyone.  You don't have to share or buy anything. Scarcity can go away if you let your imagination go wild.  There is no physical principle preventing  a post-scarcity economy from happening.
Kaku talking about post-scarcity economy on youtube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzgVWpa4fzUYeah sure, in a world where we can create anything by pressing a button, we won't need money and we won't need to work.  And yes, that'd be great.   But that has nothing to do with a social or political project.  It's purely technological.Until we have such technology, we still need money to deal with scarcity.  When two people want a same thing, the one who will get it must be the one who is willing to do an effort to get it, to work for it, to give something in exchange.  In a nutshell:  to pay the price.Saying that we should give up on money now because we might reach a post-scarcity in the future is just silly. Non, je me suis trompé.  Désolé.

Today I was reading an article about airless tyres and this led me to realize something funny about tyre producing companies such as Michelin or Goodyear.The business of those companies consists in reinventing the wheel.  Literally. +1If the Pixar studio could be in charge of a new Star Wars movie, the result might be cool. Somehow it seems to me the following video might be relevant in this thread:NASA | Computer Model Shows a Disk Galaxy's Life HistoryIt's amazing how they manage to see how a galaxy gets this typical disk form.   This the central black whole, spiral-shaped branches and all.  I mean, ten years ago this process was pretty much a mystery, and now it can be reproduced on computer.  That's impressive. Not even a subatomic-scaled simulation of a billion years of evolution for a whole universe?  I doubt so.I believe reality goes "as fast as possible".  If you could go faster, it seems to me that it kind of would mess up with the very definition of time.   But I confess I'd have difficulties to rigorously explain why.  It's an intuition I got. This entity does not need to have any intelligence, conscience or whatever.  For instance in the holographic principle, the simulation is realized by the very particular physics occuring at the horizon of a black hole.  And there is no need to imagine that a black hole is some kind of self-aware being. added to list «A Turn of the Page for NewsweekAfter 80 years in print, the newsmagazine adopts an all-digital format.»http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/18/a-turn-of-the-page-for-newsweek.htmlNeither the first, nor the last, but I think this subject deserves its own thread if there is none already.NewsweekTimeThe TimesThe Washington PostThe Wall Street Journal......Bitcoin magazine(we should fill this list) Interesting point.   Simulating a Lorentz invariant world got to be tricky.  I don't quite see how the simulator's clock could fit when compared to those of the simulation. Damn, you're right.   Ok, then I'll also create something I'll call "dark energy" and this thing will have the power of expanding the universe at an ever-accelerating rate.I know it sounds totally lubricious but for some reason I'm sure they'll buy it.   True.  Kind of like Conway's game of life, but in more complicated I guess.  Haven't thought about that.It's not from the 13th floor.  I imagined it.    I'm glad to see someone will be able to do it at some point.  I confess I tried to read the autotools documentation but I found it quite tough to grasp so I kind of gave up.If you can do it, it's great.  It's ok if you prefer to wait until he changes the directory structure.  There is no rush. I would have much difficulty to explain why, but I have a strong belief that the kind of simulation he's talking about can not run faster than reality.  Therefore, It is not possible for evolved conscious beings to simulate their evolutionary history up to their current level of consciousness, as it would take way too much time.  So they would not do that, either because it would be pointless (who wants to wait a billion years for the result of a computation?), or because they would just have no time to do it in the universe they live in (considering their universe might have a finite lifespan for cosmological reasons). So I think amongst his three hypothesis, it's the second which is true:« any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); »It doesn't mean they can not gather enough computing power.  It just means that having an infinite computing power does not mean you can simulate anything as fast as you want.It's a very interesting paper though.  Thanks.  I'll read it more thoroughly some day. Just watched "the 13th floor" for the first time.  It was nice.  Funny it came out the same year Matrix did.It made me think of the following dialog:«- Damn those simulated human beings are so annoying.  They keep exploring the artificial world we create for them.- So? That's good right?  It means they have curiosity and initiative.- Yeah, but eventually they always manage to find out the limit of the domain and then they realize they are not real.  It's messed up.  So we have to make an other world and reboot the whole thing.- Can't you make a bigger world?  Or a world topologically round?  Like a sphere?- We did.  We made a round planet for them to live on, with a force that attracts them to the center, so that people on the lower half don't fell off.- Makes sense.  Did that work?- Nope, they did explore the whole planet but those morons also started to look at the sky.  Like, "with a telescope" look.- What's the problem with that?- The problem is that it gave them the idea of exploring space as well.- Jeez.  And now you need to make a closed-curved universe as well?- Screw that.  I don't have enough energy and resource to do something like that.  I'll make it simpler.   I'll make it look like the universe is extremely big and that stars are separated by huge distances, like light-years distances.- Won't work:  at some point they'll manage to increase the speed of their spaceships and they'll reach your limits again.- Yeah, that's why I'll add a rule saying that mass increases with speed, so that one needs an infinite amount of energy to accelerate above the speed of light.- I see.  With such a rule, interstellar space travel will never be possible for them so whatever they do they'll never encouter the limits of your data.  Good work.»
This thread reminds me of a theory from Nikodem Poplawski according to which the universe might be inside a black hole (and that black holes are actually alternate universes).I have to dig into his work one of this days because it's much more credible than one might think.Did you know that apart from neutron stars and black holes, the only thing whose radius is of the same order of magnitude than its Scharzchild radius is the observable universe itself??If you link this to the holographic principle, then a black hole's horizon is kind of a 2D quantum-computer which simulates its own universe.  And we would be the result of such a simulation.I don't think the proposed test in this thread could be applied though.  From what I understand, they imagined kind of an inferior type of computer.  Not as powerful as a black hole horizon.  You wrote "conciseness" three times.  If you're a computing simulation, there's a bug. Lol.  Exactly. Damn.  Here we go a gain.  Guess a lot of people are going to come and complain about deflation/thesaurization/whatever.78% to me seems good enough, anyway. That's possibly the best explanation.  Which gives me an idea for a poll. For those interested in the holographic principle, there is this presentation from Leonard Susskind (pretty much the guy who developped the concept):The world as an hologram Google "holographic principle". Then please explain to us what is wrong in the following reasonning:« With computerized simulations, it's necessary to create a lattice to account for the distances between virtual objects and to simulate the progression of time. The German team suggests such a lattice could be created based on quantum chromodynamicstheories that describe the nuclear forces that bind subatomic particles.To find evidence that we exist in a simulated world would mean discovering the existence of an underlying lattice construct by finding its end points or edges. In a simulated universe a lattice would, by its nature, impose a limit on the amount of energy that could be represented by energy particles. This means that if our universe is indeed simulated, there ought to be a means of finding that limit. In the observable universe there is a way to measure the energy of quantum particles and to calculate their cutoff point as energy is dispersed due to interactions with microwaves and it could be calculated using current technology. Calculating the cutoff, the researchers suggest, could give credence to the idea that the universe is actually a simulation. » I bet 100BTC that it is not a simulation. Do you guys know about tribler?If you don't, you seriously need to check it out.  In a nutshell, it's a fully decentralized P2P file-sharing network, with "play-while-you-download" capability and a backward compatibility with bittorrent.I've been trying it a bit for the last few weeks and it was a little buggy but today I found out that the 6.0 version is out, with a brand new interface and all.  Seems really awesome.PS. If you are on debian Sid, you can even install it from the main debian free repo:$ apt-cache show tribler$ su -# apt-get update && apt-get install tribler The part when he's still in the cabin and opens the door before preparing himself to jump reminded me so much the 2001 scene where Dave must return in the spaceship without his helmet.  When you think about it, there are quite a few similarities.  The pod is about the same size as Baumgartner's cabin and both of them must get out of it in a dangerous way that most astronaut normally don't do. Found this quote on wired:Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble. Its not about breaking records anymore. Its not about getting scientific data. Its all about coming home.It's kind of touching and people who dream about living on Mars should meditate this imho. Why is occupy Wall street movement not immediately embracing bitcoin?Because they behave like monkeys. This thing relies on the bitcoin faucet, and anyway it basically consists in encoding a hash of a salted message into a private key.  This scheme was discussed long ago on the forum (Satoshi himself talked about it) and it convinced no one for several reasons, one of them being the cost of transactions that would be prohibitive iirc.« First we ran,openssl rand -out random.dat 20creating a file containing a 20 byte random factor.Then we concatinated the randomness to the end of the file and hashed it using RIPEMD-160,cat abstract.pdf random.dat > preimage.datopenssl dgst -ripemd160 preimage.datgiving us the result:135e3712334428d4061efe4e5ffd5ff817aeb817We called an online tool to convert this hash into a valid Bitcoin address giving us:12mQhpvGYdBrvDJq6sFGwEe3GETaqEM4JkFinally, we used the Bitcoin Faucet to send BTC0.005 to this address. » Here is an idea:   a world-wide, distributed, decentralized supercomputer that would use bitcoin's block hashes as timetamps for synchronization of processes.Such a computer would have quite a low ticking clock (only 6 ticks an hour in average), but it would me massively parallel.This is just a short description and I'm not going in the details of how exactly it would work but I have some ideas.  I'll be more explicit if some people are interested. I think we all underestimate how indeed the blockchain idea will be important in the future.I believe the blockchain concept provides something that was missing in distributed computing: a reliable, trustworthy, decentralized logical clock.The applications are countless:- distributed and decentralised electronic markets (that will be the end of conventional, centralized stock exchanges);- worldwide-scaled operating systems running zetaflop supercomputers (including an artificial intelligence and expert system whose brain will be distributed all over the world);- distributed, uncontrolled virtual reality where many people will spend most of their time (yes, like in Matrix);  « Sometimes I just can't sleep because I can't wait to be living on a seastead, paying﻿ my rent in bitcoins, and having a 3D-printed steak for dinner. »  It has.  Bacteria cultures in laboratory need only a few weeks to evolve and develop resistance to antibiotics.  Moreover, great video games do not need terrific graphics.  Isn't Tetris still popular nowadays? Minecraft is an awesome video game, but it's even more than that.I don't play video games much but I can tell Minecraft is a milestone in video game history.   I also sincerely believe it will succeed where other games such as Second Life had quite failed.  It created the basic blocks (pun intended) for a global, user-friendly virtual reality.
Reminds me of a physicist joke about Everett's interpretation of QM:«- According to Everett, there is a universe in which Sarah Palin is president of the United-States?- Well you know, it has to be compatible with the laws of physics.» Make the thread sticky, maybe? It's close enough.Because there are just too many possible answers.  You just have to pick a representative subset of them.  I didn't think very deep about this because I know there's just no way to make everyone happy anyway. It's pretty much the same as option 2. After some thought, and a few mail exchanges with RMS, my opinion is that it would be nice if Mathew could stick to GPL (yes, GPL, not LGPL).    People would indeed not be able to link to cbitcoin without releasing their source code.  So be it. Not sure any poll on the September announcement has been posted yet. Did he really use the word "hacker" in this sentence?  Is that a bad thing to be a hacker?Also, who is Peter Vessenes?  Never heard this name before. And is that why our heart is on the left side?  (this is almost a serious question) That is not counter-intuitive at all.  Such bubbles are legions in a free market, at all scales.   Members of a family exchange stuffs without using money.     Many workers co-operatives exist.  And I'm sure you can find many other examples of communism-inspired organizations.  In a sense, communism is allowed in capitalism, provided it stays voluntary. It kind of sound like you do, though.  At least because you keep saying "islamic civilization".   At school I was told that the arabs preserved and developed antique knowledge during the european dark ages and that it allowed renaissance.  You keep associating religion to that and it's difficult not to see it as proselytism,  but I'm Ok to give you the benefit of the doubt. And as I said, their advance in science at this time had probably little to do with their religion, and was rather due to their geopolitical situation at this time, which is quite complex.  It would be absurd to promote a religion just because it happened to be the religion of a great civilization at some time in the past.   There were lots of them, I bet you just pick the one you currently believe in, or the one which corresponds to your ethnicity. Today I've learnt that a black hole made of pure energy is called a kugelblitz.http://youtu.be/4fuHzC9aTikhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics) Well, maybe he has a few hundred millions invested already, besides of these 12 millions. "Prix de fabrication"?  Donc tu ne cherches pas à faire de profit avec ce livre?  Dois-je en conclure que la version électronique est disponible gratuitement? No.  But one of the premisses of the story is based on something similar. Have you watched The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya?    The problem with this conception is that such an idea of God is far, far away from the conceptions of organised religions.  In particular, in such a "theist" picture of God, humans do not play any particular role.  God does not care about them more than he cares about ants. As I said, extraordinary claims that we have no way to verify, either for practical or ethical reasons, are condemned to remain inside the domain of myths. Indeed it's important to mention that the subject should be capable of describing what happened in the room if he claims that he was actually floating outside of his body.I suggest we write a word on his front-head and we make sure there is no mirror in the room when he wakes up. It makes it an interesting subject of study, but unless you can reproduce those circumstances and observe the claimed effect, skepticism is natural.These phenomenons can turn into myths, by the way.  They are related facts that are plausible (I don't think near death experiences are actually post-mortem or surnatural, but other topics might have some plausibility), but for whom we do not have any way to test the truth.  The modern form is the urban legend, I guess.
It has been witnessed, but nobody has ever been able to reproduce the experience at will.   It's like cryptozoology:  some people say they have seen weird animals, but when we go to the place and have a look, no matter how hard we try, we never see anything.  So you just can't believe those witnesses blindly.  On the opposite, when someone wants to check if Jupiter exists, I've never heard of anyone claiming it doesn't.  It's quite reliable. Unfortunately, I must admit there is some truth in this.  I believe in a lot of scientific concepts, and yet I don't understand them all.  At some point to believe in science you have to put some faith in scientists.On the other hand, does that mean that science is nothing but a modern kind of religion?  I don't think so.  At least with science, you have the theoretical possibility to learn how to understand or experience things you did not understand nor see by yourself.For instance, I've never seen Jupiter through a telescope.  So to me it just looks like a very bright point in the sky (I've watch it several times).  But if one day people suddenly start questioning the fact that it looks like what we currently know it looks like (i.e., a huge cloudy planet with a big red storm on the south hemisphere), at least I could buy a telescope and figure it out by myself.   That's a big difference:  no religion provides any practical procedure to test its truth. So?  With this kind of argumentum ad populum, I guess there would be no one to advocate for open-source licenses at all in the first place, considering how little popular they were at some point in the history of computing. If the benefit you're talking about is only about mass adoption, I do not care.  Even if it means a "better quality", I do not care either.  I prefer to use a Free Software rather than a proprietary software, even if it has a lower quality. Maybe.  But it is much, much closer to reality than is your RBE, for instance. I'm going to make it probably too simplistic, but to me it just fills the gaps of our knowledge and understanding of the World.  When something happens and we don't know why, this makes us uneasy.  To feel better, we sometimes just say "it happened because someone did it, somehow".  "God" is just one of the many words we created to call it. I thought you meant that information requires consciousness to exist.  Whether this consciousness comes from a human, an inhabitant of the Alpha Centauri system or a God-like being does not matter.  Consciousness is consciousness.Information has quite an accurate scientific definition nowadays.  It even has a mathematical formulation.  It's one of the basic concepts of thermodynamics, which means that it is used to analyze matter on molecular level and thereby define notions such as temperature.  And I assure you, to do so physicists do not need to assume that anyone has a full awareness of the exact position and momentum of all existing particles.   It even goes beyond than that if you want to talk about quantum mechanics, but this is probably off topic. I wonder if you know how close this is from some hard science fiction concepts. Is it?  Oh shit it is.  I really thought it was GPL.   My bad.   I guess you guys win. Information does not need a conscious mind to exist, though I understand this is a tricky philosophical question.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest Just so you know, I've just sent an email to RMS about this.  As I said, I think it's an important enough issue to bother him. I gave my opinion but as you might have understood, I'm not a professional programmer, not even an experienced or talented one.  So maybe indeed GPL is not a good fit for a library.  The only example of a GPL library I know is the GNU libc library itself.I suggest that during those few weeks you seek wisdom in the FSF community, on IRC or something.   Hell, maybe you can send an email to RMS himself  (I'm serious, I think this is an important enough topic, and we now know that RMS is aware of bitcoin). I'm must say I'm quite surprised by this GPL hate.Fair enough.  If MatthewLM wants to stick with GPL (I really hope he will), then cbitcoin will only be linked with GPL applications, which is totally fine imho.In long term, I think bitcoin will need at least one GPL implementation, for reasons too long to explain.  It does not matter if not everyone uses it. There were two parts in my post.  The first one was to show you that the fact that religion exists does not mean that it gives an evolutionary advantage to humans.  It does not anymore than the common cold or diabetes does.The second one was to alarm you of your reasoning that consists in saying "it has existed for thousands of years, so it must be good".These were two separate arguments.  Please don't mix them. Indeed, please stop.  It's just confusing. As I said, it is insane.So you basically want to treat humans like animals in a farm.  Taking care of all their needs and desires in an organized, "rational" way.   I guess you're fans of Orwel and Aldous Huxley, aren't you?Tell me:  when you read "Brave new world", did you think oh my gosh this is the way to go, by any chance?  This is insane.If on morning I want to drink coffee instead of tea, do I have to leave the county as well? I'm not sure but I think space is a terrible environment for electronics.  There are radiations, cooling issues (it's cold but there is no air to convect heat), and it's pretty damn difficult to bring a human if there is a need for a repair or change of component. Wired: Why We Need a Supercomputer on the Moon« It would be a mammoth technical undertaking, but a University of Southern California graduate student thinks theres a very good reason for doing this: It would help alleviate a coming deep-space network traffic jam thats had NASA scientists worried for several years now. »Unless the secret goal would be to mine bitcoins for government?  (  just kidding, of course) It can.  It's just that it mostly doesn't depend on you.That being said, not being happy does not necessarily mean being miserable.IMHO
Je crois qu'il vaut mieux éviter ce genre de publicité sur le forum.  Sinon très vite tout le monde va s'y mettre (y compris quitte à créer des faux-nez pour l'occasion).D'un autre coté je dis ça mais j'ai une pub dans ma signature.  Dans les signatures tout le monde le fait depuis le début du forum, donc ok.  Mais faire de la pub dans le corps d'un message, et pour ne rien dire d'autre, c'est pas tout à fait pareil amha.J'en parlerais volontiers au modérateur, mais comme c'est Davout et que c'est le créateur de bitcoin-central, je ne suis pas sûr qu'il soit très objectif.    You gotta be kidding, right? I've tried to explain them that countless times.  I'm still waiting for an accurate answer. You haven't read my quote above of Daniel Dennet comparing religion to the common cold, have you?Religion has an evolutionary advantage...  for religion.   Same as a common cuckoo has an "evolutionary advantage" other a reed warbler:Parasitism does exist.  And it does not give any evolutionary advantage to the host.You know, slavery also has been common for thousands of years.  Does that make it a good thing? Nice summary. You mean a conspiracy theory, right?  Like in Truman show?  Do you know that there is a psychiatric term for this?Then I guess he'll have to talk to you about Occam's razor and how conspiracy theories can not reasonably explain anything since it is always possible to imagine one. +1Especially considering how easy it is to publish a scientific paper nowadays.   Consider this:There is not a single article mentioning the word "Zeitgest" in arxiv.orgEdit.  My bad, I made a typo.  There is one.  A single ONE on the whole arxiv.http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2016Here is the abstract:« Whereas physics in the period from about 1880 to 1910 experienced a steady growth, it was also a revolutionary period in which the foundations of the physical world picture were criticized and reconsidered. Generally speaking, from about 1890 mechanics and materialism came under increasing attack and sought replaced by new formulations based on either energy, the ether, or the electromagnetic field. Fin-de-siecle physics was in many ways a chapter of turmoil in the history of science. I review the main developments and alternatives to the established physics, in particular energetics, ether physics, the electromagnetic world view, and also the role played by radioactivity and other new rays discovered in the years around 1900. In the end the anticipated revolution based on the "matter is dead" catchword did not succeed. A revolution did take place in the period, but it was a different one that did not derive from the Zeitgeist of fin de siecle. » Economics, politics are not really science, are they?   I mean, politics is about deciding what's good for society.  And science has very little to say about what's good or wrong in the way people live their lives.Any "social design project" stinks.   Society is not something that has to be designed by anyone.  It is an phenomenon that emerges from a collective behavior, not from the wicked mind of some lunatics.  You know what kind of people used to talk about science in order to defend their views on society?  Eugenists, and not just in the german third reich.To me this whole Zeitgest movement seems to be in the direct lineage of Francis Galton.  It's not the same theory, but there is the same way of trying to defend it.But let's just give you the benefit of the doubt, one second.  You say "science is based on facts".  Ok, what facts are you talking about?  Which reasoning exactly leads you to think that your crappy socialist project is the way to go for humanity?  And please don't just point me to a youtube video or some weird esotheric website.  If you are not capable of summering it yourself here, I suspect it's either because you did not understand it, or because there is just not much to understand. What the heck I gave her .2 BTC.   I remember the first time I got bitcoins.  It was on IRC and a guy gave me bitcoins just like that.   So I guess I can give a bit to a self-proclaimed homeless girl begging on the net. Well, I disagree.I'm not a native english speaker though, so I'm not in best position to talk about word definition.  Still, I do right now consider my life worthwhile, and yet I would not say I am happy in the sense this millionaire guy we're talking about in this thread is, for instance. I very much doubt this is happiness.  When I talked about it, I did not mean "transcendental joy".  I meant happiness as what I can imagine it is through its description in standard cultural stereoptypes (familly, fullfilling job, love and stuff like that).I know what satisfaction, tranquility and thrill are.  But I would not call that happiness.   Maybe happiness is what describes what we feel when we have it all.   Then I doubt it is reasonable to hope for that.IIRC, bouddhists believe in something they call renouncement.  I'm pretty sure that's why they don't call their ultimate goal "happiness".  It's just much more complicated than that. The linux kernel is under GPL.  That did not prevent Google from using it with Androïd.Also, if they don't want to use cbitcoin because it's GPL, at least the very existence of cbitcoin will show them it's possible to port bitcoin into C.  So they'll rewrite their own C code.   That's good enough to me. Very few people think there is nothing beyond what they currently experience, because we experience very little of the whole world.  Think about astronomers.  They might believe there is nothing beyond what could possibly be experienced, yet they don't lack any imagination to create new ways of seeing beyond what could previously be seen and thereby discover new worlds.  And sometimes, these new words blow our minds:  there are many quite amazing stuff in the universe.So believing there is nothing beyond what can be experienced does not produce stagnation of the mind, on the contrary:  it gives an incentive to expand our ability to experience things.Yes, imagination is great.  And fantasy is often an effective way to exercise it.  But you don't need to actually believe it.  I like Star Wars movies and yet I don't believe in the power of the Force. You smoke?  Do you buy your own cigarettes sometimes?That would be kind of ironic for someone who asks for bitcoin donations.   I sure would not give bitcoins to someone who would just burn them. This is true, but off topic. Does happiness exist, anyway?   I mean, I know some people experience it.  Good to them.  But is it really reasonable to seek for that in your life?  Can't there be more "modest" goals?   Achievement, for instance?  Peace of mind?  Or just curiosity about what this amazingly changing world will be in thirty years?I don't remember having experienced anything that looked like happiness.  I can't say I had a miserable life, it was just "ok", I guess.Do you really need to be happy to make your life worthwhile? First you say that "the entire economy of the world is based around stealing from the poor", and now you say it affects the whole world economy.  Please clarify, because to me, this is not the same thing at all.To me it seems that what you wanted to say is that there is a minority class whose economic activity is based on stealing from the poor in the whole world.    There is some truth in that.  This minority takes a bit from a lot of people.But what you actually wrote was kind of reversed:  you said that the entire world economy is based on stealing from the poor.  This is silly.I was comparing to the worldwide drug market.  And those derivatives are, by definition, based on other financial instruments, which can very well be "real" economic assets, with real economic activities behind, with real workers and production and so on.  So I'm not sure it makes your point.  It's probably quite a complicated subject anyway.  This guy is right about a few things.I'm amazed he keeps that much money in cash though.  You need to seriously trust the USD to do that. I don't care much about the things you're talking about.  Before bitcoin I owned gold.  So I was not much concerned about inflation, for instance.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure it's extremely biased to think Wall Street activity is representative of "the whole world economy".I would not be surprised if the drug market in whole world represent much more money than WallStreet, for instance.  So your picture of an evil government-controlled economy does not fit well in my idea of what economy is.Say the government steals 10% of each economic transaction in the world.  Well, that's 10% of the whole economy.  That's bad, sure, but that's not the entire economy of the world  (SIC).I think you seem weirdly totally obsessed with monetary subjects.  Seems that starvation is not your only fixed idea.Gold exists.  And now Bitcoin exists as well.  So stop complaining. You were talking about "the entire economy of the world".   This was a grotesque oversimplification.Reminds me of a discussion I had in an other thread with an other adept of these communist idea about redistribution of wealth.   He also kept talking about food and starvation.   Jeez, is the situation in US that bad that you are so obsessed with starvation?   Are you personally hungry right now or do you just take starving people as an excuse to steal from rich people? 
No, I'm sorry but I do not share this very peculiar view of the world economy.There is a "disconnect in the system".  Precisely:  people who are starving are far, far away from people who throw food away.   Either they are physically far away, and thus it would cost a lot to ship the remaining of food you're talking about (not to mention how humiliating it would probably be to accept to eat that), or they are socially far away (they don't know who they are, and they don't know they are starving).  They are literally "disconnected", as you said.But if a guy sees a starving children in Africa on television, and a minute later he watches a documentary about LasVegas restaurant where they throw tons of food every week, he'll think "oh my god there is something wrong".What is wrong is that he sees two things that are logistically, economically, socially and politically completely different and yet he thinks that everything would be just fine if we could, magically, teleport instantly this food from US to Africa with zero cost. Then if it must happen, let it happen.  No need for your social plan.I've said it many times, but I'll say it again:   you can't prevent people to sell things they own.Say we embrace your silly idea of a planet we all share.   I'll go talk to my neighbor and I'll offer him a big amount of money for his share of the planet.  He'll accept and he'll use the money to have some good times, to party all night and to travel around the world during a year.   I'll use the extra-portion of the planet to make more money in the long term.  With the extra money I'll earn, I'll buy more shares of the planet from other neighbors.Capitalism is not just a political doctrine:  it's a truth about human nature.  Some people like to own stuff, some other like to consume.   Some people value wealth more when it's in the present, and others value it more when it's bigger, even in a far future.   Therefore savers buy means of production from consumers.   Means of production allow to buy more means of production.  And the spread between those who own stuff and those who don't increases.That's why your idea about people "sharing the planet" is naïve.  Try to understand this:  ownership is not a static concept.  It's dynamic.  And this dynamic is what we call the free market. Yeah but what's your plan exactly to provide the means for people to have the comfortable and meaningful life you're talking about?  Does it consist on stealing the work and savings of those people who only care about profit and personal wealth?If so, then I guess greed is not so bad after all, since it allows you to create the wealth you plan to steal. Still, it would be great if we could compile your library with a classic "./configure && make"I'm not good enough a GNU programmer, but if someone here is, please help.Meanwhile, I'll read the automake manual and I'll see what I can do.Anyway your project really seem like an awesome step towards a GNU version of bitcoin (C language + GNU license).  Please keep up. I'm pretty sure that when someone spend years in the darkness of a room, working on a computer, at some point it has to have some negative impact on his physical appearance. Maybe we should all believe in many gods in the same time because two of the most brillant civilizations, the greeks and the romans, were polytheist.  I guess we should all adorate Zeus and Jupiter.This is so stupid.I mean,  imagine I ask: "What did polytheism ever do for us?"  And then I start talking about mathematics, architecture, roads, medecine, atoms, Archimede, Pythagore, Platon and so on.Everybody would laugh at me.   What on earth does this has to do with religion??Each time a scientist makes a discovery, do we have to ask him in which God he believes in (if he ever believe in such fantasy), and make a count of scores?  Isn't that totally childish?Yes, the arabs made a lot of great discoveries and they preserved and transmitted the antique knowledge that we had lost in Europe.   They just happened to believe in Allah and his prophet during this time.   Big deal.PS.  The arabs did not invent the astrolab.  A very interesting Youtube series about the interdependence of ideas:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmwwjikTHxw Ok.  My bad.   I did not know about this concept.  I guess it's kind of a recent technique and openssl being quite an old library, it might not fit well into it. That's quite ironic for someone who just wrote:I mean, for a good programmer, learning how to reuse existing code seems to me at least as important as learning new languages.Lots of people link their code to the openssl libraries.  They might be complaining about the process being painful, but in the end they eventually do it.  They don't say:  "nah screw this, it's just too difficult". I'm surprised by this.  I mean, openssl might be hard to use and to link, but what's the alternative exactly?  Reinventing the wheel each time you do some code with cryptography? Damn.  Just noticed this thread is forked.  What the heck I'll cross-post:To compile your libraries on my 32-bits, debian GNU/linux host, I had to change line 94 of BUILD.py (why not use a makefile, btw?):Code:cflags += " -m64"into:Code:cflags += " -m32"Also, in src/structures/CBBigInt/CBBigInt.c, line 43:Code: for (u_int8_t x = a.length - 1;; x--) { into:Code: for (uint8_t x = a.length - 1;; x--) { Then all compilation seems fine, but linking failed:LINKING ./build/bin/libcbitcoin.sogcc: error: unrecognized command line option -flat_namespaceso I just removed this option.  I hope it's ok.I want to try to make an interface to this in Perl6, using the NativeCall module.  If I succeed, it would be really cool.

Religions do not necessary have a function per se.  They exist just because they can, as all living species do.You guys should consider listening to Daniel Dennet's view on the subject.  He sees religion as a natural phenomenon of memetic nature which takes its roots in superstition but has evolved in a very sophisticated, domestic form.«- Evolutionary theory of religion?  Oh yes:  every human group that's every been studied has religion so it must be doing us some good.  So what is it for?   What do you think religion is for?  It must be for something if every society has them, right?- Yeah...  And every society that has ever been studied also has the common cold.  What's that for?» Corrompu ça veut dire qu'il y a au moins un bit dans le fichier qui a été altéré.  Ca n'interdit pas à 99.99% du reste du fichier d'être encore valable.Ce que tu veux c'est la clef privée associée à l'adresse bitcoin souhaitée.  Tu ouvres un éditeur hexadécimal, tu te plonges dans la documentation de BerkeleyDB, tu y consacres quelques heures, et normalement tu peux retrouver la clef "à la main".   Bon courage, quand même. I'm not sure anybody cares. Waouh.  Drôlement bien pensé ça.  Surtout l'idée du lien qui permet à n'importe qui de contribuer à vous faire de la pub.Allez hop, je mets ça en signature  Yes.Yes.Not exactly the sum of changes, but otherwise yes that's the overall difficulty.If the action for block n and molecule M_i is A(n, M_i), then the difficulty D_{n,i} is D_{n,i} = ln( A(n-1, M_i)/A(n, M_i) )And the global difficulty D_n is the sum for all i.Well, the permutation is defined by the hash, and you use it to search paths so that D_{n,i} is decreasing with i.Yes it can.  The miner just has to work very little on the molecules "to the left" and harder with molecules "to the right".  He can just set his requirements to match those of the previously computed path in the list.The hash defines a permutation of the molecules.  For the block to be valid, this permutation must match the one defined by the decreasing difficulty order.  
I told you, you can make a correspondence between hashes (there are 2^160 of them) and permutations of 1, 2, ..., 58 (there are 58! of them).  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Numbering_permutationsFor a molecule, the performed difficulty is the logarithm of the ratio between previous action and new action.You make a list of given molecules in their decreasing performed difficulty order.  It has to correspond to the corresponding hash value (given correspondence mentioned above). I would encode the hash using a list of molecules.Given a list of molecules, and assuming there is a standard way of serializing their chemical formula in a unique, unambiguous manner, this list has a unique basic order A, B, C, D, ...If this list is at least 58 long, then it is possible to encode any number from 0 to 2^160 using a permutation of A, B, C, ..., for instance F, G, T, Z, A, C....  This is due to the fact that 58! > 2^160.So the miner must find solutions in a decreasing difficulty order.  This means that he must first work on F, then he must find a better solution for G, then an even better solution for T, and so on.Then a block is not considered valid unless its hash encodes into a permutation of the molecules in their decreasing difficulty order.The way the miners would solve the problem does not matter much.  It's a bit like some people with bitcoin found better technical solution to compute hashes, either software or hardware. Today I've learnt that tribler has finally been packaged into the main debian repo (at least on sid):http://packages.debian.org/sid/triblerI'm going to try that right now!   That's a nice summary.  It will certainly be useful for me if I want to prove that my proposal works.  Thanks.I've proposed something for condition 1:  encoding the hash of the block with a permutation of at least 58 molecules.  The actions would be searched in a decreasing difficulty order.As for 3, I'm pretty sure we can scale the chances of success as much as we want.  We just need to increase the number of challenges. I don't see why it wouldn't.  In the scheme I propose, we would use many molecules.  Actually, miners could incorporate new folding challenges in each new block.  There are certainly lots and lots of molecules scientists would be interested in knowing how they fold.And even if there are not enough molecules, I wouldn't be surprised if there were many other physical problems that require a brute force method to solve their least action formulation. I'm considering using a relative progress in the progression of the action as a measure of difficulty.difficulty = - ln(A_new/A_previous)Historical data about difficulty progression should, at least in a statistical sense, give some predictability.Well, this is not much different from SHA-256, is it?  I mean, I could know some stuff you don't know about SHA digests and then this "pre-knowledge" would save me some CPU.Edit.  Even if it was possible to know the solution of a protein folding problem (I doubt it is:  you can know the geometrical structure of a folded molecule by crystallographic methods I guess, but you won't know the folding process), that wouldn't be a problem, unless you're ready to do that all the time for all molecules.  You would just trade CPU against the real life time and efforts you'd put in your experiments.  To me, this would be fair enough.It can rely on higher information, as long as nobody has such information.  If nobody has it, it's just as if it didn't exist.  And nobody can magically solve the problem of folding molecules without doing brute force attempts, just as nobody can find an arbitrary small digest without brute force attempts.  I'm just not convinced by your argument, as I don't see any fundamental difference between digests and folding molecules. I don't think Turk denied the very existence of bitcoins.  He just doesn't like the idea of them not being physical.   Still it's funny debate.  Can be annoying or interesting, depending on whether or not you're in the mood for metaphysical stuff.Bitcoins are amounts whose transfer requires the knowledge of private keys.   Private keys are numbers.  Knowledge of numbers is information.So, is information something tangible?On one hand, yes it is.  Because it always requires a medium for storage.  And that medium must be physical.   Even if it's in your head, it's somewhere in your brain, encoded with some of your neurons.On the other hand, no it's not.  Information can travel through space vacuum via EM waves, a.k.a. light.  And light is a non-material substance:   you just can't hold it in any way.  It's the best example of non-tangible substance we can imagine.The real question is:  should we care if information is tangible?  Does it matter if bitcoins can not be hold in hands?  I don't think so. A USB key is something tangible, right?  I can put my wallet in it, can't I?  If I also erase the copy of my wallet on my PC, then this USB key becomes the only thing in the whole universe that can allow me to get my bitcoins back, right?So to me, bitcoins ARE tangible.And what is so magic about holding something in your hands, anyway? Problem is that Turk could have a defensive reaction towards such a definition of tangibiity.Gold is tangible in the sense you've just described.  But gold in GoldMoney's vaults is not. Well, that would be a weird idea, since your wage comes precisely from taxation  () You have a lack of imagination. We do.  One way is to evade taxes.  And to affirm clearly that taxation is theft. Do you really think that the State prevents monopolies?Also, if the only purpose of taxation is to prevent monopolies, why do I have to pay taxes??  I do not have any monopole on anything whatsoever. Besides, there is nothing wrong in having power, per se.   If people are free, that means that they can have power.  If a company is large enough and offers such a good service that people goes only to this company, a "monopole" appears, but it was deserved.  It was honnestly gained.   Think Google or Apple as examples.Of course, this comes with some power in negotiations.  This power is just an acknowledgment of the weight of the actor in the market.  No big deal, really.A guy who sells 10000 a day is more respected in the market than a guy who sells 10.  Is that really so unfair?? In any case, there is no such thing as a social convention on this topic.  Social conventions, as mentioned on the article on agumentum ad populum are about rather trivial things such as etiquette and polite manners.  Taxation has nothing to do with polite manners.  That was my point.Because socialist societies are a model of justice, maybe?  You're either naïve or oversimplifying. I hope you realize this is a very subjective interpretation.  You could make the same reasoning with abortion, death penalty or anything.  I'll get a godwin point if I say it, but German people at some point in history considered it was "proper" and "safe" to ostracize jews.To you it's "proper" and "safe" to redistribute income.  To me it is just theft.  And theft has nothing to do with hygiene (or whatever you mean by "proper") or safety.A social convention is NOT what the majority thinks.  The "Argumentum ad populum" article does not define it this way.  You need much more than the majority.  Otherwise polemic topics such as abortion could be considered as social conventions, which they are obviously not.If you say that an idea is true because a majority of people think it is true, you do not say it is true because it is a social convention, you just say it is true because a majority of people think it is true.  That's all.  And this is precisely a Argumentum ad populum. The section on social convention is about what is polite or proper.  The given example is about russian people kissing each other.  I read nothing about income redistribution.You say it's a social convention.  It is obviously not as consensual as you suggest.  This very debate proves it. Read what myrkul is writing.  He's talking about how absurd it would be to pay the rent for OTHER tenants. +1There are very few financial assets whose value has little chance to fade away with time.  Precious metals, real estate, shareholdings of multinational companies are some.Then you have currencies.   I would not bet much on the value of the dollar or the euro.  Hoarding a large amount of fiat currency on long term would just be stupid, imho.   Bitcoin will beat them, hands down.  Well, it is indeed.So let us find out how much they cost!  Just let the market handle those extra services.  Then we'll know their real price.  Why should those services be financed via taxation, anyway?? Guys, slavery has very little to do with the amount of work you're being ripped of, when you are.  Theft is theft.  Slavery is slavery.  Don't mix up everything.A slave is someone who belongs to another human being.  That's it, that's all, and that's totally off-topic in this thread.
I can tell you there are at least two whales in the sky. Well, today I've learnt something about Antarctica.  Were you to remove ice, it would actually be an archipelago, not a single mass continent: Check out this video:Is Diablo III Turning Virtual Economies Into Real Ones?I really like the vsauce team. They are very smart guys and I was quite surprised they did not mention bitcoin in this video.If you have a youtube account, consider adding some comments mentioning bitcoin! I think so as well. I'll try to make a more accurate description here.Everything would work as in bitcoin, except the proof of work part.  ECDSA, bitcoin addresses, transaction mechanism and all:  it's all working in the same way.A block header would have the same fields, apart from nNonce and nBits.  We'll use two other fields:  hashWorkBench and difficulty.  I'll describe them later.- version- hashPrev- hashMerkleRoot- nTime- nNonce hashWorkBench- nBits difficultyThe hash of the block is a double SHA-256 of this header, just as in bitcoin.  But it doesn't have to begin with zeros anymore, so it does not contain any "work".  The work and its proof are somewhere else, in some additional data that has to be given along with the block in order for the block to be considered valid.  I'll try to describe what the work consists on, now.  I'll be generic so that it can actually be applied to anything, not just molecules.The work consists in finding paths of least action for Lagrangians.  Any Lagrangian will do.  They are submitted by miners and as the block chain increases, nodes maintain a database of known, already studied Lagrangians and paths.A Lagrangian is nothing but a mathematical function of a set of parameters.  It returns a real value.   A path is an ordered set of such parameters.   The action is the integral of the lagrangian along a path.We'll assume that there is a unique, unambiguous way to serialize the mathematical expression of Lagrangians and paths into bit strings.A miner can work on any Lagrangian he wants.  Even one that has never been studied before in the block chain.  That's how new Lagrangians are introduced in the system. So a miner must tell other nodes what lagrangian he's working on, and on which paths.  That's called his workbench.  Say he works on four Lagrangians A, B, C, D.  (In fact, he'll need much more lagrangians than that, but that's a showcase).  We need an unamigous way to serialize those four lagrangians, since B, D, A, C for instance would be the same set.So he first serializes those mathematical expression (according to the serialization hypothesis, he can) into four bit strings a b c d, and then he sorts those bit strings.  He then serializes the list and that gives him a long bit string.  He does the exact same thing for the paths he found.  That gives him an other bit string.  Well, actually he can not use the full paths.  He can only use the extremities of the paths.  The full paths must be disclosed somewhere else.  It's a tricky part to explain.  I'll explain it later.He concatenates the lagrangians bit string with the path bit string, computes the double SHA-256 of this, and that is the hashWorkBench.  It's a index to the workbench database (EDIT:  see note 1), which consists of records of the form (lagrangian)+(path extremities).The difficulty is evaluated by comparison with the previous known results.  If a Lagrangian has never been used before, or if the extremities of the associated path were never used either, it does not contribute to the difficulty.Otherwise, we use the relative decrease of the action.(Action(previousBestPath) - Action(newPath)) / Action(previousBestPath) =(   (integral of Lagrangian on previousBestPath)     -   (integral of Lagrangian on newPath))  /   (integral of Lagrangian on previousBestPath)That is only for one lagrangian.  The total for the set of lagrangian is the sum of these values.Now, the tricky part.  We have to make it impossible for an other node to just use this work and make it available for an other block, i.e. with an other hashMerkleRoot, or an other block hash.  Somehow, we need this work to be linked to the hash of the block.To do so, the miner will work on those lagrangians with a preference order.  He will work a lot on some of them, and much less on others.   Sorting the resulting difficulties will give a permutation of the workbench.  This permutation will have to be associated to the hash of the block.The hash of the block is a large integer inferior to 2^256.2^256 is a large number, but it is inferior to 58!This means that we can encode any number up to 2^256 with a permutation of 58 workbench entries.So a miner just has to chose 58 couples of lagrangians/path extremities, and work on them so that the difficulties are in decreasing order when using the permutation corresponding to the hash of the block.  In the example of four Lagrangian A B C D, say the permutation corresponding to the number 13 is:C A D BThen the miner works first on C, then he works on A until he finds a better work (achieving a better difficulty) than what was found for C, and so on until he reaches B.The full paths he computed can not be published with the workbench, because the workbench was needed to compute the hash of the Block, which was needed to compute the full paths.  So to avoid circularity we can only publish the extremities of the path in the workbench.So in addition to the transaction database, i.e. the block chain, there would be two additional databases:- a workbench database, which contains lagrangians and path extremities.  This would be linked to the block chain database via the hashWorkBench external key ;- a full path database, which contains full paths giving least known actions for workbench entries ;Note 1:  I've made a mitake here.  There is an intermediate database.  Because what I call a workbench here is not made of just one lagrangian, but a series of some. Symbols and beliefs do exist in their own way.Superman does exist, in the sense that we all know about him:  it's a character that has an accurate, known representation in comics, cinema and all.On the opposite, there is, for instance, no such thing as a bitcoin super-heros.  I mean: a super-heros whose super-power consists in being able to magically solve a block for any difficulty in an instant.  This super heros would be called "bitcoinman", and he would look like a typical superheros:  he would have a cape and tight pants (black and yellow, for anarcapism), a mask and a big bitcoin sign shield on his chest.Well, now that I've just imagined him, he does exist.  But just before that, he did not. Honestly, does shouting in the street with a megaphone really is part of freedom of speech?? I meant that it's the only thing that can.  If it actually can't, then nothing can.You just have to get the wealth from somewhere.  You can't create it out of thin air.  If there is not enough wealth in dividends to allow everyone to live happy doing nothing, then I don't see where exactly you plan on getting the wealth to implement your system. No, I didn't mean that.  I mean that if a guy can earn his life on his own already, he doesn't need your help or your money to afford the things you're talking about.  That's what I meant.  A man who is not poor does not need the basic income you're promoting.But maybe I had your proposal confused with an other in my country.  You want to give this money to everyone, including people who actually already have a job and no financial difficulties, don't you? Computing the action is very fast for a given path.  That's one reason why I think it's a good candidate to be used instead of a digest algorithm.Basically, the action uses a function called the Lagrangian, which is easy to compute with a certain set of parameters.But the action is the integral of the Lagrangian along a certain path of parameters, and we want the path that gives the least action.  So the only way is to compute the action for all possible paths, and there are really a lot of them.But for a given path, and a given Lagrangian, the action is very quick and easy to compute.It's really, just like in bitcoin, a brute force computation, and the result with least value is the winner. Edit:  Oops.  Sorry, I'm not sure I answered your question, actually.I did read your question again.  The method I propose here is not much different from the standard, current method used in BOINC (I don't think so anyway).  If there is a loss, I think it would be compensated by the fact that miners would get rewarded for their work.  folding@home is already much less powerful than bitcoin, and that's kind of a shame, imho. Jeez...  For someone who does not take starvation as a primary driving force to advocate your system, you sure talk about it a lot.But fine, I think I get your point.  Basically it is just an example of how we can make exceptions to capitalism, because of moral considerations, altruism and all.   We care about each other, that's why we might accept to give to a stranger with not much in return.  Cute.But once again, your system is for EVERYONE.  Including the guy who hates capitalism, who earns his life correctly, and who would never ever spend a penny in order to buy a share.  It doesn't seem to me that I should feel much pity to him.  And yet, you want me to give him some of my capital.If you give this guy a basic, additional income, this money will come from the "excess of production" as you called it earlier, which otherwise would have gone to people who did actually buy a share:  capitalists people like me.So you steal capital from people who did a financial effort to acquire this capital, and you give it to people who:- were not interested in acquiring this capital ;- do not need it ;- have nothing but contempt for the capitalist system ;To me, there is something deeply wrong in this scheme. Even if there is a good reason for state welfare (hell saving lives is a good thing, I can agree with that), this is NOT what your proposal is about, as I've mentioned above.I want your reaction on the paradox I've pointed out:  you claim your proposal is for poor, starving people and yet you want to give the same amount of money to everyone, including people who don't need it.    Doesn't make much sense.Really it almost seems that you're exploiting poverty for your profit. I don't quite understand your question.  Please rephrase. Then convince people to buy robots, a.k.a. capital.   Let the market work, the yield of capital will raise, so that having very little capital will be more and more interesting.The transition to a society where all work comes from non-human capital, if it happens, will be smooth.   So you must let price mechanisms and market adjust to it.  Not an arbitrary system decided by bureaucrats.If people don't want to buy capital, not even a single share that only costs a few dollars, I don't want to hear them complaining about how poor they are and how I should give them some shares that I did buy.   And please do not tell me they don't have any money to spend for these stuff.  Unless they are completely destitute, they do.I've just realized something about what you write.  You keep talking about starving people, and yet this whole proposal is about some kind of a universal basic income.  I mean it's for everyone, not just for homeless people, isnt it?  You don't live in a country where homeless, starving people are at majority, do you?Therefore, mentioning starving people to promote a basic income sounds pretty sketchy.  I'm sorry to tell you that, but it can very well be understood this way:« We should take to the rich in order to give to starving people.  And I want my cut. »Starvation really sounds like an excuse to get a free share of the cake. That's why I will NOT answer your questions about starving people.  We all have moral issues when we walk in the street and encounter a destitute human being.  Assuming you are not completely poor, you do have too.  You could give a homeless person half of your income to save him.  I guess you do not and I do not ask you why.   So please don't ask me why I don't like the idea of giving away to strangers a capital that I worked to earn. There is no magic.If someone has really no economic value whatsoever, which by itself is quite a harsh hypothesis but that was your hypothesis, then indeed I see no way for him to earn his life other than owning some capital or relying on charity.To me it's beyond moral.  I'd totally understand if someone tries to steal because he's desperate or something.  But I also totally understand the person who will defend his property. Miln40 is not.He just explained above that he won't buy shares because it would not allow him to live without working.  So to him it is everything or nothing.When someone enters the stock market, he usually does NOT intend to become filthy rich by doing so.  Most of the time it just gives some nice complement to other incomes. So you're basically talking about food stamps.  Like in war time.  I don't know what to answer.   It's just too odd for me.Yes.  A life in which you can live happily doing nothing all day is not a possibility for everyone.  Does that really surprise you?I don't know.  I guess you think he should just steal it.  Or ask the government to steal it for him. «- Mr Smith!  Good afternoon!  I'm so glad you could come visit me.  Please sit down and tell me:  how did it go?- Well, it went fine.  I went to the town hall, I signed a few papers, they took a DNA sample, my fingerprints and a photograph.  Did not take long, and when it was finished I was kind of happy.   That's great, I'm now assured that I will receive 100 bucks every month, no matter what happens.  This new basic income law is really wonderful.  I can't wait to receive my first payment: it will help for our project of holidays with the kids in a few weeks.- Mr Smith, what if I told you that you do not have to wait?  That you can go on holidays with your kids right now, and with an even better budget that what you were planning?- What do you mean?- How old are you Mr Smith?- 54, why?- Let me check my computer...  Ok, what if I told you that you can leave this room with precisely 23,134 new bucks on your account?- Twenty thousand bucks?  You're kidding?- Not at all.  That's several years of basic income.  And you won't even have to pay us anything, since we'll just transfer automatically the amount every month.  You'll have nothing to worry about, just enjoy your holidays with your kids.  You'll be able to do this several years without spending a penny.- Yes, but when it run out, I won't receive anything more.- Well, you do have a job, and it gives you your real income, right?  I'll help you with that:  we'll make some investments and soon enough you'll receive pretty much as much money as if you were still entitled to basic income.  Plus, when your 23,134 bucks do run out, statistically, you'll be dead.   You know Mr Smith, we live in a great time, but humans are still mortals.    I am too and actually statistically I should die before you do.  So you see I don't tell you this to scare you or anything  - Well, I guess this makes sense.  And twenty thousand bucks is a nice amount of money.- Isn't it?  So let's do that, shall we?  Here is the document.  Please sign here.- Ok.  Done.  When is it that we'll talk about those investments to replace my basic income?- We'll have plenty of time to do that.  Right now my schedule is quite busy.  You see, we now have a lot of cash entries coming from the state.  Next month for instance, we'll receive your first payment and we'll use it with others to buy other basic income from other people.  Mathematically, it's complicated, but it works.  Just do not worry and enjoy your holidays with your kids.  It will be the first of a long series, and the State pays it all!- That's great indeed.  Thanks so much.  I'm so glad I have such a good banking adviser.» Lots of new features and all.  That's great.  Thanks guys.... BUT ...The important september announcement is not that there is a troyan horse in the binary, allowing a secret retrieval of all private keys in order to reboot the block chain, is it?I mean, everybody's so quick into jumping in every new version.  Am I the only one worrying a bit about that? I'm not sure it is worth spending time reading this.Can someone confirm that it is just stupid? That was not my point.  If your system is like today, then people will be able to sell their BIS.  They would basically endebt for life.  They would not care much since it's the State that would repay this debt.  I'm pretty sure bankers will be very happy with your system.Yeah, great.  Vote like majority, obey or get the fuck out.  Wonderful.Well, you could have spent those 50 EUR to buy a share and you would have received about 1 EUR a year by doing nothing.  That would have been much more of a actual step towards your project of basic income.It very much depend on your lifestyle.  Also, I do not only live on dividends.  I have other financial assets.  That's not the issue anyway.Thing is, the way I see it, share and stock markets are the only thing that could fulfill the function you are promoting.  It is basically designed for that:  allowing people to share the excess of wealth produced by companies.  The only feature that does not fit your concept, is that shares and stocks are not evenly distributed.  So most people can not live on dividends because they just do not own enough shares.  And yet, globally if the wealth is somewhere, it is there.So what's the way to make this distribution more even?  Do you have to steal to people who have some, in order to give to people who do not have any?   It won't work:  you're a living proof of that.  If you don't have shares, it's not because you can't, it's because you don't want to.  You prefer giving money to political organizations.Instead of using force and stealing people to give shares to people who do not even want to own shares, you should promote the idea of owning shares.  Eventually, if more people get convinced that it's ok to invest and receive money from doing nothing, the distribution of shares will be more even.
I think it will always be possible to sell your BIS, even if it's not supported by the state.  I can always sign a contract saying "from now on I swear I'll give all my BIR to XXXX".   It's basically a eternal debt contract, but your proposal makes this idea not so ridiculous."Worthwhile" is very relative.  It all depends on your time preference regarding consumption.Some people might prefer having 100 BIR right now rather than waiting 100 months.  So they might accept to sell their BIS against 100 BIR.More generally, some people might be more "carpe diem" oriented, so they'll just sell their BIS to people who think they'll live two hundred years (I'm exaggerating).Private contracts do exist.  And even if courts decided not to defend them, reality would, as screwed people would get angry and would use violence.Ok, that's one thing.  But can I be exempted from tax then?You can buy stocks with no more than a few dollars.  That's a start.  Maybe the OP has spent much more in contributions to the pirate party.  Which to me is ironic.Money makes more money indeed, but your system does not change that.  People could buy BIS, and with the money they get from these BIS, they'd buy even more BIS.I do not trade.  I receive only dividends indeed.Some guy indeed at some point had a company grow.  He made it florish and he produced some wealth.  I now own the shares he used to own.   So according to you he's a good guy and I'm a parasit, right?Well, consider this:  I did not steal those shares from this guy.  I bought them.  So in a sense, I rewarded him for the good work he's been doing.  Without people like me, his job would have had much more difficulty to find a correct price in the market.  I hope you can understand that.Are you going to tell me that receiving money from doing nothing is fine as long as you don't pay to do that, but if you do it without stealing anyone, by investing wisely, it becomes morally wrong? I think the problem is that the verb "exist" has a long history of being used with a physical meaning.  It is obviously confusing in information technology.Isn't there any word to make this distinction clearer? Not only they exist, but you can actually verify they do.I mean, the bitcoin database is public and every single transaction is stored on every user's computer.Someone sends you a bitcoin, and your computer verifies that this bitcoin exists by looking at the transactions it points to, all the way back to when it was created by a miner.There is nothing of the sort with any other currency.So yeah, they do exist.  Not in the physical sense but hey, does an email exist in the physical sense?  Does this forum message exit in the physical sense??  Why would electronic money scare anyone more than any other electronic stuff they use on internet? I'd like to go back to my question about whether or not people could buy or sell this thing.Let's call Basic Income Share (BIS) one entry in the database.  It's basically the name of one person, some bitcoin address or something, along with some proof that this person does exist and a way to identify him (with biometrics).Let's give a different name to the amount one person actually receives each month.  Let's call it BIR (Basic Income Right).Ok so one person "owns" a BIS and that allows him to receive one BIR each month.Question:  do I have the right to sell my BIS?I mean, can we allow people to give an order such as:  "I'm the owner of BIS n°XXXXX.  Here is cryptographic proof of this assertion.  From now on, all my BIR will go to the owner of BIS n°YYYYY"  ?I don't see why it should not be allowed.  If people have the right to own things, they should have the right to give them away (and in particular, to sell them).   Plus, if you forbid this, a black market will probably emerge.So assuming I do have the right to sell my BIS, I also have the right to buy some.  In effect, it is just as if the State was turned into an anonymous society (not sure of the english term.  Corporation maybe).Some people would have a lot of BIS, some people would have very few.   So we'll be very far away from your initial project.Your system would look like capitalism, but it would be much worse.  Because this "big state" would be a giant company whose income does not come from free trade, but taxation.   This should be a nightmare to everyone.  I wish I could just answer you "well, I don't want to be part of this system", but I guess I can't, can I?I mean, let's assume your basic income system is based on some consumption tax.Can I be exempted from this tax if I decide not to be included in the national database and not to receive your basic income? That's not what I meant when I talked about cattle.  This biometrics thing makes me think of cattle tagging.That's what I meant.  Maybe it's irrational, but yeah, the whole idea stinks. That's a big "if".  An even worse is "if not".If your 2% taxation is NOT enough to fund basic income, what will happen?  People will complain and ask for more.  So it will be 3%.So basically since your "big state" can raise this level as high as it wants, it will always make sure that the rate is high enough to finance your basic income, even if it does not make economic sense.  In other words, even if it will crash the economy.  That does very much look like an elaborate, quantified version of communism.Basic income is implemented in the current system with shares and stock market.  Why don't you guys just buy shares?  You would get some part of the excess of production you are talking about.But no, you want your share of the cake, without putting any fucking effort about it, not even spending a penny.  Seriously, this is despicable. Don't you find this idea a bit repulsing?   Can't you see it basically consist in treating humans as cattle? Thanks.  However, it's technically difficult and I'm not even sure it is possible.  I think it is, but until someone actually implements it, nobody really knows. I'm sorry I can't answer your questions.  It's just too personal.   What I can tell you is that I think I'd probably not be aware of bitcoin right now, had I been keeping on doing that job.  Sometimes I happy I did quit, just because of that.  I'm not sure you get my point.  Right now I don't do much but at least I don't cost society anything.  Were your proposal to be implemented, I wonder how many people would immediately quit their job and start leaving on other people's work and money. That's a funny question, since I did actually quit my job four years ago.Once I gathered enough money so I would not need to work in the next ten years, I just stopped working.So I can actually answer your question without any "if".In a sense, I'm a living proof that this basic income is not a good idea.You should not underestimate people's laziness. Ok, ok...   Group behavior then?  You mean that I would accept to work for others mainly because that's what people around me do? Oh... you meant "charity".It's ok.  I'm fine with working for other people and buying them stuff, as long as I don't have to. No fork.  A brand new chain used as a secondary, alternate cryptocurrency. My proposal consists in doing both:  securing the block chain while folding molecules. And it's also a pity.Might be an opportunity for me to advert for my proposal about folding molecules instead of computing sha-256:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=108888.0 Well, to motivate someone you can give him a reward.  It doesn't have to be money.  It's basically anything that has value.  The thing is, in a highly interpenetrated economy, money is the most efficient way to transfer value, so it did indeed become the simplest way to reward a human being.   But as you say it only has been turned as such.To me, more important is that it's a way to measure value in a decentralized way.  If I exchange a commodity against money and I notice that suddenly I need more money to get a certain amount of this commodity, then, because I know the global amount of money in existence is globally stable, it has to mean that somehow the availability of the commodity has decreased.  The price of the commodity is therefore a measure of its availability.  This price signal is an economic information that I can use to induce some changes in my economic behavior. The scale of energy production is probably the same as the scale of energy demand.   All civilizations on the Kardashev scale probably have the same energy issues.  Otherwise they would not develop such elaborated devices to extract energy.To determine price, what matters is the ratio between offer/demand, not the absolute value of the offer.Edit.  I just realize this contradicts what I wrote earlier.   Oh well.Please explain what you mean by "peer pressure". That may create a fork indeed.  A consensus would be required.But the idea of allowing the code to behave differently depending on the height of the block was mentioned by Satoshi himself on this forum, iirc. No.  It is really much more complicated than that.Money is really not just some tool invented to motivate people.  This basic income concept is not just some moral issue.To answer your question, I do want people to be driven by their desire to build amazing stuff.  I just don't think a basic income is a way to realize that.  In a nutshell, I think it would just not work and that the corresponding currency would quickly get no value whatsoever.
As mentioned earlier in this thread, the protocol would necessarily have to proceed blocks differently, depending on the height of the block in the block chain. Jeez, this discussion is silly but what the heck.Time is not an unlimited resource.   At all.  Especially if you travel interstellar space at relativistic speed.  Your proper time will tell you that you've spent a year, but the solar system you left may have seen centuries pass away.Cosmologists now think the future of the universe will be a deep freeze.   So if you spend too much time gathering stuff in the universe, you'll end up in an almost empty, deadly cold universe. Speed of light is limited.  So even in a infinite universe, you'll have to wait a bit to get the desired amount of the thing you want if you have to fetch it by yourself.  So people might have to buy some to their neighbors if they don't want to wait.Also, heavy elements in the universe are pretty scarce. Well, you can just build a clone with an artificial uterus or something     If you want to push the science-fiction hypothesis to the extreme, you have to consider a world where robots can be indistinguishable from humans.And there is nothing, at least theoretically, preventing AI to perform as well as a human in art, culture, music and all. Ok, that's a valid point. True.  Indeed I forgot about that. Oh yeah, I think I get it.  A group of one, then a group of two, then a group of three...   So you can indeed store an infinite number of reals.    That's pretty smart.  Thanks.  I've learnt something today. Ah I'm getting confused.   This subject is really tough, honestly.   No irony here.On one hand I told you that there is no point to start now, since robot do not currently do all the work.On the other hand I'm going to tell you that it's already started.  Robot do indeed do a lot of work, and some people do receive money doing nothing thanks to that.  I do.  I own shares and I get money by doing nothing.  So the system you are advocating has already begun.The key point, imho, is whether or not robots create not just wealth, but also copies of themselves as well.  In that case, everybody can own robots, and there is no point having a system of shares that would be unevenly distributed.  But then again in that case price of things would really be almost zero.  Because everybody could create whatever he needs when he needs it. So there would be no point in buying something.  Hence a price of zero for everything.Honestly I'm not sure anyone here gets how complicated this is. Yes.  But I notice that you are using all your memory to encode just one number.  Well ok, why not.I'm not sure it is obvious that this is a consequence.  Seems interesting though. I don't have your tool to include maths.  I'll use N to represent the integer set, and R for the real set.What I would agree on, is that:2^N = R^n,  where n is any finite integer.Because you can basically use the hospital paradox to alternate location for each real.   The i-th real will have its bits on position numbers that are equal to i modulo n.   So that's fine.But I very much doubt you can go to the limit and write:2^N = R^N On paper, yes.Thing is:  I very much doubt this basic income would really replace the current welfare.  First they say it will, but soon they'll add exceptions.  For instance, disabled people will receive a special treatment.  Then, pregnant women, and so on and on.  Soon you'll have basic income +  current welfare system.Of course there is no way to prove that this is what would happen, but it is so easy to guess. Well, indeed  you can have people on the right who have the same communication strategies (gathering and making some noise) than people on the left.Having stupid ways to deal with divergence of opinions is not clearly politically defined.  I admit that. Yeah, that's the spirit.   PS.   Well, maybe I should think more about why I find hippies so annoying that I can even enjoy watching them beaten up.   It's not clear, but it's probably related to the way they deal with divergence of opinion.  When hippies have an opinion about something, let's say "X is a bad thing", then they think the best strategy to defend this opinion is to gather in large numbers, walk in the street with signs, shout « X IS A BAD THING!! X IS A BAD THING!!»  as loud as possible, and do this continuously until "something" happens.They kind of hope that people, just because they have been forced to hear the sentence "X is a bad thing", will eventually be convinced.  So they continue shouting for ever in hope for this event.  Of course most of the time, what actually happens is that people call the police in order to get rid of what is nothing but a nuisance. Honnestly, I do.  I do not mean that I think it's ok to beat them up, but I just can't help feeling some pleasure when it happens.It's not possible to control your emotions, is it? An other problem with this video is that a lot of bitcoiners may have a huge contempt for hippies or other left-wing protesters, so they might actually enjoy watching them beaten up by police. Well, we'll disagree on something, for once.Here's a french proverb:  « Le pire n'est jamais sûr. »It's hard to translate in english but I think it comes from an inversion of Murphy's law, and it says:« The worst case scenario is never certain. »Excess of pessimism is not healthy, you know. This is silly.  Even in such a society where robots can produce all wealth, a basic income would make no sense since everything would be basically free.Also, if you think such a basic income would make sense in such a society (and it wouldn't), why would you like to create one in the current society, where robots do obviously not produce all wealth??I wrote in an other thread that even in a post-scarcity, robot driven economy, a basic income would not solve anything because people would buy and sell their "income right".I was wrong.Now that I think about it, a post-scarcity economy is possible if and only if robots are capable of producing themselves, so that robots can own to everyone.  Post-scarcity economy must also mean that there is no scarcity of whatever provides post-scarcity, i.e. robots.  A bit like what we are starting to see with 3D-printers.But when this happens, price of everything will drop like a rock and your idea of a basic income is just futile. Do you genuinely think it would be fun to watch? Receiving money doing nothing??  Sure, what's not to like?    Actually I've been doing it for some time now.  I use something amazing:  it's called "shares" or "stocks".  Basically it's a part of a company and when you have some, you can get a portion of the profit of the company, even if you don't actually work in this company.  Ain't that cool?  Go buy some and join the club! Yeah.  True.   But if you mention that, it's hard not to look like a smart ass, isn't it?
Technically?  Yes.  Any computer can deal with a wide, arbitrary range of numerical values.Easily?  Almost certainly not.  I'm not in the dev team, but if you look at the code you'll see that the "amount" field is coded with a fixed size integer, not a BigNum or something.  So I guess if we'd really have to divide bitcoins to more than 10^8, a lot of code rewrite would be required.Also, consider that it would probably require some clear conditional test on the code somewhere:Code:if (blocknumber < BLOCK_NUMBER_AT_DIVISIBILITY_CHANGE) {   // do as normal   ;} else {   // use the new algorithm for increased divisibility   ;} True.If there really is a need for more monetary signs, they will appear as secondary currencies.  And the market will give them their appropriate price.Just like silver and copper coins were used during the gold standard. I'm not sure I proposed this one already.An atom is something that can not be broken apart (well, at least in the etymological sense).  Most atom names end in "-um"  (germanium, silicium, lithium, ...).So what about "Satoshium" or "Bitcoinium" ? Watched it already many times several years ago.  I kind of grew up since. Some people would think it's a diversion of maternal instinct.   That can make a woman chose to live with a man only because she thinks this man needs her.  That abandoning him would be too cruel and on.  And yet the woman can feel some pleasure, only because she'll have the feeling she's kind of useful.  That her life is not meaningless.Of course, if the man has any pride, it is repulsing. So tell me.  After reading this wired article, is there someone here who considers actually buying Legos and Raspberry pis to build a giant lego bitcoin miner wall?That would be so cool... Just red this piece of crap.  What a troll.« And yet, these very same designers of BitCoin are part of the segment of society that creates new utility value. Engineers dream up things that never existed before and bring them into the world. There are reasons why the money supply needs to be something that can enlarge. Creation of new value, new products, new capabilities that never existed before is one of them.  When new value appears it must be accounted for somehow. »Duh...yeah...  with prices!   Jeez.Wealth is created, prices fall.  So we know wealth has been created and we can even measure it with falling prices.  That's what money is about: measuring the value of things.   In a world with X apples, the price of an apple is twice the price as in a world with 2*X apples.   And in a world where there is more wealth, things look cheaper.  Because people are richer, because there is more wealth.  What's so hard to get, seriously? So that was you...   Wanna Build a Supercomputer? Youll Need Legos and Raspberry Pis I'm a bitcoiner and I have very little doubt that some exchange do indeed some FRS.Why ?  Just because they can.If you have a customer that has been giving you 100BTC so that you just hold them, and if you haven't heard of this guy for months, it's really difficult to resist the temptation of using at least a fraction of this money to do some business for your profit.   If the guy claims his money, but you have only 90BTC on his account because you used 10 BTC for something (a loan or whatever), hell you just have to take 10BTC from an other sleeping account.It's that easy, and nobody has to know.That's why when I send money to an exchange, I always presume that they will use it for some stuff, without explicitly telling me.No.  Just be cautious and do not put too much money in the same time in an exchange. I'm not responsible for other people's ignorance.  Whatever are the reasons why they are happy with the system, those reasons are not my concern.  I'm not in their head, and I'm not sure I understand the system better than they do, anyway.  Maybe YOU are the one who is wrong.There really is no point launching a croisade against a this monetary system since you are not forced to hold fiat money.   Just buy precious metals, bitcoins or whatever. Forcing people to ask for a same price for a same service IS planned economy.  It's called price control.  And it brings nothing good.  Do you think a bureaucrat is better suited than the market to determine what is the appropriate price for a given service? Damn it you make me feel guilty about not having given anything already.  I'll add half a bitcoin. You know what would be cool?   Some kind of a bitcoin standard test-bench, with predefined addresses, keys, transactions and so on, that all clients in all languages could use as a reference for testing. I'm quite amazed by how fast you've been coding this.  Congrats.Do you support IRC bootstrapping in the test network ?  I've searched occurrences of "irc" in your code and I've found nothing relevant. I'm not a US citizen, but from what I know of american people, not all of them support gun ownership and therefore not all of them actually have weapons at home or know how to use it.  My guess is that burglars think the risk is acceptable.I very much doubt a burglar is motivated by hunger.  Otherwise when someone robs a grocery store, he would go after the food, not the cashier. Ces derniers temps on dirait qu'il y a beaucoup de nouveaux qui sont dirigés vers bitcoin-central.  Peut-être qu'ils sont un peu débordés (je crois savoir qu'il y a encore une grosse part de traitement manuel des données).Cela dit je ne fais pas partie de leur équipe et je n'ai pas utilisé le site depuis un bail.  Demande à davout pour plus d'info, je crois qu'il bosse toujours autour. Well, he has been robbed at the beginning of the process.If I burn your house and see that ten years later you bought a new, prettier house, are you going to tell me that you have no hard feelings against me?Well, what is it, then?  Because the way I see it, even in your SF world where robots do all the work and produce all the wealth, this wealth will have to be shared.  And even if you initially give everyone an equal number of shares, at some point people will start buying and selling them, so that eventually you'll end up with a world being like a big corporation whose shares will be pretty much as unevenly distributed as any company nowadays is. Here we go with this again.  Reminds me of the thread about venus project and Zeitgest movement.Let me explain you that what you describe is not much different than the current way capitalism works.  A robot is a mean of production, just as is a share of a company/firm/factory (I don't know exactlly how you call that in english).  And those means of production have to belong to someone.From the point of view of the owner (i.e. the capitalist), it does not matter much if the worker is made of flesh or steel.  What matters is that it behaves as such:  it accepts to work, to give away its production and to receive a predetermined money amount in exchange.  The robot does not demand much wage, basically it only requires maintenance costs which is equivalent.  But otherwise, to the capitalist the robot and the human are not much different.  One is just much cheaper than the other.So the situation you describe is just a fancy, science-fiction way to describe what currently exists already.  I do own shares of companies and most of my income come from that.  I don't care much about what kind of workers work in these companies.  Hell, I guess there is a fair amount of robots already.Now, I guess you're going to tell me that we should give shares of companies to everyone, on an equal basis.  Ok so that means first that you have to steal mine.  Ok I'll try to ignore that and do as if it was moral.  Now, everybody has the same amount of shares.  Great.  I'll go see someone and I'll tell him:  « dude, you have 10 shares of company X and they give you 1 bitcoin a year.  I'll give you 10 bitcoins now if you give me those shares. »  The guy does accept because he thinks it would be cool to have 10 bitcoins now, and not to have to wait ten years.  So he gives me his shares and go buy some now legalized drugs with the money.  I, on the contrary, will keep on underconsumming or working harder in order to keep saving capital.Eventually, people who tend to work and save will tend to have much more shares than people who tend to consume and be lazy.  And you'll end up with a situation which will be no different than the current one, except that you would haved passed through a phase where you expropriated people (remember the part when you to steal my shares to give them to everyone?).Is that your plan? Ok, so according to you in the particular case which is discussed in this thread, the old man should just have let the burglar help himself and get away (I don't see any other alternative if you don't want to kill nor imprison anymore).Yes, there might be something wrong in the american society (I don't know, I'm european).  But until society is fixed, people should have the right to protect themselves from the consequences of this wrong society.  Don't you think?I doubt people who favors gun ownership think this would improve society.  They just think it can help prevent people from undergoing the fact of living in a wrong society.  This is quite different. Tu peux générer une adresse et communiquer cette adresse pour recevoir tes bitcoins.  En attendant que tes blocs soient téléchargés, tu peux vérifier que tes  bitcoins ont bien été reçus en consultant un analyseur de chaîne en ligne comme blockexplorer.Garde bien à l'esprit que tu ne pourras utiliser tes bitcoins pour payer quelqu'un que lorsque le bloc dans lequel se trouve la transaction correspondante aura été téléchargé et relié au reste de la chaîne.Bitcoin-central est le site le plus connu pour les français.  MtGox est plus international et a plus de volume mais les démarches pour l'inscription sont très lourdes (photocopie de carte d'identité, de justificatif de domicile et tout...).Si tu veux acheter en vis-à-vis et que tu es à l'aise avec IRC et GnuPG, tu peux utiliser bitcoin-otc.
 Justin Bieber is a bitcoin developper !!     If one of your 20 addresses has been hacked for some reason, the others probably are too.  IMHO.  Better use a key that has never been used and only you know it even exists.  It might be encrypted and hidden in a picture somewhere using steganography, for instance. Code:#!/bin/bash# send all your money to a previously generated bitcoin address# whose private key is stored and hidden somewhere on the net # or printed on paper somewhere.bitcoind sendtoaddress WRITEYOURPANICADDRESSHERE  "$(bitcoind getbalance)"# clean up your tracks:# remove this script from your disk# so that you'll have plausible deniability.# You'll say that you just happen to have sent all your bitcoins to someone.wipe $0 || rm -f $0     BTW guys, for those who do not know this, menopause is quite a unique feature of our species.   There's a whole evolutionary theory about it, called the Grandmother hypothesis http://phys.org/news/2012-09-upconverting-nanoparticle-inks-invisible-qr.html« An invisible quick response (QR) code has been created by researchers in an attempt to increase security on printed documents and reduce the possibility of counterfeiting, a problem which costs governments and private industries billions of pounds each year. »« According to the researchers, the QR code will add an increased level of security over existing counterfeiting methods as the complexity of the production process makes it very difficult to replicate. »They really don't get it, do they?I mean, it seems that the only solution they can find against counterfeiting consists in making the fabrication process more and more difficult, and hope that counterfeiters will not have enough technical skills.Yet the truth seems quite simple to me:   if a government can do it, or can pay technicians to do it, then anyone, with enough time and money can do it as well, with just a bit of reverse engineering and motivation. So basically this guy is more of a supporter of bitcoin than Ron Paul is.  It's a bit surprising. I've just had an idea about how to insert information, thus avoiding the whole tournament scheme and switching back to a more bitcoin-like process.Let's say we have 40 molecules that we want to fold.   We can code information using the permutations of these molecules.  There are 40! permutations, which is about 2^160.  That's about enough to encode a bitcoin address (as it is precisely a RMD-160).So, a miner must compute minimal values for each molecule, in a decreasing order, assuming there is a way to compare minima for different molecules (maybe with a ratio energy/molecular mass or something).  The overall sum of all values is used to compare the work of different miners.By doing so, a miner can publish his result as soon as he finds them, pretty much as in with bitcoins.  I'm pretty sure this information can not be used by other miners to forge their own result.  Yet it's not obvious and should be studied more seriously.  I like the idea, though.PS.  Mapping permutations is not an easy task but it seems to be well known in maths.  Also, we don't have to use a finite set of molecules.  As long as a molecule has a unique, unambiguous way to write its chemical composition, we'll be fine:  we just hash this expression and sort the resulting numbers.  Then the miner just has to encode its bitcoin address using a permutation of this list of molecules. Yeah that's what I thought:  it really depends of the picture and the make up.  On this one it's easy to suspect she had a lifting.Still, so far she looks well for her age, indeed. She looks great for her age but she is also well dressed and seems to have a lot of make up.  Show her in a more casual set up. It is often objected that the current computing task performed by miners is a waste of CPU.  Though many good answers have been given against this idea, the most basic is still that we just don't know any other way of electing nodes in an anonymous, decentralized and verifiable way.  Sure, it would be great if the mining process could have a usefull side effect.  But so far we just don't know any way to do that.I've been thinking about it and here is a rough idea:  using the least action principle to solve physical problems.  As you may know, finding the correct folding process for long molecules is a very tough problem to solve with a computer.  It is so tough that it often requires the use of a large number of computers working together in a framework such as BOINC (see folding).   IIRC, this problem is solved using the least action principle (or the least configurational energy, I confess I don't know the details much, but you get the idea), which is the at the root of both classical and quantum mechanics.  Basically, all nodes try to find an geometrical structure of the molecule that minimizes a certain function.  They use more or less a brute force method:  they try plenty of structures until they find one that gives an action that is considered low enough.See the parallel with the proof of work system used in bitcoin?Now, of course replacing the cryptographic proof of work by a least action calculus would not be easy, because they are still some very crucial differences.In a cryptographic proof, you can put information in your work, so that nobody can "steal" your work.Let's call "PAYLOAD" the message you must work on (in bitcoin, that would be the Merkle root of the transactions).If you want people to have an incentive to work on this payload, they have to be allowed to add some way to identify themselves, so instead of computing a hash of the form:PAYLOAD:NONCEThey will compute a hash of the form:PAYLOAD:USER_ID:NONCEIn bitcoin the USER_ID is basically the equivalent of the coin_base transaction.With the least action, it is much more difficult to do something like that, because the action depends only on the sequence of amino acids and their geometrical structure.   The sequence is the equivalent of the payload, and the geometrical structure is the equivalent of the nonce.  There is no way to include any extra information.This means that as soon as someone publishes a particularly efficient folding, there is no way to prevent anyone to just quickly copy it and also publish it to the network pretending he found it himself.   Trying to use timing consideration would probably be useless, as the inevitable latency in the network makes it impossible to make sure of the exact time a message was introduced.  That's basically the main reason why the double spending problem existed and why bitcoin had to solve it.Isn't there a way to overcome this difficulty, though?  I believe there has to be.  It would work in the same way as sport events (I was inspired here by chess tournaments):  you need to find a way to force players to admit their defeat.##EDIT:  This scheme is probably not the best way to do this.  See next message for a better idea.##Here is the basic idea.First, we share a list of molecules that we want to work on.  Then we organize the "competition", pretty much as we would do for a sport event:- We register all players.  They are of course identified by a public key.   Decentralizing this step might not be easy, but I doubt it's impossible ;- "Round" begins:  players compute actions for each molecule.  They can focus on a particular molecule, or work on all of them.  Doesn't matter.  If they want to work on only one, they just pick one random geometric structure for all the others, but in the end they publish a result for each molecule ;- they don't publish clear text results:  they publish encrypted, signed results.  The encryption scheme has been chosen by the player and only him knows the key (which is either an assymetric key or a symetric key, in which case it is necessary a different one for each round ;- when a player receives the (encrypted) results of an other player, he must sign it and publish his signed version to the rest of the network ;- once a certain ratio of player has submitted their results, or once all players that have published their results agree that some time limit is over, the round is finished ;- at this moment, all results are available in their encrypted version, and they are all signed by all players who have published some results ;- Now all players publish their decryption key.  Everyone can see who has found the minimal action, and nobody can pretend he did it if he actually did not.- We can choose to assign a different crypto-currency for each molecule, or mesure the relative progress for each molecule and select the player who has reach the best progress for any molecule.  Does not matter much.- The winner has the right to publish a block of transactions for this crypto-currency, the first transaction being a creation transaction, just as in bitcoin.There are certainly lots of difficulties with this scheme.  One that I see is that in order to verify the block chain, one must know the whole history of all the tournaments that occured.  That can require a lot of disk space.  But hopefully with increasing disk capacities it should not be that big of a problem.Well, here it is.  I know it can look far fetched, but I believe the "bitcoin is a waste of CPU" argument is not a stupid one.  So I really wanted to imagine an alternative protocol that would solve this issue.  Or at least I tried.  Not sure I get the exact point of this thread, but it makes me think of this idea I red once, according to which the Internet itself is a MMORPG. Ok en effet, tu peux épingler ce fil (le titre actuel convient parfaitement) ou demander à un admin de le faire.On ajoutera des liens au fur et à mesure. Though I am a supporter of gun ownership and the right to defend one's home, I do also believe this story is a bit stretched indeed.  This guy was probably in his own right to self defense, but I do not like the way people say he's a hero or something.He should have shot a warning shot.  The japanese case mentionned above proves that honest mistakes can happen.Also, what's stopping us to think that the guy was kind of happy of the idea that a burgler entered his house, so that he could enjoyed the manhunt and the kill?  It's not as if the presence of a stranger in your house should give you a total license to kill.   I'm ok to give the guy the benefit of the doubt, considering his advanced age (he probably could not think as fast as a young man) and all...  But felicitations?  Honors?  I don't think so.  Though it's not a crime, it's not really a good example either, as it is not the wisest use of a gun, to say the least.«  Hum, I haven't recently heard of this old man who lives nearby.  Maybe I should check he's ok.  Oh, the door is loose.  "Mr xXXX??"  Damned, Why am I shouting his name?  I recall the old man doesn't hear anything.  I think I hear some footsteps in the stairs.  Oh, here he is!  Hello.... hang on, what does he hold in his han....  BANG!! » One of these days, I'll read this whole thread carefully.  I like the subject and I've been thinking a bit about it during recent years.Post-scarcity economy?  I'd be happy to see it.  What's not to like in the idea of not having to work for pretty much anything?   But why does it have to mean that money should be forbidden??If things must tend to become free, that just means that prices must tend to zero.  So in other words:  just let prices fell down!To do so we need a stable and incorruptible money supply, because it is needed to correctly measure the value of things, that is to say the relative and absolute abundance of things.   As the amount of available things increases, their price will drop, until it eventually reaches zero, in ten, an hundred, a thousand years... who knows.But making a decent monetary tool is not enough.  We also need to stop preventing people from producing.  Here in Europe, farmers can not produce cereals, milk and other basic products beyond quotas.  Believe it or not:  it is forbidden.   There is something similar regarding real estate.  For some strange reasons, it seems that everything is done to prevent entrepreneurs to build houses and residential high buildings.  As a result, there are not enough decent accommodation for everyone and people still have to struggle to pay their rent.  To me, this is much, much more outrageous than fractional reserve banking or other stuff that Zeitgeist is complaining about.To reach a post-scarcity economy, we have to allow people to produce, so that abundance can arise and thus lower the price of things.Trying to forbid the usage of money is just silly.  It is very much a communist idea and you'll end up with everything free indeed, but with empty shelves in grocery stores: The big difference is that it is much easier, and virtually costless, to withdraw your funds.  So FRB is much more armless with bitcoins because people can have most of their savings on their own PC.Also, there is very little you can do against that.  But I guess the proposed idea on this thread is meant exactly for this purpose:  putting some pressure on exchanges so they are extremely cautious in their fractional reserve rates, and ultimately they don't use FRB at all.So, the idea does actually make some sense.  My bad. It is not.The fact that not all customers withdraw their funds in the same time allows them to use statistics in order to increase their ability to repay their debts towards their clients.  There is nothing wrong in a clever use of statistics, clients know what is happening and they pretty much always get their fund back in time, which is the only thing that was promised.  So no, this is not a theft in any way. Oops.  I totally missed that.   Sorry.PS.  Well, the idea is more or less the same, anyway. What do you have against fractional reserve, anyway??   Banks do not lie to you.  On your balance sheet it is written "credit" and "debit", not "deposit".  So the bank does not make any mystery of the fact the money you "own", is actually some money the bank owes you.  If you don't believe in its ability to repay you on time, fine, just get your money back right now.  I don't get why you should wait for other people to do the same thing in the same time.  If you do that, then yes indeed the bank might not be able to pay you.  Bravo:  you'd be creating the very thing you were advocating against.  What for exactly?  To prove your point?Why do you want to destroy a system that hundreds of millions people are happy with (or at least, do not complain), when you can just step away from it peacefully?
This kind of blows my mind.I mean ok but... with such a point of view, was there any point in history when there was anything but a worldwide anarcho-capitalism?  Does this very concept mean anything in that sense?  Ben, il y a bien bitcoin.fr, le wiki francophone, le blog de boussac, et sûrement plein d'autres.Chaque lien devrait te donner d'autres liens externes, donc tu as en fait un peu l'embarras du choix.Je ne pense pas qu'on puisse dire qu'il exite un site francophone de référence, dans la mesure où les francophones sont assez discrets dans le développement du client principal. This really is a silly idea.  For plenty of reasons.Do you know Eric Cantona?  The soccer player?He made exactly the same call in december 2010.   When you start to have the same political ideas as a soccer player, it can't be good, can it?In a nutshell, if you don't like the fractional reserve system, fine, just drawback all your money, buy precious metals or bitcoins, do not ever borrow money from a bank, and that's about it.Why do people always refuse to do anything unless millions of people do as them?  This is just a silly group behavior. A CGI: OK...We stop now. At some point I did regret having created this thread, but now that I think of it, it does help to talk about it and try to withstand watching these things.I did find the name of the plant I was talking about, for instance.  It was in the youtube video above.  It's actually the lotus fruit pod:It's still a bit difficult to look at it, but it's getting easier. No, swiss cheese is fine.  Please do not make such experiments, though.  You'll get as many examples as you want when googling trypophobia. Well, good for you.  I can tell you the first time I realized I can't watch this kind of things, was with a picture of a particular plant.  There was no human skin involved, just the particular shape of this plant was made of a bunch of wholes.  I don't know what plant it is, I don't wanna know, and don't ask me to find one on the internet.  Just thinking about it gives me the creep.  It's a really a weird and surprisingly powerful phobia. Well, to tell the truth they are helping the blackmailer just as well. I'm not even sure we can ever be sure of it, unless Romney publicly admits having paid, or the ransom is not paid and the tax return forms are released.If it's hoax, it is perfectly possible that the author actually owns more than 1M$ in bitcoins.  Then, he could publish a bitcoin address and make a transaction to himself, pretending it was from Romney.  Couldn't he? I knew for a long time that I can't withstand watching this kind of pictures, but it's only recently that I learned the name of this phobia.  Apparently, not everyone is concerned.  Are you?Again:  BE ADVISED:  watching these pictures can really be disturbing, especially if you were not aware that you just can't watch them. Yeah.  Good point.Yet one might argue that financial privacy should not apply to politicians,  otherwise corruption would be too easy.  2012-09-06,  forbes:  Blackmail and a briefcase of bitcoinshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=106219.0 Some quite bold statements from John Matonis about the Mitt Romney's blackmailing case.« But, is blackmail really an illegitimate act? [...]Professor Walter Block of Loyola University New Orleans reflects on the old axiom that the truth shall make you free and says that a blackmailer is simply setting the truth free to do whatever good or bad it is capable of doing. »http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/09/06/blackmail-and-a-briefcase-of-bitcoin/ Salut et bienvenue,Bah maintenant les sources d'informations sont tellement nombreuses qu'il n'est plus si intéressant de savoir comment les gens apprennent l'existence de bitcoins.   Les nouveaux sont donc dispensés de nous raconter ça, dorénavant  Euh... non, ça parait pas normal.  Mais il peut y avoir des tas de raisons pour ça.  Je doute fort que ça soit limité au forum bitcoin, en tout cas. Shouldn't all press articles reporting the same event be listed in the same thread or something?  It's kind of annoying to receive a different notification for each of them. « Nearly a quarter million dollars worth of the peer-to-peer currency was stolen by accessing unencrypted backup wallet keys. »Someone has put online an unencrypted backup of his 25kBTC wallet??Well, if that is not an epic fail, I don't know what is. I'm pretty sure it's not a problem with the flash storage device, but rather with the USB connection which just can't transmit data fast enough.  I guess the problem would be the same with any kind of USB external disk drive. That's great, but it's very hard not to suspect a politician to accept bitcoins only because it would be soooo easy to hide some of the donations.At some point if politicians start to accept bitcoins, they would have to make an official declaration about their receiving bitcoin addresses and electoral authorities would invite the public to consult this list before making any donation.  If a politician were to request donations on his website with a different bitcoin address, this would be considered as fraud.
Ok.  Good to know.    But if you use a memory based fs, you need quite a lot of RAM, right?  I only have 1Go so I guess that won't do. I totally disagree with you guys:  BB definitely rocks.Walt's character does absolutely make sense:  he goes from being a humble science teacher who endorses crime only because of his fear of cancer, to being a narcissistic mastermind who wants to build a drug empire just to prove himself that he can achieve what he failed to do earlier in his life in the legit science business.  Walt's not addicted to meth, but he's addicted to adrenalyn and power.  Just remember the "stay out of my territory" scene long ago when he decided to cook again on the parking of a hardware store, and you'll realize this aspect of Walt's personnality was clear right from the start.http://youtu.be/pLMF7p8hO7ASure, the series had some lows (some of them being due to budget issues), but so far it's been fantastically awesome and this last season is just one of the best of the five. Yeah...  It was late and I wrote that because I was kind of bored.  Now I realize it was not very pertinent.  Sorry. Ok according to the wikipedia definition, the short answer would be no.  Because bitcoin is just not complex enough:  it was designed by one person and it now works exactly as it was designed for.  It is not complexity emerging from multiple and simple interactions.But let's give this idea a second chance, based on this:  no one can stop bitcoin.  Satoshi can't.  Gavin can't.  Justin Bieber can't.  Even Chuck Norris can't.I believe this is not a trivial statement.  Bitcoin is an unstoppable machine.   It takes its root in human greed:  miners want the block reward and hoarders want to become filthy rich in a thousand years.  Human greed is not something you can get rid of easily so yeah, imho bitcoin is here to stay.This count number is the start of something that will stick to humanity for a while:  an unstoppable clock used to synchronize economic transactions worldwide.And as it is something that is beyond the will of any single human being, I believe it is in some way something we can consider "autonomous" and somehow, emergent.  Assuming you're talking about quickmeme.com, yes I could not get the image either.  I made an other one on imgur:  https://i.imgur.com/yKGsY.jpg Ok, sorry again.  I edited the post. Yeah, it's a bit of a spoiler indeed.  Sorry.  But many things happen in the last three episodes.  This picture does not spoil too much. WARNING:  Breaking bad SPOILER No.  'Fair' doesn't really mean 'Random'.   'Fair' means that there is no hidden mechanism implying lying about the past.Say you want to play rock, paper scissors (RPS) with a machine.  You can not just chose R, P or S and wait for the machine to tell you if you have lost or won.  A fair way of doing this would require that the machine shows you a hash of a salted R, P or S world.   Then you chose R P or S and the machine shows you its initial salted phrase which was beginning by R P or S.  Therefore you know that the machine did not lie.A machine could very well not be random and still be fair.  If for some psychological reason people tend to  chose rock as a first bet, the machine can very well be programmed to have a tendency to play Paper as its first bet.   It would still be fair as long as the machine does not change its mind when it notices that the player actually played scissors. In the same way, it is very well known that people really suck at picking up random choices.  So the machine could try to detect a pattern in the player's choices.  And still, it will be fair as long as the machine doesn't lie on what it picked before the player actually bet.Actually, it is much better to play against a machine that is not truly random, because it is predictable.  So people can carefully study how the machine behaves and try to deduce its algorithm.  So, fairness has very little to do with randomness, imho.I hope this all makes sense to you, but I confess it's tough to explain.  It's probably easier with an example:Human:  Let's play Rock, Paper, Scissors, shall we?Machine:  Sure, let me think of a random number... Machine:  Ok I got one.  The sha-256 of the string I'm thinking about is: 50a32f4b3864165afb1d52f709191e7eaf98c9dfca572b9406a9110759b24aa3Human:   Ok....  PAPER!Machine:  You win.  My initial string was:  "ROCK 59496.1637704731" There is no such thing as 'provable randomness'.  But you can collect data and do statistics to check that the distribution is even. I suspect people who are smart enough to understand this kind of things just don't play casino games. There is really no point playing once you know for sure that your expected win is actually a net loss. Je répondais tout à l'heure au message d'un nouveau qui demandait des explications sur bitcoin.  Et comme souvent, j'ai utilisé la fameuse analogie du ticket de loterie pour simplifier la description du système de preuve de calcul et de rétribution des mineurs.Je voudrais justifier un peu l'usage de cette analogie, car j'imagine que les détracteurs de bitcoins y trouvent beaucoup à redire.Le truc qui me parait important de signaler, c'est que c'est une loterie où les participants n'ont pas tous les même chances de gagner.  C'est donc, pourrait-on dire, injuste.  Pourtant non.  La plupart des loteries fonctionnent comme ça.Quand je joue au loto, j'ai le droit d'acheter autant de billets que je veux.  Et mes chances de gagner seront d'autant plus grandes que j'achète beaucoup de billets.  Certes, en pratique les chances de gains au loto sont tellement faibles que ça ne rend jamais ma chance de gagner probable.  Et mon espérance mathématique de gain est toujours la même, implacablement négative.  N'empêche que si j'achète deux fois plus de billets que mon voisin, mes chances de gagner, fussent-elles infinitésimales, n'en sont pas moins double.Le fait que l'espérance de gain soit négative pour le loto y change-t-il quelque chose??   Et bien, n'étant pas mineur je ne suis pas sûr que l'espérance de gain pour bitcoin soit réellement positive.  Il y a le coût de l'électricité, l'investissement dans le matériel, etc.   Pas évident.  Et puis même, je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit le problème.Ce qui importe je crois c'est que dès lors qu'un système d'élection basé sur le hasard est anonyme, il y a nécessairement une disparité dans les chances de gains.  Quelques soient les démarches nécessaires pour participer à l' "élection", ces démarches peuvent être répétées par tout participant pour augmenter ses chances.  Ces démarches nécessitent nécessairement de l'énergie, de l'argent, quelque chose en tout cas d'extensif.  Pour une loterie, c'est le prix d'un billet.  Pour bitcoin, c'est le CPU.Si on tenait vraiment à faire en sorte que chacun ait la même chance d'obtenir des bitcoins, je ne vois pas d'autres moyens que de rompre l'anonymat du système, et donc d'intégrer un système d'identification qui serait drôlement difficile à décentraliser.  Il faudrait nécessairement un truc qui jouerait le rôle d'un bureau de recensement, avec éventuellement un marquage physique des gens.  Comme dans certains pays où lors des votes on marque un doigt à l'encre indélébile je crois.  D'ailleurs la problématique du vote est exactement la même:  soit on rend le vote anonyme en marquant les gens, soit on le rend nominatif (le bulletin est secret mais le nom de l'électeur est bel et bien écrit sur un registre électoral) en utilisant un bureau central de recensement.  Deux solutions pour obtenir un même but: que personne ne puisse voter deux fois.Quelque part il me semble qu'il y a trois ou quatre aspects qui ne peuvent pas tous être réunis à la fois:  l'anonymat, la décentralisation, l'égalité des chances et peut-être un autre qui m'échappe un peu et qui aurait rapport au marquage physique des gens.  Comme je l'ai déjà dit il y a longtemps j'ai l'impression qu'il y a presque un théorème mathématique qui reste à écrire sur le sujet.  Un de ces quat' faudra que je m'y pense sérieusement.  Il n'y a pas de représentation "concrète" de bitcoin.  C'est une monnaie électronique donc ça n'est jamais autre chose qu'un montant sur un compte.Ce qui permet de connaître le nombre de bitcoin, ce n'est pas à proprement parler un fichier, mais plutôt une base de donnée.  La différence avec les autres systèmes de paiement, c'est que cette base de données est décentralisée:  tout le monde en possède une copie et quelqu'un est désigné au hasard toutes les dix minutes pour la modifier.Je ne sais pas trop ce que tu entends par "porte monnaie bitcoin".  Il y a plusieurs moyens d'effectuer des transactions, la plus sûre est d'utiliser le client offciel écrit en C++, la plus commode est d'utiliser un service web ou un site d'échange qui fera la transaction à ta place.  Un compromis entre les deux est un client léger comme Electrum. Interesting point.  Of course he is.  "Attention whore" is pretty much an aphorism to describe his job.And to some extend, aren't we all attention whores, anyway?  Ok I get it now (hopefully).  A Tesla museum, right?  Ok, why not, but...  does it really make sense to spend a lot of money such a physical place, nowadays??The Wikipedia page about Tesla used to be a good article, but is not anymore.  You guys should work on this first.  It would be much cheaper and would have probablly much more impact on Tesla's notoriety. Oops.  I did read it quickly, maybe I missed something.  I'll read again. I'm amazed by the amount of enthusiasm in such a weird idea.   I don't know much about Tesla, but from times to times I indeed hear a bit about this Tesla-mania on internet.  Sounds very irrational to me.We know a great deal more about electromagnetism now that we know during Tesla's life time.  Moreover, we now have computers to make simulations, so we don't need to build expensive and hazardous machines for experimentation.  I doubt there is anything we could learn from Tesla nowadays.Please guys, go back to earth and be serious. If Bernanke ever publicly pronounces the world "bitcoin", I'd like to know.  It would be kind of an historic moment. Same for Obama.  But it's not so sure he'll be reelected anyway, so it does not matter much. 2012-08-29, americanbanker.com:  « Stop sending me bitcoins, please. »https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=104476.0

I've recently tried to install my OS (debian sid) on a USB key (ext4 formatted).   As this key has not much storage room, I thought of using a second removable media (SD card or USB) where to put the bitcoin database.Problem:  it never actually work well enough.  At first, everything's fine:  the database and the index get filled, but eventually everything is stuck and no more block is added in the block chain.  And I get a Warning in the client saying:WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!  You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade.I look in the debug.log and to me it doesn't seem like a connection problem.  I get a repetitive pattern of messages like:askfor tx 5fce383170099b52a632   0sending getdata: tx 5fce383170099b52a632askfor tx 5fce383170099b52a632   1346243977000000ERROR: FetchInputs() : 5fce383170 mempool Tx prev not found 04e6a51ecbERROR: CTxMemPool::accept() : FetchInputs failed 5fce383170stored orphan tx 5fce383170 (mapsz 10001)mapOrphan overflow, removed 1 txMy guess is that with low bitrate media, things screw up at some point.  When I use my internal, non-SSD hard drive,  everything works fine and I can update the database up to the latest block.I used ext4 for my USB key and I suspect that it would work better with vfat but then I could not use symbolic links to point to my wallet.Has anyone succeeded in using a usb key to store the bitcoin database ?  If so, which format ? Did you know this site?http://www.whatdoestheinternetthink.net/bitcoinPositive:     79%Negative:   14%Neutral:        7% Just found this awesome youtube channel and I've found it so cool I could not help myself talk to you about it:http://www.youtube.com/user/vsauce?feature=watchIn a nutshell, it's a regular report about science, technology, art and cool stuff on internet. mostawesomestthingever.comI should hang out on internet more, instead of always visiting the same websites  Aujourdhui en faisant mes courses à Carrefour je passe devant le stand des cartes cadeaux et j'hésite encore une fois à en acheter une ou deux pour les revendre contre des bitcoins.Sauf erreur, certaines de ces cartes sont valables dans tous les rayons, y compris donc dans l'alimentaire.  Cela peut donc être une méthode à explorer pour changer ses bitcoins en euros pour faire ses courses.Mais avant de me lancer dans un tel business, je préfère lire vos opinions. Looks good, but it might be difficult to iconify.  I suggest replacing the round bitcoin mini-pictures by fat colored U+0243 symbols. Bitcoin c'est des sous comme ceux que ton papa il te donne pour acheter des bonbons, sauf que c'est pas vraiment la même chose.  Ton papa il te donne des "euros".  Par exemple pour acheter un carambar, tu dois donner un demi euro au marchand, parce que la plupart des marchands de bonbons n'acceptent que les euros.  Ils n'accepteraient pas d'autres monnaies qu'on trouve dans d'autres pays, et ils n'accepteraient pas les bitcoins.Le problème avec les euros c'est qu'on a aucun moyen de savoir combien exactement il y en a en tout.  Donc tu peux pas savoir si il n'y a pas quelque part des gens qui profitent de leur position dans certaines grandes banques, pour se créer des tas d'euros et ainsi permettre à leurs enfants d'acheter énormément de carambars.  Alors le marchand de bonbons il vend tous ses carambars à ces enfants de banquiers qui s'en fichent du nombre d'euros qu'ils dépensent puisque de toute façons ils peuvent en avoir autant qu'ils veulent sans effort.  Alors du coup le marchand n'hésite pas à demander non plus un demi euro, mais un euro entier, deux euros etc.   Au final toi tu n'as plus assez d'euros pour acheter le moindre carambar.Bitcoin c'est des sous qui sont conçus pour éviter ça.  Grâce à l'informatique, on sait toujours exactement combien il y a de bitcoins en tout.  Pour avoir un bitcoin, il n'y a pas que deux moyens:- convaincre quelqu'un de t'en donner un (par exemple en lui donnant un carambar en échange);- faire tourner ton ordinateur pour participer à une sorte de loterie qui a lieu toutes les dix minutes.  Plus tu fais tourner ton ordinateur fort, plus tu as des chances de remporter le premier prix (qui est fixé à cinquante bitcoins pour l'instant);Une fois que tu as obtenu des bitcoins, pour acheter un carambar tu dois échanger une partie de tes bitcoins contre le montant nécessaire en euros à donner au marchand de bonbons.  Y'a plein de sites sur internet où tu peux faire ça.  Garde bien tes bitcoins au chaud car grâce au fait que le nombre de bitcoins n'augmente pas aussi vite que le nombre d'euros, le prix du carambar en bitcoins reste globalement fixe, voir diminue.  Avec des bitcoins tu as plus de chance de pouvoir continuer à acheter un carambar qu'avec des euros. Oui, ils sont perdus pour toujours.    D'où l'importance de faire des sauvegardes. Well, an attacker could attack a given bitcoin address just when it is spent.   He would just listen to non yet-validated transactions, and immediately produce a new, competing one for each of them.  Not all of them would be validated (it would be kind of random, my guess is a 50/50 chance), but some will definitely be.The only way to keep your bitcoins safe would be not to spend them.  Ever.   And what good is a bitcoin you can't spend?? Damn it.Well, the bright side is that bitcoin thus gives an other big incentive to develop quantum computing. If you drop the B it's tough to get the link with bitcoins. As I said electrum is an allow of silver and gold, so I thought about something like that:I'm not very good in image processing so I guess someone could make it look better, but you get the idea. Could Shor's algorithm be applied to crack ECDSA?  I'm not sure.Shor's algo is about factoring large prime integers.  In ECDSA there is an additional difficulty, as the algebra is not about integers but points of an elliptc curve.  Has anyone shown that solving the former permits solving the latter? Sauf erreur, personne n'a parlé d'emprunter quoi que ce soit à qui que ce soit dans ce fil.  Tu parles des réserves fractionnaires?  C'est dûr, très dûr d'empêcher les réserves fractionnaires dès lors qu'un établissement gère des comptes pour des clients.  C'est pas que les banques, encore une fois MtGox, bitcoin-central ou même Silk Road pourraient faire très exactement la même chose.  Bitcoin rend juste la chose peu plus difficile car il est très facile de rapatrier son argent (ça prend dix minutes contre plusieurs jours pour une banque), ce qui fait que les gens ont tendance à conserver eux même une grosse partie de leurs avoirs.J'ai besoin de services bancaires ne serait-ce que parce que l'essentiel de mes revenus provient de mon portefeuille d'actions.  Et pour l'instant il n'existe pas d'alternative suffisamment crédible aux banques pour la détention d'actions (faut que je garde un oeil sur GBLSE, cela dit).   Je n'ai pas de carte bancaire car je trouve que ça coûte trop cher.  Chez boursorama la carte est gratuite mais uniquement au dessus d'un seuil de détention sur le compte espèce.  Or je n'ai presque rien sur mon compte espèce, pour des raisons facile à comprendre.L'une des raisons qui m'empêcherait d'acquérir la carte bitinstant c'est le coût justement, assez élevé comme remarqué plus haut par caveden je crois.  1% par virement ça parait un peu trop à mon goût.  Mais si c'était moins, ou si le prix ne dépendait pas du nombre de virements mais était fixé à l'année par exemple, j'aurais beaucoup moins d'hésitations.Mais une fois ces considérations de prix mises à part, la CB bitinstant aurait un attrait énorme pour moi:  me permettre de changer instantanément une partie de mes économies de bitcoin vers euros afin de les dépenser aussitôt dans n'importe quel commerce.  Alors qu'une carte bancaire sur un compte normal ne me servirait pas à grand chose puisque je ne possède presque aucun euros.   Tu vois la différence?  Qu'est-ce tu entends pas "relié à" ?La banque ne ferait que tenir un compte des bitcoins qu'elle te doit, tout comme le font MtGox, bitcoin-central etc.  Mais au moment où la banque te restitue tes bitcoins, c'est bien le logiciel bitcoin, avec le même protocole qui n'a pas changé d'un pouce.  Elle ne peut pas te restituer de faux bitcoins puisque tu les reçois avec toujours le même logiciel, tu le verrais tout de suite si ils essayaient de te refourguer de  faux bitcoins.   Autrement dit la banque ne s'approprie absolument pas bitcoin, elle ne fait que l' utiliser.  Bitcoin ne serait alors pas plus lié au système bancaire qu'à, par exemple, Silk Road. C'est là que je ne te comprends pas.  Tu n'es manifestement pas opposé au fait de posséder une carte bancaire.  Or, en tant que membre de la communauté des utilisateurs de bitcoins, entre une CB "normale" et une CB dont l'organisme émetteur permet une conversion immédiate bitcoin->euros, laquelle est la meilleure?  Pour moi, y'a pas photo.Le processus que tu décris revient EXACTEMENT au même, sauf qu'il est beaucoup plus long puisqu'il faut au moins trois jours ouvrés ne serait-ce que pour transférer les euros obtenus du site d'échange vers ton compte bancaire.Si tu y réfléchis bien, tu vas comprendre que MtGox fait déjà quasiment le boulot d'une banque (en tout cas ils collectent des fonds et tiennent des comptes de ce qui est possédé par leurs clients, ce qui est la base du boulot d'une banque).  Pour moi le bitcoin offre surtout une alternative aux monnaies nationales, par vraiment aux banques.  A terme, on pourra se passer des banques, parce que les marchés des changes seront décentralisés et que la technologie des cartes bancaires sera ouverte.  Mais le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est qu'on y est pas encore.  On en est loin.Je n'ai pas de CB à l'heure actuelle, d'où mon intérêt pour ce projet justement.  Ma famille vit à l'autre bout du monde et parce que je n'ai pas de CB, c'est pas évident pour moi de bénéficier des tarifs d'avions au meilleur prix.  Pareil quand je dois louer une voiture, je ne peux pas fournir une empreinte de CB pour la caution (la dernière fois j'ai du emprunter celle de mon frère, c'est quand même pas terrible), etc.  Si j'avais une CB avec une compte libellé en bitcoins je pourrais faire tout ça en payant avec mes bitcoins, ce serait super.Qui peut le plus peut le moins.Avec bitcoin tu peux refaire ce qui existe déjà, mais tu n'y es pas tenu.  En ce cens tu ne peux plus parler de monopole.Le bitcoin c'est bien plus une question monétaire qu'une question bancaire.  Ton propos est tout à fait similaire à ce qu'on lisait parfois au tout début de bitcoin avec mybitcoin.com.   Ca a été longuement discuté et le consensus a vite été que non, ça ne trahit pas le projet initial.Sur le forum en 2010 et 2011 on passait beaucoup de temps à réinventer la roue comme tu dis, par exemple avec les contrats d'options, les marchés d'action (GBLSE) etc.  C'est normal:  bitcoin en tant que nouveau système monétaire est à la base d'un système financier qu'il faut nécessairement réinventer.Par exemple, quand davout a créé bitcoin central, sauf erreur il ne connaissait pas les principes de fonctionnement d'un carnet d'ordres.  Il a dû s'informer sur le sujet et redécouvrir ce qui est connu depuis fort longtemps sur les marchés financiers.Cette carte bancaire procède exactement du même phénomène:  refaire ce qui existe déjà mais sur de nouvelles bases, en l'occurrence une monnaie dont on connaît à chaque instant le détail de toutes les transactions effectuées dans le monde entier, et dont on est donc sûr que personne n'est capable de s'en procurer arbitrairement.  Pour moi c'est l'essentiel.  On ne dénature rien du tout.Le marchand est libre de vendre ses produits dans la monnaie de son choix.  Si t'es pas content, tu vas acheter ailleurs.  Et bonne chance si tu tiens à trouver un marchand qui accepte directement les bitcoins.Essaie de voir les choses ainsi: cette carte, ce n'est rien d'autre qu'un moyen ultra-rapide d'accéder au marché des changes et de rendre les fonds immédiatement disponibles pour un achat dans le système commercial actuel.  Moi je trouve ça très important:  c'est une sorte de couche de compatibilité, de pont entre bitcoin et le système monétaire actuel.  C'est crucial. 
ça ne fera jamais que la deuxième fois que je l'écris dans la journée mais bon:   http://bitcoin-otc.com Comment fais-tu tes courses à l'hypermarché du coin avec des bitcoins sur un smartphone ?  Je serais curieux de le savoir. Moi, j'ai un compte bancaire.  J'en ai même deux pour être exact.   Pourquoi?  Parce que les gens qui travaillent autour de moi utilisent l'euro, et ils n'acceptent pas toujours le cash.   Sans euro, je ne pourrais tout simplement pas manger.Oui, en théorie on n'a pas besoin des banques.  C'est à dire à condition que tout le monde réalise qu'on a pas besoin des banques.  Comme cette condition n'est pas satisfaite on a, de fait, encore besoin des banques.Ton point de vue est celui d'un utopiste.  J'essaie de rester pragmatique.Le bitcoin m'est utile parce qu'il me permet de garder mon argent en autre chose qu'une monnaie soumise au bon vouloir des banquiers et des politiques.  Mais quand je dois acheter quelque chose, en général ce sont bel et bien des euros qu'on me demande.  Je ne peux pas faire accepter mes bitcoins de force, donc je les échange contre des euros avec quelqu'un sur le marché des changes, et avec ces euros j'achète le truc que je voulais, et ce juste pendant le temps nécessaire pour acheter ce truc.   Et tout le monde est content.N'essaie pas de raisonner en disant "on n'a pas besoin des banques", parce que là tu te places dans une situation utopiste où tout le monde serait d'accord sur ce que doit être la monnaie.  Tout  le monde n'est pas d'accord, mais ça ne doit pas nous empêcher de faire des affaires ensemble.Et puis cette haine envers les banques est un peu idiote, je trouve.  Rendez à Caesar ce qui est à Caesar:  avant bitcoin le système bancaire était probablement le meilleur système monétaire qu'on pouvait imaginer.  Il a prouvé quand même plus ou moins son efficacité.  Il était tout au plus très mal régulé (trop selon moi), et surtout pourri par l'intervention des états.Avant bitcoin, qu'auriez vous proposé pour améliorer le système?  Je suis tout ouïe.   Si vous n'aviez rien d'autre que bitcoin à proposer, alors on ne peut pas en vouloir au banque de ne pas avoir utilisé bitcoin puisqu'il n'existait pas encore. Il y a une différence entre "centralisé" et "homogène".Un réseau peut très bien être décentralisé et hétérogène.  Par ailleurs l'important c'est vraiment que tu n'es pas obligé de mettre toutes tes économies sur le compte bitinstant.  En outre on peut espérer que ça pousse à la concurrence.  Il serait en effet regrettable que bitinstant soit la seule société à proposer un tel service, mais il n'y a aucune raison que ce soit le cas lontemps.Les marchands de nos jours veulent que tu les paies avec des euros, et ils apprécient que tu les paies avec une carte bancaire.  Au lieu d'essayer de les convaincre de tout changer, il faut s'adapter à leur souhait, parce qu'ils n'ont aucune raison d'accepter tes bitcoins.  Tu ne peux pas les y forcer.Une carte bancaire émise par une banque "bitcoin friendly" n'est même pas un mal nécessaire, c'est vraiment un outil indispensable pour rendre bitcoin plus utilisable pratiquement. Une image vaut mieux qu'un long discours:Si ce truc devait se réaliser, ça changerait énormément de choses.  Avec ses bitcoins, on pourrait acheter quasiment n'importe quoi.  Ce serait un énorme pas en avant pour le projet.Les détracteurs diront que bitcoin réinvente ainsi ce qui existe déjà et ils diront que ça prouve que bitcoin n'apporte rien de neuf au système.Il y a une énorme différence quand même.  Je ne serai pas obligé de mettre tous mes bitcoins sur mon compte bitinstant.  Ce serait même idiot de le faire.  Je peux n'y mettre qu'une petite somme, juste assez pour couvrir mes dépenses au jour le jour, et garder le gros de mes économies sur mon PC.  Et à tout moment je peux demander à bitinstant de me rendre mon argent, ce qui ne devrait prendre que dix minutes.Allez faire la même chose avec votre banque classique!Un projet comme celui-ci, j'espère le voir devenir réalité depuis au moins un an.   C'est marrant justement j'étais sur le point de demander une carte bancaire à ma banque ces derniers temps (à cause de mon déménagement ça va sûrement être bientôt nécessaire).  Je vais attendre encore un peu. That would be sooooo freakingly AWESOME!!!    The word "electrum" describes an allow of gold and silver.Then, why not start with the generic bitcoin logo, and give it a yellow-gray bicolor? What the hell??  It's also an obvious reference to the japanese cineast Miyazaki:I really wonder what genjix was thinking about, as this has no relation to bitcoin whatsoever.  I suspect it is a joke.  Le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est que c'était prévisible.  Compte tenu des problèmes qu'a connus MtGox, il eût été surprenant que bitcoin-central (si c'est bien d'eux dont il s'agit ici) passe entre les gouttes.Pour rappel, pour éviter ces soucis, il y a bitcoin-otc. Bon ce n'est pas "grand public", mais cette entrée de blog m'a beaucoup plu donc je me permets de la poster ici.  J'espère que ça vous va.http://sametmax.com/quest-ce-que-bitcoin/De bonnes formules, beaucoup d'aspects abordés, et une forme "FAQ" dont on pourra sûrement reprendre des trucs sur le wiki francophone. J'en doute fort, à moins que ce que tu achètes soit en fait un billet de loterie  Ce qui t'a peut-être embrouillé, c'est le fait que tu peux placer un ordre à n'importe quel prix.  Mais ça ne signifie pas pour autant qu'il sera exécuté.Si tu places un ordre d'achat de 10 kBTC pour 1, on dit que ton ordre a pour bid (c'est un terme anglais qui signifie "offre" ou "proposition") 0.0001 /BTC, ce qui est de plusieurs ordres de grandeurs inférieur au meilleur bid du carnet d'ordres.  Ton ordre n'aura donc que très peu de chances d'être exécuté.  En gros ça n'arrivera que si le cours du BTC chute très drastiquement jusqu'à atteindre ton bid.Tu donnes l'impression d'être nouveau dans ce genre de choses, donc pour plus d'info, informe-toi sur le fonctionnement des marchés financiers, sur le concept d'adjudication de carnet d'ordres, etc. Silly topic.   Locked. Je ne connais pas DarkComet mais un rapide coup d'oeil m'apprend que c'est un outil de contrôle à distance.  Je suppose que c'est pour les machines sous Windaube?  Parce que sous unix le contrôle à distance ça existe depuis l'antiquité.Sinon sur Wikipedia j'en ai trouvé un autre qui a un nom rigolo: back orifice.      Fallait ôser!Une chose est sûre:  utiliser un tel logiciel pour faire de l'intrusion et faire tourner bitcoind ne serait pas un mince exploit!     Those guys don't often speek about bitcoin, but when they do, it's pretty much about silk road selling drugs or about a heist of a bitcoin exchange.So obvious. I'd be curious to know how he "adopted" the bitcoin idea.  Is he a technical guy himself?  Did Stacy Herbert convince him about bitcoin? Je me demande ce que le législateur entend par "limité".  Si c'est pas chiffré à un endroit ou un autre, c'est très subjectif.  Une centaine d'utilisateurs ?  Un millier, un million ? From the recent Forbes article about Silk Road and bitcoin, the arxiv article:« Traveling the Silk Road: A measurement analysis of a large anonymous online marketplace »http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7139 This is great .  This market place is the best proof of concept one could imagine for bitcoin.Long live Silk Road!PS.  In the article I can read:« His findings: the sites number of sellers, who offer everything from cocaine to ecstasy, has jumped from around 300 in February to more than 550. »  The beautiful thing is that those 550 people most likely do not know each other.  This means they can do nothing to prevent one another to compete.  The only thing they can do is providing better products with lower prices.  In a physical market, such as a street drug dealing business, they'd probably fight each other to the death until the most vicious ones gets all the market.Isn't anonymous economics awesome? Ce matin sur France Info à 9h55 un reportage sur les monnaies alternatives.Une demi-douzaine de monnaies alternatives mentionnées, la plupart arrimées à l'euro (je me demande comment ils font d'ailleurs) et promues par les gouvernements si j'ai bien compris.Sur bitcoin, silence assourdissant. I'm ok to give a bitcoin away, but not for free.If people can get bitcoins for free, it won't help convincing them that it's money.
Before I know about bitcoin, I was obsessed by gold, so Peter Schiff was one of the guys I was listening to carefully.I was kind of disappointed that Schiff did not catch on bitcoin.  My guess is that he is not a IT guy at all, so it might take some time for him to realize what bitcoin can do that gold can't.  But I'm pretty sure that he will eventually.  Et on a pas encore passé le cap des 210 000 blocs, donc amha on a encore rien vu.Je suis sûr qu'il y a beaucoup de mineurs qui convertissent immédiatement leurs gains en dollars.  Quand leurs gains seront diminués de moitié, ça réduira automatiquement les volumes à la vente. Perso ce qui a attiré mon attention avec neteller ce sont les cartes prépayées.  Dans le temps on avait un service de change bitcoin vers des cartes VISA électroniques prépayées.  C'était vraiment formidable pour changer rapidement et simplement ses bitcoins.  ça manque.Mais bon je n'ai pas encore essayé neteller.  C'était juste une première impression après avoir survollé la page d'acceuil. neteller?  Je ne connaissais pas.  ça a l'air intéressant (notamment les cartes prépayées). Ca dépend surtout de ce qu'on entend par « interdire bitcoin ».   Je peux imaginer que les sites de change soient interdits mais j'imagine mal qu'on interdise aux gens d'installer le logiciel sur leur PC. Gxi estas malfacila frago.  Mi ne estas spertulo, sed jen mia opinio:la angla vorto "coin" tradukigxas per la esperanta vorto "monero", do mi kredas "bitcoin" tradukigxus "bitmonero". lol.  Funny times   Has anyone ever been arrested for buying or selling drugs on SR anyway? Concernant la page sur bitcoin, c'est moi qui l'avait créée dans le temps et plus tard certains contributeurs anti-bitcoin ont tenu à ajouter une section énumérant les critiques usuelles.  Je les ai laissées pour rester objectif et éviter une guerre d'édition.D'ailleurs ces derniers temps je songeais à faire un appel sur ce forum pour inciter à améliorer cette page.  Moi j'ai ni le temps ni l'inspiration pour m'y mettre.  Toi Boussac tu maitrises drôlement bien le sujet maintenant donc n'hésite pas.  Super, mais pourquoi ne pas avoir enrichi directement la page Wikipedia sur le sujet ??PS.  bon je viens d'ajouter un lien vers l'article dans une section "liens externes".  C'est déjà ça. J'ai écouté la version audio de la conf.   Excellent.  C'est du bon boulot, Boussac.J'ai bien aimé plein de trucs, par exemple ce qui tu dis sur les early-adopters (et les "late-adopters", lol), sur le fait que bitcoin permet le "deux coins" mais n'interdit pas le "trois coins" ou le "quatre coins".   Au passage Boussac tu noteras que tu dis quatre "coins", pas quatre "koillne" (je dis ça juste histoire de plaider pour la prononciation française).Une suggestion:  quand on te lance sur le thème "mais pourquoi 21 millions?  C'est pas assez, c'est arbitraire blah blah", tu fais bien de parler de l'or mais tu n'as qu'à leur dire que l'or par exemple, il y en a au total 30 mille tonnes, mais aussi 30 millions de kilos, 30 milliards de grammes, je-ne-sais-combien d'onces, etc.   Ca n'a aucun sens de parler de la quantité "numérique" d'une substance parfaitement fongible.  C'est juste une question de choix d'unité.  Loved the interview.  Always great to hear such bitcoin enthousiasm.My prefered part: Je viens de me souvenir ce matin d'une autre idée sur le sujet.Le jeu peut tout simplement consister à parier sur la valeur du hash pour le block validant la mise.Genre, je verse 10BTC pour parier sur le fait que le bloc qui validera ma transaction sera pair.Si en plus je paie vers une addresse crée à partir d'un clef publique fournie par le site de jeu, ça peut être honnête. Ok ok...  I just did not know about this movie.  Anyway I thought the expression "giant talking mosquito" was funny so I wanted to developp the idea.  Sorry you did not enjoy the text. After watching an episode a the "True blood" series lately, I had a weird idea about a not so usual description of vampires.  I thought it was worth being published, as it may be fun to read.If you enjoy reading this text, feel free to give a donation to:  1Pn3oMRoWdJ2xNrqpaEV7sgm16qhTMuizA Si tu choisis ce que tu fais dans la vie en suivant simplement la meute, tu dois pas trop t'étonner de ce qui t'attend.http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/pres-de-600-moutons-tues-en-tombant-d-une-falaise-en-savoie-28-08-2010-1046078.php Je n'y connais rien en steveJobsologie mais il y a très certainement écrit quelque part dans les CGU d'Apple qu'ils se réservent le droit de refuser une application pour une raison ou pour une autre.  Et en fait je suis sûr qu'ils n'ont même pas à se justifier.Dans la vie, fort heureusement, tu n'as pas à te justifier pour chacun de tes actes.  Imagine un peu le contraire.Et évidemment que c'est parce qu'ils préfèrent privilégier les solutions de paiement maison.  Mais pourquoi voudrais-tu qu'ils l'admettent??  Ca n'est pas dans leur intérêt. Don't you know that for french people, sodomizing flies is a national hobby?   Plus sérieusement, j'ai déjà résumé la solution au problème:  ne pas utiliser, et encore moins acheter, les merdes vendues par Apple. /mode troll ONYeah maybe that's the problem:  people who carry guns don't use them enough./mode troll OFF That's too easy.  You can not just defend something by arguying that without it it would be the end of civilization.  I just don't agree with this prediction.Get rid of governments and something else will emerge.  Maybe it will be chaos, maybe it will be just another form of government.  I don't know.  What I know is that I'm so fed up with elected governments that I want to accept the risk of trying something else.
Ben là y'a pas enlèvement mais il y a bien séquestration.L'analogie exacte c'est quand tu interdis à quelqu'un d'entrer chez toi.  Et là j'espère que tout le monde sera d'accord pour dire qu'il n'y a rien de mal à ça.Là en gros Boussac se plaint que Apple ne les laisse pas entrer dans l'écosystème Apple.  Pourtant c'est bel et bien leur écosytème:  ils laissent entrer qui ils veulent.Moi j'espère juste que Boussac va comprendre qu'il faut être idiot(*) pour développer pour Apple.  Pour moi quand de bons développeurs persistent à vouloir le faire, c'est du gâchis.*: ou alors particulièrement attiré par l'appât du gain. Euhh... là en l'occurence, oui.  On parle même d'enlèvement et/ou de séquestration  Mais personne ne te force à développer pour AppStore!!C'est comme si toi et tes potes vous vous présentiez à un tournoi de football et que vous vous plaigniez de ne pas avoir le droit de prendre le ballon avec les mains.   C'est la règle.  Si t'es pas content, inscris-toi à un tournoi de hand. C'est pas de la coercition car personne ne te force à télécharger ta musique sur iTunes.C'est pas plus de la coercition que quand tu entres dans une boucherie Halal où tu peux pas acheter de porc.Ca peut paraître peut-être un peu simpliste et borné de raisonner comme ça mais pourtant c'est un fait:  personne ne te force à aller chez iTunes ou chez Apple.  Ils peuvent donc te vendre ou refuser de te vendre ce qu'ils veulent. You have a point.  Too much bank hate is ridiculous.One reason why it's silly to say that banks are bad compared to bitcoin is that bitcoin DID NOT exist before 2009.  We can not blame bankers for not having invented bitcoin. Just don't buy this crap. Honnestly that's quite a big sum of money.  Do they really need that much to run webservers?  Or we could also fuck the CC-BY-SA and make an illegal fork on Tor.Because CC-BY-SA makes forking a real pain in the ass, and that is why there are so few forks of wikipedia. Why hasn't any bitcoin fan forked wikipedia already ? My guess is that they are just less desperate.  As soon as the french social security system collapses, I'm pretty sure it will quickly get ugly.Good point.  Gunned violence is indeed not just a matter of gun regulation. I may have a romantic idea of organised crime, but to me it is much more about racket, drug traffic and proxenetism.By comparaison, state is about racket (taxes), sequestration (jail) and endoctrination (schools and publicly financed medias). I once thought about an alternative protocol where miners, instead of crunching numbers, compete in chess.  A tournament occurs every ten minutes and only the winner is allowed to publish transactions.The problem with this is that it would require a lot of disk space to store all the games of all tournaments, in order to verify the block chain.  Yet this data would not be totally useless as there might be some interesting chess games in it. J'avais déjà proposé un schéma avec tirage vérifiable, mais c'est un peu compliqué.En gros le tirage a lieu avant la mise.  Pendant la mise le joueur peu voir le hash du tirage.  Après la mise le joueur peut vérifier que le hash correspond.  Il peut donc s'assurer que le résultat n'a pas été choisi pour ne pas correspondre à sa mise.Il y avait une subtilité quelque part qui faisait en sorte que le joueur devait aussi procurer un bruit avant chaque tirage, mais j'ai oublié pourquoi.Un de ces quat' je réimplémenterai une preuve de concept. Yeah right.  Until you encounter someone who has a large knife despite law, and who is willing to use it:http://galliawatch.blogspot.fr/2007/11/woman-fatally-stabbed-in-subway.htmlYeah and I want to live in a society where the weather is great everyday, beer is free and male-female ratio is one to ten.Weapons are things that can be produced by human beings.  As long as they will be humans, you can not prevent those things to exist.Yeah it is probably not the best argument.  Recently in Mali I've heard that islamists have taken control on the north of the country, and have arrested armed citizens.http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=227315&cid=1But still, I keep thinking it is probably more difficult, yet sadly not impossible, for a government to dictate law to an armed population. I think you missed the point of the old lady.In a nuttshell: it's not a matter of scale, it's a matter of style. Even when a mafia war ends up with a unique winner, it doesn't have to necessarly end up with a bureaucratic, private life intrusive government.  The lady speaker was not bashing the uniqueness of the government, but what it does and how it does it. Why did you strike this sentence through?« Outlaw guns, and only outlaws will use guns. »This is just plain truth.  By outlawing guns, the State makes peaceful people defenseless against violent people.  It is just silly. Ca n'est pas la question.  Si on prononce le mot bitcoin avec une prononciation française, ça n'enlève pas au mot son origine anglaise.Ce n'est pas à moi qu'on peut faire la leçon sur le bien fondé qu'il y a à laisser les langues vivre et se créoliser.Mais bitcoin à l'anglaise dans une phrase française ça me fait presque mal aux oreilles quand je l'entends, et à la machoire quand je le prononce.Que les gens fassent comme ils veulent, comme je le disais la langue c'est un phénomène vivant et il faut le laisser évoluer librement.  N'empèche que j'ai très envie de plaider pour une prononciation française.  Y'en a sûrement qui hésitent et qui choisissent de faire "comme tout le monde".  Donc ça a un sens de donner son avis pour pouvoir convaincre les indécis. Great post. Il y a sûrement des tas de contre-exemples à cette idée selon laquelle on doit prononcer à l'anglaise un mot d'origine anglaise.Un rapide coup d'oeil sur Google me donne cette page du Wiktionnary sur le sujet:http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Annexe:Mots_fran%C3%A7ais_d%E2%80%99origine_anglaise« Les mots empruntés à l'anglais se prononcent généralement selon une phonétique anglaise simplifiée.»Les exemples de "chèque", "cannette", "paquebot" et "redingote" me paraissent éloquents.Le son "ojn" n'existe nul part en français et ça fait très bizarre de le prononcer dans une phrase française.  Le mot "coin" par contre est banal même s'il fait sourire parce qu'il fait penser au bruit du canard.  Mais c'est à peu près aussi idiot que de sourire à l'énoncé du mot "bit" en informatique. Ben compte tenu du principe de fonctionnement, il serait particulièrement idiot d'utiliser ces services pour y recevoir des données confidentielles.J'ai déjà essayé d'envoyer des données chiffrées vers mailinator, le mail n'est pas arrivé car le texte a été reconnu comme encodé, et le site n'accepte pas ce genre de données.
Maybe you've already seen this video but if not, check it out:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IErlI34-0so I'll have a look at it someday.  But meanwhile I've been working on neat stuff and I'd like to share it to everyone.  It's not implemented in SQL right now, but I should do it soon.Here it is.I've spent quite some time reading the work of a guy named Vadim Tropashko onthis subject.  It's quite fascinating, and I think his technique would beperfect for a SQL model of the bitcoin block structure.Tropashko uses rational values as borders for his intervals.  One of the mainadvantage is that you can work on a fix global interval (0 to 1 for instance):you don't have to shift half of the block tree each time you insert a new node.One cool aspect of this technique is the relation with continued fractions.As you know any fraction can be written as a finite continued fraction:Code:p          1      - = ---------------q            1      a + -----------               1         b + -------                        c + ...The idea is that the a, b, c, ... sequence provides a natural path for thenode's branch.For instance, a sequence such as 1, 1, 2, 1 would mean:  "take the second branchat the third node from the root".Now, nested intervals are all about intervals, so we can not be happy with justone rational for each node.  We need an upper limit, assuming the rationaldescribed above is the lower limit (it is not necessarly the case though, butwe'll deal with this problem later).The idea is to associate a Möbius function of a variable x ranging from 0 to 1(same as our global interval):Code:              1      M(x) = ---------------                1         a + -----------                  1            b + -------                   c  +  xThen we have p/q = M(0).  The parent of f/p is then M(infinity). This is actually already enough to understand that M(x) can be written:Code:        p + r xM(x) =  -------        q + s xWhere r/s is the parent node written as a rational.I have no exact proof for that, but considerations on limits at infinity and value at 0 clearly indicates it should be true.Without the possibility to write M(x) like this, it would be pretty toughto compute any M(x) value in SQL.Anyway, what is important to remember is that to compute M(x) we only needtwo rational numbers:  the one from the actual lowest edge of the node, andthe one from its direct parent.The only thing which is lacking is a way to get the first child.  M(1) wouldn'tdo as this is actually the first 'sibling'.Tropashko then gets into quite a lot of complicated stuff and I had a lot ofdifficulties grasping them, and when I managed to understand them I waswondering if they would be useful anyway.  Yet there is one remark that hemakes at the very end of his last article, a remark that can make, in myhumble opinion, the whole thing much easier.Tropashko remarks that simple continued fractions are notoriously knownnot to be monotonuous.  Depending of the parity of the position of one of thenumber a, b, c..., sometimes the whole value increases with the number,sometimes it decreases.He then proposes to use positive continued fractions(mind the minus signs):Code:                 1M(x) = ---------------------                     1         a + 1 - -------------                       1            b + 1 - ---------                       c + 1 - xAlthouth this expression seems more complicated at first glance,it is actually much easier to visualize and to work with.The main reason for this is that it's easy to convince yourself that thisfunction of x is growing (I mean:  x > y => M(x) > M(y) ).This changes everything.  We now can be sure that the lowestedge for an interval will be M(0), and the highest edge will be M(1).We'll usually identify a node with M(0).Parent is still M(infinity), so we can still write the function as:Code:        p - r xM(x) =  -------        q - s xThe only difference are the minus signs, but they are not a problem.The first child of M(0) is easy to spot: it's M(1/2).  The second child (firstsibling of M(1/2)) is M(1/3), the third is M(1/4), and so on. The first sibling of M(0) is M(-1), second sibling is M(-2), and so on.Here is a small part of a genealogy tree, to make things clearer:Code:M(infinity)-->M(0)-------->M(1/2)--> M(1/(2-1/2)) --> ...asymptotically ends at M(1)        | |          |  |        | \-->M(-1)  |  \->M(1/3)----> M(1/(3-1/2)) --> ...asymptotically ends at M(1/2)        |            |        \---->M(-2)   \->M(1/4)---> M(1/(4-1/2))--> ...asymptotically ends at M(1/3)                                |                                \-> M(1/(4-1/3))--> ...asymptotically ends at M(1/(4-1/2))                                       .                                       .                                       .Then there is still a catch:  how do you compute the parent from the lower edgeof the interval?  Normally, as Tropashko explains it, you'd have to use theextended euclidian algorithm, but we actually don't need to do that for abitcoin block tree, since each parent is present already in the databaseanyway.  We can therefore retrieve the parent rational value, and use it tocompute the Möbius function, and thus the rest of the tree as we need it.So, to summarize, it's pretty easy.  Each node tree will have two rationalnumbers, defining an interval.  If the lower edge of node A is inside theinterval of node B, then B is an ancestor of node A.  To add a child to a node,we just need to get the parent and compute the Möbius function for x = 1/(n+2),where n is the number of already existing children.  It shouldn't be difficultto get n, we basically just need to make a loop and test for the existence of M(1/(k+2))in the database.Moving a whole branch should not be too difficult either.  Imagine we have anorphan block with children, and then suddenly the parent block of the orphan isadded to the database.  To patch the new branch to the database, we need tochange intervals for each node of the previously orphan branch.  It sure willcost more than adding a single child to a leaf, but hopefully this situationdoes not occur too often anyway.One cool thing with the fact that positive continued fractions are increasingfunctions, is that we will not have to store the ordinal value (height, depth,however you name it) of each node.  If we sort our queries by rational loweredges, then we'll automatically get the sequencial order of our chain. Pour la retraite par répartition, je ne sais pas.  Par contre pour l'or, je ne serais vraiment pas étonné qu'on en trouve quelques uns pour clamer l'or, ça sert à rien, ou c'est une relique barbare. As I try to implement a SQL bitcoin database for my perl library, I was looking for a way to efficiently store the tree block structure.  So I found out about an idea which is kind of neat:  nested sets.Here is one document which explains it (it's not the one I actually used as the one I used is not in english, so I had to find an other one for you):  https://communities.bmc.com/communities/docs/DOC-9902EDIT:  the wikipedia page seems fine also.I think it's quite a cleaver method, but a bit tough to grasp.Here is the mysql code I wrote so far (I didn't put here some views, but I did put the main tables, even if they are not related to the subject of this thread):Code:-- Table "blocks" actually only contains block headersCREATE TABLE blocks (    hash                char(32) binary primary key,    version             integer default 1,    hashPrev            char(32) binary not null,    hashMerkleRoot      char(32) binary not null,    nTime               integer unsigned not null,    nBits               integer unsigned not null,    nNonce              integer unsigned not null,    key (hashMerkleRoot),    key (hashPrev));-- We'll insert the genesis block here as some triggers won't behave well-- with an empty 'blocks' table.INSERT INTO blocks values (    unhex("6FE28C0AB6F1B372C1A6A246AE63F74F931E8365E15A089C68D6190000000000"),    1,    unhex("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"),    unhex("3BA3EDFD7A7B12B27AC72C3E67768F617FC81BC3888A51323A9FB8AA4B1E5E4A"),    1231006505,    486604799,    2083236893);-- A view of orphan blocks-- (notice that we don't use any "view" prefix in the name here)CREATE VIEW orphan_blocks ASSELECT a.*FROM blocks a LEFT JOIN blocks bON a.hashPrev = b.hashWHERE b.hash IS NULL;-- Merkle transaction trees are stored in their own tableCREATE TABLE Merkle_trees (    root                char(32) binary not null,    idx                 integer unsigned not null,    hash  char(32) binary,    primary key (root, idx),    key (root));-- TransactionsCREATE TABLE transactions (    hash                char(32) binary primary key,    version             integer,    lockTime            integer unsigned,);-- Transaction inputsCREATE TABLE tx_in (    hash                char(32) binary,    prevout_hash        char(32) binary,    prevout_n           integer unsigned,    scriptSig           blob,    sequence            integer unsigned,    primary key (hash, prevout_hash, prevout_n),    key(hash))-- Transaction outputsCREATE TABLE tx_out (    tx_out_id           integer unsigned primary key auto_increment,    hash                char(32) binary,    value               integer,    scriptPubKey        blob,    key (hash));-- A function to compute target from nBitsCREATE FUNCTION target (bits float)RETURNS REAL DETERMINISTICRETURN mod(bits, 0x1000000) * pow( 256, bits div 0x1000000 - 3 );-- To create the block tree structure,-- we'll use the interval model.-- Each node (i.e. each block) will have a left-- and a right edge.  We must ensure that descending-- blocks have edges inside its parent's edges.CREATE TABLE block_tree (    node char(32) binary primary key,    L           integer unsigned not null,    R  integer unsigned not null check (R > L),    height integer unsigned not null);-- We insert the genesis node manually.-- Left edge is 0, right edge is 1, height is 0.INSERT INTO block_tree values (    unhex("6FE28C0AB6F1B372C1A6A246AE63F74F931E8365E15A089C68D6190000000000"),    0,    1,    0);CREATE TRIGGER add_block_in_tree AFTER INSERT ON blocksFOR EACH ROWBEGIN    UPDATE block_tree t, block_tree r    SET t.L=t.L+2    WHERE r.node = new.hashPrev    AND t.L >= r.D;    UPDATE block_tree t, block_tree r    SET t.D=t.D+2    WHERE r.node = new.hashPrev    AND t.D >= r.D;    INSERT INTO block_tree (node, L, R, height)    SELECT new.hash, r.D, r.D + 1, r.height + 1    FROM block_tree r    WHERE r.node = new.hashPrev;END;The trigger "add_block_in_tree" should work when a block whose parent is known is inserted.  But it will not work if  block is inserted before its parent is.  It should be possible to code this but it is a bit tricky.Anyway if anyone is also interested in this model, I'd gladly hear suggestions. French Data Network, le fournisseur d'accès internet associatif, accessoirement le plus ancien FAI français, a développé depuis quelques années un système fédéraliste permettant à plus ou moins n'importe quelle association de se déclarer comme fournisseur d'accès, en suivant l'exemple de FDN.Chez FDN, on n'aime pas bitcoin.  Souvent sur le thème "arnaque de Ponzi", pour faire simple.  Je le sais parce que je me suis déjà pas mal fait bousculé sur leur canal IRC. Personne n'est parfait, comme on dit.  Moi j'ai énormément de respect pour leur assoc et pour leur président Benjamin Bayart, en grande partie parce que quand j'étais étudiant j'ai appris LaTeX en lisant le manuel qu'il avait écrit quand il était à l'ESIEE.Donc si chez FDN, on n'aime pas bitcoin, c'est pas grâve.  Par contre ce serait drôlement cool si on pouvait suivre leur exemple pour créer un FAI acceptant les bitcoins comme paiement mensuel.  Le FAI paie le raccordement à un FAI "grossiste" (Nerim, je crois) en payant en euros, donc une conversion serait nécessaire, au moins pour cette partie des frais.  Mais pour le reste (administration, autres couts variables, que sais-je encore...), ça pourrait être payés en bitcoins constants.J'ai bien peur qu'on soit encore loin de pouvoir mettre ça en place (déjà que le nombre d'utilisateurs de bitcoins est faible, alors ceux qui ont envie de changer de FAI pour un FAI "amateur" l'est probablement encore plus), mais l'idée vaut la peine d'être lancée.Ca n'a même pas à être associatif (cad à but non lucratif).  Ca pourrait très bien être un vrai projet entreprenarial, vu que l'usage de bitcoin doit pouvoir (j'imagine) réduire certains couts (car les banques prennent des commissions sur les prélèvements automatiques je crois). By the way, is there any plan to implement a "header-only" mode on the main client, as Satoshi described it in his white paper?PS.  sorry I realize it has been discussed already. Indeed.  I'm kind of surprised that even Gavin worries a bit about this. I am working on it for my perl library.It's quite different from genjix's approach, though.  In particular, I want to use triggers to create the chain tree structure.  First I wanted to use ideas such as this one, but I soon realized that with a long chain it would cost a lot of memory.For instance with 200,000 chained blocks, the tree table would have 40 billion records. With at least 64 bytes per records, that would be about 1 Po, which is silly.So I'm still thinking of better structures, since  I don't quite understand Genjix's.Code:CREATE TABLE blocks (    hash                char(32) binary primary key,    version             integer,    hashPrev            char(32) binary not null,    hashMerkleRoot      char(32) binary not null,    nTime               integer unsigned not null,    nBits               integer unsigned not null,    nNonce              integer unsigned not null,    key (hashMerkleRoot),    key (hashPrev));CREATE TABLE transactions (    hash                char(32) binary primary key,    version             integer,    lockTime            integer unsigned,);CREATE TABLE tx_in (    hash                char(32) binary,    prevout_hash        char(32) binary,    prevout_n           integer unsigned,    scriptSig           blob,    sequence            integer unsigned,    primary key (hash, prevout_hash, prevout_n),    key(hash))CREATE TABLE tx_out (    tx_out_id           integer unsigned primary key auto_increment,    hash                char(32) binary,    value               integer,    scriptPubKey        blob,    key (hash));CREATE TABLE Merkle_trees (    root                char(32) binary not null,    hash  char(32) binary,    idx                 integer unsigned not null,    primary key (root, idx),    key (root));CREATE TABLE block_tree (    leaf        char(32) binary,    node        char(32) binary,    length      integer unsigned,    PRIMARY KEY (leaf, node));CREATE VIEW view_blocks ASSELECT HEX(hash) as hash,version,HEX(hashPrev) as hashPrev,HEX(hashMerkleRoot) as hashMerkleRoot,nTime,nBits,nNonceFROM blocks;CREATE VIEW orphan_blocks ASSELECT a.*FROM blocks a LEFT JOIN blocks bON a.hashPrev = b.hashWHERE b.hash IS NULL;CREATE VIEW view_orphan_blocks ASSELECT view_blocks.*FROM view_blocks INNER JOIN orphan_blocksON view_blocks.hash = HEX(orphan_blocks.hash);CREATE VIEW view_Merkle_trees ASSELECT HEX(root) as root, HEX(hash) as hash, idxFROM Merkle_trees;CREATE VIEW view_block_tree ASSELECT HEX(leaf) as leaf, HEX(node) as node, lengthFROM block_tree;CREATE VIEW chain_length ASSELECT leaf, length FROM block_tree WHERE leaf = node;CREATE VIEW chain_weight ASSELECT leaf, SUM(work(target(b.nBits))) as weightFROM block_tree INNER JOIN blocksON block_tree.node = blocks.hashGROUP BY leaf;CREATE VIEW longest_chain ASSELECT leaf, max(length) as lengthFROM chain_length;CREATE VIEW heaviest_chain ASSELECT leaf, max(weight) as weightFROM chain_weight;CREATE FUNCTION target (bits float)RETURNS REAL DETERMINISTICRETURN mod(bits, 0x1000000) * pow( 256, bits div 0x1000000 - 3 );CREATE TRIGGER update_block_tree AFTER INSERT ON blocks FOR EACH ROW BEGIN    INSERT INTO block_tree (leaf, node, length)    SELECT new.hash, new.hash, length+1    FROM block_tree WHERE leaf = new.hashPrev;    UPDATE block_tree    SET leaf=new.hash    WHERE leaf=new.hashPrev;END;# vim: ft=mysql Ok, so it was not obvious and required some understanding of Legendre symbol, Euler criterium and stuff like that, right?I had no reason to be ashamed of not understanding.  That's a relief.Thanks anyway.PS.  jeez, modular arithmetics is tough. In the Tonelli-Shanks article mentionned above, it is said that when p = 3 [mod 4], then the answer is simply:n^((p+1)/4)[Remainder:  we want to compute the p-modular square root of n]It's cool because precisely with secp256k1 we are in this particular case.Yet I confess I don't understand why this relation is true.If p = 3 [mod 4], then there is q such that:   p = 4*q + 3Ok so (p+1)/4 =  (4*q+4)/4 = q+1.So:n^((p+1)/4) = n^(q+1)Ok that's great.  But so what??   I don't see how this shows me that (n^((p+1)/4))  ^ 2 = n (which is what we want).I can live without understanding that.  But it's kind of annoying.  Can anyone enlighten me? The rise of quantum computing would be so awesome that if it really must mean the end of bitcoin, it would be a totally acceptable collateral damage. Je te conseille de ne proposer que l'envoi.   Comme ça tu économiseras de l'espace disque, ce qui facilitera le maintien de la gratuité du service.Pour la réception, il y a déjà des tas de services comme celui mentionné plus haut.  Et dans un mail on peut toujours stipuler l'addresse de réponse avec le "Reply-to:", donc on peut très bien séparer les services d'envoi et de réception.Sinon, il y a longtemps un gars avait mis en place un site de messagerie pour les utilisateurs de bitcoins, à base d'addresses bitcoins.  J'ai complètement oublié le nom, par contre. C'est juste pour recevoir ou on pourra envoyer des mails aussi ??Parce que si c'est juste pour recevoir il y a l'excellent mailinator. J'ai fait un drôle de rêve l'autre jour.  Je mets ça dans "hors-sujet" même si ça concerne bitcoin, parce que ça n'est rien d'autre qu'un rêve, après tout.Dans le temps quand j'avais la télé je regardais souvent l'émission de Yves Calvi "C'est dans l'air" sur France 5.  Et bien l'autre jour j'ai rêvé qu'il consacrait une émission entière à bitcoin.Je fais rarement des rêves aussi détaillés et celui-ci était fascinant.  Ils posaient pleins de questions super intéressantes mais je me souviens seulement de ce qui m'a réveillé.  A un moment dans l'émission les invités doivent réagir à des SMS envoyés par les télespectateurs.  Et là Yves Calvi cite un SMS disant:  « Le mot "bitcoin" est devenu tabou dans les milieux financiers. »Et là, long silence éloquant sur le plateau.   C'est là dessus que je me suis réveillé.   I haven't.  I kind of felt stuck in Perl5 as I was reaching the point where I should implement networking.  Yet I don't know much about networking programming, I have difficulties understanding Satoshi's code about it, and I don't have a regular internet access so I could not make as many tests as I wanted.   So I felt like starting a Perl6 implementation until I get a regular internet access.Specifications are pretty much done, yes.  Implementations have done very impressive progress lately.  Rakudo is pretty much usable now, for instance.No.  Perl6 will NOT be backwards compatible.   At all.Still, it will be (and is already) an awesome programming language.     Au temps pour moi   Lemonde.fr:  « Bitcoin, les deux faces de la monnaie virtuelle »http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2011/06/17/bitcoin-les-deux-faces-de-la-monnaie-virtuelle_1537285_651865.html Pas une super idée le van.  Beaucoup trop facile à braquer. EDIT:  It seems that the solution is here:  Tonelli-Shanks algorithmSo I've learnt about compressed public points recently and I have a question:  How do you decompress one?I mean, with a compressed public point you have the X position, and a boolean telling you whether Y is odd or even.So I thought:« ok I just have to compute the square root of X^3 + aX+ b, ie the square root of X^3 + 7 »,but since this is modular arithmetics, is it only possible??  I thought quite a bit about it and I could not find the beginning of an idea.I know I could have a look a the source code of openssl, but if someone could give me a quick explanation, that would spare me some hassle.
Est-ce qu'on peut espérer qu'un jour, quand les gars de bitcoin-central seront devenus super-riches, ou qu'ils auront levé assez de capital, ils mettent en place un bureau de change physique avec un comptoir, où on pourra faire du change bitcoin/cash de façon totalement anonyme comme le font les changeurs "normaux" ? I recently found out about YAML and I think it's much cooler than JSON.I'm curious about your opinion about it. It is not python but have you considered using my bitcoin bash tools?Code:$ . bitcoin.sh$ newBitcoinKey---WIF: 5KFtidLNEgFicv1QWGjMUECprKEQdLEqDGA7V5F8PJDZxaazRG7bitcoin address: 1NZunrMgUVoe7H46GZW3x1NUxGPSyJUCSLpublic key: 048EB823CBA7A29B9E8DE312E1F7516333D2754C2A7C480218C4E16E0CAB0E782EFFA715E5AB89426C948827A384CF32ECE0E8DE8625F2B124F40630CCA720997AIt only requires openssl and dc. Ok, maybe it's a bit early to push to github but I did it anyway because I really like what I've done and I want to show it to people.  I should have created an 'experimental' branch but I totally forgot and I don't master git enough to revert the process.  So it's still in the main branch.I went back to basics, got rid of unnecessary stuff (such as encryption and master keys) and focus on dealing efficiently with keys and addresses.Now, you don't have to 'use Bitcoin::Key' or 'use Bitcoin::Address', just:Code:use Bitcoin;You don't have to explicitely call a constructor, either.  I overloaded the constants interpretation with the overload pragma and its overload::constants function.  So now when you type a string litteral that looks like a bitcoin address or a bitcoin key in WIF, perl checks it and see what it is exacly (while verifying the checksum, of course).This allows you to write something like:Code:say "5KFtidLNEgFicv1QWGjMUECprKEQdLEqDGA7V5F8PJDZxaazRG7"->address;Perl will magically recognize this is a bitcoin key so it will create the corresponding object before calling its address method.  This should normally print "1NZunrMgUVoe7H46GZW3x1NUxGPSyJUCSL".Also, now Bitcoin::Key inherits from Math::BigInt, so you can transparently do arithmetics on them and you'll get a derived key.  This can be usefull for defining a master key or for Diffie-Hellman like schemes:Code:say "5KFtidLNEgFicv1QWGjMUECprKEQdLEqDGA7V5F8PJDZxaazRG7" * 2;One thing that still needs to be done is having this arithmetics being modular, but it should not be too difficult.Random generation of a new key is done with a special constructor called 'random':Code:say random Bitcoin::Key;It is actually a constructor for EC::DSA::PrivateKey, from whom Bitcoin::Key inherits too (yes, I've done multiple inheritance).   I think it makes sense since a bitcoin key is both a Base58 encoded data and a ECDSA privatekey.Also, I've decided to use environment variables to tune the behavior of the library.  For instance, if you want to work with the test network, just define the BITCOIN_TEST env var (you can put anything in it, it doesn't matter):Code:$ export BITCOIN_TEST=yes$ perl -wE 'use Bitcoin; [your code here...]' orCode:$ BITCOIN_TEST= perl -wE 'use Bitcoin;'More will come. Developping a bitcoin library in Perl6 gave me a lot of ideas about how to improve this library in Perl5.I can't publish just yet but it's gonna come out soon.  Stay tuned.  No, but I'll check it out   A bit shorter, and with better alignment (64 characters):Code:I16i7sb0sa[[_1*lm1-*lm%q]Std0>tlm%Lts#]s%[Smddl%x-lm/rl%xLms#]s~483ADA7726A3C4655DA4FBFC0E1108A8FD17B448A68554199C47D08FFB10D4B879BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F817982 100^d14551231950B75FC4402DA1732FC9BEBF-so1000003D1-ddspsm*+sGi[_1*l%x]s_[+l%x]s+[*l%x]s*[-l%x]s-[l%xsclmsd1su0sv0sr1st[q]SQ[lc0=Qldlcl~xlcsdscsqlrlqlu*-ltlqlv*-lulvstsrsvsulXx]dSXxLXs#LQs#lrl%x]sI[lpSm[+q]S0d0=0lpl~xsydsxd*3*lal+x2ly*lIx*l%xdsld*2lx*l-xdlxrl-xlll*xlyl-xrlp*+Lms#L0s#]sD[lpSm[+q]S0[2;AlDxq]Sdd0=0rd0=0d2:Alp~1:A0:Ad2:Blp~1:B0:B2;A2;B=d[0q]Sx2;A0;B1;Bl_xrlm*+=x0;A0;Bl-xlIxdsi1;A1;Bl-xl*xdsld*0;Al-x0;Bl-xd0;Arl-xlll*x1;Al-xrlp*+L0s#Lds#Lxs#Lms#]sA[rs.0r[rl.lAxr]SP[q]sQ[d0!<Qd2%1=P2/l.lDxs.lLx]dSLxs#LPs#LQs#]sM Thanks!  I had no idea it existed already   Hello all,the bitcoin wiki is a great source of documentation about bitcoin, but please, please, think about people who do not have a regular internet connection.I already have a dump of Wikipedia which I browse with a few Perl scripts (see here if you are interested).  I really would like to do the same with the bitcoin wiki.Could anyone create a xml dump such as those which are avaible on wikipedia at http://download.wikimedia.org.  I presume that the same tool can be used since it uses the same wiki engine, right?It would really be cool. Au fait je pense à un truc.  Si jamais ce projet se concrétise, envisagez s'il vous plait une diffusion en P2P (http://freetorrent.fr), et un format libre genre OggVorbis.

J'espère que Davout n'a pas donné l'idée aux gens de Merdosoft d'installer une blackdoor anti-bitcoin dans la prochaine version de Windaube.

Ben écoute, si le français n'est pas ta langue maternelle, permets-moi de te féliciter parce que tu as posté ce message avec très peu de fautes et dans un français très compréhensible.  Ce n'est pas si commun, et même pour des francophones natifs !Sinon, bonne continuation pour ton site  Sorry I haven't read the whole thread but that is basically Diffie-Hellman, right?Anyway it sounds to me like a pretty good idea and a possibility for an additionnal business for miners.An offline tool will be easy to write.  My Perl bitcoin library almost aready does the job. The Perl6 developpers are working hard on dealing with tail recursion (I think it's done already in rakudo).  I guess the Python team is concerned about that too.Also, the maximum amount of recursive call here is 256.  That sure is a lot but it is capped so it should be fine I guess.
I found out that a really slow part was the elliptic curve exponentiation (this is needed when converting a private key to a bitcoin address).So I wrote a wrapper to make it possible to compute this using BC.  It is used when the environment variable "PERL6_EC_METHOD" is set to "BC".   It's now about five times faster.Here is the bc code:Code:/* * * A small library for elliptic curve arithmetics and cryptography with * bitcoin. * *  */scale=0;/* secp256k1 parameters */ibase=16;p= FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F;b= 7;a= 0;gx=79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798;gy=483ADA7726A3C4655DA4FBFC0E1108A8FD17B448A68554199C47D08FFB10D4B8;go=FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141;ibase=A;/* A modulo function that behaves well with negative numbers */define true_mod(n, m) {    if (n >= 0) return n%m else return -n*(m-1)%m;}/* modular inverse function */define inverse_mod ( n, m ) {    auto c, tc, d, td, uc, tuc, vc, tvc, ud, vd, q;    c = true_mod(n, m); d = m; uc=1; vc=0; ud=0; vd=1; q=0;    while (c != 0) { q = d / c; tc = c; c = true_mod(d, c); d = tc; tuc = uc; tvc = vc; uc = ud - q*uc; vc = vd - q*vc; ud = tuc; vd = tvc;    }    return true_mod(ud, m);}/* This test function should print a long sequence of '1'. */define test_inverse_mod () {    auto n, i;    n = 2017;    for (i=1; i<n; i++) print (i * inverse_mod(i, n)), n;}/*  * Elliptic curve operations. * * For simplicity, we'll ignore the possibiliy of a * point at horizon.  * * BC functions can not return multiple values, * so we'll use a base-p encoding for points. * */define add( point_a, point_b ) {    auto i, l, x, y, xa, ya, xb, yb;    xa = point_a / p; ya = point_a % p;    xb = point_b / p; yb = point_b % p;    i = inverse_mod( xb - xa, p );    l = true_mod((yb - ya) * i, p);    x = l^2 - xa - xb;    y = l*(xa - x) - ya;    return true_mod(x, p) *p + true_mod(y, p);}define double( point ) {    auto l, x, y, xout, yout;    x = point / p; y = point % p;    l = true_mod((3*x^2 + a) * inverse_mod( 2*y, p ), p);    xout = true_mod(l^2 - 2*x, p);    yout = true_mod(l*(x - xout) - y, p);    return xout * p + yout;}define mult( k, point ) {    if (k == 1) return point;    if (k == 2) return double( point );    if (k % 2 == 0) return double( mult( k/2, point ) );    return add(point, double( mult( k/2, point ) ));}];our sub compute(Str $expression) {    return map {:16($_)},    qqx[    echo "{code}    tmp = $expression;    obase=16;    tmp / p    tmp % p    quit" |    bc -q    ].comb: /<xdigit>+/;} As I was trying to speeden my Perl6 bitcoin library, I realized something that is worth mentionning, imho.In the elliptic curve arithmetics library, the implementation of "mult" is kind of weird and tough to understand.  Here is the relevant part in Python:Code:def __mul__( self, other ):    """Multiply a point by an integer."""    def leftmost_bit( x ):      assert x > 0      result = 1L      while result <= x: result = 2 * result      return result // 2    e = other    if self.__order: e = e % self.__order    if e == 0: return INFINITY    if self == INFINITY: return INFINITY    assert e > 0    # From X9.62 D.3.2:    e3 = 3 * e    negative_self = Point( self.__curve, self.__x, -self.__y, self.__order )    i = leftmost_bit( e3 ) // 2    result = self    # print "Multiplying %s by %d (e3 = %d):" % ( self, other, e3 )    while i > 1:      result = result.double()      if ( e3 & i ) != 0 and ( e & i ) == 0: result = result + self      if ( e3 & i ) == 0 and ( e & i ) != 0: result = result + negative_self      # print ". . . i = %d, result = %s" % ( i, result )      i = i // 2        return resultWell, I don't know about you, but to me, this is ugly.I love recursive functions, so whenever I think I can write one, I think hard about how to actually do it.It appeared to me that this one is a good candidate.   Here is what I'd do:Code:def __mul__( self, other ):    """Multiply a point by an integer."""    e = other    if self.__order: e = e % self.__order    if e == 0: return INFINITY    if self == INFINITY: return INFINITY    assert e > 0    if e == 1:  return self    if e == 2:  return self.double    assert e > 2    if e%2 == 0:  return (e/2 * self).double    return self + (e/2 * self).doubleWell, I didn't try this particular one because I don't like python, but the same idea worked fine with my perl implementation for instance:Code:sub mult {    no warnings qw(recursion);    my $k = shift;    my $u = shift;    return    $k == 1   ? $u :    $k == 2   ? double $u :    $k%2 == 0 ? double mult $k/2, $u :    add $u, double mult $k/2, $u    ;}To me it's kind of cool. I'm not sure I understand exactly your problem, but maybe it could help if I tell you that I had lots of difficulty trying to understand the bitcoin serialisation protocol, until I read Gavin's bitcointools python code.  It is much easier to understand than C++.  It helped me a lot for my perl library. (registering to this thread) Has Satoshi ever explained his choice for BerkeleyDB instead of a SQL-based relationnal db? Excellente interview.  T'as été très complet, Boussac.  Et Laborde a été étonnamment tolérant.  Bravo à vous deux donc.Une petite critique tout de même:  je t'ai trouvé un brun trop consensuel.  Pas un mot sur Silk Road par exemple.  Quant à ce que tu dis sur la fiscalité et sur le fait que bitcoin ne change pas grand chose dans ce domaine, j'ai l'impression que tu as éludé un peu la question et que ce n'est pas aussi simple que tu le dis. Lots of improvements.  The Bitcoin::DataStream class is now implemented.  This allows me to create a block object from a hexdump and check its proof-of-work.However, it requires a customed version of rakudo with more complete pack/unpack functions.  They can be found on my fork of rakudo: http://github.com/grondilu/rakudoIt's still pretty slow, though.  But I love the syntax of the whole thing, for instance for creating a new, random bitcoin address:Code:use Bitcoin;say my $k = Bitcoin::Key.new;say $k.address;What is really missing now is a decent database library.  If someone would like to port BerkeleyDB on perl6, it would be awesome. I can't believe this thread is still alive.   Ce serait super un podcast en français effectivement.  Histoire de se tenir au courant des nouvelles et des nouveaux sites sans s'abimer les yeux devant un écran.Par contre comme remarqué plus haut: une émission par semaine ça me parait un peu trop ambitieux.   Un mensuel ou même trimestriel me parait plus raisonnable dans un premier temps.   Mais bon c'est toi qui vois. +1Please everyone: stop saying bitcoin is democratic.  It is not. I created two github repositories:one for the digest moduleand one for bitcoinYou can now create addresses in Perl6:Code:use Bitcoin; my Bitcoin::Key $key .= new;  .say for $key, $key.address;Or check an existing key or address:Code:use Bitcoin; say Bitcoin::Address.new: "1SomeSi11yAddressToCheckXXXXX";This is still the most basic stuff and it is awefully slow but there is a begin to everything, right?This is a very long term project anyway. LoL  I don't "demand" you anything.  It would be too easy if I could have you forget about your superstitious beliefs by just asking.I wish you were not using the word "islamic" in your banking business, just as I wish there were no more religion in this world.  This is not a request.  Merely a hope. Only maths are strictly logical.   And I'm not the one who brought logic in this thread, anyway.Occam's razzor is a logical principle.  It's not an axiom of Zermel-Fraenkel theory, for instance.  It doesn't have to be one of them to be widely accepted as logical principle.If only mathematicians can have an opinion about the universe, then no wonder religion has so much success. I don't know exactly what you mean by "strictly logic".  Logic is about applying a succession of axioms to a set of hypothesis in order to arrive to a conlusion.  If you add Occam's razor to the set of axioms, then there is no tea-pot orbiting around Jupiter.Otherwise, from your "strictly logic" point of view, I don't know if Jupiter even exists as we know it, since I have never seen it through a telescope.  So to me it could just be an ordinary star.  Or a totally different planet.Occam's razor allows me to affirm that all the photographs, descriptions and scientist studies about Jupiter are not lies, nor a huge international conspiracy against me, aimed at having me believe in a non-existent planet. There is no tea-pot orbiting around Jupiter.  Neither there are any leprechauns or flying horses. That's an application of Occam's razor.If you don't agree with that, then you just can't affirm anything and you are not religious, you're nihilist.  You might as well say that we don't know for sure if the sun is going to raise tomorow.  And without occam's razor, we don't.Common sense tells you there is no tea-pot around Jupiter.  So it should tell you there is no omnipotent God anywhere, caring about human beings and violating physical laws from times to times to guide their life. The topic of this thread is not:  "should I do business with IBB?".    Neither it is "should anyone be forced to do business with them?".We were discussing about religion and why it sucks, and that lead me to express my opinion about IBB.  Now I can understand you don't like it but it is not because I don't have to use it that I won't express my opinion about it on the dedicated thread. This is not directly related to this particular article, but:I wonder if Silk Road is not much greater an innovation than we can realize at first glance.  I mean, if drug dealers are unknown, even for their clients, then they are probably unknown from one another.  As a consequence, they can not use violence to impose themselves on the market.  So in a way, Silk road style drug traffic could eradicate violence in the drug business, which would be tremendously good in my humble opinion. I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that.  To him the issuing of currency would be defined by an algorithm depending on the spendings (assuming a computer can know these data).  The FED would have no power on it once it is launched:  he insists on the idea of throwing the key a way, so it is not ambiguous at all.I doubt there is anyway for a computer to measure economics activities though, since money transfers could easily be fake (with no real economic exchange behind) by anyone willing to increase the money supply.  But this is an other matter.To me a computer should be economicly blind:  its only job should be to provide money at a predefined rate, whatever the economic situation is.  Selgin doesn't agree with that, but he likes the idea of a monetary system being "human-proof". Oui effectivement.   Maintenant je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit pratique/confortable.  J'avais proposé déjà des RDV réguliers dans un parc, sans trop de succès. Pour vendre des bitcoins dans un lieu public il faut un accès internet.   Ca réduit déjà pas mal les possibilités.
Don't worry I don't force you about anything.  I'm telling you that there are some people who will not consider iyou seriously as long as you put religious references in your economic activities.Atheists don't like superstitions and would not want to have business with a "astrological bank of bitcoins", "christian bank of bitcoin" or "pastafaric bank of bitcoin".PS.  I understand though that such a name has probably a good appeal for muslim people.  And there are quite a lot of muslims in this world so I guess from a marketing point of view your name is a good strategy. I very much disagree.  He likes the idea of a monetary policy beeing handled by an unstoppable computer.  I guess he would like the bitcoin software to be modified to do so.  This is totally a positive attitude towards bitcoin, imho. If we believe in monetary freedom, then we should hope that more people adopt this idea of modifying bitcoin to comply to their ideas regarding monetary policy.  Everyone would just pick the money they agree with and the market find a price for them. Nice.  I like this guy.  I had seen once his speech about private coins and it was very enlightning:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gn55fTRXZwShouldn't this thread be in the 'press' subforum, though? You're the fisrt muslim I ever encounter who supports evolution.Maybe I'm wrong about muslims and they are not as obscurantists as I thought.  I still whish you were not refering to islam with everything you do, though.  Including banking and bitcoins. Yeah right.  When someone shows you a book supposedly written by a prophet of God you just accept it without discussion.  And yet when someone gives you a materialist explanation of why life is so diverse and how it evolves, you just reject it and ask for "facts" because you think a weird explanation such as "it's just that God made it so" is better (although it doesn't explain anything: it just gives a name "God" to the explanation).Science is full of theories about how things work and I'm pretty sure you accept them without so-called "facts", because you know they make sense and do not hurt your religious belief:  you may accept plate tectonics and yet you will never ever in your life see a continent move with you own eyes.  But I guess plate tectonics does not hurt your feelings.Then call those civilisations persian when they are persian and arab when they are arabs.  Western cultures come from roman and greek civlisations but usually we call them just romans even if we're talking about people who where living very far from Rome.  Anyway we do not use the roman religion to name them.  We don't say that the western culture comes from the civilisation of Zeus.Just get rid of this stupid book and you'll do even better in learning nature.  It's a waste of time for the mind to read and accept a book just because it is "revelated".  It is contrary to scientific method to accept an ad-hoc idea just per se, as a dogma.  This is the main reason why religion is very little compatible with science: it diffuses the idea that it is acceptable to use autorithy and blind faith to determin whether something is true or false.You can talk however long you want about how great were some muslim scientists.  There is no point as I will not deny that some of them made great discoveries indeed.  Yet I may ask why then your great God didn't gave more hints about science to your prophet and put them in the Coran.  Why didn't he write the equations of Maxwell, the list of the elements and the axioms of quantum mechanics for instance?  All this could have been written on one or two pages.  Yet it seems your God wanted all this to be discovered by non-muslims, and he wanted the people he chose to be quite limited to maths, astronomy and medecine, and still to be over-powered by non muslims in these fields anyway.  Go figure!  This is BS, seriously.  I've seen some documentaries about madrassas, islamic schools, where young chidren were spending their all day long learning the Coran by heart during years.  How on earth do you want such kids to learn anything about nature?In the arabic world, in the persian world or whatever makes what we currently call the "islamic" world, there were great scientific discoveries that were made.   Yes, but it is true also before that in the greeko-roman world (which arabs transmitted the legacy to us, thanks for that!), and also in India and probably in other civilisations I do not know about.  Those civilisations had religions two, damned it!  And yet we never insist on using the name of these religions to qualify them, as you keep on trying to do. En voiture non puisque j'en n'ai pas.Je crois que je vais devoir privilégier les contacts par le net.  De toute façon si tout va bien une fois emménagé j'aurai un accès permanent donc ce sera l'occasion de participer un peu plus activement aux discussions.Mais pour les rencontres IRL, ce sera difficile pour moi.  Par contre je ferai peut-être le déplacement à Londres pour la conférence cette année. Yeah but were they really all muslims at this time ??I mean, it's not like all the arab population, including greatest minds, became muslim as soon as the prophet appeared. What do you mean by we are taking over all of bitcoin ? Yeah, they have their share in human progress.  Yet, I wonder why we keep calling these civilisation "islamic", because islam is very much less about science than about stoning adulterous women, cuting hands and raising your bottom five times a day.And yes, islam has a probem with science:  evolution.  You may not think the world is 6000 years, yet you still refuse to admit that the human species is one species amongst many others, and that it evolves with other mammals from a common ancestor.   Every time I talked with a muslim, they always confirmed me this impression.Why don't you talk about "arabic" civilisation instead of "islamic" ??To me, keeping talking about islamic science is just as silly as talking about christian science when talking about Galileo, Newton, electromagnetism, electronics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, and so on.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt there is any sourate in the Coran encouraging young people to learn science and to understand nature.  Coran just want them to learn Coran.  And if there is something in science that contradicts Coran, then Coran says that Coran is right.  Because it is the book of God so it is true and you just can't discuss it.  How silly is this, seriously?Sience has nothing to do with religion.  Without islam, people who invented algebra would probably have invented it anyway.  There is no reason why schools and libraries you are talking about could not have been built in a non-islamic arabic world. It doesn't make any sense to say that religion is evil, does it?  I mean, if you don't believe in God, then you don't believe in the devil either.Anyway, I am atheist and I think religion sucks indeed.  Mainly because it is pretty much not compatible with scientific knowledge.  It's obvious when talking about biology and evolution with a religious person, and particularly with a muslim.  But if you don't want everyone to fight one another, you gotta learn tolerance.About this islamic bitcoin bank, I don't know much about it and maybe it rocks.  Yet I would propbably not do business with these people unless they get rid of the "islamic" reference in the name.  I don't know what's the point anyway, since I guess this word just mean that they don't lend money with interest, which is fine but doesn't need to be refered to "islamic" to exist. Ouais, je pars en Picardie.  En tout cas je pense ne plus être à Paris d'ici juin.  Malheureusement je serai aussi en province une bonne partie du mois de mai donc j'ai bien peur de ne pas pouvoir être là pour le prochain appéro bitcoin, à moins qu'on fasse ça dans les prochains jours.Y'a des gens que ça branche de faire ça d'ici la fin du mois ? I am not sure the english version was published anywhere here.  But looking for bitcoin on the website gave this:http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/money-shiny-new-coins-1.404597 Indeed it is annoying.I downloaded it with clive and watched it with:$ mplayer -delay 1.45 jeffbrito-not-talking-about-mintchip.flv Yeah, that was fun   Je suis à Paris dans le seizième mais je vais bientôt déménager en province,  donc j'espère qu'un apéro se déroulera bientôt car je ne suis pas sûr de pouvoir me déplacer ensuite. Ben oui.  Ca s'appelle l'adjudication de carnet d'ordres.  Google et Wikipedia t'en diront plus. According to Max Keiser,  Larry Summers, former secretary of the US Treasury, said the following about bitcoin:«[bitcoin] is one of many innovative technologies that are going to seek to take friction out. »However, the given link requires registration to see the full article. http://maxkeiser.com/2012/03/29/bitcoin-is-one-of-many-innovative-technologies-that-are-going-to-seek-to-take-friction-out-larry-summers/ Nahh j'étais pas très sérieux  Ton affiche elle est très bien.  Juste un truc éventuellement:  si tu as de la place quelque part essaie d'indiquer que c'est un logiciel libre. It's kind of a good idea to revive this thread from times to times. ça faisait un moment que je me disais qu'on devrait lancer un concours pour une affiche ou un trac.Bonne initiative donc.Une affiche minimaliste et un peu provoc:
arXiv is a cool website that gives, in my opinion, a glimpse of what science might look like in the future.I've just noticed that there are three articles whith "bitcoin" in their title.I haven't read them yet, but I thought it was worth mentionning.http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+bitcoin/0/1/0/all/0/1 Je crois que ce sondage d'une importance cruciale  n'a pas été posté encore. Non, ça n'a pas à être tout ou rien.  Ça restera probablement une pratique marginale, mais néanmoins bien réelle.Je ne suis personnellement pas malade, mais si je l'étais je ne verrais aucun mal à payer un médecin en bitcoins, puisque de toute façon je ne suis pas couvert par la sécurité sociale. Ah crotte j'ai déjà posté mon opinion sur le sujet dans la file sur les nouveaux venus, et j'ai la flemme de copier/coller. Salut docteur Genjix a déjà raconté une histoire personnelle dans laquelle il avait payé un médecin pour quelques conseils suite à ce qu'il croyait être une entorse.La médecine par internet est un gros sujet.  Il y a beaucoup d'implications, ne serait-ce que la nécessaire prudence que le patient doit avoir quand il s'adresse à quelqu'un qui prétend être un médecin.  Il est évident que si une telle pratique devait se généraliser, beaucoup de gens ayant peu de scrupules se feraient passer pour ce qu'il ne sont pas.Personnellement je pense que la médecine sera fortement chamboulée par le net.  L'automédication va prendre énormément d'ampleur par exemple, surtout lorsque la médecine sera entièrement privatisée, ce qui amha est inévitable.Je pense qu'un médecin peut donner des conseils sur internet et se faire rémunérer pour cela, à condition paradoxalement qu'il ne prétende pas être médecin (parce qu'il ne peut de toute façon pas le prouver à distance).  Par conséquent chacun de ses conseils doit être accompagné de sources les plus complètes possibles afin que le patient puisse vérifier qu'il ne dit pas n'importe quoi.Plus que tout, je pense que la connaissance médicale doit faire l'objet d'une ouverture et d'un accès le plus libre possible.  J'invite donc les médecins à participer à la création de bases de données publiques (en commencant par rédiger des articles sur Wikipedia, mais j'imagine qu'il existe bien d'autres projets).Voilà, c'est mon opinion.  C'est un sujet intéressant qui mérite son propre fil si vous voulez en discuter en détail. A sub-forum "press" is a good idea indeed. Well, anyway he made me realize that anonimity is not a minor feature of bitcoin (and to me, bitcoin is much more anonymous than people say, but that is a whole different topic) I was quite positively surprised by RMS talking about bitcoin the way he did recently.He's basically pro-bitcoin, but not for the reasons most people are.  I personally didn't see anonymity as bitcoin's main feature.  RMS does, and I think he might be right.Apart from bitcoin, Internet paiements on internet rely heavily on strict user identification.  As a consequence, every thing you buy is known by someone, somewhere.  One doesn't have to be a conspiration theorist to understand that this is an unacceptable highway to an Orwellian society.Long lives RMS. I don't care at all if someone else does it.  Actually, that's part of the reason I posted it here.  If someone think such a site could be cool and actually implement it, that's all good!  I don't hav technical skills (especially in javascript) to do it myself anyway. If he earns a lot of money doing so, he would totally deserve it, since as you perfectly point it out, it is one thing to have an idea, it is an other to actually make it come true.  And I believe money should go to the person who makes it come true.Personnally, I would like such a website to exist.  Whether it is me or someone else who creates it doesn't matter.  I would benefit from it anyway, at least as a user.Also, it would not just about ideas, but also about people.   For instance, one could enter "Lady Gaga" or "Justin Bieber".  I believe it could be fun.PS: To tell the truth, I'd even prefer that someone else does it.  I am that lazy  This is an idea for a website whose purpose would be to promote and evaluate ideas from people all other the world.You have a great idea that you want to promote, you just enter it in a textfield on the website frontpage.Exemple:  your idea is "flat tax".  You just enter it.  You don't register, you don't login, your don't do anything except entering your idea.  If this idea is already in the database, then nothing more is done.On the front page, you can also search for ideas with keywords and you have a list of « popular » ideas.  You can vote for an idea with you CPU.  Using javascript crypto module such as the one used on bitaddress.org, visitors can chose whether an idea "rocks" or "sucks".So a visitor visitis the "flat tax" page.  There are two big buttons: « this rocks», «this sucks».  If he presses one of them, his computer starts hashing proofs of work and he gets a real time count of the amount of proof of work he's adding.  At anytime he can make it stop by pressing a « Ok, that's enough » button.By doing so, maybe we can get an idea of what people of the world really want.  It can also be a way to promote and diffuse neat ideas quickly.  Indeed I realized just after posting that you might actually be serious.  Well, why not.  I say go for it.But, you can not promote someone as a "spokerperson" only on his/her look.  At most, she can be sponsored so that she makes some advertisment, but in no way she could be described as a "spokerperson". Damnit I was silly enough to go check out the video and thus fell in this stupid trap. John matonis a écrit un article dans Forbes sur le sujet et utilise l'expression "brainwallet":http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/03/12/brainwallet-the-ultimate-in-mobile-money/ Nice, I don't know who exactly coind the term "brainwallet", but I like it  Kial ne, pli simple, "algoritma mono" ? Ne, gxi ne estas. The problem with these kinds of threads is that everybody forget they exist and where they are.I did make a comment in the main thread just because I couldn't help myself. I understand that it is pollution. So yeah, beat me. « Don't get me started on "money laundering." It's a completely artificial crime. It wasn't even heard of 20 years ago, because the "crime" didn't exist. Now, everyone speaks of it as though it were a real crime, like murder. It's ridiculous, and further proof of the totally degraded state of the average person worldwide, absolutely including US citizens  what we used to call Americans. The government proclaims something as a law, and "sheeple" robotically assume it's part of the cosmic firmament. If an official tells them to do or not to do something, they roll over on their backs like whipped dogs and wet themselves out of fear. The War on Drugs may be where "money laundering" originated as a crime, but today it has a lot more to do with something infinitely more important to the state: the War on Tax Evasion. »Oh their god, this is a marvelous quote! J'ajoute que si tu aimes IRC et que tu n'as rien contre quelques manip en ligne de commande avec GPG tu peux aller sur le canal #bitcoin-otc de freenode.  C'est un peu compliqué mais c'est du pur pair à pair. "Premier arrivé, premier servi" n'a effectivement rien d'absolu.  D'ailleursles vérités absolues, hein...Ensuite oui, le concept de propriété dépend du contexte et de l'observateur.  Mais il n'en reste pas moins que le "premier arrivé, premier servi" s'applique dans de nombreuses circonstances et dans de nombreuses cultures.  Il constitue souvent le meilleur compromis pour éviter la violence.Et, même si j'ai complètement perdu le fil de cette discussion, j'imagine que si je l'ai invoqué ici, c'est qu'il s'appliquait.  Et si vous êtes pas d'accord, commencez par proposer quelque chose de mieux.  Et je ne me concenterais pas d'un:  "on laisse d'abord l'Etat mettre la main sur tout, quitte à réquisitionner, et ensuite on le laisse faire la distribution de manière équalitaire".  Ça c'est le communisme et le communisme, non merci.
Bon et bien en fait il y existe une page javascript très simple pour créer des boites utilisateurs, du coup j'en ai fait une basique (sans logo graphique pour le bitcoin par contre).Code:{{Userbox | border-c=#999999 | border-s=1| id-c=#DDDDDD| id-s=12| id-fc=#000000| id-op=| info-c=#EEEEEE| info-s=8| info-fc=#000000| info-lh=1.2em| info-op=| id=BTC| info=This user exchanges money using [[Bitcoin]]}} +1Sérieusement vivement qu'ils le fassent, leur truc.  Qu'on ait la paix. I've learnt Perl recently, but I'm not sure that gets me out of the pattern you have in mind  Salut "ninja".   Pour acheter je te conseille #bitcoin-otc sur freenode.  Je ne l'ai pas utilisé depuis un bail, mais si ça n'a pas changé c'est très bien.  Sinon il y a toujours les sites d'échanges, et là il y a en pleins.  Je te laisse chercher car je ne veux pas en favoriser un plus qu'un autre. I wrote a Crypto module.  Only Sha256 and rmd160 so far.Sha256 seems to work fine but rmd160 returns wrong result FIXEDhttp://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/Crypto.pm6 Ok on va en rester là alors (je préfère ignorer le discours incongru plus haut).Tant que tu ne souhaites rien imposer à personne, ou interdire quoi que ce soit, tout va bien. Tout le monde paie pour obtenir la monnaie, pas seulement les "derniers".  La monnaie ne sert pas d'ailleurs à autre chose que ça justement: échanger la valeur.  Certes, certains paient moins que d'autres, parce qu'à certains moments la monnaie ou l'épargne est plus demandée qu'à d'autres.   Mais il n'y a pas de raisons à priori pour que les derniers paient plus cher que les premiers. C'est à ça que sert le concept de "prix", et en l'occurence ce prix peut monter ou diminuer, et donc il ne s'agit pas d'une cavalerie puisque les prix peuvent refluer ou stagner (comme c'est le cas pour le cours du bitcoin ces derniers temps).Le principe de symétrie est sinon facile, du moins possible à comprendre.   Par contre ce que je ne comprends pas c'est pourquoi diable il devrait s'appliquer aux sociétés humaines.   Est-ce qu'au nom de la symétrie temporelle je devrais donner une part de mes possessions à chaque nouveau-né dans le monde ?  Est-ce qu'on nom de la symétrie spatiale le pétrole devrait appartenir à tout le monde ??  On voit bien qu'appliquer tes principes de symétrie spatio-temporelle, ce n'est rien d'autre que nier le droit à la propriété privée (qui fait pourtant partie des droits de l'homme que tu aimes tant).Invoquer des théories scientifiques pour justifier un système social, ça donne en général les pires visions totalitaires.  La dernière en date a été l'invocation des théories évolutionnistes pour justifier l'eugénisme, par exemple.  Je suis désolé de te le dire, mais ta TRM et ses allusions à la relativité m'y font toujours irrémédiablement penser. J'ai récemment mis à jour mon profil sur Wikipedia (j'avoue que j'adore ce concept de boites utilisateurs):http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:GrondiluIl n'existe pas de boîte "Je crois en la liberté monétaire et j'utilise la cryptodevise bitcoin".  Ce serait bien si elle pouvait être crée, mais faut faire une demande et j'ai la flemme.Si quelqu'un est motivé... Well, I guess you're right.  I confess I had totally forgotten about the possibility to store data in the cloud when I made this post. Well, people can do both, you know.   Don't be so squared. Oui théoriquement le stockage offshore pourrait être une solution mais j'ai de gros doutes sur sa fiabilité.Par exemple quelqu'un qui aurait stocké ses backups chiffrés de wallet sur megaupload les a perdu après l'intervention du FBI.Si quelqu'un peut me citer une solution fiable de stockage de données en P2P qui fonctionne déjà je suis preneur.Personnellement j'ai de gros doutes sur la possibilité théorique d'un tel système.  Je ne vois pas ce qui pousserait une personne à stocker des données que je suis le seul à pouvoir exploiter. A terme, il faudra considérer que l'Etat pourra toujours vous forcer à dévoiler les données sur votre PC:http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57365004-501465/judge-americans-can-be-forced-to-decrypt-their-laptops/« Judge Robert Blackburn ordered a Peyton, Colo., woman to decrypt the hard drive of a Toshiba laptop computer no later than February 21--or face the consequences including contempt of court. »C'est la raison pour laquelle il est selon moi crucial de développer les techniques permettant de stocker son portefeuille dans son esprit.    Toutes les données sensibles ne devront passer par la machine que très temporairement (en gros le temps d'effectuer une transaction par exemple), et effacées aussitôt. Never been to Berlin.  Could be an opportunity  OMG the client displays Bernanke in ACII art! Definitely a big coolness factor PS.  It doesn't make much sense on an X application, though Ce fil n'est plus vraiment d'actualité car je ne crois pas que la méthode des mots clefs soit efficace ou fiable.  Pour mémoriser un portefeuille, je préfère la technique de la "maison aux deux étages", en conjonction avec la génération déterministe de clefs.Oui, utiliser un casacius coin ou un truc du genre c'est utile mais il y a toujours un support physique susceptible d'être volé/perdu/réquisitionné.A terme, utiliser uniquement sa mémoire me paraîtra préférable. Ben tu peux poster des trucs.  Et si t'as rien à dire, ben le fait d'être newbie ne devrait pas te déranger...  There are plenty of reasons why I don't use any social networks.  One of them is that their websites just suck.  When I tried to browse facebook with w3m once, I got a page saying something stupid such as:"Sorry, we are not cool enough to support your browser."Well I am sorry but implementing html standards so that a website is accessible with any browser, it is not being cool.  It is just being serious. I retract what I said about this thread being great. This is a great thread and I wish I had time to read it more thoroughly but I just would like to say a few things.First of all, bitcoin is not "the same all over again", at least because nobody forces you to use or accept it. In a world where bitcoin has become mainstream, if you are a merchand, you still can refuse bitcoins and accept only US dollars or whatever.Second, about the "Rotshield" metaphor. Well, as you said yourself, people are free to fork the chain anytime if they think the currency doesn't reach some kind social consensus and is used for so called oppression.Then, about the early adopters. Well, how should it have been done exactly? Once Satoshi started the chain, he immediately told everyone about his creation, so they can enter and help mining. Well, he told it to the maximum number of people he could, given his reputation at this time. Sure, had Satoshi been Steve Jobs, then the whole world would have known about this invention at the same time, and there would be no "early adopters" issue. But Satoshi had no big reputation so people had to slowly come into bitcoins, and there is nothing wrong with that. You can't force people to understand how great is an idea. If at some point in the future, when everbody on Earth knows about the bitcoin technology, some people decide to start it again from a fresh start (ie a new genesis), it would be perfectly fine (though I'd stick with the orginal chain but I'll gladly accept competition).  Merci pour l'info mais une source serait appréciable.En tout cas, continue à suivre et tiens nous au courant.
I'd like to help implementing Bitcoin in Perl6, one of the most awesome programming language of the future.Here is the beginning, the Base58 encoding:Code:#!/usr/local/bin/perl6module Bitcoin::Base58;my @b58 = <      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    A B C D E F G H   J K L M N   P Q R S T U V W X Y Z    a b c d e f g h i j k   m n o p q r s t u v w x y z>;my %b58 = @b58 Z ^58;our sub decode(Str $x) returns Int { $x ~~ /.$/ ?? %b58{$/} + 58*&?ROUTINE($/.prematch) !! 0 }our sub encode(Int $n) returns Str { $n < 58 ?? @b58[$n] !! &?ROUTINE($n div 58) ~ @b58[$n%58] }More will come. Un long article sur les monnaies complémentaires dans le numéro d'hiver d'un magazine que jusqu'alors personnellement je ne connaissais pas:  "uzbek et rika":Attention le bitcoin n'est mentionné qu'à minima, à la fin de la frise chronologique sur l'histoire des monnaies.Dedans il y a 10 "uzbeks", une monnaie complémentaire fondante crée par le magazine pour l'occasion.  Je vous vends les miens si vous voulez, faites une offre (en bitcoins bien sûr)   ça y'est, c'est arrivé hier soir dans une émission dont j'ai oublié le titre.Le thème était les monnaies complémentaires et alternatives, Stéphane Labordeétait invité et a été le premier à lacher le mot sur l'antenne, je crois.Par contre, ils prononcaient à l'anglaise, ce qui est ridicule amha.   Et biensûr, il n'ont pas manqué de qualifier bitcoin de système de Ponzi.Quoi qu'il en soit, la bonne réponse au sondage était donc "2012"   Bonne idée un fil sur les articles francophones.Sinon, sur l'article en question, il est pas mal mais y'a plusieurs points quim'ont fait tiquer. L'expression "devise universelle", notamment. Même si l'expression "universel" ne signifie pas forcément "acceptée par tous",c'est ce que beaucoup de lecteurs comprendront. Bitcoin ne sera trèscertainement jamais "universel": il est certes accepté partout, mais pas partous.Bitcoin est universel (ou plutôt "mondial") au sens géographique du terme, maispas au sens économique ou 'anthropologique', si j'ose dire. The scripting mecanism is now implemented.  It hasn't been tested much though.Also, a "master key" class has been created.  So it is possible to derive a key from an other one, using a 32 bytes string.Code:my $master_key = new Bitcoin::Key::Master;my $slave_key = $master_key << "some string identifying an account";Information is completely included in the secret exponent, in a reversible way (I used the master key as a symmetric encryption key to do so):Code:my $account_name = $master_key >> $slave_key;I must say I am a bit disappointed by the lack of interest in this project.  I know much people here only love python, but still... Money is a tool for cooperation.  If B can not buy anything to A then the money he owns worths nothing.  So there is no problem. That's a usefull and apparently accurate overview.  Should be in the Wiki if it's not already. If a jewish merchand has the right to refuse serving a customer for whatever reason, what's stopping a non-jewish merchand to serve jewish people?I believe any merchand should have the right to refuse to serve any client.  And if this allows racist behaviors and ostracism, so be it. Corporations don't steal my money. They do not put me in jail if I don't buy their products.Corrected. If I were you, I would worry about the quality of these schools, hopitals and roads if those are built by just printing money on pieces of paper.That's a huge "if".  The thing is that government is not wiser than free people.  Most of the time it just wastes the money into stupid things. This gave me a crazy idea recently.  I was planning on writing a CGI script so I can browse the block chain with my local thttpd web server (kind of a local bitcoinexplorer), and then I thought that it would be cool if I could do it all inside Vim, as I spend so much time inside this text editor anyway.  Vim has a help syntax with hyperlink-like capabilities.  I'm pretty sure it can be done.Also, Vim has support for both Perl and Python scripting, so if the thing works with one language, it should work with the other.PS.  By the way, the regex search should work now. Until I publish to CPAN, I set up a github repo:https://github.com/grondilu/libbitcoin-perlIt now ships a bitcoin block dumper !!To my amazement, it does actually fly pretty well:Code:# I want to check out the 100,000th block:use Bitcoin::Block;use Data::Dumper;print +Dumper new Bitcoin::Block 100_000; I finally managed to open the database using the BerkeleyDB module instead of DB_File.In short:Code:tie my %blkindex, 'BerkeleyDB::Btree',-Filename => 'blkindex.dat',-Subname => 'main',I still have to figure out the equivalent of the 'cursor.set_range("\x0ablockindex")' in Gavin's bitcointools, though. I can see in the bitcointools 's python code that database are DB_BTREE, so I tried:Code:use DB_File;my $db = tie my %h, 'DB_File', ".bitcoin/blockindex.dat", O_RDONLY, 0644, $DB_BTREE;END { undef $db, untie %h if defined $db }printf "%s: %d\n", $_, length($_) for keys %h;but this gives me only one line:main: 4What am I missing?  I can understand the the data is a bit serialized or something but I had expexted to have at least a bigger entry. Jewish people getting interested in bitcoins?   BUY BUY BUY   Ok, so multiplication it is.  I'll try to improve the friendlyness of my Perl library. Je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit beaucoup plus utile qu'un bout de papier ou qu'un bitbill de Cacascius.Sinon l'idéal serait d'implémenter tout ça sur une carte à puce.  Une carte à puce de nos jours c'est un véritable micro-ordinateur auquel on peut faire faire des tas de choses.Et puis une carte à puce peut être masquée en un truc plus anodin comme une carte téléphonique. Ok I confess I don't know about that.  I'll check it out. (I have few possibilities to read the bitcoin forum so maybe somebody has already thought of this and I apologize if it is the case.  If not, please feel free to continue reading   )As you know Satoshi imagined a solution to offer some protection against moral risk in transactions.  It basically consists in special transactions whose outputs are reedemable not with one private key, but with two.  Thus it is possible for Alice to send some bitcoins to Bob so that Alice will never be able to get her bitcoins back, but Bob will not be able to get them either unless Alice finaly agrees.I believe it is the best we can do against these kinds of risks, without using a third party.However, it is kind of low-level since it relies on a specific feature of the bitcoin protocol.  I have no idea about how to actually do it, for instance.I think it is possible to do exactly this with a higher level method.So, let's assume Alice wants to sell Bob 10 BTC against 30 USD via bank wire.  Alice and Bob do not trust each other so none of them is willing to pay first.Here is the idea.Both Alice and Bob generate a new random bitcoin address on their computer.  Those keys are basically secret exponants in the secp256k1 elliptic curve.  They also compute the corresponding public points, which are two 256 bits numbers.Alice:Code:my $key = new Bitcoin::PrivateKey label => "10BTC for Bob";my $point = $key->public_point;Bob:Code:my $key = new Bitcoin::PrivateKey label => "10BTC expected from Alice";my $point = $key->public_point;They both exchange their public points, on IRC for instance:Alice>  Ok Bob, here is my public point:  435ab6e5......5f54,  b87f566......90cdBob>  Ok, here's mine :  123fe.....32a,   32aa54....cc54Now they compute the sum of these points, and get the corresponding bitcoin addressAlice:Code:my $pointsum = EC::add $point, $bobpoint;print new Bitcoin::Address $pointsum;Bob:Code:my $pointsum = EC::add $point, $alicepoint;print new Bitcoin::Address $pointsum;They check they get the same bitcoin address, and then Alice sends 10 BTC to this address.At this point, none of them is capable of reedeming those 10BTC, but obviously they can check that they are in the blockchain with bitcoinexplorer or something.Once Bob aknowledges that the bitcoins are buried enough in the blockchain, he can initiate the 30USD bank wire.Two or three days later, Alice aknowledges that she received the 30USD.  Now she communicates the secret exponant she generated.Bob now knows both secret exponents.  Thus he can compute the secret exponant of the exchange key:Code:my $exchange_key = new Bitcoin::PrivateKey +($key + $alice_key) % secp256k1->{generator}{order};With this key, Bob can redeem the 10BTC.Had Alice refused to reveal the private key, Bob would have been screwed, but Alice would not get any real benefit for that, as the 10BTC would be lost in the blockchain for ever.Am I wrong somewhere? 
You guys should certainly stop doing that.  Harceling people about bitcoingives the worst possible image of the community.Bitcoin doesn't need such methods to succeed. Parce qu'un gestionnaire de mots de passe, ça se confisque. Bigre, ça n'a pas l'air de passionner grand monde, mon histoire.   Bon tant pis. J'ai fini par mémoriser une de mes clefs privées, après avoir abandonné l'idéed'utiliser le hash d'une phrase faite de toute pièce (méthode utilisée parCacascius), ou d'avoir recours à une liste de mots (méthode du clientElectrum):  dans un cas je trouvais l'entropie de la clef trop faible, et dansl'autre je ne trouvais aucun choix convenable de liste de mots.Je me suis donc attaqué directement au format WIF d'une clef généréaléatoirement, du genre:5JfTp8uzBFzcJWhjrb7wJfevehwjT6c3WCBcYivpoRcjaSAgHtZLe point principal de la méthode que j'ai retenue consiste à imaginer unemaison à deux étages: rez-de-chaussée et premier étage, ou bien cave etgrenier.  Disons cave et grenier pour fixer les idées.L'idée consiste à placer des objets hétéroclites au grenier pour les lettres enmajuscules, et à la cave pour les lettres en minuscule.  Les chiffres sontutilisés pour quantifier les choses quand c'est possible.  On se fait ensuiteune petite histoire un peu absurde ou rigolote pour mélanger tout ça.Quand il y a des acronymes visibles ou des mots faciles à retenir, il faut biensûr les utiliser.  Ainsi dans l'exemple plus haut il y a le mot "feve" quiapparait donc il faut s'imaginer à la cave en train de manger une fève.Au fur et à mesure qu'on alterne majuscules et minuscules, on va monter etdescendre et ces allers retours constitueront un parcours qui servira selon unprincipe comparable à celui de laméthode des loci.C'est pas évident, faut faire preuve d'imagination et de patience pour trouverles bons mots et concepts, mais je crois que c'est faisable.Dans l'exemple plus haut, on commence avec 5JfT.  C'est d'emblée pas facile caron change deux fois d'étage.  On peut par exemple commencer par 5Jours d'attente à ne rien faire au grenier, puis descendre à la cavepour aller chercher le financial Times et le lire une fois revenuau grenier.  Ici le f de fT est minuscule car je prends l'objet à la cave et jele consomme au grenier, d'où la casse mixte.  Si vous trouvez ça tropalambiqué, allez juste à la cave pour mettre une pizza au four etrevenez au grenier pour boire un Thé .Ensuite je redescends à la cave, où je constate que l'éclairage est enpanne.  Heureusement je parviens à changer 8 fuzibles etje rétablis la lumière.  Je retourne au grenier, satisfait du travailBien Fait.  Ensuite quand je redescends, je constate que lapizza est cuite.Et caetera, etc...Je pense que c'est faisable, mais c'est à tester sur le long terme.   J'aimaintenant en tête une histoire un peu abracadabrante mais qui frappel'imagination et devrait donc rester gravée dans mon esprit.  Je vais me larépéter mentalement de temps en temps (genre, quand j'ai rien d'autre à faire,en prenant le métro ou des trucs du genre). That would be awesome. Indeed.  I worry about that as well but I'm not sure we have more guaranties with the contemporary poetry. Tandis que je développais ma librairie bitcoin pour Perl, j'ai eu l'idée d'utiliser /usr/share/dict/words  pour mémoriser une clef privée (à la manière de ce qui est fait avec le client Electrum)ça réduit le nombre de mots à huit pour une clef de 128 bits (valeur par défaut, modifiable avec la variable $Bitcoin::PrivateKey::entropy)exemple:Code:use Bitcoin::PrivateKey;my $key = new Bitcoin::PrivateKey;say join ' ', $key->mnemonic;affichera par exemple:grimage recommander nymphes empêcheriez payement âcreté excusées exemptaisJe trouve ça plutôt cool.Atention les verbes sont conjugués et les mots peuvent être au pluriel muet.  Il faut donc ajouter mentalement les pronoms ou les articles.  Par exemple dans l'exemple plus haut il faut lire:le grimagerecommanderles nymphesvous empêcheriezpayementl'âcretéelles sont excuséeshier, j'exemptais.Mais dans l'absolu ça n'est même pas nécessaire, vous pouvez facilement écrire un programme qui essaie toutes les combinaisons quand il y a ambiguité.L'idéal étant de se faire une petite histoire avec ces mots.Théoriquement il est possible de réduire encore le nombre de mots en diminuant l'entropie, mais dans ce cas il faut augmenter le nombre d'itérations de sha256.  C'est fait par défaut mais vous pouvez hériter de la classe pour faire votre propre cuisine.  .La sécurité d'une clef dépend à la fois de sa taille et de ce nombre d'itérations.  Une clef très courte devrait comporter un grand nombre d'itérations et devrait donc prendre beaucoup de temps à générer (plusieurs jours par exemple).  Un compromis est à trouver.  A vous de voir. Well, 2000 is an easier number to remember and that's the number of words in the wikitionary page anyway.   Other wise you have to remember that 1626 is the lowest number n such as n**3 > 256**4 or something.  That's a bit odd.But that doesn't change the final number of words in the mnemonic anyway, so I guess it does not matter much.However, I recently thought about using /usr/share/dict/words, which is -at least in french-, about 136,000 words long.  This reduces the number of final words to height (for a 128 bit keys), which might be a significative improvment. Ahh I had the http and git address mixed up.  Silly of me.Works fine now.  Thanks. So true. This is by far the longest last word I've ever seen. I think the mnemonic algorithm is kind of weird (using quartets of bytes??)I suggest we use the full 2000 english words list with a complete base2000 encoding:Code:def mn_encode( number ):    return [words[number],] if number < n else [words[number%n],] + mn_encode( number/n + number%n )def mn_decode( wlist ):    r = words.index(wlist[0])    return r + n*(mn_decode(wlist[1:]) - r ) if len(wlist[1:])>0 else rWell, the good thing is that anyone can do his own recipe with his client, asthe server is not supposed to be aware of the particular encoding, right? Can you remind us the git repo please?  I tried https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/subvertx with no success  Yeah I will eventually but I don't know CPAN much and I don't have a regular internet access so it might take some time. Pendant que je traduisais le client en Perl, j'ai été amené à écrire une librairie bitcoin qui me parait plutôt cool je trouve.Le fil en anglais:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=54997.0 I know you guys you all like Python and do plenty of bitcoin-related stuff in this language and that's cool.But for people like me who are much more script lovers, a complete Perl bitcoin library would be great.So, while I was translating ThomasV's Electrum client, I happened to had written such a library. I think it is already awesome, so I think it worth publishing it.You can see the main POD in html here.The tgz is thereIn a nutshell, you can do stuffs such as:Code:use Bitcoin qw(BTC);printf "you owe me %d%s.\n", 10, BTC;use Bitcoin::Address;my $addr = new Bitcoin::Address '1DxH3bjYeCKbSKvVEsXQUBjsTcxagmWjHy'; # this does checksum verifuse Bitcoin::PrivateKey;my $key = new Bitcoin::PrivateKey; # generates a random private keyprint $key->address; # prints the corresponding bitcoin address Exactly. I had trouble phrasing it correctly but you nailed it. Well, Terabytes of data are exchanged every day in P2P file exchange systems,and yet I have never heard of any donation campaign for them.First, I want to say that I love Wikipedia. I contribute on the french site, I donated about 10EUR few years ago as I think it is the best thing that came up from Internet.However, I will NEVER ever donate anything again. Because there are two many things I don't like with this project. For instance, there are several Wikipedia editing rules I just don't agree with. That's one problem with centralization: you must agree with the whole package or go away. If you don't agree with one part, you can't use the whole thing.I also don't consider storing pictures to be important for an encyclopedy. And yet I assume this is one of the big cost for wikimedia. So I may accept to donate to "wikipedia", but certainly not to "wikimedia". Unfortunately, the wikipedia project is not separable from the wikimedia project.What is wrong with diversity??? There is no reason why there should be a *single* encyclopedic wiki. An encyclopedy could have a "editorial line". There would be nothing wrong with that. On the contrary.In Eric Raymond's metaphor, Wikipedia moves much more toward a "Cathedral" than a "Bazaar". And that's the main thing I don't like with this project.Yeah that why I think we should not fund old technologies with charity, so that people can have an incentive to imagine better technology.reliable:   okusable:      okcoherent:   oksingle:      WTF?Wait a bit. Some people will create a decentralized collaborative encyclopedy. But it sure won't help if people continue to support and fund wikimedia. Why do they need money in the first place?I mean, it seems to me that they don't do any effort to decentralize the whole thing, so that computing and storage essources would be provided by users.Somehow, I think it might be a good thing if the Wikimedia fundation could go bankroute. After all, the encyclopedy would not vanish. It's free so anyone could save it by just downloading it (I have a copy on my laptop with a CGI script to consult it and it works fine).Once Wikimedia goes down, it would be a big incentive for other organizations to continue the project with other, fresh ideas. Je crois qu'un minimum de posts a été exigé avant de pouvoir poster sur d'autres forums que ceux consacrés aux newbies.
As I am translating the client, I have a few comments/suggestions:- Shouldn't the wallet store its own version number? Otherwise we'll need to  guess it when we recover an old wallet.- It would be nice if a standard data format such as JSON was used to  communicate with the server- The 'for_change' thing in 'create_new_address' is a bit odd. I suggest  considering the created address to be 'for change' when no password is  provided.- In the wallet, addresses should be stored in a dictionnary, not an array.  Pretty much everything should be stored in a dictionnary anyway. We don't  need sequential access, except maybe for the change_addresses index.- There is way too many Object Orientation in the code, imho. Objects are  useful when instanciation is needed. Otherwise packages or modules are just  fine.Other ideas I may forget may be seen in my repo:http://github.com/grondilu/Perlectrum in Bitcoin/Electrum/Client.pm Bonjour et bienvenu.Pour comprendre comment fonctionne bitcoin, amha le mieux est encore et toujours de lire et relire le papier de Satoshi en personne:  http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf The more I think about it, the more I think this stuff is really good.  For at least two reasons:1.  It separates the client code from the server code, making two clearly distinct applications.  What is good about this is that it gives much less possibility for a troyan to be harmful in the server code.2.  This idea of generating keys deterministically from a seed that can be memorized is just a great idea.  The official bitcoin client should propose something like this as an option.I'd like to nominate ThomasV for a Satoshi award or something Anyway, I have a question.I don't quite understand this random number generation algorithm (the "randrange_from_seed_trytryagain").  It seems overly complicated to me.If I must pick a random number from 0 to n, where n < 2**256, I would just do this:x = randrange(0, 256)for i in range(32 + 4):     x = 256*x + rand(0, 256)return x % nMaybe there is something I miss mathematically here, but basically why can't I pick a number from 0 to p where p is fairly larger than 2**256 (say, 256**4 times), and then take the remainder modulo n? Damn, developping a client in Perl is much more difficult than I thought, but I really want to do it as I am not comfortable with python code.I had made a mistake creating the repo (I wrote Perlelectrum for the name instead of Perlectrum).It's now corrected (I guess):      http://github.com/grondilu/PerlectrumAny other Perl adepts here?  If so, please help. Well, the public key is used to make the hash, which is encoded in Base58 to make the address, so in a sense the public key serves as an address.  When the guy says "the public key serves as an address", it does not necessarly mean litterraly. Il existe un montant minimal pour les transactions, et ce afin de résister à une attaque par inondation du réseau.  Il n'y a pas si longtemps cette limite était fixée à 0.01.Il n'y a pas de "tarif" des frais de transactions.  Les frais sont entièrement déterminés par ce qu'exigent les mineurs.En pratique, il y aura toujours des mineurs qui acceptent de traiter les transactions gratuitement (puisqu'ils empochent de toute façon toujours la génération).  Mais ça prend forcément plus de temps.Si tu veux "tester" bitcoin, le mieux c'est d'utiliser le réseau de test, s'il est encore en service (je suppose que oui). Je le sens bien ce projet:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50936.0Pour moi c'est idéal vu que je n'ai pas de connexion régulière au net.Mais même dans un ordre général je trouve que c'est une bonne idée de séparer d'une part la gestion du portefeuille de clef et la signature des transaction, et d'autre part la gestion du nud du réseau (traitement des blocs).Un projet à suivre attentivement amha. Well, I must say I feel quite enthusiast about this project, so I put an ad about it in my signature. There is something weird in the create_new_address function:Code:# strenghteningfor i in range(100000):  oldseed = seed  seed = hashlib.sha512(seed + oldseed).digest()Is it me or this code is just the same as:Code:# strenghteningfor i in range(100000):  seed = hashlib.sha512(seed * 2).digest()?Also, I'm not sure I see what is the point of this :-|PS.  I set up a github repo to work on my Perl client:http://github.com/grondilu/Perlectrum This is very obvious but it doesn't hurt to be said.I personnaly think this client is great for people like me who don't have a regular internet access. I see in the client source code that the ast module is used along with the 'repr' builtin are used in order to serialize/deserialize data in the Wallet.It seems kind of ugly to me.  What about using the fairly simple and standard 'shelve' module?I tried to write a version:http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/electrum-with-shelve.pyThis is a great project and I'll try to help developing it.  I'll also try to write a client in Perl.I've noticed that the 'create' command does not work.  Also, I wonder if someone is running the server on the bitcoin test network. My apologies when I red the README I saw the easy_install command and I had no idea what this thing was.  It appears that it is actually installed on debian.  So everything is fine.Thanks for this tool that seems to be exactly what I had been waiting for for quite some time. Sorry for whining but...this really seems to be great but I'm too lazy to read this all thread and I want more infos about how to install this on debian. A nice howto would be appreciated.  On the main page I read:Code:sudo easy_install ecdsasudo easy_install pycryptogit clone git://gitorious.org/electrum/electrum.gitpython ./electrum/client/electrum.pyOn debian I see a python-pycryptopp package that should do the job for pycrypto I guess.But what is the equivalent of ecdsa on debian? I had no idea that any random number up to 2^256 could be used as a private key.  I guess I should learn more about ECDSA.  This looks awesome.The bitcoin forum has become so huge that it gets difficult to learn about cool stuffs.  Thanks. seems pretty cool Code:This could be in technical, but it does have a "psychological" aspect too so I put it in the general discussion forum.I have written a set of bash functions to handle bitcoin addresses:  https://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools.   I added a few functions to turn a private key into a bunch of english words, inspired from RFC-1751.My aim with this is to help people memorizing at least one bitcoin private key.  Such a key could be used in case the FBI threatens to seize your computer, if you want an extremely low tech solution to hoard bitcoins, if you don't trust any physical support, or whatever ...I have no idea if it is easy or even possible to memorize 27 english words but I guess it should if one uses a method such as the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci]loci method[/url]Here is an example of a generated address.  You'll recognize the public key, the private key in WIF format, the 27 english words and the key in openssl's PEM format.[code]1ArPXGu8H3PhKduTamJ5Dj5uPtdpubFuaA, 5JUL6oXMMrgo4MC31oWySDpdH65qLuSNaCdV97i3DekWPyRrJtUTHE BLOT SET TWIT BARE LEER WAGE LILT LIND CORK GOAL OFT REAR VOTE FLEWWAD KEYS GAVE SEES WAGE EAR YOGA VAST POT BIRD FAKE BEE-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----BgUrgQQACg==-----END EC PARAMETERS----------BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----MHQCAQEEIFZh3PHqWrJ6+vNfmtRtLtmz1kFEP0yihsf14g//ecNMoAcGBSuBBAAKoUQDQgAEmblPqTIy9lhU5U/UW97j/FLFYra5VSol4AX1avdVitR5n6pxcvyAB4BX/HjeTsZZdxBK127h9zVk0N4Df9dxzw==-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----Notice that, conveniently enough, the leading 5 in the WIF format makes the sentence often start with 'THE'.If you have other ideas about how to memorize a private key, please share.[/code] Sincères condoléances.   Cool, n'hésite pas à nous faire part d'une éventuelle offre d'hébergement payable en bitcoins.Et sinon, bienvenue.

Bah, au fond t'as raison.  J'étais un peu de mauvaise humeur quand j'ai écris mon post.N'empêche que j'ai pas trop l'impression que la libéralisation des systèmes financiers et monétaire fasse partie de leurs revendications.  Mais je veux bien leur accorder le bénéfice du doute. On n'a pas à "éveiller" les gens.  Il faut se sortir de l'idée de "convaincre" autrui, et a forciori convaincre les dirigeants politiques.   Tu parles de courage, mais pour moi celui qui espère mobiliser derrière lui des millions de personnes avant de faire quelque chose est plutôt un lâche car il n'ose pas faire les choses lui-même.   C'est un instinct grégaire assez lamentable amha.Y'a des tas de gens qui considèrent que le système monétaire actuel est satisfaisant.  Qu'à cela ne tienne!  Qu'ils l'utilisent.   Il est illusoire et dangereux de vouloir regrouper toute une population derrière une seule doctrine.   Vive la diversité et le choix.En matière monétaire, l'or, et maintenant les cryptodevises, existent.  Moi quand j'achète un truc dans un magasin je paie en euros et ça ne me pose aucun problème, car c'est la monnaie que le marchand demande.  C'est son choix et si je ne suis pas content je ne suis pas obligé d'acheter.  Tout ce que j'ai à faire pour exprimer mon aversion envers cette monnaie, c'est de ne pas en stocker à long terme. Bienvenue à CleverMiner et Math47,le forum n'est pas très actif ces derniers temps mais ça ne doit pas vous dissuader de poster.   Je suis sûr que des tas de gens surveille ce forum de temps en temps et seront ravis de participer à un débat enflammé  I think this guy could be white-listed  This looks awesome.  Is it possible to connect to another host, so that we can make a transaction without having bitcoin actually running nor installed on localhost?This would be great, as it would be the cheapest (and possibly the safest) to use bitcoin.I also think this should be related to the Bitcoin Off-The-Grid project. Some interesting developments of this thread can be found on this one. There is indeed a problem when the key is below 8^31. Notice that in even more rare cases, it can also be below 2^30, 2^29, etc... Also, as you mentioned earlier, the key could have 33 bytes when the last byte is above 0x80. It is quite a pain in the ass to deal with thoses cases and ensure that the key is 32 bytes long. Trial and error in bitlotto's code works, but it's kind of ugly.I think a solution would be to use an arithmetic sum:  V*2^256 + K, where V is the version number and K is the private key.Anyway, I rewrote my set of functions. I tried to suppress any unecessary dependancies (no more xxl, nor tac.) I use Perl to do binary packing, as Perl is installed on most unix plateform.Here they are:Code:#!/bin/bash# Satoshi Nakamoto's Base58 encoding## requires dc, the unix desktop calculator (which should be included in the# 'bc' package)declare -a base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})unset dcr; for i in {0..57}; do dcr+="${i}s${base58[i]}"; done   # dc registersdecodeBase58() {  dc -e "$dcr 16o0$(sed 's/./ 58*l&+/g' <<<$1)p" |  while read l; do echo -n "$l"; done}encodeBase58() {  dc -e "16i ${1^^} [3A ~r d0<x]dsxx +f" |  while read n; do echo -n "${base58[n]}"; done}checksum() {  perl -we "print pack 'H*', '$1'" |  openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |  openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |  perl -we "print unpack 'H8', join '', <>"}checkBitcoinAddress() {  if [[ "$1" =~ ^[$(IFS= ; echo "${base58[*]}")]+$ ]]  then # a bitcoin address should be 25 bytes long: # - 20 bytes for the hash160 (16/8 = 2, right?); # - 1 byte for the version number; # - 4 bytes for the checksum. # shorter addresses can only occur with standard 00 version number # and should be zero padded # Of course, in hex you must mutiply these numbers by 2 # to get the number of nybbles (hex digits) h="$(printf "%50s" $(decodeBase58 "$1")| sed 's/ /0/g')"    checksum "${h::${#h}-8}" |    grep -qi "^${h: -8}$"  else return 2  fi}hash160() {  openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |  openssl dgst -rmd160 -binary |  perl -we "print unpack 'H*', <>"}hashToAddress() {  local version="${2:-00}" size="${3:-160}"  local x="$(dc -e "${size}ss 16dio 2 ls^ ${version^^}* ${1^^}+p")"  printf "%34s\n" "$(encodeBase58 "$x$(checksum "$x")")" |  sed -r "s/ +/1/"}publicKeyToAddress() {  hashToAddress "$(  openssl ec -pubin -pubout -outform DER 2>&- |  tail -c 65 |  hash160  )" "${1:-00}"}privateKeyToWIF() {  hashToAddress "$(  openssl ec -text -noout 2>&- |  sed -n '3,5s/[: ]//gp' |  while read l; do echo -n "$l"; done  )" 80 256}WIFtoDER() {  printf "%64s\n" "$(dc -e "16dio $(decodeBase58 $1) 100 4^ / 80 100 20^*-p")" |  sed 's/ /0/g'}vanityAddress() {  local addr priv  while ! grep -qi "${1:-1}" <<< "$addr"  do priv="$(openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 2>&-)" addr="$(openssl ec -pubout 2>&- <<<"$priv" | publicKeyToAddress)" WIF="$(privateKeyToWIF <<<"$priv")"  done  echo "$addr, $WIF"  echo "$priv"}PS. I forgot to mention that if you want to use some random typed data to seed the random number generator,you can do something like:Code:read -p 'Type in some random characters:' randomopenssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 -rand <(echo $random) Damned it, information about all this stuff seem quite dispatched every here and there.I'd be interested in learning more about Casascius's formats (called "mini private key"  I think) and the "wallet import format".Any entry in the wiki?  I can't contribute personnaly these days, but I'd be very happy if someone could centralize intel about those formats. i have difficulties following this overlong thread but I'd like to respond to this quickly.in France a new method called 'méthode globale' has been introduced recently to teach children how to read.  It basically consisted in NOT teaching kids the alphabet.  Instead, kids were taught to recognized small words directly, as if they were ideograms.  It seemed to helped a few children who had reading difficultes with the classical abc method.   But once this method was generalized, in the long run it appeared to be a freaking disaster.  Many kids were simply unable to read or write correctly once they entered higher schools, and some studies showed that the global method was responsible.I personnaly think there is no surprise if the State is a poor educator.  To teach kids, it spends money in the worst possible way, according to Friedman: This is a terrible assertion.  You seem to be advocating for equality at the cost of uniformity, which terribly reminds me of "The brave new world".  You are basically saying that parents should not have the right to make decisions regarding the education of their offspring, otherwise some children might be disavantaged in the future.  You might as well assume that parenthood should be outlawed and that children should be raised like orphans, in public institutions, by State employed surrogate mothers.An other reason why this is wrong is that nobody knows what is the best education for children, if such a thing exists.  And if it does exists, I very much doubt that public centralization of decision regarding pedagogic methods is the best way to find out what it is.  Giving the responsability of educating millions of children to a few technocrats is a total madness, imho.It is crazy to advocate for the same education to hundreds of millions of children, just in order to prevent a small percentage of them from not having some. There is nothing wrong with a monopoly as long as it emerges from free market.  A coercive monopoly is not compatible with liberalism.I don't know about the 19th century, but it seems to me that your country has developped quite a lot during this period. Because between competing companies there is an equilibrium of forces, and the less greedy finally gets the more customers.I want to exploit a poor worker by giving him one penny to build a thing that I'll sell one dollar.  Now, comes an other ugly capitalist pig who talks to my worker and offers him two pennies.  My worker resigns and work for my competitor.  Then an other guy offers three pennies, and so on.Yes, I am.  Please spare me your french bashing. Capitalism is the private ownership of means of production.  Period.  There is nothing in such a definition about elected morons spoiling other people's property or rich people corrupting those elected morons.  Or other stuffs like that.The corrupted capitalism you seem to dislike is much more a problem with democracy than with capitalism. Not everything we know about capitalism is wrong.  Some aspects of it are, but not all of them.Everything I use every day comes from capitalism.  From the food I eat to the computer I use to type this message.  I also own company shares whose dividends pay most of my bills.  Whithout capitalism I'd be totally helpless, poor and ignorant.   That's pretty much why I have "faith" in it, to answer your question. I am not a cynical person.  But I am lucid enough to aknowledge the existence of poverty in this world, and still being able to sleep well.And anyway, I believe economic freedom is the best way to reduce poverty.  Communism or socialism just spreads it. Hum... lots of anger in your speech.  And you say WE are sociopaths??Except that I'll still have to pay for public schools via taxation.  I guess I'll be OK to do that, providing that public shchools are reserved to poor people, so they don't cost too much for the tax payer. An other thing:  if public education aims at providing education to the poor, why on earth is it proposed to everybody???Does the State assume that every one is a poor thing that must be taken care of? And just how does that not prove my point?  As mentionned above, it's easy to find good peoplewilling to give free education.  Basically YOU guys.Also, if I'm wrong and that nobody's willing to do it, so be it.  Poor people will have to pay,just as they have to pay to eat, get dressed and find shelter.Being poor means there are things you can't afford. By definition.  Libertarianism does nothave any pretention to eradicate poverty.  It might claim it's the best way to reduce it, but that's all. "getting us to the Moon".   You're a member of the Apolo expedition?? Plue, mi timas ke multaj esperantistoj estas tro 'maldekstraj' por shati la ideon de bitcoin (aux bitmono, mi ne estas certe pri kiel nomi gxin).
Pitoyable:http://fr.canoe.ca/infos/regional/archives/2011/10/20111020-173600.htmlCes gars là sont vraiment des charlots.Transcription:MONTRÉAL - Les rumeurs de voies de fait, dagression sexuelle, de vandalisme et de consommation de drogue préoccupent de plus en plus les organisateurs du mouvement Occupons Montréal, car la violence a fait son entrée dans le camp du square Victoria.Jeudi matin, quelques «indignés» levés tôt partageaient leurs inquiétudes quant à la sécurité du site après cinq jours doccupation.La nuit précédente, une jeune femme aurait «presque été agressée sexuellement» ou «attouchée», selon les témoignages récoltés, information qui na toutefois pas été possible de vérifier auprès des policiers. Le fautif aurait été arrêté.«On a des problèmes parce que des gens ne savent pas se contrôler, sinquiétait une occupante en colère. Nous ne sommes pas ici pour faire la fête. Il y en a qui viennent ici pour faire le party et non pour faire avancer les choses.»Les sans-abri pointés du doigtLes sans-abri seraient pointés du doigt dans plusieurs événements violents survenus ces derniers jours.«Ça devient difficile de gérer les gens qui nont pas rapport dans loccupation», concède un manifestant.Harcèlement, comportement déplacé ou menaçant, hurlements sur le trottoir en pleine nuit, les problèmes saccumulent.«Un gars est entré dans sa tente et il y avait deux itinérants dedans. Il leur a dit de sen aller, mais ils lui ont donné deux coups de poing dans le visage», a raconté un «indigné».La drogue pose aussi problème. Les occupants du square ont voté une motion de non-consommation dalcool et de drogue cette semaine, mais quelques-uns en font fi.«Les vrais changements viennent quand on est lucide», a lancé un occupant au milieu dune discussion, en faveur du règlement sur la sobriété.Création dun «Service dordre»Parmi les solutions, les uns proposent la création dun «Service dordre», une sorte de police interne qui aurait le mandat de surveiller ce qui se passe.Plutôt froid à lidée dune telle autorité, dautres proposent tout simplement que chacun se responsabilise soi-même. Une autre personne a proposé quant à elle de dresser une liste des travailleurs sociaux disponibles afin de contrôler les cas problématiques.Un autre a carrément proposé de fermer le campement sous prétexte quil devenait hors de contrôle. P2P is peer-to-peer or people to people if you want.  So in a P2P exchange, there is no compensation, escrow or stuff like that.   If you want to sell 1 BTC for 3USD, you find a buyer, you send him the bitcoins, and he sends you the 3USD directly (cash in the mail, wire transfer, whatever...)It's not as convenient, nor as reassuring as a centralized exchange, but at least it is 100% legal/bureaucrat free. +1In France there has been a study recently, about the amount of tax money used to pay people in charge of organizing distribution of public help to homeless people.  Once we divided the total amount by the number of those homeless people, it was almost enough to pay them an hotel room.  Every night. Nobody forces you to follow them to the bottom.  You don't have to get in a plane if you think it is not safe.On the contrary, you must pay for public education via taxation, even if you think public schools are mass indoctrination camps or just places where you put your kids to be watched for, during your working day.Well, this is very much an assertion with no proof whatsoever.  The opposite could sound just as true.Not so much.  Consider this internet dialog.  It's not just a fight to get the opposite camp rally the other's side.   It is also, whether it is conscious or unconscious, a way for us to try to "educate" other people and bring them to a more reasonable point of view.   And we do that for free.  So I think there is a big tendency in human nature to share knowledge amongst one another.  I like to see things this way anyway.   Consider also projects such as wikipedia.I sincerely believe that in a free and globally wealthy society, most of the education system would be voluntary based, and free as in 'free beer'.But call that wishfull thinking if you want.  I'm OK with that.  At least you'd have proven that libertarians are not as cynical as you seem to think so. I don't see why poor people could not afford some education.  Surely not as good an education as the one a child of a rich family could afford, but still they could get some.  And they would certainly be some good people who would be happy to provide free education, just by generosity. Sure, but this is even more a reason to privatize education.   If you accept that private companies are in charge of your safety in a plane, why wouldn't you accept that private companies are in charge of your education?A bad education is a terrible thing in life, but unlike flight transportation, it won't kill you.   Also, as you said yourself, most libertarians are poorly educated.  So I guess they are a living proof that public education is terrible anyway.    I don't see why private education could not do better. Public education is not just regulated, it is organized and founded with taxation.The regulated industries you are talking about are NOT publicly founded.  Most of them are privately owned.  They offer a service and customers pay for it.   At most, State intervenes to impose some safety and quality standards.   Why should it be different with education ??!!!   Moreover, I don't see why we need state to organize a regulation system.  This could be done by a private company.  Or better:  by several, competing regulation companies.   IEEE, for instance, was initiated by a pool of engineers working in the electronics sector.  I don't think they were State employees. Please tell us why exactly.   Education is important, sure, but I don't see why it means that it should be publicly founded.   Being able to eat is important just as well, and yet nobody would seriously consider to socialize all the food industry. I'm afraid this does make sense indeed.  The bitcoin network can be considered as a distributed accounting system, and there is no transfer through any "single entity".  But with currency exchanges there is a conventional currency part, which is half of each transaction.  And MtGox does maintain a centralised balance/accounting database at least for those conventional currencies.  Therefore, they do act as bank and/or financial institutions.If a currency exchange wants to bypass financial regulations, they need to get rid of all the part where they hold currency amounts before they are actually exchanged.  In other words, each transaction should be done using a direct wire transfer between parties.  There are a few websites that propose such a service I believe.  It is, anyway, a very different business model from what MtGox is.Anyway I think we must focus on using decentralized exchanges such as bitcoin-otc or stuffs like that.This is just my humble opinion. Bitcoin is only a currency according to the bitcoin community, but not according to french law.  Now, the bitcoin community does not create law, does it?   So to me it's clear. Je pense qu'on aura l'occasion de se voir à l'audience de Créteil le 18.  Personnellement j'y serai très probablement.  On pourra boire un verre à la sortie ou un truc du genre. Ben ça fait déjà un bon écrémage parce que je ne vois pas l'intérêt pour une cryptodevise d'être hostile aux GPU.J'ai rien contre les cryptodevises alternatives, mais bitcoin pour l'instant n'est pas suffisamment imparfait pour me donner l'envie de fouiner dans les fils sur le sujet. Moi je veux bien mais je ne connais aucune des monnaies dont tu me parles.Un bref topo sur ce fil pourrait me motiver à m'y intéresser. A dividend of 0.07 will be detached soon. Is it me or they keep postponing any decision?  Personally I think occupying Wall Street is silly.  It's useless to shout like this.  If you're not happy with the US currency or the banking system, just buy gold, silver or bitcoins.  It's less noisy, but much more efficient imho. Just letting you know that I'm working hard on this.  There is still a lot to do but a few hard things have been done now, including the event creation process (signing/verification and stuffs like that) and the current website gives a better idea of how it will work out once it's functional.I could use some encouragements.  So please feel free to express your interest in this project if you want.You should already be able to register a public key and create an event if you want to test this part.  But that's pretty much the only thing you can do right now. It is, more or less. Most western countries are currently an heaven Lenin could not have dreamed of.Of course, the current economic crisis is bringing all this to reality.  Welfare state is, as you said, an utopia. It's a metaphor.   Change "murderers" to "thieves" and you'll get a better idea of the reason why democracy tends towards socialism, as everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else. Je n'ai pas eu de réponse de boursorama après deux courriels.  Va falloir que je leur téléphone.  Pffff...
It's not just two wolves and a sheep, it's also the idea that democracy allows majority to vote for stuffs that should have no reason to be voted for in a first place.Imagine how stupid a vote would be if it consisted in deciding which drink should people have for breakfast (tee or coffee that is).   Well, that's democracy.Democracy implicitly assumes that everyone can mess with other people's business, as long as they behave like the herd. I witnessed a dead cat bouncing once.  Quite impressive.  I didn't even know this english expression at that time and I thought it was surnatural or something.  I think I saw it bouncing on the road at least ten times.  I thought it would go on forever and I actually didn't see it stop as I had to leave the place. Although I despise democracy as much as anyone, I don't get the point of this picture   PS.  However, this thread might be a place where to collect pictures on this topic. En fait pour tout dire ça ne m'intéresse pas trop de coder ça comme ça.  C'est pas KISS comme manière de faire.Une zone de texte est largement suffisante.  Peut-être un champ prix, et encore, je ne suis pas sûr que ce soit vraiment utile.  Si une recherche est bien faite on se trouve avec quelques annonces et le tri par prix est facile à faire visuellement. Je laisse ça complètement au choix de l'utilisateur.  Il existe suffisamment de moyen de contacter quelqu'un de nos jours.  Email, forum internet, microblogging, facebeurk, etc.D'ailleurs un lien vers un forum est un bon moyen comme ça les éventuels clients peuvent poser des questions et se renseigner sur la disponibilité de l'article à vendre. Attention suite à une nouvelle modif du code j'ai du effacer la base qui n'était plus correctement indexée. Non.  Donc il faut bien se lire et se relire lors de la rédaction.  La fonction de prévisualisation est faite pour ça.Tu ne la supprimes pas.  Tu te contentes d'informer ceux qui te contacteront.  C'est comme pour les petites annonces dans les journaux, avant internet.Ok, de toute façon je ne suis pas sûr de garder cet algorithme.Sûrement.  Mais c'est un peu plus pénible à coder. Suite à une discussion sur ce fil, j'ai écrit un petit site "le bon bitcoin" où vous pouvez poser vos annonces.ça a l'air de marcher mais ça a besoin de tests.  Avis aux volontaires.http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/lebonbitcoin.fr J'ai bossé dessus cette nuit.  Maintenant tu peux saisir ton annonce et y accéder soit par un lien direct soit par les tags.Il me reste à mettre en place l'outil de recherche.  Je m'amuse bien sur le développement de ce site.  Et puis j'apprends des trucs, vu que c'est l'occasion pour moi d'apprendre un peu javascript.Par exemple j'ai fait en sorte qu'il soit possible d'utiliser un marquage simpliste pour mettre en forme les annonces.  Et puis au lieu de mettre un champ de saisie d'url pour les images, j'ai décidé de laisser javascript parser la zone de texte et y détecter les URL d'image.  Je trouve ça beaucoup plus simple.http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/lebonbitcoin.fr?newY'a encore beaucoup de boulot mais ça progresse.   « Dutch TV has done a nice objective segment on the Silk Road and bitcoin. They point out (correctly) that bitcoin was specifically developed for illegal transactions while revealing the horrors of drugs to us. Lots of interviews from anti-bitcoin people. A+, would recommend as an educational piece. »I'm not sure I understand what this means exactly.  Anyway a video link, if it exists, would be nice. Lol je n'étais pas vraiment sérieux mais puisque je vois que y'a des gens que ça intéresse, je vais m'y coller.Faut dire que ces derniers temps je me passionne pour Perl, donc je vais bosser là dessus à titre d'exercice.Voilà déjà ce que j'ai fait en une grosse heure:http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/lebonbitcoin.frC'est très sommaire mais ça donne déjà une idée du truc.Pour simplifier le fonctionnement, je compte classer les annonces uniquement par tags.  Les tags pourront permettre d'identifier l'objet vendu, mais aussi la zone géographique, la plage de prix etc. En même temps tu n'es pas forcé, non?Dès que tu n'es plus rentable, tu arrêtes.  Tu reprendras si le cours monte, ou si la difficulté baisse.  Je comprends mal ce qui t'inquiète exactement.  C'est si cher que ça des cartes graphiques? Respire!A un moment ou un autre tu devras apprendre à arrêter de regarder constamment le cours sur bitcoinwatch.  Le plus tôt sera le mieux  So you definitely need to have you script file be run as root.   You can use the sudo command as ovidiusoft suggested, or you can chmod u+s yourfile.   It's up to you.   Configuring sudo to run a command without entering a password should be done carefully for obvious security reasons, though. The creator of the proposition is in charge of arbitrating it.In your example, the person who created the event "It will rain in Paris tomorrow" will be the only one who will be allowed to decide whether it rained or not.So there is a reputation element in the event creator.Me?  I won't.  If the service is usefull, I may make money by using it.I don't want to moderate anything as I think it is too much work.  I want a 100% automated website.Actually, I'll use cookies to allow clients to ignore signatures they don't trust, or categories of events they don't want to hear about (tags can be added using a simple 'Tag: ....' syntax in the description).  This is some kind of a custom moderation. When it runs without the fan, is it running as a superuser?   If not, then I guess you need whether to setuid root (or something like that, I don't know exactly), or to give the user the necessary group privilege to control the fan (though I have no idea how).To setuid root, you need to read the chmod man page.I think that you must run something like:$ setuid u+s yourscript$ chown root yourscript The shebang is the first special comment line that tells what program to use.  In your case, it is probably:Code:#!/bin/shSee what shell you use when you say that it's perfect when you copy/paste in your terminal.If your code needs to run as a super-user, you might have to setuid root or something. You have a shebang, right?

Hi,I've been thinking a lot about gambling websites recently.   Not really because I like gambling, but because I think it's quite an important market for the bitcoin economy.  It's also pretty interesting morally/philosophically.Anyway, I'm working on a basic gambling website.  It's a work in progress, but the FAQ is already written, so I thought it might be a good idea to publish it already, in case someone is interested in implementing the same design, and would like to help.http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/betting?faqThe main difference with other gambling websites is that I don't maintain any kind of bitcoin balance per user.  Instead, I issue "prediction tickets" which are some kind of conditionnal bonds, that can be sold/purchased anywhere on internet (on a forum, IRC, biddingpond, bitcoin-otc, whatever).Anxious to here your comments.  Hum...  Funny thing is that this makes me realize an usefull side effect of gambling websites.   It gives an incentive to publish and verify information.  A bit as if gambling markets can be an alternative to journalism.For example,  I've bookmarked this betsofbico.in page, not because I want to bet on this event, but just because I want to know its outcome asap. +1(mais bon je ne doute pas qu'on aura un compte-rendu assez rapidement) J'ai eu un retour pour un virement SEPA refusé.  Je ne sais pas encore s'il s'agissait de mon virement vers bitcoin7 ou vers bitcoin-central (j'avais fait deux virements de 20 euros).J'espère qu'il n'y a pas un lien avec l'affaire MtGox, que je suis fiché par TracFIN ou un truc du genre.Quelqu'un d'autre a connu ce genre de mésaventure? Personnellement je n'accorde qu'une importance relative à cette affaire.Dès le début, bitcoin est conçu pour résister à l'hostilité des gouvernements et des législateurs.  Dès lors, il m'apparaît important que le projet soit capable de résister à la décision d'un juge.C'est sûr que ça va être un peu plus pénible sans une plateforme d'échange légale, mais ça ne doit pas compromettre le projet. Je n'y connais pas grand chose en droit.  C'est publique ce genre d'audience ? I don't know...  Is it possible to bring popcorn in the court?Seriously, yeah I seriously consider showing up.  I've never attended this kind of stuff, though.  Any advice appreciated. (registering to this thread) Je viens de lire cet article, Bitcoin, Bernanke and my lunch money, et je dois dire que ça faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas ressenti un tel plaisir à lire un article sur bitcoin.Si un jour je me rends à New-York, nul doute que je mangerai dans ce restaurant qui accepte les bitcoins.Mais le truc que j'aime le plus avec cet article, c'est qu'il montre bien à quel point il n'y a aucune raison d'imposer l'usage d'une monnaie unique dans un même espace commercial.  Un restaurateur peut afficher ses prix en bitcoins, un autre à coté peut exiger des dollars, ou un autre encore peut demander une monnaie électronique gagée sur de l'or.  Il n'y a aucune raison de leur imposer d'afficher leurs prix dans une monnaie particulière ou de n'accepter que la monnaie crée par une bande de politicards, bureaucrates ou autres trous du'c.Avec les technologies actuelles de communication, changer une monnaie électronique en une autre se fait en quelques instants, du moment qu'il existe des marchés des changes libres et efficaces, car débarrassés du boulet que constituent ces connards de politiques.Les monnaies sont un outil, une marchandise comme les autres.  Les états n'ont pas à s'en mêler. Pardon j'avais promis de faire une relecture mais j'ai complètement oublié.  Mes plus plates excuses.En vérité j'avais effectivement relu le truc, notamment l'intro, et j'avais trouvé le tout atrocement mal écrit et illisible (y compris l'intro que j'avais moi-même écrit!)Bref avec le recul la traduction de cet article n'est vraiment pas une mince affaire.   Traduire un document technique c'est un métier, j'imagine, et c'est pas donné à tout le monde.Bon courage à ceux qui persévéreront. Sorry but I haven't got used to github as I basically don't like using it.  Also I don't have a permanent internet access, and I don't think about updating it when I connect.Sorry but you'll have to extract the code from this thread. Ouais j'entends souvent parler de cette idée de Locke dans la bouche des cocos/socialos.  Je ne suis tout simplement pas d'accord.  Le propre de la propriété c'est qu'elle prive certaines personnes, presque par définition.Je ne vois aucun mal à s'approprier l'unique source d'eau d'un désert, du moment qu'elle n'appartenait au départ à personne, ou qu'elle a été achetée honnêtement.  Ce n'est même pas de l'égoïsme.  Une source d'eau dans un désert a énormément de valeur.  Il est logique qu'on cherche à se l'approprier.Maintenant, si t'es dans le désert et que tu n'as aucun accès à de l'eau, on peut se demander ce que tu fous là.Mettons par exemple que tu débarques de nul part, avec l'intention de traverser le désert "pour le fun".  Tu es Lockéen donc tu considères que tu as "le droit" de prendre un peu de cette précieuse eau, gratuitement.  Je me demande bien au nom de quoi tu aurais ce droit.  Cette eau ne t'appartient pas et si tu veux en boire tu dois payer.Le marché est très certainement le meilleur moyen de gérer les ressources rares et épuisables, qui autrement subissent ce qu'on appelle la tragédie des communs.Le territoire américain a été pris aux indigènes par la force.   Ce n'est peut-être pas légitime, mais c'était il y a plusieurs générations de cela.  Il y a prescription.  Et si il n'y a pas prescription, c'est aux indigènes de se plaindre, pas aux blancs. Those guys seem to forget that bitcoin is not a USA-based currency.  It's international.  As a french person, it seems to me that the US government is not minding its own business.Fucking bastards. Excellent texte.  Merci pour ce lien.Je note plusieurs propos qui recoupent ce qui a déjà été dit sur ce fil.sur les statistiques:« Ceux qui parlent le plus fort d " humanisme ", ceux qui critiquent la pensée libérale moderne soi-disant pour son excès " déconomisme ", sont en réalité des gens qui, sans le savoir, réfléchissent à partir de modèles de représentation extrêmement pauvres où lhomme se trouve en définitive privé de toute dimension morale véritable. Cest le cas des socialistes qui raisonnent principalement à partir dindividus statistiques moyens qui nexistent pas. »sur la soi-disante injustice de l'héritage:« en privant de son gain, par exemple, le bénéficiaire d'un don, ne met-on pas en cause le droit du donateur de faire ce qu'il veut de ses ressources supposées légitimement acquises? »Ce qui est dit sur la liberté, la chance et le principe de réciprocité est très intelligent.J'aime beaucoup ce paragraphe notamment:« De quoi parlons-nous fondamentalement quand nous utilisons des mots tels que liberté (formelle, si l'on veut) ou droit de propriété sur soi-même? Ma réponse et probablement celle de nombreux libéraux (mais pas seulement) est que nous pensons à l'émotion que nous éprouvons lorsque l'on porte atteinte au droit que nous estimons avoir de choisir seuls nos propres actions ou règles d'action, autrement dit à notre autonomie au sens propre du terme. Il s'agit donc de notre désir fondamental d'être respecté par les autres en tant que sujet autonome, de ne pas être traité par eux comme un pur instrument ou une chose et que les particularités de notre personnalité ne soient pas négligées. Cela n'a rien à voir (même si c'en est une condition) avec l'envie de faire tout ce que l'on veut, de maximiser la satisfaction de ses désirs de toute nature. L'aspiration à la liberté n'est pas fondée essentiellement sur un appétit hédoniste de jouissance "sans entraves" (comme on disait en mai 68) ou de désir puéril de vivre au gré de ses fantaisies. Elle correspond avant tout à une revendication, pour ainsi dire, instinctive de dignité et d'intégrité. De ce point de vue le fait que ce qui constitue la personnalité d'un être soit largement le fruit du hasard ne peut être considéré comme un défaut sous prétexte qu'il peut se faire que certains aspects de cette personnalité soient productrices d'avantages matériels dont tout le monde ne jouit pas. Or la logique de l'argument selon lequel personne n'a droit aux revenus qui sont le résultat du hasard serait de conduire à la privation forcée, si elle était possible, de ces traits de personnalité pour les redistribuer aux autres. Le prélèvement par la contrainte fiscale des ressources dont la chance fait bénéficier certains n'est qu'une solution pratique de remplacement (une sorte de pis-aller) par rapport à l'"idéal" inaccessible de ce "lit de Procuste" - nouveau modèle - qui rendrait chaque individu non pas, certes, strictement identique à tout autre mais privé de tout ce qui lui confère éventuellement des avantages réputés indus. Or c'est bien ici que la liberté est mise en cause. Quand on en affirme la valeur en face d'une revendication égalitariste, ce que l'on exprime n'est pas essentiellement le désir de garder pour soi seul les revenus que l'on doit, entre autres choses, il est vrai, à la chance mais le sentiment que nombre des causes de cette "chance" sont indissociables de notre individualité, c'est-à-dire de ce qui fait que chacun de nous se distingue des autres, et que vouloir en réduire les effets par le biais de mesures coercitives est une atteinte à cette individualité. En ce sens le droit de propriété sur soi-même ne peut pas être limité, comme le soutient finalement van Parijs, aux caractéristiques productrices d'avantages matériels de l'individu moyen.»J'aime bien aussi la préface qui résume très bien ce qu'il y a de répugnant dans tout ce ramdam autour de l'AU:« Cest aussi le cas de Rawls dont le principe quon ne saurait avoir aucun droit sur des ressources qui seraient le simple fruit du hasard conduit à ne prendre de sérieux dans lhomme que ce qui en fait le " clone " de tous les autres. » Vrai, et j'avoue que je n'y avais même pas songé.  Pour un peu, ça plaiderait presque en faveur de l'AU Perso j'ai tendance à penser qu'in fine ça revient au même.  Parce que si le DU permet d'acheter une bière, il faut que cette bière ait été brassée, acheminée jusqu'au bar, puis finalement servie.  Il n'y a pas de magie.  Ces efforts correspondent à une valeur.  Qu'elle soit extorquée par l'impôt ou par la création monétaire, au final c'est toujours la même bière. No worries.  I remember this thread quite well and I enjoyed it.   Glad to have this kind of news.Things will be even greater once we'll have pizza-delivering robocopters.But indeed, a robocopter could be a nice way to deliver drugs as well.  And not just legal drugs  Merci de cesser de faire dévier ce fil vers des considérations physiques qui n'ont rien à voir avec la monnaie ou l'économie. Faudrait que j'ajoute à ma TODO list la création d'un "lebonbitcoin.fr". Porte plainte alors.Tu accumules le fruit de ton travail.  Que tu le dépenses dans un an, dans dix ou cinquante ans, ça ne fait pas de différence.  Tu ne voles personne.Et alors je suis un contre-exemple pour ton affirmation idiote.Et pourtant si, figure-toi.   Les "premiers arrivés", comme tu dis, sont souvent aussi et surtout ceux qui ont cru en l'idée et qui se sont bougé le cul pour générer ou acheter des bitcoins.  C'est la preuve de leur motivation.  Y'a des tas de gens qui connaissaient bitcoins depuis longtemps mais ne se sont pas intéressé au truc.  Ce n'est pas un reproche que je leur fais, je cherche juste à montrer que parmi les "premiers arrivés" que tu décris, tu ne vois que ceux qui, dans les faits, se sont activement impliqués dans le projet.  D'ailleurs on est encore en phase I, et pour l'instant ceux qui connaissent bitcoins sont essentiellement les fondus d'informatique.  Bref tu fais toi-même partie des "premiers arrivés".Et de toute façon qu'une innovation bénéficie aux pionniers, ça n'a rien d'aberrant.Comme dit l'adage: l'enfer est pavé de bonnes intentions.Ceux qui ont abandonné l'or comme monnaie, ce sont les Etats.  Mais les agents économiques ont continué à vouloir l'utiliser.   En fait encore récemment les USA ont fait fermer une société qui frappait ses propres pièces d'or et les vendait au public (http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_dollar).Pour répondre à ta question, si les états ont abandonné l'or, c'est amha d'abord et avant tout parce que la discipline monétaire associée à cette monnaie était incompatible avec le maintien des déficits nécessaires au financement de l'état providence.C'est pas qu'elle n'est pas rare, c'est surtout que sa quantité croit de manière illimitée.   C'est pas tout à fait pareil, hein.Figure-toi que même en étant goldeux je suis contre l'étalon-or, alors ta remarque tombe à plat.  Je suis pour la libéralisation absolue des monnaies et la non-intervention totale de l'état dans le domaine.   Si l'or est vraiment une monnaie obsolète, ce n'est ni à toi ni à moi ni à une poignée de technocrates d'en décider, c'est au marché. Et voilà, ça commence.Ce n'est pas à toi d'en juger.Un peintre qui en une minute crée une toile qui vaudra un an de salaire d'un ouvrier, c'est scandaleux, selon toi??Le mythe de la valeur-travail a la vie dure en économie, et il fait souvent partie de la phraséologie marxiste.  Je ne m'étonne pas de te voir le défendre.Oui et bien moi un truc qu'on me donne sans même que je l'ai demandé, j'ai tendance à penser que ça vaut que dalle. Cesse de me faire me répéter.  Démocratie => coercition.Que tu dis.Bah, t'as qu'à porter plainte, alors.  Plus sérieusement, peut-être que le traité de Lisbonne est passé en douce au parlement, mais le parlement est une institution démocratique après tout, et le traité de Maastricht, lui, vous l'avez voté avec enthousiasme et il décrivait le fonctionnement de l'euro dans les moindres détails.Je veux pouvoir stocker ce dont je n'ai pas besoin dans l'immédiat.  Quand je gagne plus que ce que je dépense, il faut bien mettre son argent quelque part, et même en diversifiant en actions, or etc... il reste toujours un peu de signes monétaires pour lesquels je ne sais pas quand j'aurais à les dépenser."avec bitcoin c'est à ceux qui ont le plus de CPU"  Pff...  Je n'ai jamais généré un seul bitcoin.   Avec bitcoin les bitcoins appartiennent à ceux qui sont le plus motivés pour en posséder.  Comme il se doit pour toute chose dans un marché libre."avec le DU c'est aux pauvres".   M'ouais, le syndrome robin des bois, quoi.  Si les pauvres sont pauvres, y'a une raison économique à cela.  Vouloir changer ça avec  un coup de baguette magique une planche à billet, c'est idiot.Là on est d'accord.  Ca vaut le coup d'essayer, en effet.  En fait j'ai hâte que vous le fassiez afin que ça échoue rapidement et qu'on passe à autre chose.Alors là n'importe quoi.  L'or ça s'achète au gramme, s'il le faut.  D'ailleurs j'ai vendu des mini lingots de 1g sur la section marketplace de ce forum.   Et puis il y a l'argent métal aussi.Et puis ne me prête pas des idées que je n'ai pas exprimées, stp.  Je ne vénères pas la rareté, comme tu dis.  Je n'ai même pas écrit ce mot dans ce fil.  Si tu ne comprends pas pourquoi l'or est monnaie, ce n'est pas de ma faute, mais du coup ne prêtes pas à autrui des propos qu'ils n'ont pas tenu.L'or, ça se divise.  Le thème "au bout d'un moment il n'y en a plus assez" est proprement ridicule. Il s'effondrera surtout parce que les gens exigeront toujours un montant plus important.  Mais ça, ça relève en gros de la psychologie donc je ne peux pas le prouver.   Il faut le voir pour le croire.  Donc dépêchez vous de mettre en place votre truc, vous verrez bien.Et alors?  Ce n'est pas parce qu'un truc se fait presque sans dépense énergétique, si c'est bien à cela que tu fais allusion, que ce n'est pas un "travail".Ca reste une production dont la valeur est susceptible d'être évaluée par le marché.  Si moi j'écris mon programme de création monétaire, ça vaudra sûrement que dalle.  Si c'est Satoshi Nakamoto, c'est une autre affaire.Tu concèdes que la monnaie est un outil facilitant l'échange.  C'est un outil de mesure de la valeur d'échange.  Et bien à ce titre, c'est bel et bien un truc que l'on produit dans le but de le vendre.  Un thermomètre est un outil de mesure de la température.  Et les thermomètres ne sont pas distribués gratuitement à la population.  Pareil pour les pieds à coulisse, les marteaux, les lunettes, les oscilloscopes, que sais-je encore... Agreed.   Before criticizing Bruce, people should ask themselves:  "Would I do better?"I certainly would not.
Elle cultive quand même une belle ambiguité.  Je lis par exemple (en cherchant "monnaie commune"):« La nécessité de définir une monnaie communeétant admise au sein de la communauté desindividus »« Une monnaie commune n'est compatible avecles Droits de l'Homme que si son mode decréation respecte l'égalité des hommes devant lejugement de toute valeur, ... »et autres balivernes...Ok je sais que monnaie commune ne signifie pas monnaie unique, et que communauté ne regroupe pas nécessairement tous les habitants d'une même région, mais quand même...Pas besoin d'être calé en physique pour comprendre que ça n'a rien à voir, tout comme je n'ai pas besoin de connaître l'astronomie pour ne pas prêter de crédit à l'astrologie.L'état ne nous impose l'utilisation de l'euro que de façon très relative.   Il nous force à l'utiliser dans les échanges, certes, mais il ne nous force pas à le stocker.   C'est déjà pas mal.Et surtout:  il vous laisse bel et bien choisir comment il fonctionne, selon vos critères.  L'euro et le traité de Maastricht sont le produit d'un processus démocratique.   Donc ceux qui se déclarent favorables à la démocratie n'ont pas à se plaindre.   J'ai même envie de dire qu'ils n'ont que ce qu'ils méritent.Je croyais que chacun était libre de décider ce qui avait de la valeur ou pas ?   Si moi je crois qu'au contraire une monnaie doit pouvoir conserver sa valeur sur le long terme, c'est mon problème, non ? Grande quantité ou pas, ça ne regarde que l'épargnant, et dans les deux cas ça peut lui déplaire profondément de céder chaque année 5% de la valeur. N'attends pas de moi de défendre l'euro.  Ce n'est pas le sujet de toute façon.  Tu peux pas défendre le DU en disant "c'est mieux que l'euro".  Je crois que les tenants du DU et de bitcoin ont l'euro un ennemi commun.  Cependant, moi en tant que goldeux j'estime que l'euro n'est de toute façon pas un gros problème car il est facile de s'en débarrasser.Entre l'euro et le DU, je préfère le DU parce que je pense qu'il s'effondrera encore plus rapidement que l'euro et que donc c'est tout bénef pour les libéraux, car ça favorisera l'essor des monnaies privées.Mais pourquoi voulez-vous distribuer la création monétaire???   Pourquoi un producteur devrait-il distribuer sa production??  En général un producteur produit pour vendre, pas pour donner gratuitement. I think he's been doing a pretty good job so far. It is certainly unwise for most people to hold that many bitcoins on MtGox, imho. Yes, that's the idea.Binary is not an issue but complexity is indeed.   I'll keep looking at such a solution from times to times, as I would like to make a few bitcoin related websites with CGI I can't/don't want to have a full client on an open webserver.« Another is to generate a "false" bitcoin address formed from the hash and to send a small amount of bitcoins to it (e.g. one satoshi). This is the method implemented in my script. »This has been discussed on the forum, by Satoshi himself.  Indeed you can use the hash160ToPublicKey in order to achieve that.  You basically just need to compute a rmd160 of the data you want to timestamp, and send a small BTC amount to the corresponding bitcoin address.  The money will be lost forever, though. Ah si je le savais...écroulé c'est un bien grand mot, hein...    Mais c'est un grosse baisse, c'est vrai. Ben je ne l'ai pas lu explicitement, puisque de toute façon je n'arrive pas à supporter la lecture de son bouquin, tout comme je ne peux pas lire un bouquin d'astrologie.Mais j'en ai lu suffisamment pour savoir qu'à un moment il préconise d'utiliser un procédé démocratique pour établir les règles de fonctionnement.  Or je suis désolé, mais là où il y a démocratie, il y a coercition.PS.  quand je dis que ce bouquin me fait la même impression qu'un bouquin d'astrologie, je fais référence à des perles comme celle-ci:«C'est le même rôle que joue la vitesse de lalumière au sein de la physique Relativiste. Lalumière n'est pas un objet physique comme lesautres. Sa vitesse, donnée d'espace/temps (unedistance divisée par un temps) est la même danstous les référentiels. Et c'est parce que lesobservateurs s'accordent sur ce point, qu'ils endéduisent la relativité des autres mesures pourétablir une théorie relativiste compatible entreeux, différente selon les référentiels, mais « demême forme ».»PS#2Dans la vie économique, les choses appartiennent à ceux qui les ont produites, ou à ceux qui les ont achetées, ou plutôt obtenues par un échange volontaire.  Il n'y a aucune raison qu'il en soit autrement pour les monnaies.  L'euro actuellement est émis par les banques centrales et prêté préférentiellement aux banques.  La belle affaire.  L'euro est de toute façon un produit des états et de leur technocratie.  Je n'ai aucune légitimité à me plaindre de ne pas en recevoir gratuitement.  C'est leur truc.De toute façon, l'or existe.  Et de fait en me débarrassant de tous mes euros il y a quelques années pour acheter de l'or, j'ai fais valoir mon droit à "juger moi-même de la valeur de l'euro".Une monnaie est un outil, un bien comme les autres.  Satoshi possède énormément de bitcoins mais je ne vois rien d'anormal à cela.  C'est son truc, son bébé.  Si t'es pas content, rien ne t'oblige à accepter les bitcoins.Vouloir distribuer uniformément une monnaie c'est aussi saugrenu que de vouloir distribuer n'importe quel autre bien, comme des terres cultivables, du pain, des poissons.  C'est très chrétien comme attitude mais ça n'a rien à voir avec la réalité économique.Vous pouvez bien sûr le faire, mais ce faisant votre monnaie perd tout son sens en tant que monnaie, et je ne lui attribue donc aucune valeur. I have red a few description of betting protocols and I'm afraid I'm not much convinced by any of them.As far as this one is concerned, I still don't get exactly how it works.  I guess I'll have to read more.Anyway, so far what I think about this is that a prediction market needs a clear specification of the market rules, and more precisely, a better description of the financial vehicle it involves.Here is how I see it:- an event should only have a Yes/No outcome (i.e. 'will happen'/'will not happen' betting possibilities)- anyone should be able to create an event.  But the person who creates an event should also be responsible of settling it down.   Byt settling down, I mean "telling everyone wether the event occured, or not".  Such a person could be called the "referee" for this event.  The honesty of the referee should be appreciated only on a reputation based way.  Thus all referee should cryptographically sign their event descriptions.- the bookkeeper is normally a different person from the referee.  He is basically the website admin and he earns money from his own bets and/or advertisements on the website.- a bet should be considered as some kind of a conditional bond.  It is a promise to pay a certain amount of money in case some event happen at a certain time.   This makes it possible to follow the same financial principles than 'normal' bonds.  In particular, a bond emission is based on a auction system that determines the final winning ratio.  For instance, if a 100BTC bet that Obama will get elected on 2012 is sold at 50BTC, then the winning ratio is 200% on one side, and 50% on the other.- As a consequence, as soon as your bet has been bought, you know exactly how much you can earn from it.- this would allow a second market for bets.  Therefore, as times goes on and the likelihood of the event  changes, owners of bets can sell them before the event is settled, and the winning ratios get adjusted by the selling prices.  Exactly as it is for bonds.-   The bookeeper should also act as a third party (escrow), so that he supports all credit risk associated to a bet.  For instance, in order to bet 100BTC for an event that will settle in a year, you have to pay 100BTC immediately to the bookkeeper who will hold the bitcoins until settlement. well, I forgot to mention that my version of openssl prints an annoying "(stdin)= xxxxxxx" with the hex option.  I could use a sed 's/^.*= //' but that would be fugly.See my previous message. My idea is to use bitcoinexplorer to extract the information that is necessary to write the transaction (block number, hash root and so on).Well, just the destination address, and the origin address.   The raw block would be fetched from blockexplorer.We would need at least one IP of a running full client if we want to publish the transaction.  And IPs are published on irc. I've been waiting and thinking about this for quite some time now.First I have to read carefully how it does work though,  but I'm definitely interested. It doesn't with my version of openssl (1.0.0d).   Also, don't forget you need to get only the first 4 bytes on checksum.Thanks.  What would be very cool would be a script that creates a transaction to an other address, using raw block downloaded from blockexplorer.com and an IP found on IRC. C'est un crime d'avoir des relations ?  C'est injuste de vouloir donner ce qu'on possède à ses enfants ?Et surtout, surtout, en quoi est-ce que le fait d'hériter de la fortune de ses parents fait que tu "profites" du travail des autres ?  L'argent, le capital, devient-il sale dès lors qu'il est transmis d'une personne à une autre ?   En admettant qu'une personne soit devenue riche honnêtement et de façon juste, pourquoi son fils où sa fille serait moins légitime à gérer le capital, si telle est la volonté de son père ?Quant au point 2. , pardon mais là j'espère que tu comprends que ce n'est pas le capitalisme qui est à blâmer là, mais plutôt le corporatisme et l'intervention de l'état dans l'économie.PS.  Et puis, je ne comprends toujours pas ce que tu entends par "profiter".  Oui, un employeur 'profite' du travail de ses salariés.  C'est bien pour ça qu'il les a embauchés!  Mais le salarié profite lui aussi du salaire qu'on lui donne.  C'est bien pour ça qu'il accepte de travailler.  C'est une relation gagnant-gagnant.La différence c'est juste qu'il y en a un qui profite plus parce qu'il est entré dans plus de relations de ce genre:  le patron car il a plusieurs employés.  Mais de un à un,  c'est toujours gagnant-gagnant et si une partie n'est pas contente, elle peut toujours aller voir ailleurs.  Personne ne force personne ni à enter, ni à rester. Pourtant si, dès qu'il parle de démocratie.Bon faut que vous accordez vos violons les gars, parce que plus haut je lis que l'un des intérêts du DU c'est de remplacer l'aide sociale en la simplifiant:« Après tout, avec un système de dividende universel, lÉtat n'a plus besoin de gérer des dizaines d'aides conditionnelles complexes (CAF, RSA, etc.), »dixit benkebab sur ce fil.C'est ton opinion hein.  Heureusement d'après Laborde:« tout individu est libre d'estimer ce qui est valeur et ce qui ne l'est pas »C'est l'un des rares trucs avec lequel je suis d'accord dans son bouquin.  L'ennui c'est qu'il n'apprend rien à personne en le rappelant, et il semble ne pas utiliser ce précepte dans tout le reste de sa théorie. oui c'est bien le reproche que je lui fais.  Il n'y a aucune raison de procéder de façon démocratique.Bitcoin n'est pas démocratique.La démocratie c'est pas "je suis libre de choisir".  La démocratie c'est :  "je suis libre de faire comme tout le monde".Au cas où tu ne l'aurais pas remarqué, la plupart des anciens de ce forum sont plutôt anarchistes et en tant que tels, il n'ont que peu de respect pour la démocratie.PS.  Si j'osais je dirais qu'on parle d'économie là, et qu'en matière d'économie, la démocratie n'a pas sa place.  Voter démocratiquement les règles de fonctionnement d'une monnaie, c'est aussi idiot que de voter pour savoir si les gens doivent boire du thé ou du café. ça ne me fait pas fuir la France (du moins pas encore), mais ça me fait déjà fuir l'euro.Il y a longtemps (en gros à l'époque où j'étais de gauche), j'étais moi-même favorable à un dividende universel, essentiellement pour le coté simplification de l'aide sociale, en effet.  Et maintenant même en tant que libéral, je peux comprendre qu'on soit pour, pour la même raison.Mais maintenant je suis plutôt contre toute aide sociale, donc j'ai du mal à défendre un dividende universel.  ça me parait être une concession trop forte faite à l'état providence.  Une forme d'abdication.Sinon, le dividende de Laborde est basé sur la création monétaire, donc ce n'est pas à proprement sur la société qu'il fait peser l'aide sociale, mais sur la monnaie.  Donc pour moi c'est ok, mais il est clair que je n'accepterai de posséder une telle monnaie que le temps nécessaire pour la changer en or ou en bitcoins.Enfin, je ne crois pas une seule seconde que les pauvres et les gauchistes se contenteront du DU.  Soit ils demanderont continuellement à ce qu'il soit augmenté, soit ils exigeront qu'il y soit ajouté d'autres prestations sociales, en commençant pas la sécurité sociale, puis les allocations familiales, etc.Je ne vois rien qui permettrait de maintenir une discipline dans le domaine. M'ouais je comprends que tu ne veuilles pas poursuivre, car ça peut vite s'envenimer.Quand t'auras un moment essaie tout de même de répondre sur le coté démocratique de votre truc, car pour moi c'est un vrai mystère cet aspect, et j'y vois vraiment une contradiction flagrante avec le caractère soit-disant "relatif" de la monnaie prônée par Laborde. Je ne vois juste pas le rapport et de toute façon je n'aime pas qu'on me balance un texte avec des illustrations pour enfants, en me disant :  "t'as qu'à lire ça".  J'ai un peu l'impression d'être pris pour un imbécile.C'est typiquement le genre de phrases dans ce bouquin qui fait que je ne peux pas le lire entièrement.  Utiliser la physique pour justifier ses opinions politiques/économiques, c'est juste bête et dangereux.  Contrairement à la politique, la science c'est pas un truc qui est découvert grâce à des considérations morales ou philosophiques.  Einstein ne s'est pas dit un jour "tiens, ce serait bien si une symétrie spatio-temporelle existait dans l'univers".  Ca me rappelle un peu a les penseurs qui invoquaient Darwin pour justifier les génocides.  Bref utiliser cette phraséologie pseudo-scientifique, c'est assez nauséabond si vous voulez mon avis.Je n'ai aucune confiance dans les calculs, mais surtout dans les hypothèses de calcul, effectuées par Laborde.  Tout ce que je sais c'est qu'avec son système, y'aura des gens qui seront payés à ne rien foutre, ad vitam aeternam.  Ça me suffit à fuir comme la peste la monnaie que recevront ces gens.Je trouve aussi stupide cette utilisation certes typique des statistiques.  L'espérance de vie est peut-être de 80 ans, je m'en tape:  je ne suis pas une statistique.  De nos jours beaucoup trop de monde use et abuse des statistiques.  C'est idiot. Je mesure 1m96.   La taille moyenne des français doit être de 1m80, à tout casser.  Et bien ça me ferait bien chier si un technocrate en concluait qu'il faut faire en sorte que toutes les portes aient 1m90 de haut.Je ne comprends très mal ce que vous entendez par "favoriser".En fait mon plus gros reproche à votre théorie, c'est le paradoxe criant qu'il y a dans le fait qu'elle se dit "relative", mais que dans le même temps elle cherche à imposer (via un processus démocratique), une monnaie à tout le monde.Ainsi, Laborde écrit « tout individu est libre d'estimer ce qui est valeur et ce qui ne l'est pas », et en fait un principe fondamental.  Dès lors, comment peut-on considérer que la distribution de la monnaie "favorise" qui que ce soit Mettons par exemple que Alice reçoive un plus gros dividende que Bob, pour une raison ou pour une autre.  Bob s'estime à juste titre lésé et décide donc que cette monnaie n'est pas correcte.  Du coup il ne lui attribue aucune valeur.  Exactement comme les tenants de la TRM considèrent bitcoin, d'ailleurs (j'imagine).  Le résultat est qu'il n'est pas lésé, du moment que personne ne le force à accepter la monnaie d'Alice.Laborde, lui, propose d'établir des règles monétaires de façon démocratique.  Il n'y a absolument aucune raison de faire cela.  La démocratie c'est la majorité qui décide pour tout le monde.  En matière monétaire je ne vois rien qui justifierait une telle démarche.  Certains individus conçoivent ensemble une monnaie, la propose à la population, et ceux qui veulent l'accepter l'acceptent.  Ceux qui ne veulent pas l'accepter ne l'acceptent pas.  Ceux qui hésitent attribueront une certaine valeur, et la mesure de cette valeur se fait sur le marché des changes.Personne ne peut être défavorisé dès lors que tout le monde est libre d'accorder la valeur qu'il souhaite à des monnaies circulant librement de façon concurrente.  Par exemple si une génération s'estime lésée d'un point de vue monétaire par rapport à une génération plus ancienne, alors les jeunes émettent leur propre monnaie, et c'est au marché de déterminer la valeur relative de deux monnaies. J'ai suivi ce fil de loin jusqu'ici mais je vais faire une relecture cette semaine.  Promis. Instead of xxd, I guess it is possible to use perl oneliners:Code:checksum() {    perl -we "print pack 'H*', '$1'" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    perl -we 'print unpack q{H8}, join q{}, <>'}hash160() {    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -binary |    perl -we 'print unpack q{H*}, join q{}, <>'}Perl is usually easy to install on systems where bash is installed.Watch for the last lines of these two functions:  they are actually different (H8 instead of H*), as the checksum function only needs the four first bytes.THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED MUCH.   Please test it thorously before actually using it. Oh, my bad.   It seems that xxd goes with the Vim editor.  I had no clue.It might be tedious to get the vim source and extract only the xxd part.  You may not want to install Vim if you are not a vi adept, though.I guess I should rewrite this script with a more standard hex dumper, such as 'hexdump' or 'od'.
You need bc and dc.  They should be available on Cygwin (which is a great project by the way).  Check out the "maths" section.You also need xxd.  I don't know if it's available on Cygwin but it should.  It's a small programm anyway, so in worst case you can just compile it.PS.  Après vérif bc et dc sont dispo dans le paquet "bc": http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-cat.cgi?file=bc%2Fbc-1.06-2&grep=dcPour xxd je ne l'ai pas trouvé donc je pense que tu dois le compiler ou faire un truc équivalent avec un autre filtre. V'oui ben je ne suis pas contre non plus, c'est juste que vous me faites flipper avec vos discours car ça sonne très communiste, tout ça.Tant que vous ne cherchez pas à confisquer l'or, interdire bitcoin ou des trucs du genre, ça ira.  Mais sinon on ira droit vers un conflit violent.  Bon je me suis calmé alors j'essaie de répondre gentiment.Efficient, oui, sans le moindre doute.  J'écris cette réponse avec à un ordinateur fabriqué en Chine que j'ai pu acheter avec trois fois rien grâce à l'adoption par ce pays des règles de marché capitalistes.Le communisme, ça ne marche pas, et l'histoire est absolument claire sur le fait que c'est le marché libre qui est le plus à même de satisfaire les besoins et niveaux de vie humains.   Des tas de types plus compétents que moi ont soutenu cette idée.  Je citerais volontiers Milton Friedman par exemple:« The record of History is absolutely crystal clear:  there is no alternative way, so far discovered, of improving the lives of the ordinary people, that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by free trade and free enterprise system. »http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWsx1X8PV_Ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi-D24oCa10Le communisme, ça ne marche pas, désolé.Moi je suis capitaliste car je possède des actions et je t'assure que je ne correspond pas à ce profil.  Tu focalises sur une extrême minorité, et je ne suis même pas sûr que tu sâches de quoi tu parles.Les notations dont tu parles portent sur les emprunts d'Etats.  Ca n'a pas grand chose à voir avec le capitalisme, qui lui porte sur la propriété privée des moyens de production.Je ne sais pas pour Enron, mais pour les subprimes l'histoire est liée à l'intervention massive de l'état dans un mécanisme de marché qui n'aurait pas du le concerner.Par ailleurs, avec le libéralisme, des entreprises peuvent faire faillite.  Il n'y a rien d'anormal à ça.  Le capitalisme n'a pas prétention à empêcher les êtres humains de faire des âneries. Intelligent n'est pas le mot correct, au temps pour moi.Sinon, les propos que je lis ici sont affligeants et là je ne suis pas d'humeur à entretenir un débat cocos/libéraux, alors stop.Faites juste votre truc parce qu'on arrivera pas à vous convaincre que c'est une mauvaise idée à moins qu'on vous laisse vous planter en l'essayant. Par contre souvenez-vous des trois conditions mentionnées plus haut, et en particulier n'imposez pas votre solution par la force. Oui, oui, j'imagine.  Personnellement j'ai tendance à être sceptique face à ce genre de constructions économiques théoriques, hein...  Je doute que Stéphane Laborde, ou que qui que ce soit d'autre, soit plus intelligent que le marché. Aïe.  Je sens que ce débat va mal tourner.  Pour répondre le plus poliment possible:  non.L'entreprise appartient à ses actionnaires, par définition.  Si tu n'as pas d'actions de cette entreprise, elle ne t'appartient pas, même pas en une infime partie. Être actionnaire d'une entreprise est bel et bien donné à tout le monde, à mesure de ses capacités.  Si t'as déjà eu cent euros en poche dont tu n'avais pas un besoin vital, tu aurais pu acheter une action.  Le seul facteur limitant que je vois c'est la paperasse nécessaire pour ouvrir un compte titre.  Il faut par exemple prouver son identité, son adresse et sa nationalité.  Mais ce n'est pas ce que tu reproches au système, et de toute façon ça pourrait très bien changer.Et y'a rien d'anormal à ça.Aïe.  Mes craintes sur l'arrière fond Marxiste des défenseurs du dividende universelle se confirment cruellement, là.Penses-tu vraiment que toute personne riche est quelqu'un qui a profité du travail des autres ?  Qu'entends tu exactement par "profiter" ?  Penses-tu que toute richesse est acquise de façon injuste ?Oui, le dividende universel, à tout prendre, me parait préférable au système actuel.  Je suis juste persuadé que la valeur de la monnaie sous-jacente baissera rapidement.   Et donc ce serait formidable, car si les gouvernements suivaient vos préceptes, au final on aboutirait à l'échec de la monnaie nationale, et donc vers la victoire des monnaies privées libres, imposées par le marché et non par les technocrates.  J'ai rien contre le fait de donner l'argent créé à tout le monde, là où je tique c'est dans l'idée que cet argent serait créé constamment, à perpétuité et à taux constant.   Pour moi l'argent n'a d'intérêt que si il existe en quantité fixe.  Sinon l'instrument de mesure est cassé et ne permet pas de faire émerger le signal prix.Par ailleurs, pour que cet argent du dividende universel soit utile à quoi que ce soit, il faut qu'il ait un tant soit peu de valeur, c'est à dire qu'in fine on puisse acheter des trucs avec.  Par exemple, une bière.Donc avec le dividende universel, en théorie je devrais pouvoir m'acheter ne serait-ce qu'une bière gratuite par mois.  Par gratuit, j'entends ici "sans aucune contrepartie économique".  C'est à dire que je bois ma bière, mais je n'ai rien cédé ou fait pour l'obtenir.  Le tenancier du bar me la donne littéralement sans rien en échange.  Bon ok, le tenancier reçoit des sous, mais ces sous on me les a donné sans rien me demander en compensation.Si c'est le cas, il y a un malaise parce que y'a pas de bière gratuite en économie.  Et si je ne peux pas, ben alors je comprends mal à quoi sert le truc.Merci je connais l'histoire de l'île des naufragés.  Je vois mal le rapport, par contre. Le trading gratuit est extrêmement alléchant !Je n'ai plus utilisé bitcoin-central depuis des lustres mais là c'est l'occasion d'y retourner. Cette conception du DU, ça existe:  ça s'appelle les actions.  Les actionnaires touchent, sans rien faire, une part des bénéfices des entreprises.  Et ce qui est bien avec ce système, c'est que quand les entreprises ne font pas de bénéfices, en général elles ne versent pas de dividende.  Ça permet de conserver une cohérence économique au truc. J'ai essayé de lire le bouquin en question et en restant poli je dirais que je n'ai pas été convaincu. Franchement, si un dividende universel était mis en place, je vendrais ma part aussitôt reçue pour acheter de l'or ou des bitcoins.C'est d'ailleurs l'une des raisons qui m'incite à penser qu'un tel système ne peut pas marcher:  ça me permettrait d'accumuler de l'or gratuitement.  Bien sûr, ça veut juste dire que le prix de l'or dans la monnaie à dividende universel grimperait très vite, mais j'ai tendance à penser que, les mêmes causes entraînant les mêmes effets, ce serait pareil pour tous les autres biens.Comme on dit:en économie, il n'y a pas de repas gratuit.Maintenant, ce n'est qu'une opinion basée sur une intuition plus que sur un raisonnement mathématique rigoureux, et de toute façon, sous réserve que les trois conditions mentionnées plus haut sont satisfaites, encore une fois je n'ai rien contre.  En plus je pense que ce genre de truc, le seul moyen qu'il y a de savoir si ça marche ou non, c'est de l'essayer. +1 pour "empreinte".Une "note du traducteur" en bas de page serait bienvenue pour expliquer l'usage de ce mot, par contre. Perso je n'ai rien contre un anglicisme ici, d'autant plus que le terme anglais est très proche du français (y'a que le 's' à la place d'un 'c').   Et puis "hachage" est le substantif qui désigne le fait de hacher, mais je crois qu'il n'y a pas d'équivalent au hash, c'est à dire la chose obtenue après le hachage.Par contre pour les anglicismes, songez à utiliser une fonte différente.  Je crois que l'italique est le standard quand on emprunte des mots à une langue étrangère. J'achèterais volontiers un T-shirt avec un message un brin plus subversif que ce qu'on voit en général sur les T-shirts bitcoin.Genre:<<Marre des banques ?www.bitcoin.org>>Je m'amuserai à le porter dans le métro 1 direction la Défense, un lundi matin  C'est un sujet souvent discuté ici (allez savoir pourquoi...), et j'ai déjà eu l'occasion de m'exprimer là dessus.J'ai quand même envie d'ouvrir un fil sur le sujet et de clarifier mon opinion.Le dividende universel, basé sur une monnaie commune dont chacun recevrait un montant fixe et inconditionnel tous les mois, je n'ai rien contre, même si amha ça ne servirait pas à grand chose.En tout cas donc je dis:  allez-y, faites le donc!  Ça ne peut pas faire de mal, à condition:de ne pas être pas obligé d'utiliser cette monnaie.  C'est à dire que si un vendeur veut vendre un truc avec une autre monnaie et qu'il trouve un acheteur prêt à acheter le truc avec cette monnaie, qu'ils aient le droit de conclure leur transaction avec cette monnaie là, et non avec la monnaie "officielle" ;qu'on ne me force pas à être listé dans un fichier avec mon nom, mon adresse, mes empreintes digitale ou un truc du genre.  A défaut qu'on m'autorise à renoncer à mon droit au dividende, afin de ne pas figurer sur un tel fichier.que le financement de ce truc n'augmente pas mes impôts.Voilà déjà trois conditions, j'espère ne pas en avoir oublié. Je me demande pourquoi tu te donnes tant de mal, Ploum.  Si tu continues à promouvoir bitcoin, tu vas conforter les gens dans leur idée que c'est une arnaque et que tu essaies de faire monter le cours en attirant des gogos.Désormais la plupart des geeks savent que bitcoin existe.  Inutile d'en faire plus.  Ceux qui veulent l'utiliser l'utiliseront, et les autres utiliseront les monnaies pour esclaves. "j'ai lancé le logiciel et j'ai toujours rien reçu,  c'est normal ?" Non, mais je ne placerais jamais toute mon épargne en cash de toute façon, même en bitcoins.   Je suis essentiellement en or et en actions.Ceci étant, si on me forçait à choisir entre mettre toutes mes économies en bitcoins ou en euros, je choisirais les bitcoins sans trop d'hésitation. Il n'est pas question pour le bitcoin de prendre la place de l'or.  Par contre, en ce qui me concerne, le bitcoin m'inspire déjà plus confiance que n'importe quelle monnaie nationale. Non.  Le nombre de bitcoins est déterminé, oui, mais il n'y a pas de raison que l'utilisation soit continuellement croissante.  Ça, ça dépend de la conjoncture économique.  Bitcoin permet la déflation, mais ne l'impose pas.Parmi les biens et services qu'on peut se procurer avec des bitcoins, il y a les autres monnaies.  Voir mon post sur bitcoin en tant que metadevise.Une monnaie est un outil de comptabilité décentralisé, un instrument de mesure de valeur, et à ce titre bitcoin permet (ou permettra à terme), comme l'or, de palier aux aberrations de mesure liées aux monnaies nationales, dont les administrateurs font n'importe quoi avec.Regarde le cours de l'or en ce moment.  Il n'y a pas beaucoup de biens et services qu'on peut se procurer directement avec de l'or, et pourtant le prix de l'once est au plus haut. On est encore en phase 1, c.a.d avec 50 nouveaux bitcoins par bloc.On est au bloc 140 000, ce qui est les deux tiers de 210 000.  Donc d'ici un an environ, on va avoir une augmentation de 50% de l'agrégat total.  50% d'inflation, c'est beaucoup.  Si la masse d'utilisateurs n'augmente pas autant, le cours peut encore beaucoup baisser.Donc pour moi tout est possible, mais je pense qu'on a vu le pic le plus important cette année, et qu'il faudra attendre le passage des 210 000 blocs pour que la hausse reprenne de façon durable.
Ah crotte, au temps pour moi.  J'ai fait (1+0.005)^365 et j'ai cru que le résultat, 6 et des poussières, était un pourcentage.  Mais en fait c'est un rapport.  Donc plus de 600% à l'année en effet.Autant dire que tôt ou tard tu vas te prendre une grosse dérouillée. 0.5% par jour c'est déjà bien.  A l'année ça ferait environ 6%.Sinon pour le manque de liquidité vous les traders vous devriez vous réunir, faire un club d'investissement ou un truc dans le genre.  Pour peu que vous ouvriez le capital (en bitcoin si possible), je peux être intéressé à y placer quelques bitcoins... En moins violent, il y a le sang (vendu au litre), ou les placentas humains (mais il faut vérifier qu'il s'agit bel et bien de placentas humains et non animaux, ce qui nécessite une analyse ADN et un centre d'authentification, et donc de distribution).J'aime bien ce fil.  La question d'une distribution uniforme et décentralisée d'une ressource est intéressante.  Je suis personnellement convaincu que c'est impossible sans avoir recours à des trucs atroces du genre de ce que j'ai évoqué (mutilation ou vente d'une part du corps humain), ou d'un marquage des individus (puce RFID, tatouage d'un numéro de série, etc.)Rien de très enthousiasmant donc pour quiconque a lu Orwel ou Huxley. Oui, c'est une possibilité qu'il faut garder en tête.  Bitcoin n'a pas la prétention d'être invulnérable.  Mais en l'état actuel des connaissances en cryptographie, il est solide.  On peut mettre en doute cette solidité, mais dans ce cas on remet en question bien des choses, au delà de bitcoin.  Car les algorithmes de hashages ne sont pas utilisés que pour les monnaies cryptographiques, loin s'en faut.Non.  Satoshi a évoqué la question plus d'une fois sur ce forum.  Et même si effectivement il faut abandonner la monnaie et en créer une autre, tant pis.  Changer de monnaie ça déplaira à ceux qui ont mis toutes leurs économies dedans, mais c'est pas la fin du monde.  Dans quelques années on va abandonner l'euro, et pourtant je suis sûr qu'il y en a qui diront que l'euro c'était super.  Le bitcoin, lui, on lui reproche déjà d'être mortel alors que absolument rien ne prouve qu'il le sera.  Une banque centrale n'a pas de protocole de chiffrement.  Enfin, pas plus que moi quand je chiffre mes mails avec GPG.  Ils peuvent chiffrer leurs communication, mais ça n'est pas propre à leur activité.Personne ne sait.  Mais le pire n'est jamais sûr.  Rasoir d'Occam, tout ça...Complexe, tout est relatif.  Je n'ai personnellement aucune idée de la façon avec laquelle SHA-256 fonctionne.  Mais je m'en fiche, la fonctionnalité que l'algorithme procure est facile à comprendre.  Pour le reste, il me suffit de constater que jusqu'ici personne n'a réussi à inverser la fonction.Et puis, ce n'est pas beaucoup plus complexe que les rapports et études de la BCE justifiant sa politique monétaire.Encore faut-il avoir confiance dans les organismes et entités en question.  Parce que c'est bien beau de te protéger contre le vol de tes sous, si dans le même temps ces gens se versent mutuellement des milliards de ces sous, dévaluant ainsi les tiens, t'es bien avancé au final.Par ailleurs, ces institutions sont sensées, du moins en théorie, protéger les citoyens qui les ont élu démocratiquement.   Donc ils accomplissent leur volonté, et si un jour bitcoin devait devenir une monnaie adoptée par une part significative de la population, alors on peu imaginer que les mécanismes de protection que tu évoques soit appliqués au bitcoin.  C'est souvent comme ça qu'une monnaie s'impose, ça a été le cas pour le dollar, par exemple.Plus généralement le cadre juridique dont tu parles n'est pas inséparable de la monnaie à laquelle elle s'applique.  Pas du tout.Et puis, pour dire le fond de ma pensée, ce cadre juridique, c'est nul.  Ca pose bien plus de problèmes que ça n'apporte de solutions. C'est sur youtube, facile à trouver.pas encore regardé mais lol!Moi aussi on m'avait contacté mais comme j'ai pas une bonne connection internet ytout...  En plus j'ai pas grand chose d'intéressant à dire et David lui a un échange donc il est plus légitime que moi pour représenter la communauté francophone.Cool en tout cas.  Si un jour un plateau TV/webTV est organisé sur Paris, je serai ravi de participer par contre. Agreed.  It's quite a vague assertion, though.  But it has profound truth in it.  IMHO. Haven't read all this thread, but here is my opinion:- C is the most influential modern programming language.  You should at least read Kerningam and Rithie's book:  "The C programming language", and trie to write a few C programs.- python is a widely popular language.  It's very easy to learn and it's a good introduction to even more modern programming languages, which use concepts such as garbage collection and just-in-time compiling.  It's also an easy way to get familiar with object programming.- some knowledge of java, javascript and PHP can not be avoided if you want to focus on web programming.- C++ is nice but tough to master.  I personnaly thought I knew C++, until I read Satoshi's code  C'est quoi tes sites liberaux préférés ? Je réponds 2)  sans hésitation.T'as pas besoin de la loi pour ça.  Une association de consommateur ferait très bien l'affaire.  Ou même des agences privées d'évaluation des produits, travaillant en concurrence sur un marché libre.  Et pas besoin d'amende.  Il suffit de dévoiler publiquement la fraude.Les USA ne sont plus le modèle du libéralisme depuis un bon moment.Quant à l'idée d'un pays qui "m'encourage à faire de bons choix", non merci.  Je ne veux pas d'un État nounou, j'ai passé l'âge.Note aussi que l'idée d'un État qui "encourage à faire les bons choix" est très Orwellienne.  Quand l'État commence à inculquer des idées dans la tête des gens, on est dans la propagande et l'endoctrinement.Si elle n'est pas disponible, tu n'achètes pas.   Si suffisamment de gens fontcomme toi, ça incitera les producteurs à rendre l'information disponible.  Tu crées une demande d'information, et le marché répond à cette demande.  C'est pourtant pas compliqué. Je n'ai pas les connaissances techniques nécessaire pour discuter de l'amiante, mais il me semble que l'Etat l'a autorisé pendant des années et ne l'a interdit que quand il y a eu des morts.  Une régulation comme ça, le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est que c'est pas terrible.Une loi ça sert pas à grand chose s'il n'y a personne pour vérifier qu'elle est appliquée correctement.   Mais bon si c'est ça ta conception de "l'étiquetage obligatoire", alors je suis preneur !En utilisant son sens critique.  Pas en comptant sur l'État pour réfléchir à sa place.Si tu achètes un produit sans t'enquérir un minimum, ne va pas te plaindre ensuite si tu as achèté de la mauvaise qualité.  Et les marques, ça existe partout, y compris dans l'immobilier et l'électroménager.Effectivement les discussions entre pastèques et anarcap tournent souvent au vinaigre.  Mieux vaut ne pas s'éterniser. (registering to this thread) D'abord, je n'aime pas la phraséologie "obsolescence programmée", et tout le discours qui va avec et qui essaie de nous faire croire que c'est nouveau et que c'est une tendance vers laquelle se dirige la production industrielle de nos jours.  Des gens qui fabriquent de la daube et qui essaient de la refourguer en nous faisant croire que c'est de la balle, ça n'a vraiment rien de neuf.  Rien de nouveau sous le soleil.Ensuite, il n'y a vraiment, VRAIMENT, aucune raison d'imposer quoi que ce soit par la loi.  L'étiquetage dont tu parles peut très bien émerger naturellement des conditions de marché.  Les associations de consommateurs peuvent tout à fait émettre des critiques sur les produits.  Plus généralement, derrière le concept même de "marque", il y a la notion de réputation, et ça suffit amplement à protéger le consommateur.  Les gens n'ont pas besoin que la loi leur dise qu'une BMW est plus robuste qu'une Renault pour le savoir.Tu parles d'un "indicateur obligatoire de durée de vie".  Je dis que c'est de la foutaise, pour plein de raisons.  Je ne mentionnerai que la nécessité d'une bureaucratie écrasante pour faire respecter un tel étiquetage.  Si tu tiens vraiment à un tel étiquetage, il te suffit de ne pas acheter les produits qui n'en n'ont pas. I've been rediscovering Perl recently.  It's the coolest programming language I know.Code:#!/usr/bin/perluse strict;use warnings;use Digest::SHA qw(sha256);my @base58 = (1 .. 9, 'A' .. 'H', 'J' .. 'N', 'P' .. 'Z', 'a' .. 'k', 'm' .. 'z');my $base58 = join '', @base58;sub decodeBase58($) {    my $_ = shift;    die "wrong format" if not m{^[$base58]+$};    for my $c (0..57) { s/$base58[$c]/ $c/g }    s/ /+58*/g;    return qx{dc -e "16o0d$_+n"};}sub encodeBase58($) {    my $_ = uc shift;    open my $bc, qq[echo "ibase=16; n=$_; while(n>0) { n%3A; n/=3A }" | bc |];    return join '', map { $base58[$_] } (reverse <$bc>);}sub checksum($) { return uc unpack 'H8', sha256 sha256 pack 'H*', shift }sub checkBitcoinAddress($) {    my $address = shift;    die "wrong format" if $address !~ qr(^[$base58]{34,35}$);    (my $h = sprintf "%50s", decodeBase58 $address) =~ tr/ /0/;    (checksum substr $h, 0, -8) eq substr $h, -8;}sub hash160($) {    # I have to use the shell here for there is no rmd160 in Digest:: :-(    my $h = shift;    open my $sh, qq{    echo -n "$h" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -binary |    };    return uc unpack 'H*', <$sh>;}sub hash160ToAddress($) {    my $_ = shift;    my $checksum = checksum "00$_";    $_ = sprintf "%34s", encodeBase58 "00$_$checksum";    tr/ /1/;    return $_;}sub publicKeyToAddress($) {    # Couldn't find a Perl library for ECDSA,    # so I use the shell here.    my $_ = shift;    return hash160ToAddress hash160 qx{    echo "$_" |    openssl ec -pubin -pubout -outform DER 2>&- |    tail -c 65    }} La gratuité des transactions n'est pas "un principe de bitcoin".   Un système sans aucun frais de transaction serait vulnérable aux attaques par innondation du réseau. La répartition de l'information entre deux individus n'a pas à être symétrique, ni dans le monde réel, ni dans un monde "parfait".  Pas dans le cas général, et donc à forciori pas entre un acheteur et un vendeur.Tu sais des trucs, je sais d'autres trucs.  Parfois on discute, on échange des informations.  Parfois non.  C'est la vie.Quand tu achètes un truc, tu achètes ce que tu vois.  Parfois le vendeur ajoute une fiche technique avec les détails sur la manière avec le truc est fait, mais il n'est pas obligé de le faire et s'il le fait c'est uniquement pour t'inciter à acheter.  Et dans tous les cas tu achètes en fonction des informations que le vendeur consent à te communiquer.  Il n'y a rien d'anormal à ça.Tu es responsable de ton achat.  Si tu achètes de la m.rde alors que tu pensais que c'était du caviar, c'est de ta faute.  Tout ce que tu peux faire, c'est ne plus acheter chez le vendeur qui t'a refilé cette m.rde, et raconter ta mauvaise expérience commerciale à qui veut l'entendre, afin de ternir la réputation du vendeur.Impossible peut-être pas, mais c'est l'idée en tout cas.  Des produits de mauvaises qualités finissent immanquablement par être identifiés comme tels, et les acheteurs choisissent alors la concurrence.   Prends les bagnoles par exemple.  Si les voitures allemandes ont une telle réputation, c'est parce qu'elles sont belles certes, mais aussi parce qu'elles sont considérées comme robustes et fiables. Je te mentirais si je prétendais être surpris.Tout est dans la mesure, évidemment.  Si une caste représentant 1% de la population touche individuellement 1000 fois plus que monsieur tout le monde, c'est dûr de ne pas y voir un problème.Sinon, il y a mon alternative du toecoin  :-D Un truc qui m'énerve avec les opposants à bitcoin, c'est qu'ils sont incapables d'y voir ne serait-ce qu'une démonstration technique, une preuve de concept pour un truc qui pourrait très bien être utilisé par l'État ou tout autre quelconque institution légitimement habilitée à émettre des signes monétaires.C'est un peu comme si un type avait inventé un billet absolument infalsifiable, et que l'État continuait à utiliser des billets bêtement imprimés et donc recopiables par les faussaires.Bitcoin, avant d'être une devise monétaire, c'est d'abord un logiciel, une technique pour rendre la monnaie traçable et infalsifiable.   L'État (ou la BCE, comme vous voulez) pourrait très bien créer sa propre chaine et lui donner un pouvoir libératoire, voir une convertibilité.  Après tout c'est ce qui est fait de temps en temps pour l'or, puisque des pièces d'or et d'argent sont frappées de temps en temps, avec une vraie valeur faciale.  Cherchez "monnaie d'or et d'argent" sur le site de la monnaie de Paris.   La même chose pourrait être faite pour une cryptodevise. Bien sûr, mais dans ce cas ce n'est qu'une stratégie de production parmi beaucoup d'autres.  Les stylos, mouchoirs, rasoirs et autres appareils photos jetables, ça ne choque personne.  C'est effectivement une stratégie de production qui s'avère plus efficace pour certains usages.Ceux qui parlent d'obsolescence programmée colportent en général l'idée qu'il s'agit d'une sorte de complot international qui s'étend à tous les produits.  C'est juste n'importe quoi. En même temps si t'achètes des produits Apple en ayant conscience de ça, tu ne peux t'en prendre qu'à toi même.Il y a les garanties, la concurrence.  Et s'il n'y a pas de concurrence, alors c'est ça le problème, pas une prétendue obsolescence programmée.  C'est comme quelqu'un qui se plaindrait de la qualité de la nourriture de nos jours, alors qu'il ne mange qu'au Mac Do.  S'approprier est un bien grand mot.  Je dirais plutôt "utiliser".Tu t'appropries un truc quand tu commences à interdire aux autres de l'utiliser.
Je n'ai pas réfléchi à fond sur la question, mais dans la communauté libérale, la thèse du mythe a largement la préférence:Article : Lemythe de l'obsolescence programmée Ouep et ce sophisme a la vie dure puisqu'il y a encore des gens pour le ressortir, même dans les grands médias.  Ça n'a pas manqué après le Tsunami au Japon, par exemple  Concernant Bastiat, à noter que l'intégrale de ses écrits est disponible sur http://bastiat.orgPar contre sur l'obscolescence programmée, il y aurait *beaucoup* à dire, et dans l'ensemble on peut y voir un mythe entretenu par les gauchistes. Ouais c'était sympa.  Par contre je regrette d'avoir laissé Boussac m'embrouiller sur une discussion concernant le libéralisme et les dérivés.  J'ai eu du mal à y voir clair avec la bière et tout.En gros je disais que quand deux personnes s'arrangent entre eux font une transaction commerciale entre eux et entre eux uniquement, ça ne regarde personne d'autre, ça ne peut nuir à personne puisque personne d'autre n'est concerné, et que donc l'Etat n'a pas à s'en mêler.Et là il m'a sorti un truc bizarre sur le sophisme de la vitre cassée.  J'ai rien compris.Boussac, merci d'éclaircir ton propos quand t'as un moment.  Sur ce fil ou sur un nouveau.  Pas en MP stp. Perso j'en sais rien, j'ai juste trouvé le lien dans un journal sur linuxfr. Bigre, j'aurais jamais cru voir ça si tôt :http://videos.tf1.fr/infos/2011/bitcoin-la-monnaie-virtuelle-6571289.html crotte, je sais pas ce que j'ai fichu.52 31 20 15 79Je crois que j'ai chevauché en recopiant le numéro que je lisais.PS.  Bon pour moi c'est râpé.   Une autre fois peut-être. bon je mets mon numéro de mobile parce que je sens que ça ne va pas être si facile que ça de se retrouver.  SVP envoyez-moi un SMS avec le nom du café une fois que c'est décidé:$ read -s grondilu_telephone$ tr 0123456789 5678901234 <<<"$grondilu_telephone"52 31 20 01 15 79 Making a long chain of small difficulties requires time, as this information would be computed in a sequential manner.  That is the whole point, actually.  The other way of computing information is to make parallel calculus.  This would require much more power.  Shannon's information is easier to calculate by cutting it in smaller successive parts, i.e. in long chain of successive events, which is all what time is about.I actually think there is no qualitative difference between my algorithm and Satoshi's, but I don't understand Satoshi's algorithm well enough.  Anyway, I just think my version is just more "pure", and that it can allow to get rid of the 6 block per hour limit, for instance. +1À la base bitcoin est conçu pour résister à l'hostilité des gouvernements de toute façon.  Donc si la loi stipule que l'usage du mot bitcoin est interdit, ce n'est qu'un moyen comme un autre pour tenter d'empêcher l'utilisation de bitcoin.  Si bitcoin n'était même pas capable de résister à cela, il n'aurait pas beaucoup d'intérêt. There are very deep implications behind this assertion.  I'm still struggling to grasp them, but I believe this is the core idea behind using Shannon's information theory to measure time.I agree. Amongst my objectives:- separating the distributed timestamping server from the rest of the bitcoin application.  I believe a timestamping server should be an application by itself, as it could be used by other distributed systems ;- getting rid of the 6 blocks per hour limit ;- finding a theoretically ideal model for the idea of measuring time using chained proofs-of-work ;- implementing bitcoin (or a bitcoin alike system) in a higher level language than C++ ;Yes, but only if the user wants it to.  He can really put anything he wants, including a hash.It will indeed encourage users (and not miners, which are different people), to use the smallest possible payload.  I see this as a healthy way of saving memory space in the database.  Basically instead of puttting Justin Bieber's last concert video in the database, Justin Bieber's fans will instead put the hash of the video.  It will fullfill the purpose of timestamping the data.It aims to be a timestamping server, not a data storage system. I'm back on coding, as I am finally happy (more or less) with my networking design.  I won't use IRC or other fancy stuffs finally (I even considered using twitter via twidge).  Instead, I will use a IRC-inspired network.  All nodes will have a full copy of the database, but only those with public IP and CGI-capable webserver will be able to offer synchronization service to other nodes.  With enough servers and enough connectivity, the whole network can be decentralized and uniform.I also came up with quite a deep idea:  balancing Shannon information with memory size.  It's quite difficult to explain and I don't yet have a clear explanation of why it should be done, but I'm pretty sure it should be done.I have already implemented this idea for the payload (this is obvious), for the

J'y travaille jour et nuit ces derniers temps.  Cf mon fil sur l'information de Shannon. J'ai signé.  Je reste curieux de voir sur quoi bosse la communauté bitcoin francophone. Guys, this stuff is totally blowing my mind.  As I keep modifying my design again and again, I get to think more and more about the whole thing, and the more I do that, the more I realize how deep it is.I think it goes way beyond currencies and information technology.  I'm starting to get convinced that it is related to fundamental physical concepts such as time, energy, uncertainty principle and Everett's interpretation of quantum mechanics.   I'm really starting to think that I'm up to something big.The idea of using chained proofs of work to measure time was something that I immediately blew me up when I got to know about bitcoin.  Now I realize why.  This idea is full of profound consequences.If one agrees to define time as "a causal sequence of events", then it does make sense to use probabilities of these events to measure time.  And if you want to have additive properties for this thing you measure and that you call time, then it's not exactly probabilities you should use, but rather the Shannon information of these probabilities.  Now, instead of saying you are measuring, what if you say that you are actually defining it?Finally, if you remember that quantum mechanics is all based about probability waves, you're beginning to realize how cool this idea is. Didn't know about this freecoin thing.  I'll have look someday if I have time.I had several other ideas, such as using the chain as a data storage, and having nodes pay for each bit of information

MtGox is back and they have a pretty straightforward API so it's ok to do pretty much anything, really. Could someone write a C/C++ program that could allow me to test this portion of code in irc.cpp ?Code:#pragma pack(push, 1)struct ircaddr{    int ip;    short port;};#pragma pack(pop)string EncodeAddress(const CAddress& addr){    struct ircaddr tmp; tmp.ip    = addr.ip;     tmp.port  = addr.port;     vector<unsigned char> vch(UBEGIN(tmp), UEND(tmp));     return string("u") + EncodeBase58Check(vch);}I need to do some trial and error testing of the bash equivalent. decananobitcoindeca=10xnano=10^-9=>decanano=10^-8 In Shannon's meaning, one bit is an amount, it is not '1' or '0'.  It is one bit.  It halves the uncertainty because if you add one bit, you divide the probability by 2, by definition. No, because the amount of information is not the same for both sentences, as rain in Sahara is much more of an unlikely event as rain in Oxford. Thanks for the tip about netcat, I didn't know about it.  So many things toknow and only one life ;( Thanks for this reference.  I am a huge fan of Richard Dawkins and I will read the link you provided.  Your description of the subject makes it extremely relevant to this thread, as I realised that the cryptographic timestamp server I have implemented could be used as a currency.  I'll

Thanks for your comment.  I'll read that later but it's too late to discourage me, as I have just finished writing a prototype:http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/timestamp I worked hard during two days but I finaly wrote a minimalist distributed timestamp server in bash!!!Unfortunately I am once again in a cybercafé now so I can't publish it right now.   I'll do it tomorow, I promise.Stay tuned as I think this is gonna be an MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH in crypto anarchism! Guys, I am so excited about this new idea of mine that I can't wait until tomorrow when I get my usal internet access to tell it to you.  So I'm writing this from a cybercafé.  I hope you'll enjoy.I was working on my catalaxia project and I was thinking very hard about how I could avoid using Satoshi's compicated algorith for adjusting difficulty.  Somehow I beleived there should be a more elegant, mathematically pure way to do this.I was troubled by the idea of mesuring the "strengh" of a block chain, and I must confess I never managed to understand exactly how Satoshi does it.  I wanted something much more simple.Then I remembered my old lessons in physical statistics and information theory.   Then I thought about entropy and Shannon's information concept.Basically shannon's information is a way to measure unlikelyness of an event.  A bit like probability, but with additive properties.In probabilities, when two events e1 and e2 occurs in the same time, the probability of this to happen is the product of the probability:P(e1 & e2) = P(e1) * P(e2)Shannon wanted to have the same thing, but with additive property:I(e1 & e2) = I(e1) + I(e2)Obviously the solution was to use the logarithm function, so he came up with this formula:I(e) = - ln ( P(e) )And he called that "the information".  It's measured in bits if you divide by the natural logarithm of two, and it's quite a fascinating concept.Ok, enough for the theory.The idea now is to use this as a measure for the "weight" of a block.  Basically all we have to do is to divide 2^256 by the block hash, and take the natural logarithm.  The total information of the block chain is nothing but the sum of each information for each block.The good news is that we won't have to start the block chain from scratch or whatever, as the longuest block chain currently almost certainly has the highest Shannon's information.I think there are many advantages on this, such as simplicity and robustness.  There are also many interesting implications such as the possibility to make the information being a inside secondary currency inside the block chain, which could be used to trade between miners in order to avoid chain forks.  I'll explain later.There are many things to say about why I think this is a good idea, but right now I just wanted to tell it to you before someone else does, so I can claim the glory of being the first to have dropped it, in case it appears as great an idea as I think it is. Je n'ai que très vaguement suivi ce truc.  Mais je doute qu'ils distribuent l'adjudication. you need to learn to think like an avg Joe.  my steps are actually pretty easy and logical from a newbs standpoint.  the bash lines for non Linux users are too foreign and incomprehensible and would scare a newb.[/quote]My script is not intended to avg Joe.  At all.  It is really designed to be used by linux nerds. En gros, oui.  J'ai eu l'idée tandis que je développais mon projet "euronymous".  J'ai d'abord réalisé qu'il n'y aucune raison de le limiter aux devises, puis je me suis dit que je peux laisser les clients créer leurs propres actifs.C'est quand j'ai été sur le point d'attaquer le code de l'adjudication que l'idée m'est venue de répartir la tâche à la manière de bitcoin.Du coup j'ai complètement réécrit la chose et je l'ai renommée "catalaxia":http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/catalaxiaPour l'instant ce n'est pas du tout fonctionnel mais ça le sera très bientôt.  La FAQ et l'aide sont déjà dispo. This project is turning me crazy.First I realised there is no reason to limit the currencies to bitcoin andeuros.  Then I realized there is no reason to limit it to currencies.  So Ichanged it and started to developp a project that kind of looks like the loomproject.But then I had an even crazier idea:  what about decentralizing adjudication?The idea would be to use bitcoin-like concepts to distribute the adjudicationprocess amongst the clients.  Each of them would compute a proof-of-work on thebook of the orders they know about.  The winner publishes its results and getsrewarded by the arbitrage opportunities he could exploit in his order book.http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/catalaxia Une idée toute bête mais potentiellement révolutionnaire m'est venue à l'esprit cette nuit.  Quasiment une révélation.En quelques mots:  appliquer les principes de décentralisation de bitcoin pourl'adjudication d'un carnet d'ordres.L'idée c'est que tous les noeuds se communiquent tous leurs ordres (achat ouvente sur des actifs quelconques).  Chaque noeud effectue l'adjudication desLes noeuds vérifient que la preuve de travail est bien conforme à la difficultéen cours, ordres dont il a connaissance, et en même temps cherche une preuve detravail sur son carnet d'ordres.  Lorsqu'il a trouvé, il publie à tous lesautres noeuds à la fois son carnet et l'adjudication correspondante.Les noeuds vérifient que la preuve de travail est bien conforme à la difficultéen cours, et que l'adjudication est conforme au protocole sur lequel chacun estsensé être d'accord (ça devrait pas poser trop de problème).Pas de frais de transaction, ou alors des frais volontaires.  Les adjudicateurspeuvent aussi se rémunérer en arbitrant leurs carnets.  Ayant le privilègetemporaire de l'adjudication, ils sont les seuls à pouvoir exploiter eux mêmeles opportunités d'arbitrage.Je crois que c'est une riche idée et je vais bosser dessus très activement. successfully transfered a few euros via SEPA.   Bought a few coins.  The guys seem totally legit to me. Y'a beaucoup de gens qui postent "je suis partant pour faire la traduc", mais je ne vois pas beaucoup de traduction effective copiée-collée ici.:/
Well, this seems much more complicated than executing my code, which is just a few bash scripts lines.  The longest part is the conversion of the public key into a bitcoin address, but it's not that long. The site owner will be the only one who will be able of depositing paper currencies.So with this site, you CAN NOT buy bitcoins.  But you can sell them.By the way, here is the latest version of my

purpose of this site?</h2>            <p>This site aims to be a more or less anonymous bitcoin exchange            marketplace.  By more or less, we mean that our priority is to            provide anonymity for us, not for you.  Our main goal is to prevent            government from shutting our site down.</p>            <p>The reason we can not provide you any full anonymity, is that we            will need your postal address to send you your euros.  However,            your accounts are anonymous and you can create as many of them as            you want.  Therefore, we have no way to know exactly the total            amount of money you own in our book.  This ignorance offers you            some protection.</p>            <h2>What can I do on this site?</h2>            <p>You can trade bitcoins against other national currencies, mainly            euros.  You can create accounts, deposit bitcoins, withdraw            bitcoins, withdraw euros via cash in the mail, and trade            bitcoins/euros on your account against euros/bitcoins on some other            account.</p>            <h2>What can I NOT do on this site?</h2>            <p>You can NOT send us national currencies.  Receiving national            currencies anonymously is almost impossible (if you know a            method, please let us know).  Therefore, you can only fund your            account using bitcoins.  If you want to sell your national            currencies in cash, we suggest you mirror this site.</p>            <h2>Do you plan on publishing my postal address?</h2>            <p>No, we will publish an encrypted version of the address.  Only the owner            of the account will be able to decrypt it, so he can verify it was transmitted            correctly.</p>            <p>We shall, however, always publish the signature of each order, so that            we can prove our good faith in case of a disagreement.</p>            <h2>Why are you not online all the time?</h2>            <p>We have our reasons.</p>            <p>We shall try to be online at least a few hours every day,            though.  In the future, it should be possible to submit orders with            anonymous email via i2p for instance.</p>            <p>Right now, you can ping our webserver to check if we are online:</p>            <xmp>$ ping -q -c 5 $HTTP_HOST</xmp>            <p>Use this command in scripts if you want an order to be sent as soon as             the server is back online.</xmp>            "            ;;        help)            # command line client help HTML page            content            echo "            <title>$0 command line client help</title>            <h1>Sendings orders on command line</h1>            <p>To send commands you must use a bash command line function which            is <a href=$0?source_code>published with the server's source            code</a>.            </p>            <p>Here it is for convenience:</p>            <textarea rows=10 cols=80 readonly=yes>$(clientcode)</textarea>            <h2>Creating an account</h2>            <p>An account number is just the rmd160 of a public key.  Creating            one can be done offline since no commmunication with the server is            necessary.</p>            <p>Although the creation of an account can be made easy with our client (see below),             you can do it manually on your prefered shell command line.  Just run:</p>            <xmp>$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA</xmp>            <p>This will print on stdout a RSA private key that will be            perfectly suitable as a private key for an account on our server.            However, for better security, you might want to encrypt the output            using GPG: </p>            <xmp>$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA | gpg -e -r \$USER > priv.pem.gpg</xmp>            <p>To get the account number, you can run:</p>            <xmp>$ gpg < priv.pem.gpg | openssl dgst -rmd160</xmp>            <p>You might then want to copy paste the account number in order to rename the             file priv.pem.gpg:</p>            <xmp>$ mv {priv,ACCOUNT_NUMBER}.pem.gpg</xmp>             <p>Of course, you can write your own shell functions to automize this.</p>            <h2>Deposit bitcoins</h2>            <p>To deposit some bitcoins on your $0 account, you need to request            a bitcoin address where to send some bitcoins.  So basically you            will ask the server to run a <i>getnewaddress</i> bitcoin            command.</p>            <p>This can be done only once, or as many times as you want.  It's            up to you.</p>            <p>If you have already created an account as explained above, you can run:<p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient getnewaddress ACCOUNT_NUMBER</xmp>            <p>On the server side, this command will execute:</p>            <xmp>bitcoind getnewaddress ACCOUNT_NUMBER</xmp>            <p>Thus creating the appropriate bitcoin account if it doesn't            exist already.</p>            <p>The command will print the generated bitcoin address on stdout.            You can then use this address to fund your account.</p>            <p>If you had not already created an account, you can have the            client create one for you by running the getnewaddress command with no account number:</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient getnewaddress</xmp>            <p>Along with the bitcoin address on stdout, this command will also            create a private key in an ACCOUNT_NUMBER.pem.gpg file in the            current working directory.</p>            <p>You can retrieve a signed list of bitcoin addresses associated            to an account at this url (there is also a small html form on the home            page to do this):</p>            http://$HTTP_HOST/cgi-bin/$0?show=addresses&account=ACCOUNT_NUMBER            <p>This removes to us plausible deniability of an association            between a bitcoin address and one of your accounts.  We suggest you            keep a copy of this list for each of your accounts.</p>            <h2>Withdraw bitcoins</h2>            <p>To withdraw some bitcoins, you need to provide a bitcoin address            and an amount of bitcoins you want to receive.</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient withdraw AMOUNT btc to BITCOIN_ADDRESS</xmp>            This command will read the private key from stdin, so a complete command could be:            <xmp>$ euronymousClient withdraw AMOUNT btc to BITCOIN_ADDRESS < ACCOUNT_NUMBER.pem</xmp>            <p>Notice that in most shells you can place the redirection            wherever you want on the command.  Thus you could as well have            entered:</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient <ACCOUNT_NUMBER.pem withdraw AMOUNT btc to BITCOIN_ADDRESS</xmp>            <p>You can use GnuPG for more security:</p>            <xmp>$ gpg < ACCOUNT_NUMBER.pem.gpg | euronymousClient withdraw AMOUNT btc to BITCOIN_ADDRESS</xmp>            <p>Or:</p>            <xmp>$ <ACCOUNT_NUMBER.pem.gpg gpg| euronymousClient withdraw AMOUNT btc to BITCOIN_ADDRESS</xmp>            <h2>Withdraw euros</h2>            <p>To withdraw euros, you need to provide a postal address where to            receive cash via mail.  Only use multiples of 5 (in order to use            only bank notes).  Postal fees will be deducted from your euro            account.  For instance, if you withdraw ten euros, ten euros will be            sent but 10.55 euros will be deducted from your euro balance.</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient withdraw AMOUNT eur to POSTAL_ADDRESS</xmp>            <p>Again, this command reads the private key from stdin.</p>            <p>POSTAL_ADDRESS should be a double or single quote enclosed            string.  Please do not put any carriage return or other fancy            character in the address.  It might false the signature process.            Use a semi-colon ( if you want to specify a carriage return.</p>            <p>Exemple:</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient withdraw 50 eur to \"Satoshi Nakamoto;42, unknown street,;Tokyo, JAPAN\"</xmp>            <p>For this kind of order, the command is not sent in clear through            the internet.  Instead, it is encrypted with the server's <a            href=$0?pubkey>public key</a>.</p>            <h2>Transfer funds from one account to another</h2>            <p>To do so you can run:</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient transfer AMOUNT {eur|btc} to ACCOUNT_NUMBER</xmp>            <p>AMOUNT should be a positive number.  This commands reads private key from stdin.</p>            <h2>Trade bitcoins vs. euros</h2>            <p>To submit a trading order, you run a command such as:</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient trade 5.982 btc -19.43 eur</xmp>            <p>Use signed values to indicate the direction of your trade:            negative for the currency you want to sell, positive for the            currency you want to buy.</p>            <p>Only use three letters currency ISO            code.</p>            <p>This command also reads the private key from stdin.</p>            <p>You can use shell expansion magic if you want to make a trade            on a more conventionnal price/amount notation.</p>            <p>Example: buying 50 bitcoins at  16.4 EUR/BTC</p>            <xmp>$ amount=50 price=16.4; euronymousClient trade \$amount btc -\$(dc <<<\"4k \$amount \$price *n\") eur</xmp>            <h2>Cancel an order</h2>            <p>Euro withdrawals and trade orders are the only orders you can            cancel.</p>            <p>You can cancel a trading order as long as the order has            not been fully executed.  Cancellation of a partially executed            trading order will only prevent the rest of the trade to be            adjudicated.            <p>You can cancel a euro withdrawal as long as the letter            has not been sent yet.</p>            <p>To cancel an order, just run:</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient cancel REFERENCE_NUMBER</xmp>            <p>REFERENCE_NUMBER is a reference number published in the <a            href=$0?orders>list of all orders</a>.  It is actually the md5sum of the            signature.</p>            <p>This command reads the private key from stdin.</p>            <h2>Checking</h2>            <p>You can visualize an order, whether it is a trading, withdrawal            or cancelling order, by running:</p>            <xmp>$ euronymousClient view ORDER_REFERENCE_NUMBER</xmp>            <p>If the order is a euro withdrawal order, thus containing a            postal address, then the command will read the private key from            standard input in order to decrypt the command.</p>            "            ;;        order=*)            # viewing specific order            ref="${QUERY_STRING#*=}"            content plain

REMOVED Pardonu? There will be no HTML-form based interface.  It's really a pain in the ass to program imho.  And such things exist already.My plan is really to build a HTTP server for a command line client.The web server will only be used to publish informations and general help.When the site is ready the plan is to publish it on a hidden TOR server.Right now I'm publishing it with my real name as I see no way anyone can claim I am doing anything illegal.  This site doesn't work yet so I can't do any actual trading.  Publishing it is really a matter of free speech. Guys I'm so enthusiastic about this new project of mine that I can't resist publishing it even if it's currently a work in progress.The FAQ is already here, along with the command line help, and many of the difficult technical parts are done (signing, verifying and encrypting orders, protecting the database with locks, and so on).I think it is going to be pretty cool.Check it out:http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/euronymousIt's 100% GNU/bash CGI  This is indeed a nice idea.  With a classification of discussed themes (nobody wants to focus too much on technical discussions). I have received my funds but I see this delay, along with declarations of MtGox willing to collaborate with authorities, as a warning.I'll send less money and I registered to other exchanges. Yes, as a french person I can confirm that "Le Monde" is the most important newspaper in France.  I'll check the paper edition in case there is something. works fine here.curl --sslv3 -k -d "name=yourname&pass=yourpassword" https://mtgox.com/code/getFunds.php ; Mi ne sxatas tiun neologismon.   Mi vere preferas uzi 'bitkojno' aux 'bitmonero'. Je crois que les gars de paradigm shift cherchent toujours un conférencier pour début octobre:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11380.0 Registered today.  Transfered a few euros via SEPA.I'll let you guys know if everything went smooth. Comme je l'ai écrit aujourd'hui sur linuxfr, faut arrêter de promouvoir les bitcoins.   C'est évident que ça donne l'impression qu'on essaie d'attirer des nouveaux pour se faire des sous.J'en ai un peu marre de visionner des vidéos et de lire des articles de plus en plus violents contre le projet.  C'est pas constructif et c'est désolant.Bitcoin ne sera JAMAIS mainstream de toute façon.  Arrêtez d'essayer de convaincre.  Dans convaincre il y 'contre-vaincre', autrement dit il y a la notion de combat, de guerre.  C'est pas du tout dans l'esprit du truc. Which version of bash are you running?  (I suspect yours doesn't accept ${1^^})Mine is GNU bash, version 4.1.5(1)-release (i486-pc-linux-gnu) I've sent some money to MtGox about a week ago.  Not received yet.  It used to be way much faster.Something is wrong.

Walllet encryption is a completely different functionality from what bitcoin is supposed to do.  It should be implemented as a different software.  And in fact, it is.  Use truecrypt,  ecryptfs or whatever else. Yes it is, because people DO use contraception.  The current increase is basically only due to demographic inertia.Population increases not because of to many newborn children, but rather because of not enough old people dying.  Decreasing fertiliy even more would barely solve any problem, and bring others (putting humanity on the brink of extinction)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline This site is ranked 1,748 by alexa.  It's not extremely good.www.alexa.com/siteinfo/arstechnica.com Well, yes.  I'm not sure it's a good idea, though.  Just saying one might consider this in some particular cases.Also, it's quite important not to reveal how many bitcoins are buried this way, so that you are the only one who knows if it worth spending CPU to crack it.PS.  On second thought, I think it is a perfectly valid idea.  The idea of "burying" is made of two things:  1. finding a secret place where to hide something 2. dig a hole and put it there.Part 1. can be done using steganography,  and part 2. can be emulated with a random unknown passphrase, requiring some CPU (as digging requires physical work). An other interesting possibility would be to encrypt using a symmetric algorythm, and a passphrase that even you don't know.The idea is that the bitcoins could be retrieved only after a very long time.  It can be useful for instance if you want to make sure your bitcoins doesn't disappear after your death, or if you want to prevent yourself from being tempted to sell early:openssl  ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 | gpg -ac --passphrase $RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM |tee wallet.pem.asc-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)jA0EAwMCPX45Ddqs8uxgycAvE6r7wFVa/xH4U99ZBjmmf89yJUUhFcSGGD8ja2U8r9HuLlTvBf0gvHADFjMH00C53U96oR206yKncSDFpbeK8Pdja3HR3AISlzVZbrsS3c3jpNGPdDMpR16Mggv301i0UKAGJpNXckvG9LQO2xS3jzA/EF+SU3WAN80NxXn9f9tdoQ7gR5/0HFwH6dxYlFnhEHJtZLMLI1wnompKFnpPKbhUxq2wod1MMfGaPEJC6qrE3l59HGeGxbNSYmMu6eXayqGb5jmkZXi06nArUQIw2rw1Nzw2h7jmxz2LxMYn95e9cYXdc9vPkP057TFB0BI==lr4W-----END PGP MESSAGE----- Hors de question !  Ce serait un peu comme si je faisais leur boulot à leur place. People whining about hoarding don't realize that hoarding is not so easy.As the price of bitcoin raises, it's becoming more and more difficult to resist the temptation of selling.I can tell you that the day I can sell my bitcoins to buy a nice house near the beach, I will probably do it.   I can feel it right now, as my current bitcoin holdings begin to get a substantial value, at least theoretically.That's why hoarding is not a threat:  at some point anyone will start to sell, and the less greedy will sell first, thus reducing the price and "punishing" the more greedy.IMHO No it is not. je sens que c'est pour bientôt.  C'est juste pas possible qu'avec tout le buzz actuel ça ne remonte pas à leurs oreilles.S'ils n'en parlent pas d'ici quelques semaines, soit ce sont de mauvais journalistes, soit ils ont conscience de la menace que constitue bitcoin envers le système bancaire et il ne veulent pas se faire d'ennemis dans ce milieu. Some women are geeks, but very few are nerds.  Bitcoins is much more for nerds than for geeks.

OMG,  if this is not mainstream, then what is??? One funny thing is that we don't actually need bitcoin to have financial privacy.Financial privacy was possible as soon as assymetric cryptography was invented.  Strangely enough, nobody asks why one should give his name and address when opening a bank account.  A public key should be enough. I'm pretty sure people do not consider financial privacy as being some kind of a right.Financial privacy is incompatible with income tax.  And very little people consider income tax as being non acceptable. EDIT: on second thought I think this should be in "off-topic".  Could an admin move it please?In each cypherpunk podcast they play those words from the movie matrix :I didn't enjoy this movie much, but now when I hear those words I am suprised how relevant they are.
Banks will not be needed anymore.  They will disappear.   Everything will be software-oriented.There is no alternative in a world where money is digital. I'd rather write an enigmatic:"I bought this T-shirt at block 123440" You don't need banks to borrow money.  Just search "auction bond" in the marketplace forum.True.  But I suspect some people will have difficulties to understand that once they get sacked. True.  I'm counting on you guys. +1please lock this topic now before trolls pop out. You can receive some bitcoins without even installing the client.  You can also use this method to export some bitcoins into a file, without worrying about your backup file being altered later (after creation of new addresses in your wallet for instance).Enter the following bash functions in your command line:Code:#!/bin/bash# base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})bitcoinregex="^[$(printf "%s" "${base58[@]}")]{34}$"decodeBase58() {    local s=$1    for i in {0..57}    do s="${s//${base58[i]}/ $i}"    done    dc <<< "16o0d${s// /+58*}+f" }encodeBase58() {    # 58 = 0x3A    bc <<<"ibase=16; n=${1^^}; while(n>0) { n%3A ; n/=3A }" |    tac |    while read n    do echo -n ${base58[n]}    done}checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    xxd -p -c 80 |    head -c 8}checkBitcoinAddress() {    if [[ "$1" =~ $bitcoinregex ]]    then        h=$(decodeBase58 "$1")        checksum "00${h::${#h}-8}" |        grep -qi "^${h: -8}$"    else return 2    fi}hash160() {    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -binary |    xxd -p -c 80}hash160ToAddress() {    printf "%34s\n" "$(encodeBase58 "00$1$(checksum "00$1")")" |    sed "y/ /1/"}publicKeyToAddress() {    hash160ToAddress $(    openssl ec -pubin -pubout -outform DER |    tail -c 65 |    hash160    )}Then you generate and encrypt a new private ellyptic curve (replace grondilu by your GPG id):openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 |gpg -ae -r grondilu |tee wallet.pem.ascThis saves and prints the encrypted private key:-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)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=P2mb-----END PGP MESSAGE-----To see the corresponding bitcoin address, just run:gpg < wallet.pem.asc |openssl ec -pubout |publicKeyToAddress This gives me this:1QAVk6rZ8Tzj6665X3v1yPGfKwNHFjGV4yAnd basically this is a bitcoin address where you can send the money you want to save.I don't know yet how you can retrieve those bitcoins later.  But it doesn't really matter if you want to save it long term "burrying your bitcoins".  It surely is possible to retrieve them, though.PS.  If you think this message is useful, you can send some cents to the above address  I don't think that the system was about to collapse anyway.  It would have survived, after a big devaluation, a world wide depression, possibly a few wars.  But in the end banks would still profit from it all.Cryptocurrencies are necessary to destroy the banking system for good. Even for a huge fan of bitcoin like me, sometimes bitcoin seems so disruptive that it scares the shit out of me.This is going to bring tears and sorrow, as many people's job will suddenly become pointless.  A whole economic sector, mainly related to banking industry, is about to collapse.  Educated people are going to need to start again from scratch.  They will have learnt tons of stupid regulations and intellectual structures for nothing.  Pure freaking waste.  They will definitely not be happy about that.It is certainly going to be painful for a lot of people, and many people will claim that bitcoin is a bad thing because it brings chaos.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction Who would be in charge of guaranteeing convertibility ?  Basically there would be some big safe somewhere, where people could exchange their golden bitcoins into physical gold.This would expose the storage facility to government seizure. I'm third  bitcoin vs webmoney vs moneygram: Il y a déjà bitcoin-central, et c'est surtout de compétences juridiques dont ils ont (il a) besoin.Ceci étant la concurrence est bienvenue bien sûr. There is nothing to be "implemented".  Basically all you have to do is to borrow bitcoins.  And this is easy.  The simplest way to do that is to issue a bond on biddingpond.   You just have to start with small amounts in order to gain reputation.Now stop trying to find any more excuses and just do it. Basically shorting consists in selling something you don't actually own.  That's why it does make sense if it is economically quite difficult to do so.You can't sell something you don't own unless you are capable of convincing someone that you will own it in the future.  If you are a nobody, sure it will be difficult, and the more you want to short, the more difficult.   Nothing wrong with that.Also, if you think there is a market for bitcoin-shorting instruments, what about you offer this kind of financial service ? (instead of just complaining) Shorting bitcoins is easy straightforward:1.  Go to some marketplace, whether here, on freenode #bitcoin-otc or wherever ;2.  Convince someone to lend you some bitcoins ;3.  Sell those bitcoins, for instance on MtGox ;4.  Wait for bitcoin to crash ;5.  Buy enough bictoins to repay your debt ;6.  Profit ; /mode smart ass onSlaves usually want to please their master.  That's why they want to use the currency their master tells them to use.  To them, something has to be written "legal tender" on it, otherwise it is worthless.Slaves takes a huge part of contemporary economy.   When you enter a grocery store, chances are that the guy behind the desk is an employee who works for the shop owner.  And chances are that this shop owner is indebted to some banks.  All those people will want you to pay them with the national currency, the only one that government officially supports.Enjoying paper as a currency is their right.  So we won't try too hard to convince them to use real money.   Slave money is cheap anyway, since the masters keep printing so much of it all the time.So we just have to buy this slave money whenever we need it, and exchange it against bitcoins or precious metals whenever someone gives us some./mode smart ass off cool  J'y serai si j'arrive à m'en souvenir. C'est à Paris intra-muros, pas en banlieue ?   On peut avoir un lien vers votre association afin qu'on se fasse une idée du truc ("Paradigm shift", c'est un peu vague pour une recherche google) ? +1.J'ai d'ailleurs posté un message sur ce sujet, bitcoin as a metacurrency. we have a thread already about this:http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=5951.0
I don't understand exactly what we mean by anonymous transaction.If Alice and Bob want to trade some stuffs, what prevent them from using GnuPG to do both negociation and bitcoin address communication in an encrypted manner??I know that Bob could be a police officer pretending he's just a customer, but still... up for newbies I bet this thread is going to be at least 50 pages long, and that it will reach Godwin point several times. I just imagined that in the next season of breaking bad, the storyline is around White and Pinkman who find out about bitcoin and start their own selling business, thus competing against Los Pollos Cie. and therehow engaging a new drug war.Maybe not for this year's season, but for the next one  Do it.  You'll make miners happy.   Crap.  You're right.  Bitcoin doesn't provide much novelty here.  I totally missed that point.My bad.  I lock this thread as I don't want other people to point it out. Why does the participants send their private key??  Shouldn't they send their public key instead?Also, I doubt it is possible to deal with a bitcoin user with only one address.Making a bitcoin-pegged currency is a fair idea.  But there are certainly much simpler ways to do so.You might consider the loom project for instance.  Or opentransaction, LETS and other complementary currencies software.Also, please notice I wrote some bash functions that allow to turn a openssl generated public key into a bitcoin address:Code:#!/bin/bash# # This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.## Requires bc, dc, openssl, xxd#base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})bitcoinregex="^[$(printf "%s" "${base58[@]}")]{34}$"decodeBase58() {    local s=$1    for i in {0..57}    do s="${s//${base58[i]}/ $i}"    done    dc <<< "16o0d${s// /+58*}+f" }encodeBase58() {    # 58 = 0x3A    bc <<<"ibase=16; n=${1^^}; while(n>0) { n%3A ; n/=3A }" |    tac |    while read n    do echo -n ${base58[n]}    done}checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    xxd -p -c 80 |    head -c 8}checkBitcoinAddress() {    if [[ "$1" =~ $bitcoinregex ]]    then        h=$(decodeBase58 "$1")        checksum "00${h::${#h}-8}" |        grep -qi "^${h: -8}$"    else return 2    fi}hash160() {    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -binary |    xxd -p -c 80}hash160ToAddress() {    printf "%34s\n" "$(encodeBase58 "00$1$(checksum "00$1")")" |    sed "y/ /1/"}publicKeyToAddress() {    hash160ToAddress $(    openssl ec -pubin -pubout -outform DER |    tail -c 65 |    hash160    )}So if you want to create a private key and see the corresponding bitcoin address, you can run:$ openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey |tee priv.pem| openssl ec -pubout |publicKeyToAddress By the way it was also nice to hear Max Keiser talk about linux (around 06:45). No, the secret agreement would be to pay back a percentage of the wage.Basically you receive say 100$ each week.  You convert them into bitcoin on the current exchange rate, and you get, say 10 bitcoins.  The agreement is to give back 10%, so you give one bitcoin back to your employer and you keep nine bitcoins.Also, part of the agreement can be of some fixed wage amount expressed in bitcoins.  This should protect the employee against too a strong devaluation of the dollar.So the wage would be made of this:- the minimum wage in USD, paid only in order to comply to labour legislation ;- a secret percentage paid back to the employer.   Could be from 0 to 100% ;- a secret wage in bitcoins.  Could be 100% of the real wage. No, as she already received her salary in dollars from Bob. Very true.  Television sucks, really.Anyway: Alice is looking for a job.  Bob wants to hire her.B: I would like to hire you but due to minimal wages laws, I can't afford to pay you.A: Yes I understand, I'm a liberal myself and I think minimal wages make employment more difficult.  Couldn't we find an agreement?B: What are you thinking about?A: Well, you officially pay me on minimal wages, in dollars.  And at each pay roll, I send you some percentage using bitcoins.  We keep this between you and me.  Off the book.B: I see, using bitcoins should allow to avoid any regulators problem. Sounds fine to me.  It's a shame we have to behave like criminals just to work together, though. The so-called "guy" is Jon Matonis and he's a regular on this forum.He did a brilliant and indeed very professional job explaining bitcoin to Max Keiser. already mentionned in the "bitcoin press hits" thread.But this is such a good interview per se, that I guess it deserves its own thread. You're welcome.How comes you haven't told us about your invitation by Max Keiser?Anyway, you've done a brilliant job answering Max's questions.  Congratulations.  Definitely one of the best video

2D25251D1D16160F0F08080101F9F9F3F30000B3E5E620F5C5C0AEABA1E198") Yeah I guess you're right.  Maybe the message"We are anonymous.  We are legion.  We do not forget.  We do not forgive.  Expect us."could be translated into:"People exist.  They are numerous.  They don't forget.  They don't forgive.  Fear them." To me anonymous is an attempt to create a secret public organisation,  some kind of a cyber-freemasonry.It is also some kind of a phyle, and it is the first I've ever heard of, so it might have some historical interest in future.But due to inconsistency in structure (for instance the lack of protection of the integrity of their messages with no digital signature whatsoever), it is an epic fail in my opinion. No.I could write something like that:« WE ARE ANONYMOUS.  WE ARE LEGION.  WE DO NOT FORGET.  WE DO NOT FORGIVE.  EXPECT US.OBAMA IS A COOL PRESIDENT.  WE ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM IN 2012, AND WE INVITE EVERYONE TO DO THE SAME.WE ARE ANONYMOUS.  WE ARE LEGION.  WE DO NOT FORGET.  WE DO NOT FORGIVE.  EXPECT US.»  This is a silly example, but you get the idea.It might sound paradoxical, but basically I think there is no contradiction in being anonymous and signing your messages. I'm not "angry".   I just think this movement is silly, since anyone could pretend to be part of it.
I don't understand why the anonymous don't sign their messages.  I'm not talking about a named signature, but about a few GnuPG signatures with no real name.So at least we could make sure that each new message has been written by the same people who wrote the previous ones. You're kidding but it's a serious question you're asking.I buy bitcoins so I support the market and thus give you some incentive to mine.  Isn't that good enough? Has a cyberwar just started or something?While the pools are off, you guys are doing solo mining, right?   You don't just have your computers wait doing nothing, do you? Ah, finally!   Thanks!     How ironic it would be if we decide to make one for them, just to get over with this thing! For what it's worth, here is my opinion about mining.Mining is a race, a competition.   And in any race, not everybody can win.  So to me, mining is pointless and it's much simpler to just buy bitcoins......UNLESS:- you're a computer-nerd.  You enjoy dealing with a lot of complicated hardware, and you are good at setting them up ;and/or:- you have access to very cheap hardware and electricity ;and/or:- you are extremely smart and thus you are capable of implementing your own mining software or dedicated device (FPGA, ASIC, whatever) ;and/or:- you are concerned about the overall bitcoin security and thus you want to bring as much computing power to the network as you can, even if it will not give you many bitcoins in rewardI personally don't mine as I don't fit in any of the above exceptions.   To me, mining would be as silly as signing up for a marathon against professional runners (I can't run more than a mile or something  ) I hope you realize that there is room for several approaches.   In order to implement your stuff, there is no need to alter bitcoin in any way.  Just fork it, and use it with people who share your point of view about money.   The bitcoin community will keep using bitcoin, and your community will use your inflacoin.Bitcoin doesn't even need to be accepted in many places.  If I want to buy something in a "inflacoin-only" store, I'll just buy enough inflacoins with my bitcoins on the exchange market.  And everyone is happy. +1 I don't play any video games, but I had the following idea while I was reading an article about some MMORPG.  I hope you'll find it interesting.Ever since I learned about the proof-of-work concept (quite a bit before I learn about bitcoin), I've always thought this idea is pretty cool.  Don't know why, but it's a fact:  there is something I immediately liked about this idea of using a hash function to challenge the computing power of a machine.Now, when I think about some MMORPG, it appears to me that the concept of force is pretty lame there.  Basically you have a soldier whose strength is nothing but some parameter.   It's easy to modify (even if the game admins won't let you do it easily, but anyway).  There is a limit to it, and it's somehow 'costless'.   Someone with priviledge access to the program could get as much strength as he wants.  This is not cool and it does not fit with the idea of "strength".So, what about using proof-of-work to emulate the physical concept of force?Say, two soldiers wield their swords against each other.  The program would require each soldier's computer to solve some hash challenges in order to determine which sword gets to be thrown to the ground.More generally, there is probably some way to emulate the basic mechanical concept of force and power.To apply some force, the user asks the program for some hash-challenges to solve.  All this would be public, so that opponents can check that the guy is not cheating.  Better:  opponents provide challenges, so they don't have to trust the game admin.So, during a fight, each player sends hash-challenges to the opponent, and the amount and speed rate they can sole determins the force they can apply to their sword.I think a game would be much more fun to play if you can hear you GPU struggling during an intense fight.  At the end, the stronger player will be the one with biggest computing power.  But there are other ways than pure strength to win a fight:  ruse, speed and stuffs like that. PS.  That's it.  As a proof-of-concept, I'll see if I can find some time to create the electronic equivalent of an Arm wrestling game website.  .  You are a local tyrant or something? Right now the price of one bitcoin is not stable because it's such a new currency and very little people know it even exists.   Give it time.   Eventually it will stabilize once everyone in the world will know about this currency.   And then it will stabilize because the overall quantity of bitcoins will stabilize.I barely understand what this would mean exactly.  Feel free to elaborate. It's kind of frustrating that nobody seems to want to use my bash functions to check bitcoin addresses.It only requires basic unix tools such as xxd, dc and openssl.Code:base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})bitcoinregex="^[$(printf "%s" "${base58[@]}")]{34}$"decodeBase58() {    local s=$1    for i in {0..57}    do s="${s//${base58[i]}/ $i}"    done    dc <<< "16o0d${s// /+58*}+f" }checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    xxd -p -c 80 |    head -c 8}checkBitcoinAddress() {    if [[ "$1" =~ $bitcoinregex ]]    then        h=$(decodeBase58 "$1")        checksum "00${h::${#h}-8}" |        grep -qi "^${h: -8}$"    else return 2    fi}   Price stability is not dezirable per se.   The idea of controlling prices defeats the very purpose of prices as economic signals.Many people would like to have stable prices just as many people would like to have nice weather every day.  But it is just a silly wish.Prices have to vary in order to reflect economic reality.   Trying to interfere to this only sends false signals in the economy. The original text is available here. Good luck with that. The word "faith" seems way more connoted than I thought.  So I replaced it with "confidence". What? Is ECDSA weak? Sorry I don't know any chinese, but I've noticed China has appeared in the Google trends listing about bitcoin.So I guess China is becoming aware of the future worldwide currency.  This is good news. China has appeared in the listing recently, Bejing being the third city in the 30 days traffic:http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoin&ctab=0&geo=all&date=mtd&sort=0
Another way to get a similar result is to have the lab rat student spend some time on this forum   Too complicated for me but if I was to try to attack the bitcoin network, I would probably explore an idea like that.The time adjustment algorithm might indeed be the most obvious possible weakness in the protocol. Nice.  Let's put it here if you don't mind: It's amazing that they don't use assymetric key pair cryptography.« According to a number of security researchers, the sale of stolen information and credit cards often takes place completely underground in secret credit forums, where hackers exchange or sell data. These forums are closed to the public, and people who join the groups are vetted by forum administrators to ensure they are not from law enforcement. »Those guys should use bitcoins to buy/sell those stolen credit cards. up for newbies Ok, ok.  Why not.  Also, he can adjust the amount of CPU power so that it makes the ratio mining/power consumption being profitable.  I guess.Seems quite risky, though. Being "on" is not the same as being actually computing.Even when those PC are used for gaming, I doubt they have a power consumption anywhere close to where it goes when they will be mining. If you control all the machines, you don't need to install a pool.  Just run the miner on each machine and have them transfer any generated bitcoins to a single address.My guess is you'll get fired in a matter of weeks, just long enough for your employer to see the increase in its electricity bill. Well, I don't know.  Maybe it's possible.  But it is surely trickier than what you seem to think.   For instance, say indeed some node sees an inconsistent entry in the table.  It has to tell every one.  They all have to check the accusation is true and then they all have to decide to ban the bad timestamp server, revoke its previous transactions (how many??), chose a new one and so on.   An ugly mess for sure. Hum... sounds interesting.  Any source/documentation about that? No.  A double-spending would not work this way.  The timestamp server would sign two transactions but will just wait a bit to publish the oldest one.  It will do as if there had been some network latency.  There is no way the other nodes can prove it was not honnest.setting one up is easy, sure.  But the tricky part is to chose one and to convince everyone to use the same.Bitcoin choses a new server every ten minutes or so, without having to wait for it to behave badly.  This is much better. a very famous french tech website:http://www.01net.com/editorial/533700/bitcoin-la-monnaie-virtuelle-qui-agite-le-web/This is huge for France as this website is really very famous there. It's not a totally bad idea.  Whom would new money be given to, though?Also, even if the time-stamping server could not steal money or create new one, it would still have the power to double spend.  So it would be difficult to obtain a consensus about who is trustworthy enough to get this power. So to speak bitcoin IS a system with centralized time server.  But the server changes every ten minutes or so.  So somehow, bitcoin is already an extreme version of what you are suggesting. Moi j'ai un compte particulier et j'utilise weboob pour consulter la liste de mes virements.Ce projet est intéressant mais demande pas mal de développement en python si vous voulez l'améliorer et donner plus de possibilités.  À l'heure actuelle, il ne permet pas encore de faire des virements mais ça n'est pas impossible en théorie.PS.  ah par contre le site de la CIC n'est pas supporté pour l'instant   Tout à fait, stormtrooper.Mais bon avec les bitcoins c'est un peu chaud quand même.  Parce que retirer ses bitcoins c'est nettement plus facile que de retirer du cash ou de l'or.  Donc amha le système de réserve fractionnaire est possible, mais avec un taux de réserve nettement plus élevé.   Plutôt de l'ordre de 90% que de 10% par exemple.  Seule une analyse statistique détaillée du comportement des clients (leur propension à préférer stocker eux-mêmes leurs bitcoins plutôt que de les confier à une banque) peut permettre de choisir un taux de réserve viable. You do realize that only Mc Donald's Cie can peg a currency to a big mac, right? Attention:  un moyen de paiement n'est pas une devise monétaire.D'après ce que je lis dans cet article le système proposé par google repose d'abord sur un équipement matériel, en l'occurence une puce dite sans contact (Nier Field Communication).Amha un smartphone doté d'un client bitcoin pourrait trouver une telle puce utile.  Ce serait sûrement plus rapide que de chercher un accès internet par Wifi, bluetooth ou 3G. Prices don't have to be stable.  They have to reflect economic reality.Trying to cheat with price signals does nothing good for the economy, and it defeats the purpose of the very concept of price. 0.00000032 BTC = 0.32 µBTC = 320 nBTC thumbnail:the four photos in full format:http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/20110525_001.jpghttp://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/20110525_002.jpghttp://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/20110525_003.jpghttp://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/20110525_004.jpg
You totally missed my point but whatever.  I'll just translate it in simple words and apply it to answer your post:Just do it man.  Just chose your algorithm, find a name for your currency and start using it.   Please do it already so we can have peace and spread the world about it.   But please don't mind if I stick to bitcoins, ok? Exactly.  Using force to defend property is expensive for sure.   But having the State do it, doesn't make it free.  It just makes everybody pay for everyone.   It's certainly not moral, and probably not even efficient. it is based on the fact that people have to be judged for they actually do, not for what you think they might do in some particular circumstances. I have nothing against any of these practices.Example:  so called price fixing:« where companies collude to set prices, effectively dismantling the free market. »There is nothing against free market in companies "colluding" to set prices.  They basically come to a agreement about their prices, and there is nothing wrong with that as long as they don't use force to prevent other people to sell at a lower price.There is a nice video of Walter Block I think, where he mocks that by comparing it to a joke about three guys in a russian prison.The first guy is asked why he is here and he answered:-  it's because I had an appointment and I arrived too late.The second guy said:- I didn't want to be late so I was there much earlier but they said it wasn't good too.Then the third guy said:- I arrived at the exact time and they said I had some secret arrangement to collude with the others in order to be there at the exact time, so it wasn't good either.Price regulation rules are just as ridiculous. This is nothing but an other version of "they took our job" whining.   It's annoying as hell.I don't give a crap about the reasons why someone suddenly starts to sell things at a ridiculously low price.  It is a given and it is outrageous to complain about that.  Competitive companies should just stop production, buy the competitive product if necessary, sack employees and stuffs like that until prices go higher again, if they do.   And if they have to shut down, be it.  This is the only thing that makes sense in a free market. How on earth are they supposed to know that just from an IP address? Is it me or this debate is going through an endless loop?http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=6775.msg99364#msg99364Personally I don't understand what's this concern of yours about monopolies.  If a monopoly is not enforced per violence, who cares?   A monopoly is fine if it emerges from market forces, and market forces only.  It just satisfies demand better.  Somehow, it is nothing but an extreme version of the labour specialization concept.Now, say a company uses its cash to dump its prices below production costs, in order to crush competition.  So basically it's just like this company was offering some stuffs to people.  How can that be a bad thing?  If you think it's not fair for the competition, you are just wrong.  The other companies can just stop producing/selling.Say I build a product with some producing cost.  If an other company starts selling the same product below this production cost, what's even the point of producing for me, now?  Hell, I could as well just buy the other company's production!Being capable of stopping production should be important for a company.  Otherwise it's just silly.  Free market just makes this clearer.  I haven't read the diamond age yet, but I know the story and I heard about the "phyle" concept.Of course there are several other worldwide dissiminated cultural groups, but none of them has a clearly strong, government-proof currency. Ok.  My bad.  I totally forgot about this legal status thing, especially the limited liability part and stuffs like that.I already had such a discussion with a so called left libertarian, and as a share holder myself, this gave me a freaking headache.He claimed that modern capitalism is based on this limited liability legal thing, as share holders don't have to respond to what the company does, at least not beyond what they personnaly invested.  So to him the state protects shareholders from legal and moral responsbilities that could be engaged by the company.  Then left liberals use this as a reason/excuse to do other state-involved stuffs such as universal dividends and stuffs like that.This personnaly gives me nausea.  Anyway, I just hope that at some point shareholdings will be truly anonymous (which is only possible with a truly anonymous currency), so that companies will not need the help of the state anymore in order to protect their shareholders. Sorry to intrude, but I've just red this amazing paragraph and I can't help noticing how ugly it sounds.Corporations are nothing but a bunch of people working together in order to reach a common goal.   You don't question the existence of people.  You may judge their acts, but not their existence.   And corporations do nothing but selling stuffs to people who are willing to buy them.  They force no one to do so. Can't avoid it anyway.  So we'll just have to deal with it.And no, it does not defy the purpose of keeping bitconis rare and stable.  The "original" bitcoin will stay rare and stable.  But they will be other cryptocurrencies.  I don't think it will be a problem though.Prices between different cryptocurrencies will be a matter of social consensus and economic desire for new, "fresh" money.  I don't think it will be a problem for the whole cryptocurrency concept.  It won't be much different from the time when most currencies in the world were private.Agreed.   There is no point having a lot of money if you die before spending it. Ben si les riches s'amusaient à accumuler et utiliser les bitcoins entre eux et à n'en laisser aucuns aux pauvres, ben les pauvres se créeraient leur propre fork.Donc pour répondre à ta question, je dirais "résoudre".Le bitcoin n'est qu'un outil.  Tout le monde, y compris les pauvres, est libre de l'utiliser ou de le modifier.Par ailleurs, c'est une erreur grossière selon moi que de considérer que la répartition des signes monétaires est représentative de la répartition de richesse. A typical economically oriented argument against bitcoin is the "bitcoin will eventually create a deflationary spiral" one.According to this argument, bitcoin will fail because it lacks a way to inject new money into the system in order to suit economic growth.I think most of bitcoin adepts answer this argument by defending the concept of deflation, explaining that it is really not so bad after all.  It's especially common amongst former goldbugs as myself.However, there is a much simpler argument, that doesn't even have to defend the idea of a deflation-friendly economy. In a keynesian nightmare, people would start to hoard bitcoins in such an extent that bitcoins become rare in circulation and thus prices start to fall.  Then people are even more inclined to hoard bitcoins, and that is the very deflationary spiral.   In such a situation, the lack of money in circulation will create a demand for money.  The failure of bitcoins to serve the economy will become more and more apparent and people will just start to want an other currency.   To put it simply, they will just create an other block chain.   Bitcoin is a tool to create money.  It can be started as soon as a social/economic consensus requires it.On the opposite, if the bitcoins do their job and allow trades to occur correctly, there is no need for a new currency and nobody will be willing to put any effort into a new block chain. Between those two situations some equilibrium has to be found by the market.  It can be observed by looking at the prices of the main cryptocurrency compared to other challenging cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin doesn't prevent from creating more money than what is written in the software.  It prevents from creating more bitcoins.  Mind the difference.   Basically monetary injection/destruction is possible with cryptocurrencies.  It's just that it obeys social consensus and individual economic freedom, and NOT central bureaucratic forced planification.

I really would like to see a cryptocurrency that would use David Chaum's blind signature algorithm instead of ECDSA. This is freakingly awesome idea!It surely will help to better distribute the overall hashing power, thus making the bitcoin network even more resilient.I'm not sure the client will be very happy to see his computer burning CPU for  no apparent reason, though.      But indeed it is probably better than annoying ads.   Again:  awesome idea. You are totally free to create your KlorthoCoin.   Go for it, really.   At some point anyway this kind of stuffs will happen.  Just don't be offended if I don't value your klorthocoin much.    just not noticed Gavin's new avatar.   It is so true that he looked like Spock in the Forbes article! Even if you use some kind of a source of verifiable random numbers from cosmic radiation or whatever, as long as the system is anonymous, it will fallback into CPU power or hardware ressource.Basically if the right to receive bitcoins is based on some sky event, then everyone will try to post as many sky predictions as possible, just in order to increase their probability of winning.  And the amount of predictions you can post would be proportionnal to your CPU. Yeah I liked this part:«I know a lot of individuals in government will react with normalcy bias to this statement and saybut we have to!. It doesnt matter if you have to. You cant. Period.»
Dude, no offense but you have 4 posts here.  Yeah but the poll is "mining or buying?", not "how do you get your bitcoins?", so I put every other way to get bitcoins in only one category.  I could have written: 'Neither mining nor buying.  I get bitcoins in some other way.' I'm not sure I've seen such a simple poll already.  Notice that to me begging or selling goods/services is the same as buying, but I'm pretty sure some people won't agree with that, so I made a distinct option. My guess is he totally lost his mind this day.  Possibly due to some health issue (brain damage or something). I personnaly think he just lost his mind that day.  Those things happen. idem.regarding hard drive encryption:$ apt-cache show ecryptfs-utilsPackage: ecryptfs-utilsVersion: 83-4Installed-Size: 464Maintainer: Daniel Baumann <daniel@NO_SPAM>Architecture: i386Depends: libc6 (>= 2.2), libecryptfs0, libgpg-error0 (>= 1.6-1), libgpgme11 (>= 1.1.2), libkeyutils1, libpam0g (>= 0.99.7.1), gettext-base, keyutils, libnss3-1d, libpam-runtime (>= 1.0.1-6)Suggests: cryptsetup, opencryptokiDescription: ecryptfs cryptographic filesystem (utilities) eCryptfs is a POSIX-compliant enterprise-class stacked cryptographic filesystem for Linux. . It provides advanced key management and policy features. eCryptfs stores cryptographic metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted files can be copied between hosts; the file will be decryptable with the proper key, and there is no need to keep track of any additional information aside from what is already in the encrypted file itself.

Hewitt: To me this DSK affair is a shame for my country.  Especially since french medias knew about his perverted behaviors, but they didn't talk about it, pretexting it was his "private life".I'm ashamed to be french, honnestly. I like it.It's tough to make a national radio ad about bitcoin without making it sound like some scam/commercial stuff.  I think you managed to make something that's clear about what bitcoin is.  I would have liked to hear it's open source software, though. If bitcoin is ever made illegal worldwide, I'll just hope international organized crime will have already started to use it and offer a shadow exchange service. L'acceptation d'un block ne peut pas dépendre de la perception qu'en a un noeud.  Car sinon on remplace une course à la puissance par une course aux noeuds (cf. plus haut).Je ne sais pas très bien comment est géré le timestamp en unité temporelles normales.  Je sais en gros que c'est une moyenne constatées sur les noeuds environnants, mais je sais surtout que ce n'est pas trop ce qui compte dans l'acceptation d'un block.  Le timestamp qui compte c'est celui qui est exprimé en unités temporelles machines, c'est à dire le hash lui-même.Si tu te fies à un timestamp conventionnel, alors il suffit de posséder suffisamment de noeuds sur le réseau pour mentir sur ton temps machine. Bien vu.  Ça m'avait échappé. Ton idée me parait difficile à mettre en pratique.Limiter le hash à une épreuve d'une trentaine de secondes toutes les dix minutes, c'est peut-être faisable techniquement (et encore je vois mal comment), mais de toute façon cela nécessiterait une difficulté bien plus grande (en gros d'un facteur 10*60/30= 20) pour garder un taux de forks comparable.  Donc ça s'oppose au but initial qui est de réduire la consommation d'énergie. @bruce:  There is not much to discuss, really.  I tried to release it on CC-BY license,  but maybe I should have tried to publish it on public domain.It's not a big deal, just do whatever you want with this file.   You can also search "blender flag" on google video.  You'll see it's quite easy to do it yourself. I wonder if there could be a way to create a shadow market exchange.Basically it would be like MtGox, but instead of explicitely trading bitcoins, we would trade some other digital stuffs, such as images.  The bitcoin transfers would still occur but in an hidden way.If some customers get "caught", others could just deny having done the same thing. Just curious:  does anyone still have the bitcoin address so I can have a look and see if he spent his bitcoins? Oh my god, how stupid is that!??What's the point of having a debt ceiling if congress keeps increasing it each time it is reached?It's a joke, right? Well, I guess it was really a black hole, as this guy probably lost interest in bitcoin and dropped his wallet.  Too bad for him, imho. This is one post out of 120729.On every forum at some point some people cross lines.Moreover, you're a moderator.  Feel free to moderate him.
I think it's rather 50% of bitcoin processing power, which is quite different.Basically this client would reject all transactions that don't include a fee to some particular address belonging to the government.   Neat idea. To be fair, their job was useful before bitcoin came out.  What was not acceptable was only the fact that they used government to enforce their monopoly on this economic sector.          I answered 'Totally'Somehow I wonder if I'll ever manage to free my mind from this whole project. God damn it I'm still waiting for some funds to be received by MtGox.  Bloody bank wire delays.... It will happen soon or later.  They'll have MtGox and other currency exchange closed.However, I'm pretty sure that won't destroy the bitcoin economy.   But only time will tell. Hi Jason,I've just realised that you are quite a famous and successful IT entrepreneur.  Welcome on this forum.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis tadaah: Yeah, I red this word for the first time as well.   I like it.  My god, is economic freedom so scary? The red spider: There are several metro exits.I agree with the arch being quite far away (not even mentionning the stairs).The red sculpture is a good meeting point.   Plus, there are several benches nearby, as we'll certainly have to wait for some people.As far as time is concerned, I suggest half past noon. I was rather thinking about the red sculpture, as the arch is a bit too a big place for a meeting point.  But I guess it will be much easier to spot on for people who don't know the place well.So the arch it will be. What is stored all over the internet is the full history of all transactions of everybody.What is stored on your PC and your PC only is the set of private keys that you use to sign your transactions.  If you lose those keys, nobody can help you to recover them.The file you should backup is called "wallet.dat".All these are standard newbie questions, please read the FAQ and visit the wiki. Mining is an investment.   There are risks because there are costs and no guarantee that the income will cover the costs.Miners should always keep in mind that mining is a race between all miners.  And everyone can not be a winner. I think this short dialog sums up bitcoin pretty well! Franchement je trouve que prononcer bitcoin à l'anglaise, c'est à dire "bitekauyne", ça fait encore plus ridicule dans une phrase française que la version francisée, c'est à dire "bitcoin" avec le coin comme dans le mot... coin, justement.D'ailleurs, un rapide coup d'oeil sur un dictionnaire ethymologique me confirme mes soupçons que les deux mots ont une origine commune:Coin est un mot en français qui n'est pas si rare, c'est pas qu'une blague débile au sujet du cri du canard sur #fdn.  Le site "leboncoin" par exemple ne s'appelle pas "leboncaujne". Lol,  I was hanging around on some forum about japanese anime, and I had the idea of using "Satoshi Nakamoto" as a pseudo for posting a comment.I think it could be cool if all bitcoin users were doing the same.  It could get people curious if they keep seeing this name everywhere they go.Somehow, it could turn "Satoshi Nakamoto" into a new "John Galt".It's a nice non-intrusive way to promote bitcoin, imho. I buy at any price.  If price gets very high, I just buy less, but I still buy.Every day I receive some stupid euros as dividends from my stock portfolio.  I must get rid of them and buying bitcoins is a nice way to say xxxx to JC Trichet, Ben Bernanke and cie.In other words, you forgot one type of buyer:  the one who is politically motivated. "bitcoins are not good for anything besides trading."How stupid is this assertion, seriously!When I hear it, I can't help thinking "yeah but trading is what money is about, you moron!"It is just as silly as saying:"a telephone is not good for anything besides talking to people."pff...
Guys, I suck at organizing this kind of things, but I'm pretty sure it will not be difficult to find a nice place even if we don't book a table.  I used to work at La Defense and we often had lunch at various places without booking.  So unless an other french guy wants to book something, there won't be any specific preparations.  It should be fine, really (and possibly more fun, too).However, considering the fact that we don't know each other (only Gavin's face is known, and no, I won't post a photo of my ugly face on this forum  ), I will PM my phone number to whoever on this thread wants it.  I'll also see if I can make a photo of the meeting point and post it on this thread.  Once we are gathered, we will search for a café/restaurant/whatever.I hope it sounds good to you. To me, it's rather like wishing for a nice sunny weather every day.  If the market is not stable, be it.   Let the market do its job, whether or not people like the way it does it doesn't matter. Ça manque de sondage ici.   Yeah but is there any way for sure to know when exactly the breakage occured?Anyway, don't bother to answer, as this is extremely unlikey anyway.  We might as well discuss about the arrival of aliens on Earth. I doubt SHA256 will be broken (and not just one collision found!) any time soon, but if it was to happen, don't underestimate the consequences on bitcoin, as anyone could create a longer block chain "from scratch", thus totally destroy the current one.We would have to switch to another hash function, but we would also have to start an other block chain, thus a new currency.IMHO $ sudo apt-get fire bernanke && sudo apt-get remove federal-reservelol No, since I can find cheaper at mtgox.Saying that I buy at any price doesn't mean I chose the worst offer. I buy at any price below 1000EUR/BTC. +1,  "on-the-fly" currency conversion is what we want. I know most people won't agree with me on this, but to me bitcoin will have success as a metacurrency.What is a metacurrency?    Well, as you know, a currency is something that is used as an intermediary to exchange stuffs, right?   Then, a metacurrency is something that is used as an intermediary to exchange... currencies.Are there other metacurrencies?  Yes, plenty of them.   Gold is the most famous one.  We used to buy consumer goods with gold, but we don't do that anymore.  You can't buy a pizza or a car with gold.  You have to sell your gold against national currencies first.   So gold is a metacurrency nowadays.   Other fiat currencies were meta currencies in their history.  So was the Écu before the euro in Europe, for instance.That's why I don't care much if my local grocery store doesn't ever accept bitcoins.  I'll just buy the lousy money it requests:  I'll possess this silly money just the time necessary to buy the stuff I need.  A few seconds basicallly.

I'm considering creating a "bitcoin" user on my machine, so that no troyan could read my wallet or send any bitcoins without knowing the bitcoin user's password.Would that solve the troyan problem? Moi je n'ai rien contre une prononciation à la française.C'est uniquement une question d'habitude amha. Less than 2 hours left, guys. Non, les 8% c'est sur le montant total.   Maintenant on peut toujours vendre de l'or sans payer ces 8% (par exemple quand on vend à un particulier), mais dans ce cas c'est une autre imposition qui s'applique.  Je connais pas les détails. L'or est assujetti à une taxe de 8% à la revente.La piste de l'association loi 1901 est à creuser sérieusement. Si tout ça n'est pas dans la FAQ française, faut l'y mettre. Peu de chance d'aboutir amha.  Si la BdF ne reconnait pas le bitcoin comme une devise, alors toutes tes transactionc sont assujetties à TVA, non?  Ce qui ficherait en l'air tout l'intérêt du truc.Demande conseil aux gars de MtGox, ils doivent s'y connaître.  Et plusieurs d'entre eux sont français je crois. Problem is that I was too lazy to think about a really good backup plan.I did backup for very important stuffs, but I've lost most of my sweet config scripts on my linux box.   It's a pain in the ass now that I have to reconfigure everything  I will definitely try to make much proper backups in future.
Ok, most of my bitcoins have been recover.  I had to wait for the index to be built at block 120,000 or something.Guys, the lesson I've learnt is: do not underestimate the importance of backups! hum...  bitcoind isn't responding now (block is 109,000 or something), but it seems to be building an index as I can see the file blkindex.dat growing.Hopefully I see some change once it's done. Still downloading the block chain.  Balance is still zero after block 105,000.The wallet I restored is from may, the 4th.   Funny thing is that when I type "bitcoind listreceivedbyaccount" I see the details of my balance per account. didn't work.damn it am I going to lose everything ? Doesn't seem to get my bitcoins.I try to stay calm and I think it might be a software version issue.I was running version 0.3.19 and now I am trying with 0.3.21Isn't there any non-compatibility issue about database format or something ? damn it I've already downloaded 92,000 blocks and my balance is still zero   I'm starting to worry now.   I received my first bitcoins around block 85,000   I don't have much hope about recovering anything from my disk.I could decrypt my wallet backup so it should be fine.  I'm currently re-downloading the full block chain, looking anxiously at the "balance" field  First time in 10 years that I have such a critical crash. No as I wasn't even able to mount it.  And fsck is returning many errors. Oh my god this is the first time ever I have such a linux crash!!!It seems that my system is absolutely unrecoverable!!!!!I'm currently sending this message from a freshly installed Ubuntu distro.   So far I've managed to recover some backups such as my GnuPG private key.I hope I'll have no problem getting my wallet back!Pray for me guys! Il y a aussi l'idée que l'achat de bitcoin est un arbitrage économique.  J'avais des euros et je les ai changés en bitcoins parce que je suis convaincu que bitcoin est une meilleure monnaie.C'est une des règles économiques que le marché fait tendre les actifs vers leur véritable valeur, grâce à des agents qui achètent l'actif quand ils estiment qu'il est sous-évalué.  Il n'y a rien d'injuste là dedans ou plutôt, pour paraphraser les propos d'Hayek, ça n'est pas important par rapport à ce que le marché apporte dans l'affaire: l'ajustement du signal prix par rapport à la demande et à l'offre. This whole idea of a reputation system where people anonymously click on a +1 or a -1 button is just silly. Very true.   +1 Par ailleurs, l'argent n'achète que ce qui est à vendre.Même avec 10 millions de bitcoins, je ne peux rien acheter à quelqu'un qui refusera de me donner ce qu'il possède.La valeur du bitcoin n'est déterminée que par des gens qui acceptent de leur plein gré de céder leur richesse contre des bitcoins.Donc pour moi cette histoire d'injustice est absurde, car avoir des bitcoins ne permet d'exproprier personne.  D'ailleurs ceux qui trouvent que les bitcoins sont injustes ne les acceptent pas comme paiement, donc où est le problème ?  Ils dénoncent une injustice dont ils ne sont même pas victimes.L'argent n'est qu'une représentation de la richesse réelle.  Ce n'est pas parce que quelqu'un ne possède aucun signe monétaire qu'il est pauvre.   Son patrimoine est constitué en général de plein d'autres choses:  immobilier, parts d'entreprise, biens mobiliers, etc...En outre, avoir des bitcoins est inutile si on ne les utilise pas.  Et pour les utiliser, il faut s'en séparer, et donc les faire circuler.Mais beaucoup plus généralement, ces considérations sur la justice et le mérite dans le marché me font penser à une question posée à Hayek sur le sujet dans un de ses entretiens TV:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV7-2Aua4_4&t=3m27s  Je ne sais pas non plus avec certitude si c'est une chose positive ou négative pour la civilisation, même si j'ai tout de même tendance à penser que c'est positif.Ce que je sais par contre, c'est que le droit d'échanger de façon volontaire une unité de compte contre des biens et services, ça relève de la liberté individuelle.   Quelqu'un qui croit en la liberté économique ne peut pas s'opposer à bitcoin.Maintenant, il y aurait bien des choses à dire sur cet aspect soi-disant "injuste" de l'introduction des bitcoins.   énormément à dire.  Mais rien de tout cela n'a réellement d'importance par rapport à ce que je viens d'écrire plus haut.  Je veux bien développer, mais à condition qu'on garde bien ça a l'esprit. For those who don't know, you can get to la Défense whether via subway line 1 or RER line 1, but I very much advise not to use RER.   Use subway as it is faster, less crowdy and terminus is at la Défense, so you can't get it wrong. Execpt that here the message is nothing but an arithmetic transfer of some artificial amount. From what I see here we won't be too numerous so it will be easy to find a table pretty much anywhere. I'll PM my mobile number to everyone one day before so it will be easier to meet. I'm afraid you're right guys.  I totally forgot about those magic words. An interesting legal idea here:I tend to agree with that. Just throw you iCrap away.
Well, you can do it on this very forum, don't you know? There is Ripple already. Your drawing is very ugly, and I'm pretty sure you know that.I'm glad I wrote my pledge would depend on the quality of the drawing.Anyway, I'm sorry to acknowledge that you don't take this bounty seriously guys, so I have to lock this thread. What about you just let people decide if they want to continue pricing their products in bitcoins or not ?If the price of bitcoin is volatile in dollar, why should this mean that bitcoin's value is volatile, and not dollar ?And even if bitcoin is volatile, there is nothing preventing a merchand to keep pricing in bitcoin anyway, thus improving bitcoin's stability.For instance, I have been paying some hosting service 0.5 BTC a month.  So far, the guy has never requested any change of price, despite a BTC/USD pair having been multiplied more than four times.  And I don't mind continuing paying 0.5 BTC.   The reason is just that to me the value of one bitcoin hasn't changed much, as my bitcoin stock hasn't changed much either.Don't forget about the subjective value of a commodity.  Market is not the absolute truth.   Some economic agents may be irrationnal, but not all of them are. etherpad?  Tion mi ne konas.  Certe mi felicxigxus pri traduko de cxi tiu artikulo, sed mi kredas ke ni povas fari tion en cxi tiu forumo.  I've just realised the real meaning of the initial message.  I get it, it's about demand for bitcoins as money, not about demand for an product priced in bitcoins.I doubt this makes any sense, but it deservers a full, extensive answer.  I'll write about it later. I'm sorry I'm not a professor of economics, but isn't that precisely what the law of offer and demand is about Demand for something increases.  As a result price increases.   And people look at it and start to work on finding a way to answer this demand.High prices are an incentive for people to answer a demand.  This is what price is about, damn it!   I think it's called the "price signal" theory or something.Here is what I found on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_signal, but I'm pretty sure there is a video of Walter Block somewhere, where he explains that extremely well. I am french and I have no idea what a french toast is. should be coming.  I am not always connected so sometimes it takes some time as the client has to resend transactions.  Please be patient.

Wow, that a very very low starting price for a reverse auction  ! If nobody asks for a smaller price in the next minutes or so, I'll end the auction and accept your offer. Well, actually the thing is I don't want to give them a real email address, and they implemented a security against mailinator-like addresses. I don't know and I don't care.  I just buy a login/passwd from person A.   Hi,I want to post messages on youtube but I don't want to go through the registration process, nor do I want to accept their user conditions.So I start this reverse auction  for a login/password on youtube.Auction will end on block 123,000I may cancel the auction if at the end I'm not happy with the finite price. Is that true?http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/bitcoins-a-new-way-to-donate-to-the-fsf Strongly agree can mean a lot of stuffs.  It can mean for instance that you feel passionnate about it, and that you could debate during a long time with someone who disagree.  It can mean that you could be willing to put yourself in danger in order to defend this idea.  Or that you could put some money into it.Gandhi (one of the famous people mentionned as a left libertarian in the politicalcompass website) strongly believed in his principles and yet he was non-violent. Tu parles de ça ? Caveden, I agree with what you said about abolitionnists being seen as extremists at their time, but you lost me when you say ethics is a matter of logic.   To me it is just not, really.The exemple of someone defending his property is a good exemple.  Some people don't even believe in property.  "Property is theft", as Proudhon said.  So, those people can think they have the right to take other people belongings, with force if necessary.  To you and me it is silly and outrageous, but for them it is highly moral.  And logic has nothing to do with this.
Also, most people believe it's not morally acceptable to judge people for their beliefs.  People must be judge for their acts, not their thoughts.  There is no such think that a "mental criminal".But now, even this is nothing but a belief.  You can agree with it, or not.   And if you don't you are probably in a red square anyway.   This whole thing is too complex to make any sense.    I think I'll become a nihilist after this debate    Yeah, I think you're right.  We should make sure everyone takes this test, and then we'll put all people who fall in the red squares into jail, until we execute them for the greater good.  Hum wait...  if I think this way, shouldn't I be placed in a red square too?  Oh gosh... I also thought this question was totally biased, but then I just answered "Disagree", as I don't understand what the heck the epression "serve humanity" means. Just to make it clear:  I was kidding guys, don't have your girlfriend do something like that, you won't get the 1000BTC  I'd like to add:"What if some people start an other block chain?  Or ten of them?  Won't that depreciate bitcoin's value?""What if miners collude to reward themselves more bitcoins?"And above all:"Since bitcoins are not backed by anything, aren't they ultimately worthless?"PS.  But aren't all these questions in the FAQ already?  What am I missing? I suspect you have added the total aggregates for all currencies.  If so, I doubt this makes any sense.  Different currencies don't add one another. Why would left libertarians not be happy with that?  As long as they can do whatever they want inside their community, they are fine, aren't they? I just did the test again:PS.   no, I'm kidding, I faked this one.    (just registering to this thread) Yeah, I was kidding.  As long as you don't have the police tax me and torture me to reveal my wallet encryption password, I'm fine... For what it worths, I really think you have a real talent for this stuff.  I'm pretty sure you'll make quite some bitcoins with this activity.  Keep on the good work. I really wanted guns, as it is not clear what the intent of the guys with forks is.   On the communist version, it seems that they are about to attack, where I wanted them to look like they are watching and preventing from escaping.  Also, there are too many people in the circle and it is not clear what they are doing.  They don't seem to be working, but rather camping.   Also, the perspective for the tent is wrong in the communist version.  Thanks for your effort anyway. Guys, we have an intruder.   Set the dogs!     I have to say I am not very happy with it ,  but I reckon you tried hard so I'll send you the two bitcoins, don't worry.  What bitcoin address should I use? When you think about it, you realise that in a fully interconnected worldwide electronic network, trying to centrally control the issuing of money is just ridiculous. Pfff....  Isn't this in a liberalism FAQ or something?   If not, it should. Effectivement on risque de ne pas être d'accord.Maintenant, tu noteras que bitcoin permet aux mendiants de mondialiser leur activité.  Au lieu de se limiter à la rue et à son quartier, un mendiant peut s'étendre et demander des bitcoins à des millions d'internautes.Bref, bitcoin met la globalisation à portée des plus démunis. Mine: I won't call it justice, but I'm glad he won't hurt anyone anymore, nor will he propagate any more hate speech against non-muslim people. Corrected.  Best is to avoid the expression "intrinsic value" as it is quite controversial here.
Not even in this case.  I would call it a metacurrency, but some people would call it a reserve currency.  It would still be usefull, and several currencies have been used like this in history (the écu, predecessor of the euro, to name one). Indeed I think the metal analogy is better than the geographic one. Well, entropy has a meaning for a number, at least in a particular base  (100000 has very little entropy in Base-10, for instance, but much higher in base-8).But anyway, I totally forgot that a transaction amount can indeed be the result of some arithmetic operation (currency exchange, division into several parts, and so on).That was silly of me.   I lock this thread. This is somehow a weird assertion.  Can't money be considered as a product by itself ?Making a monetary tool is not that easy.  You can try using seeshells, or numbers on pieces of paper.  And yet everyone will think those are not "good" money.  Money needs some properties to be considered as a good money.A 100$ federal reserve note is not just a piece of paper with ink.  It has some security features that prevent it from counterfeiting, for instance.  It has some value apart from its facial value.  It has some value as something that is difficult to be counterfeited.A monetary tool is a product just as a hammer is a product.  A hammer is usefull to nail nails, and a monetary tool is usefull to exchange value and trade stuffs.Bitcoin is much a better monetary tool than federal reserve notes.  It has much better security against counterfeiting.  It can be divided much easier.   And above all, it can easily be sent through the internet.That's why mining  bitcoin is indeed a selling of a product or service: it's a financial service given to the bitcoin community. Doesn't matter as long as you can exchange cryptocurrencies quickly on a global market.But I admit this would deserve a more thourough thinking.Yeah I know but we keep hearing about it all the time as an argument against bitcoin. Why on earth would anyone use e as an amount for a monetary transaction ?You are right about exchange rates conversion, though.  I've just realised it.  So you have a point. I also had this concern for some time.  I'm not sure however it is a serious problem.  Currencies don't devaluate one another.  Printing sterlings doesn't hurt dollars.   Gold is not threatened by silver.  Etc.The fact that there are many cryptocurrencies on the market might confuse some people.  But once they make their mind and chose one, everything goes fine.  Just let the market adjust prices between them and, if the economy wants it, one particular currency will emerge.I actually think that the fact that people can create a new block chain at will is a good thing.  If they do so, it will mean that bitcoin has reached a point where too few people have hoarded bitcoins, so that it makes bitcoins less usefull for the economy.  People then need more money to do their business, and there is nothing wrong for them to create some.It might be the free market solution for the "bitcoin will create a deflationnary spiral" mantra. I was just looking at bitcoin explorer and I saw that some high decimal precision transactions already occured.Such as [utl=http://blockexplorer.com/t/AVJUJWnahm]82.68708455[/url] for instance.Such a complex amount for a transaction is probably holding data, not just an amount.  Satoshi had already expressed his concern about people using the block chain to store data, and I think he considered this as some kind of an attack on the network.I wonder if miners could not consider requesting special transaction fees for amounts that have high entropic value.By entropic, I mean that for instance an amount such as 105.43908821 has much more entropy than 0.01, even if it is much bigger.  To me, a transaction of the former amount should be more likely to require a transaction fee than the latter.I think it doesn't even have to need any modification of the bitcoin code, does it?  I guess it is just a request we could address to the miners. Not exactly.  You also only consider block chains whose first block is the one that is hard coded in the code.I wonder if we could not rewrite bitcoin without this hard coded genesis block.Instead, the software would listen to any blocks, and would create the largest block chain it can, whatever the first block is. j'ai les oreilles qui sifflent là     Since you are following this thread biddingpond, can I ask you to edit my auction and add the following paragraph at the end ?Please do not bid if you don't really intend to buy the coin, or if you don't own the amount of bitcoins you are about to bid.  Do not make a bid based on your expectation of the currency exchange at the end of the auction.   Only bid the amount of bitcoins you currently own, and that your are willing to give in order to get the coin. Well done.   However, this makes me realize how short is the english language, really.  You really seem to struggle to have your text fit in the time frame of the video. I answered a question about this coin but I forgot to make it public, so I publish it here:>> Message posted From: XXXXXX@gmail.com>> >> Hi Grondilu,>> >> I wouldn't usually ask this sort of thing, but due to extenuating circumstances>> it's become necessary.>> >> When I originally bid on your gold coin (101BTC), I was bidding with the>> expectation of 1BTC=1.80USD.

That could also lead to higher exchange fee rates   Gold and bitcoins, as any commodity, follow the same exponential rule for extraction.Gold started to be extracted long before bitcoins were.  Therefore I'm pretty sure gold will always have a lower monetary inflation than bitcoins.  I believe a few maths could prove it. IMO this is an interesting issue that hasn't been addressed enough on this forum.To me, there is no guarantee that other people would accept any currency anyway, unless they are forced to.  Money should not get its value from coercion, but social acceptance.   Moreover, even in a word with many competing cryptocurrencies, commercial transactions with anyone are possible, as long as there is an efficient currency exchange market. Lol.  Do you know there is a french movie that is all about such a stupid game?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54jn0_ugqco No.  Nobody outside of the circle.   I'd like to keep the drawing as simple as possible. I guess it's not surprising for an argentinian person to be interested in bitcoins.  After the crisis they encountered.Am I guessing right? The bitcoin wiki is not a public place.  It is not supposed to be the central website where to put all offers for goods and services accepting bitcoins.  It is just one of them.There is no "Euro marketplace wiki" nor a "dollar central marketplace".So your question has to be answered by whoever created this wiki and has admin priviledges on it.
I would like a drawing that is not exactly bitcoin related.  Rather, it would picture a caricature of the difference between capitalism and communism.  At least in my mind.Both pictures would represent a circle of armed men, with a worker inside.  The worker can do anything, for instance he can mine something (not bitcoins, the idea is that he has to be a symbol of labour).In the communist version, guns are pointed inside the circle.  Towards the worker, preventing him from escaping.  And the worker has a unhappy face  In the capitalist version, guns are pointed outside the circle.  They aim at protecting the worker's product of labour.   The worker has a happy face.No legend.  I'll add it myself.2 BTC. That's where the debate gets interesting.  I'll write more about that later. Agreed.  Local violence used by individuals, with their own means, is certainly less dangerous than global scale industrialised violence from States, financed with taxation.States have used tax money to design nuclear bombs, do genocides and so many terrible stuffs.  In many ways, twentieth century history is much scarier than any MadMax movie.On one hand you have states: And on the other hand you have anarcho-capitalistic icones: Now, is anarcho-capitalism really scarier ? True, everybody would like to live in a peaceful society, with no gun or any other kind of violence. But not at any price.  At some point if the oligopoly of violence asks too much to the people it is supposed to protect, then individuals get weapons and reorganize distribution of force.So if we have to step towards a Mad Max or Clint Eastwood society in order to get rid of the scumbags who spoil every single inch of freedom we desire, be it. There is nothing wrong in a monopoly, as long as it is obtained legetimately, ie. without violence.Google for instance has almost a monopoly on web searches.   Does anyone complain?  No.  Because searching information on the web is just something that they do better than anyone else and that is why they have a monopoly.  There is a demand and they satisfy this demand.  Where is the problem? Je l'ai déjà dit dans d'autres fils, comme celui sur le toecoin, mais je suis presque sûr que ça doit être une sorte de théorème qui doit pouvoir être démontré rigoureusement.Genre:  une cryptodevise, pour être à la fois décentralisée, purement électronique et anonyme, doit nécessairement distribuer la monnaie en fonction de la puissance de calcul des utilisateurs.L'idée c'est que le logiciel recquiert nécessairement de la puissance de calcul pour fonctionner, ne serait-ce qu'un tout petit peu.  Donc si un utilisateur requiert une puissance dP pour utiliser la machine et recevoir dM unités monétaires par unité de temps, alors il peut, puisque le système est anonyme, se faire passer pour quelqu'un d'autre afin d'obtenir deux fois plus de monnaie.  Et pour ça il devra utiliser une puissance 2*dP, tout ça pour toucher 2*dM.Rien n'empêche un utilisateur de se faire passer pour une quantité N quelconque d'utilisateurs.  Et pour ça il lui faut une puissance de calcul de N*dP, qui lui permettra de toucher N*dM quantité de monnaies.Au final on voit bien que la génération des unités monétaires dépend de la quantité de puissance de calcul qu'est capable de mobiliser chaque utilisateur. Ben non puisque comme précisé les humains s'enverront des transactions bidons à eux même.bis.  Contre le spam des transactions il y a les frais de transactions.  Et de toute façon avec le modèle actuel spammer ne te donne pas plus de chance de générer.  Ca ne peut être utile que pour un attaquant qui souhaite détruire le réseau, pas l'exploiter.Plus généralement, ne sous-estime pas Satoshi.  Lis et relis son papier.  Bitcoin est vraiment très bien pensé.  Je doute qu'on trouve mieux avant longtemps. done. My opinion is that in every commercial transaction, at some point there is always some "exchange risk".  There is no way to get rid of that.Even with cash, there is the risk that one of the party runs away with both the money and the stuff bought/sold.Bitcoin makes it clearer because it's so new and there are therefore almost no escrow services. Avec un système comme ça, si tant est que j'ai bien compris, il y aura une course aux noeuds.  Les membres du réseau feront fonctionner un maximum de machines et s'enverront des transactions à eux mêmes afin d'augmenter leurs chances d'acquérir des bitcoins.Quelque soit la manière avec laquelle tu élis les noeuds qui auront le droit de recevoir des bitcoins, tu auras des êtres humains qui essaieront d'être élu un maximum de fois, et in fine ça reviendra à acquérir un maximum de ressources matérielles, que ce soit réseau ou CPU.N'oublie pas que pour le réseau, un noeud n'est pas forcément un être humain.  Un être humain peut posséder autant de machines qu'il le souhaite (quitte à utiliser des machines virtuelles). I'm a bit skeptical about this new bitcoin ID service.  What is it for exactly?To me, if you really want to make sure the person you pay is the person you think, you have to request for a signed bitcoin address.Exemple:- Alice:  Hi, grondilu, I really like what you do and I would like to donate bitcoins to you.- grondilu: Ok, my bitcoin address is:  1LBEfZmRqtaH6KwGqt89uFm7dvdkiPdutC- fake-grondilu:  Don't listen to this guy, Alice, I am the real grondilu and my bitcoin address is: 1PffXTH9o2Lg87d6Y5igEFPSbv6f1kE97U- Alice:  I know grondilu's public key, so you guys sign your bitcoin address so I found out who is the real grondilu.- grondilu: Ok, here it is again:-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA11LBEfZmRqtaH6KwGqt89uFm7dvdkiPdutC-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)iEYEARECAAYFAk26qGQACgkQq17371C4DmjhVgCg507apPO5bNqwzZnXlPTLe+2qrM4An34WgO2Lv9LK+tTG0E8Uzlg5pg9v=+mTq-----END PGP SIGNATURE------ fake-grondilu:  damn it, you got me.Now, I know not everybody uses GnuPG, so I guess this bitcoin ID service is usefull anyway. Oui mais comment tu les reconnais ?  Tu es sûr que TCP/IP est un bon moyen d'identifier à coup sûr un noeud ?  Que fais-tu pour éviter le double paiement ?L'un des points forts de bitcoins est qu'il n'utilise pas l'infrastructure réseau pour autre chose que le partage des transactions.  La sécurité du système est dans la cryptographie contenue dans les blocs, et nul part ailleurs.Un noeud possède des tas de clefs.  Elles sont toutes dans son portefeuille et il signe toutes les transactions envoyées au réseau. C'est bien ici que le bât blesse.  Il n'y a pas grand chose qui interdit quelqu'un d'acquérir une autre adresse IP.  Et TCP/IP n'est pas conçu pour ça.En fait, il faut bien comprendre que quelque soit le critère retenu pour autoriser la création de bitcoins, les membres du réseau chercheront à le satisfaire au maximum afin d'obtenir le plus de bitcoins possible.Donc si l'attribution de bitcoin était basée sur les adresses IP, il y aurait une course à la possession d'adresses, au lieu d'une course à la puissance de calcul.En outre, une preuve de calcul est infiniment plus facile à vérifier et digne de confiance que l'entête d'un paquet TCP/IP.Mais bon si tu vois un moyen de créer un réseau monétaire basé sur ce principe, surtout vas-y, implémente le.  C'est clair que si on pouvait éviter de faire tourner des machines pour constamment calculer des hashs, ce serait mieux.  Mais pour l'instant aucune autre solution satisfaisante n'a été trouvée.Par ailleurs, relis mon post initial.  Le calcul CPU ne sert pas que à élire celui qui aura le droit de toucher des bitcoins, il sert aussi à prouver l'écoulement du temps, et donc à établir une chaine chronologique pour les transactions. Well, for a real commercial transaction, at some point a bitcoin address has to be communicated.  And email is often used.  So, in order to make sure your transactions remain anonymous nor can they be related one to another (thus allowing evaluation of your total income), you have to use different email addresses, not just different bitcoin addresses.But basically the guy could have said "by using internet in an anonymous way,..."I think that's what he meant.  I doubt he confused bitcoin address with email address. I love the part about war.And I also love this part:KEYNESso what would you do to help those unemployed?this is the question you seem to avoidwhen were in a mess, would you just have us wait?Doing nothing until markets equil-i-brate?HAYEKI dont want to do nothing, theres plenty to doThe question I ponder is who plans for who?Do I plan for myself or leave it to you?I want plans by the many and not by the few. "Undisputable" might be misleading.  "Provable" is better, maybe. That where we disagree.  To me, precision is not a criterium for somthing to be a measurement device.  As I said already, bitcoin is a poor time measurement device, when considering precision of measurement.  But it is the only time measurement  device I know of, that provides a proof of measure.  In other worlds, it is the only way to timestamp something without relying on the authority of someone who is supposed to know what time it is. Yes, computing power is not time, but it's pretty close, as computing things takes some time.   Time is made of sequences of events.  Trying to reorder previous transactions is therefore trying to mess up with time records.  That's the whole point.  Computing power provides proof of time, and thus prevent reordering transaction orders.Sorry guys, this thread annoys me.  I lock it for now. True.  I won't deny it.  Consistency or robustness may not be the most accurate words.  I don't know.All I know is that if a distributed database was capable of offering undisputable chronological order between concurrent entries, we wouldn't need bitcoin in the first place.  We would just use such a distributed database to store chained signed transactions, without using any single proof of work. Distributed databases existed before bitcoin.  But AFAIK they don't offer robust ways to handle concurrent entries, nor a consistent way to deciide which entry was created first.  For most databases this functionnality is not critic anyway, that's why most distributed databases work just fine without it.With a distributed database that is supposed to handle data associated to some economic value, such a functionnality is critic.  When concurrent entries occurs, there HAS to be a way to say, without any doubt of possibility of dispute, that one of them occured before the other.In the bitcoin network, once a node signs a transaction, he needs to prove that this transaction occured after all the previous transactions it knows about.  This history of transactions is "the past" for this node, and adding a proof-of-work at the end of a chain of previous proofs-of-work is what satoshi called the "timestamp".   Miners provide this timestamping service and that's what they get their reward for. Nice. yeah but above all:  how messy 
Who knows?  Maybe even those guys of the CIA could be overwhelmed by the possibilities of bitcoin, and they could start to think the world in a different way.Inside a CIA agent, there is a human being with a beating heart and a brain still capable of dreaming.Ok that was my peace and love moment.  Won't happen again. Way too many people won't agree with this being a good thing. http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=514I'll add more pictures on this thread, because I'm not too happy with the pics I've used on the site.Happy bidding! In order to help Gavin before his presentation in front of CIA, I would like to open a thread about what good can come out with a free, decentralised monetary system.Let's try to forget about controversial commercial activities for one second, and focus of good economic stuffs.My two cents:* easier access to credit for everyone, including micro credit ;* easy set up of a commercial activity even for poor people ;* more possibilities for raising capital in businesses ;* fair international monetary system between nations ;Ok, your turn. Wise words. I guess this is the optimistic point of view.   Ok, fine. Yeah, right.  But we're talking about CIA here.  It's not really a "normal" customer.Gavin is free to accept any invitation and to speak to whoever he wants.  But I am also free to disapprove and to say that by doing so, Gavin loses a bit of my estim. I'm still running version 0.3.19 and I have never tried Gavin's version.   I'll wait a few more months. This is a ridiculously emphatic comment, and yet I feel exactly the same.   True.  We should say that more often.Sad, but also true. +1   (don't want to inflate the rating so I stick to +1, not +10 nor +100) That's not the point.  Why should we give precious information to these people?  What have they done to deserve it?When you discover something cool, you want to share it with other people.  But then if you ask yourself "who should I tell it to?", the CIA members are certainly not the first kind of people that come up to mind! Finally someone who shares my view about this! Bitcoin is not that difficult to understand, really.  I also understood it only once I red Satoshi's paper, but it's because this document is very well written.  I understood it after reading it only three or four times, and yet I don't have any particular background.  I'm just the average linux nerd and I used wikipedia to learn the concepts I didn't know.That's also why I keep wondering what they need Gavin for exactly. Yeah, I wasn't too serious.   We can indeed be happy that things happened this way. Hang on.  Am I the only one who thinks this is big news? You might actually be right.  How weird that would be, though. I wouldn't be too surprised if, instead of a 3,000USD cheque, Gavin would receive some nice bracelets once he arrives there: To do so we might also need a nice mascott drawing:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6681.msg97567;topicseen#msg97567 I should obviously be an alpaca, but it should be well drawn, as are Tux or the GNU logo. Here is your model guys:Try to draw something nice from this PS.  I don't tell how much I pledge.  It will depend on how good the result looks.  But if some people want to pledge for a precise amount, please do so. There are very little websites where one can buy pictured T-shirts directly with bitcoins.What about you make one?  Meaning that you would not only sell bitcoin-related T-shirts, but also FSF ones, or any other kinds?  
Finally someone did it.Dude, I think you are going to make a huge amount of money   Well, at least it was a good idea to publicly announce that he has been invited by them.  In case something happens, we'll know who to blame. Yeah, right.  Especially when the speaker has to schedule a date for the presentation, take a plane to get there and so on...When is this presentation supposed to occur already?  June?  We are not even in May.   And how long does it take to read doc and watch a video? I am sorry Gavin is accepting Tax payer's money in order to do something like that.If he accepts 3,000$ to give a presentation about bitcoin, what would he do for 300,000$ or 3,000,000$?  Would he accept a full time job as trying to find a way to destroy bitcoin?Why do CIA need to have someone explain bitcoin in flesh and bone?   Can't they read Satoshi's white paper, source code and other information available on this forum?I must say I am a bit disappointed by Gavin.  I hope he reconsiders.From now on, I'll be even more suspicious about any source code Gavin will publish. Of course you can short bitcoins:1.   Borrow some bitcoins.2.   Sell them on the market.3.   Wait until the price of bitcoin has lowered enough4.   Buy some bitcoins back.5.   Pay back your debt.6.   Profit and go back to step 1. Oh I've just realised that this topic is mine so I can stop this 9/11 debate if I want.And I do want to stop it.Sorry guys.       Please don't start a 9-11 debate. Je crois que tu es le doyen du forum, Mifou60.  J'espère avoir autant d'ouverture d'esprit que toi quand j'attendrai ton âge  lolShould I create a poll or something?  Let's see how people would react in case of a bitcoin crash. +1The guy has never posted here and yet he seems to know the code in full details.  Amazing.I very much which Satoshi could answer those questions. Good point. Well, that very much depends on the amount of money you have on this account, doesn't it?I mean, in my bank account I must have something like three euros, so I coudn't care much less about losing this account. As far as I know, electronic voting is a very difficult IT problem, pretty much as difficult as mental poker.I doubt anyone will find a definitive solution here on this forum. /mode troll ONIf you consider plutocracy to be a form of democracy, as I do, then the answer is yes./mode troll OFF Imagine a small town with 10,000 people.  This town lives more or less apart from the rest of the word.They have their own language, their own culture, and their own currency.  It's a fiat currency, and it's purely electronic.  People use it because to them it is just more convenient than using gold or silver.  Their currency is totally decentralised, anonymous and it is called bitcoin.Now, some terrible natural disaster occurs:  an earthquake, a volcanic eruption, whatever.Those ten thousand people have to leave their town and travel around the world to find a place to live.They are dispatched in several countries where they learn the language and culture.   But everywhere they go, they find that people use a currency that they consider inferior.  Those currencies are controled by a bureaucratic elite, and there is no way to have financial privacy using these currencies.So our small town people keep in touch between one another, and they keep exchanging the local currency against their bitcoins.   Basically they never store any significative amount of the local currency, as they know it would be ripped by inflation.  Instead, they only store their bitcoins.When they need to buy something, they just sell some of their bitcoins to one of the small town people who has local currencies to get rid of.  And then they can proceed to the paiement in order to buy stuffs.You get my point, right?Now, how many people are there on this forum already? Can you please explain why?I am french, I'm the #3 most prolific writer on this forum and as such I am offended by this proposition. I'm pretty sure Gavin did not actually burn those notes.  Since Gavin organises the bitcoin faucet, it would have been silly not to sell those notes against bitcoins in order to add them to the faucet. You said that whether or not calling a group of attackers a bitcoin "central bank"  was just a matter of semantics and was not relevant.I could as well argue that calling you a troll is just a matter of semantics too. It seems to me that you miss one point.  The attack that was discussed here doesn't only consist in gathering more than 50% of CPU.I wouldn't mind if anybody does, as long as he processes transaction correctly.But in order to use any priviledged power, such a big miner would have to run a modified version of the software, and basically the only thing he could do would be to hurt the network by refusing to process incoming transactions or double spending some.  They could not mint arbitrary amounts of bitcoin, for instance.So it would not have the powers of a central bank.
Stop talking about "the central bank of the bitcoin economy".  There is simply no such thing, apart in your mind.There could be a large collusion of attackers, but since they would try to disrupt the bitcoin network, there is no way we can call them "the bitcoin central bank".    In a centralised economy, a central bank is supposed to organise and protect the economy, not to destroy it. I'm not sure this is a correct way to see things.  Spending money to do something is not an other way to say that you buy it.   When you buy something, at the end you own it, which means that nobody can take it back from you if you don't want to sell.   On the opposite, if at some point you spend enough money to acquire more than 50% of the bitcoin processing power, it doesn't belong to you anyway.  Because at any moment someone else could do the same and take back the majority of CPU even if you don't agree with that.  It's not a commercial transaction. Mi ne estas certe ke gxi estus vere utila, sed mi bonvolus ke iu tradukas la artikolon de Satosxio "http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"Bedauxrinde mia scieco de esperanto ne estas suficxa, do mi sole gxin ne povas traduki. Do, ni estas kvar esperantistoj, cxi tie?Bone, bone. Yeah but this transaction is at the bottom of the Merkle tree, isn'it?   This means that the light client should store a whole branch of the tree, which defeats the purpose of a "light" client I guess.Maybe we could restructure the Merkle tree and have the special transaction be on the top, just aside the root of all the other transactions. And you did a good job quite quickly.Thanks. It's a nice summary anyway.  And at no point the guy is making definitive assertions.  Just reasonnable hypothesis.It seems to me the guy is quite impressed by bitcoin, and he wanted to make a sincere full report about it. See in the doc mentionned above (section IV to be exact).  Several scenari fit the description of "failure". Bonvenon!  Mi ankaux ne uzis la Esperantan de longe, sed mi vin komprenis senprobleme  I agree about the anonimity part.  Bitcoin is not even really fully anonymous anyway.But I don't see how we could get rid of the word "cryptographic".  Otherwise people will have no clue about how it works.  It would be some kind of a cyberwar.On one side, bitcoin adepts.   On the other side, supporters of centralised government based national currencies.Good thing is that such war would not recquire guns or explosive, but GPU cards and electricity.Could be fun. Well, I said that bitcoin is not democratic but indeed I was wrong.As Satoshi wrote it clearly from the very beginning, the network can be corrupted by any group of people which can obtain and maintain 50% of the processing power. Well, yes (I don't know if 1000 people would be enough though).   So what?Also, if it's an University professor that does that with tax payer money, it's not much liberal, you know.Anyway, even if it's with their own money or if we consider that a university professor can do whatever he wants with his money even if it comes from tax payer (I don't know about univeristies in your country, but in mine, most of them are financed by gov.), I guess they can indeed mess with other people's business and try to destroy what other people have built.It would only reveal a weakness in bitcoin, which somehow would be a good thing. Do you have any proof for these allegations? You forgot:   "Why?"I think this forum is sufficient enough.  We don't need to waste money and energy for physical meetings. I was just reading this quite good document about bitcoin written by a Yale student.  In this document, the guy describe many of the possible ways bitcoin could fail.It is the best critic of bitcoin I have red so far.So, could bitcoin fail?   Yes, it could.But you know what?  The current financial system has shown us so many flaws, so many disgusting priviledges for a few too big to fail corporations, that I just want to give bitcoin a try, even if it might be risky.  I just don't want to hoard any national currency any more.Someone wrote somewhere something like :  "Current financial system is completely messed up.  Give geeks a chance."That's exactly the spirit. I totally agree and I couldn't write it better. I think it would, if you can convince us that this trade really happened and that you and your friend didn't fake it. I did sell some of these 96.1 BTC and then bought others at a lower price.But I could have used my own bitcoins.So to tell you the truth, it was much more of a proof of concept that I wanted to make.Might be usefull for my reputation if I have to borrow bitcoins in the future, though.

I pledge 1 BTC to whoever makes a nice picture mocking this guy selling his psychic powers.Him levitating carots or something  Satoshi used to discuss with Gavin on this very forum.I very much doubt Satoshi would be paranoiac enough to simulate a dialog with an other person, just in order to hide his identity. http://weusecarrots.com/          Anyway, as often, the answer can be found in Satoshi's paper: Ok I confess I don't know much about this light version of the protocol.  I'll have to read more about that. Does everybody realise how easy it would be to detect such an "unorthodox miner" ??The software THAT YOU HAVE INSTALLED on your computer does it, and even you can do it "manually".The reward transaction is the first one in the block:  you just have to look at it.After block 210,000, If the reward is greater than 25BTC (apart from transaction fees), then you have been silly enough to install the cartel's version of the software.   In that case, all you have to do is uninstall this software and reinstall Satoshi's or Gavin's version.End of story.How hard is that?To me, this Timothy Lee's article has been given way too much credit.  It's not a new idea, and it's not even smart.Bitcoin is not a democracy:  nobody has to suffer from the stupidity of the majority of people. I guess this poll is self-explanatory.  Please vote. This gives me an idea for a poll.Edit.Here it is:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6392.0 I think being mocked a bit is a good punishment for being a smart ass.If you think you are clever enough to lecture people about stuffs, you have to assume it.A lot of people are doing and writing very smart things, and yet they don't feel the narcissic urge of showing their face on Youtube. Sent 0.64 BTCBy the way I liked your version of Pink Floyd's Marooned.  I don't know much about PF but that definitely made me feel like listening to this band.  Thanks.
"surviving a bitcoin crash"?!Come'on, it would be silly to put all your wealth into bitcoins, just as it would be silly to put all your wealth into any single financial asset.There are other places where to put your money.  Precious metals, stocks, real estates and so on.I doubt anybody would get seriously hurt by a bitcoin bubble crash.  Only some greedy fools will. Oh yeah I forgot about that. Yeah that's what I thought.  So "legal tender" doesn't mean much, because selling a candy bar at 100,000 EUR piece, it's pretty much like refusing EUR as a paiement.Reminds me when I bought a 50pesos gold coin once.  The coin was worth around 600EUR, and when I asked for the price, she just said 800EUR.  It seemed to me she didn't really want to sell her coin, so she said a large number.  I know it because she looked a bit surprised when I said yes. What's stopping me from using double priced labels and put a ridiculously large amount in euros on them ?Exemple for a candy bar:"delicious candy barPrice:1 BTC100 000 EUR" Sure.  I just think this distributed timestamp network is a cool side effect. This is a weird idea.  If I am not allowed to refuse dollars, I'll just demand a huge amount of them.For instance, I can ask a gram of gold for a stuff I sell, but $1,000 for that same stuff. Oh yeah I confess I forgot about this usage. Yeah and that's silly to say that.As I said in an other thread, it's like saying a hammer has no use apart from nailing nails.  It's what it is made for, damn it! I'm perfectly ok to believe that this guy is smart.  The way he calmly and patiently rested his case showed it.However, one can not be always right about everything.  And this one is very wrong about bitcoin in particular and money in general.I'd like to hear more from him about why gold is money, as I am a former goldbug myself. You make me realize why I instinctively refuse to show my face on the web   A telephone, for instance, is a completely useless thing.  You can't eat a telephone.  If you are alone on a desert island, then your telephone is just useless because you have noone to talk to.Communication tools have some value for you because you believe you will find someone that will be willing to listen to you and talk with you using the same device.A pen is something juste as useless and worthless.  Sure, you can make nice drawings that you might enjoy watching later.  But truely, unless you find someone who is willing and capable of understanding what you wrote or drew on a piece of paper, then this pen is absolutely useless.Communication tools are nothing but pyramid schemes.  They are usefull only if other people think they are usefull.Now I'll stop writing nonsense and I'll start explaining my point.What I was trying to show here, is how clueless people who think money should have "inherent value" are.   Money has value because it is money.  Period.  Saying that money has no value is just as silly as saying that a hammer has no use apart from nailing nails.In a nutshell, money is to quantities what language is to ideas.   It is a way to communicate and transfer amounts in a reliable way.   Since it can't be created easily, then if you have some, at some point you must have got it from someone else.  In other words, it doesn't really have value:  it is value.   We tend to forget that "value" is a word that has an arithmetic meaning.   You can say "hello, here is an number: 10" to someone, but by doing so you communicate a number, you don't transfer a value.  Value is a concept which is related to a unit.  '10' has no value, but '10 smurfs' has:  it is a value relative to the total amount of whatever a smurf is.Money is a tool that is designed to allow the ownership and transfer of such a concept of value.   As such value can then be mapped to quantites of goods and services, money is therefore used to account for ownership and transfer of goods and services.   It is, as I have already said it, a decentralised accounting tool.   It is to numbers what signs are to ideas.Money has existed since the begining of times.  It is pretty much as old as writing.  And there is a reason for that:  both concepts are analogous.IMHO WTF!?The guy is volontarist and yet he thinks money should be decided and enforced by law?I don't get it. A more serious argument I could make about his "legal tender" point.Law is not something that people are supposed to withstand.  It's not some superior force that people must blindlessly obey.  Law is something that is supposed to be decided by society.The dollar existed before it was recognised by law.  I think it derives from a silver coin called Thaler.  Its usage became so popular that eventually law makers decided to make it the official money.There is no reason why bitcoin could not have the same destiny.  As more and more people use it as they realise it is a more efficient intermediate for exchange, at some point they will have law makers turn it into an "official" money.  I don't say it is something I hope for (I don't).  I say it is possible, and if it was to happen, then bitcoin would essentially replace the dollar. improving miserydaeria's picture:I know this is not cool, but it's so fun    I told you this thread could be fun! My guess is that he is just an economics student.I also suspect he doesn't know anything about austrian economists. Haven't watched the whole video yet but I predict discussing it is going to be fun.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoK8HXMSsNgEdit.  Ok, watched it all.  My quick answer:Bitcoin is a decentralised accounting tool.  It is pretty much as useless as a pen and a piece of paper are.  Which means it is not.  A pen and a paper is useless only for someone who can't write.  Or for someone who can write, but in a world where nobody else can. A little poll about your pricing propectives for bitcoin. Honnestly I could say no.  I don't give a crap about getting 10$ for free, and I would enjoy better punishing the other guy for being really too much greedy. Interesting question.  You should turn this thread into a poll.
Indeed it sounds much like Ripple.And a bond doesn't have to be decentralised, as it is issued by a specific person anyway.  So it does make sense to have it handled by a specific server.However, a standard protocol for issuing bonds could be usefull. Would be cool.   Probably possible, but since it is simpler to implement a smartphone application, I doubt anyone will spend much energy/time/money in implementing a bitcoin client on a chip card. Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if those guys copy one another.   How ridiculous it would be, though! Faites moi une offre.En gros vous m'envoyez (ou postez sur ce fil) votre clef GnuPG publique avec une photo intégrée, et on fixe un RDV quelque part dans Paris.   Je pourrai alors regarder votre visage et constater qu'elle correspond à la clef que vous m'avez envoyée.Vous me réglez une fois que vous recevez votre clef signée.Renforcer la vérifiabilité des informations vous identifiant dans votre clef peut être utile si vous comptez par exemple engager votre responsabilité dans quelque chose.   Si ceux à qui vous faites une promesse sont convaincus de pouvoir vous retrouver si jamais vous les trompez, ils seront plus disposés à vous faire confiance. This thread makes me realize how hard it is to understand that something is impossible.To understand that something is possible, basically all you need is to imagine how it can be done.But to understand that something is impossible, you need some deep understanding of the whole thing you are considering, and basically what you need is some kind of a mathematical proof.That why I predict we'll always have people trying to design some physical instance of a bitcoin. A marchand is free to denominate his prices in whatever currency he wants.  Even a crappy national fiat currency.  That's litteraly his business.  If one believe in economic freedom, that's the only acceptable conclusion.Now, I'm glad you don't want to talk anymore, as this topic is annoying me as well anyway. Yeah, I see the difference.  I guess.  But I don't think it's relevant.  In both ways, at the end the result is the same:  I had the stuffs I wanted to have. Think about Genjix's conference in front of banksters in Amsterdam.  To me it was a huge mistake.   It is just as if some french officier had spent a few times in Germany in 1938, talking about his military job to german soldiers.Although this is an extreme example, to me it's the archetype of what should not be done.Make knowledge available, but don't try to push it in people's head. You're wrong.  I pay my rent, my food and pretty much everything I buy with gold.  And yet gold is not the primary currency in my country.   As long as there are efficient market exchange places, you can use pretty much any currency you want. Write it in an encyclopedia such as Wikipedia, where people are free to get those informations, if they are interested.But don't just show off your knowledge at random places.  People don't just lecture other people by talking with a megaphone on the streets.  Don't do that on internet either. Not just bitcoin.  Gold and silver too.  And yet people are still bashing goldbugs.Bitcoin doesn't have to be widely adopted to be efficient.  I've said it several times and I repeat it.If you rely on the smartness of the majority of people, you are screwed. Not to your friends.  To general public.  Basically to anyone you don't know. Because they have never tried to know about it.How hard is it to google "digital money", to follow a few links and to come up with a wikipedia page that mentions bitcoin, Ripple and stuffs like that?How hard is it to wonder if there exist a decentralised currency?  To me, we don't have to spend energy to teach bitcoin to someone who has never even tried to do such a basic research. Since Jerry Britto's article came out on TIME, I've seen quite a few articles about bitcoin from smart asses blogs.Some are bashing bitcoin, some are just expressing their skepticism.  But most of what I read pisses me off, and that's why I think we should stop promoting bitcoin.People should learn about bitcoin by themselves.  After all, there is a wikipedia page, and the bitcoin.org website is explanatory enough.Random morons should not be taught about bitcoins.  They don't deserve it if they never made any personnal research about digital money.  Why would anyone spend energy trying to convince someone about something, if this person has never manifest any interest in the subject?Improve the bitcoin website.  Expand the FAQ, the wiki, make it resilient to government shutdown.  But please, stop promoting bitcoin to people who don't deserve it. I'm afraid we are doomed to see always the same newbies who try to appear smart by bringing always the same arguments against bitcoin.We very much need to have a good FAQ in order to answer to these guys with a simple link. I like also the spirit of the guy who post here his first message, and asks if bitcoin is a scam.WTF do you expect?  If it IS a scam, do you think anyone will tell you:  "yes, it is a scam.  Go away." ??Just read the doc and make up your own mind.  Jeez. We don't need to bring "regular folks" to the network.  Screw them.Bitcoin can be a perfectly valid currency without being accepted by the average Joe.   As long as we have efficient market exchanges, we don't need everyone to even know about bitcoins.Bitcoin is not a religion nor a political movement.  We don't have to care if people don't like it. Well yeah, or a smartcard.  That would be nice, but AFAIK, noone has ever compiled bitcoind for such a device. It should be.  There is a euro coin already in the source code.  But I failed in compiling even the original version.I uses the following png to draw the coin:PS.  Oh yeah I managed to compile finally.  I just add to add "-lX11" for some reason. This story is just outrageous.   This guy has nothing to do in jail.And yet I'm sure some rapists or murderers will go out of jail before he does.
RTFM There is no way you can prevent the counterfeiting of a physical stuff.  Unless it is based on a rare physical element.Also, what do you mean exactly by "backing"?  Who would guarantee that your paper can be turned into bitcoins?  Banks?  States?I have nothing against a private corporation guarantiing such a backing, based on its reputation.  But it would be fiat money.  I might use some but I'd prefer use a precious metal based money. If bitcoin take off, gold won't worth that much as it will be less nessary as currency.Moreover, it's not so difficult to mint coins with very little gold on it.  A thin layer of gold on some other material will do.PS.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that silver exists too, for small change.  For physical exchanges, just use gold. Hive45, singularity podcast:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0LTTnHZJcThe guy on your left, Tristan Grace, is almost as much of a bitcoin enthoustiast as I am. I thought of this when I saw a screenshot of this open-source game:I think it might be cool to fork this game and have him use a bitcoin sign instead of $.Here is the game website:http://neverball.orgPS.  It should be pretty easy.  Basically you just have to edit the file data/item/coin/coin.png.  I'll try.PS#2.  Damn it I get a :dpkg-source: error: cannot represent change to neverball-1.5.4/data/item/coin/coin.png: binary file contents changedPff...  of course the file has changed:  I've just edited it!Any debian expert around? Gosh I HATE thos blogs where you can't comment without registering to some crappy website.http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/04/if-you-dont-trust-the-dollar-you-have-lots-of-good-options-besides-bitcoin/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+matthewyglesias+%28Matthew+Yglesias%29Anyone can tell this guy that bitcoinbugs don't trust ANY national currencies, not just USD? Well, it's not for the average Joe, is it? Cash exists.  It's anonymous.  Decentralised (not issueing, but existence, as it is dispatched everywhere).  And yet the government seems Ok with it.So they could use bitcoin to issue "electronic cash".Basically they would modify the bitcoin source code, and make a new block chain with all the 21 millions "FEDcoins" generated all at once, in the genesis block.   They could also make it so that a special private key could generate any number of new coins anytime they want.And then they would guarantee the convertibiliy between FEDcoins and Federal Reserve Notes.FEDcoins would be just like FDR notes, except that they are designed to be exchanged on the net, and not in person-to-person physical exchange.That would cost them almost nothing.   God damn it, have I written otherwise?Again:  I am not saying that I am sure that in the future we will live in a money less society.   I say that to me it is possible that free market forces, along with technological developpement, slowly reduces prices so that society looks more and more like a moneyless society.I won't write anymore here, as this thread is pissing me off. cool   Je vais écrire ça en français car ça me pose quelques problèmes en anglais.Ceux qui découvrent bitcoin ont souvent du mal au début à comprendre à quoi sert exactement la puissance de calcul utilisée.  Ca leur parait absurde de faire tourner des cartes graphiques dans le vide juste pour calculer des hashs.  Du coup ils croient que c'est ce calcul qui donne de la valeur aux bitcoins, du fait de la dépense énergétique nécessaire.Ce n'est bien sûr pas comme ça qu'il faut voir les choses.La puissance de calcul est nécessaire pour donner au réseau une échelle de temps décentralisée.Si je possède 1 bitcoin, que je l'envoie à Alice et qu'en même temps j'essaie de tricher en envoyant le même bitcoin à Bob, il faut un moyen de savoir lequel des deux ordres est valable.Avec un système centralisé c'est simple:  c'est le premier qui arrive au serveur central.Cette nécessité d'une chronologie sans référence temporelle unique implique de pouvoir prouver l'écoulement du temps.    Une montre mesure le temps mais ne donne aucune preuve de sa véracité.Une peuve de calcul, elle, n'est possible à obtenir qu'avec un certain travail qui prend nécessairement un certain temps.  Dès lors, un enchainement de preuve de calculs constitue une échelle temporelle peu précise certes, mais en tout cas digne de confiance.C'est l'idée la plus originale dans le fonctionnement de bitcoin, et elle mérite d'être plus souvent soulignée afin d'éviter les malentendus évoqués plus haut. I think at some point you said that the last bitcoin will be generated in 10 years or so.  I think it's rather a century or so. Anyway, remember there ARE other exchanges places.   MtGox is currently the bigger, but if it disappeared, the other exchange place would get bigger.Also, there is #bitcoin-otc on freenode.  It's the closest thing we have from a decentralised trading place. If there was a way to do that, I'm not sure we would need bitcoin in the first place. Yes I could.  For instance I would be more wrong if I was assuming that we can reach a moneyless society NOW, with just a political decision and authoritative measures (making money illegal, in a nutshell).On the contrary, I say that maybe technical progress could, in future, make price of things decrease significantly, so that life is easier and stuffs appear to be essentially free.Prices is not something that is purely proportionnal.   One thing might be cheap when you want only a small amount, but very expensive if you want a lot of it.  This happens when you request more than what production can offer.One word:  machines.Diamonds are a bad example as they currently can be manufactured.Gold will probably never ever be free.  However, one gram of gold will probably get more and more purchasing power, just because stuffs will be easier and easier to produce with time.You missed the point when I was saying that prices would GRADUALLY decrease.  Basically I'm saying we could reach a moneyless society in an asymptotic manner.  Money will still exist, but prices of stuffs will gradually get closer to zero, even if they never actually reach zero. A big miner moving money in preparation for a trade, or something like that.With bitcoin breaking parity again, no wonder some stuffs happen. Saluton, genjix!   Mi vere dubas ke esperantisto, kiam li unue lernas pri bitcoin, unue skribas tie !Do mi kredas ke vi estas genjix.   Cxu ne?  up for newbies.  Please vote. Pardonu al mi, sed mi kredas ke por angloinstruantulo, estas malagado, je demandi al lernantuloj je monpeti.Se mi estus lernantulo, mi neniel trovus tion amuzanta.
I watched Eve no Jikan already.   Good stuff, but it's not quite the story I was describing above. Oh yeah I know about this anime.  I had watched the two first episodes I think.  I will go back to it and watch the full series someday. I've been told that viruses exist for linux, but honnestly I've been using GNU/linux for years and years and I have never ever been infected by any single one. LolI'd like to read a SF story where the world is full of commercial robot wives, and where 'real' women have many difficulties for finding husbands, so they fundamentally go through a tough social crisis, while men are just doing well. Utopias are nice, as long as noone tries too hard to make them come true. Oh come on...Money is not part of the International System, but for godness sake, decimal units are part of the way almost everyone in this world is counting numbers.So a number such as 12.94388439 should not be confused with anything in any unit we are talking about.Only people who are very, very unfamilar with numbers could have a problem with that. Indeed, found it:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=13.msg46#msg46 I was trying to rephrase what I red some time ago.  I don't remember well.It has to be here somewhere in this forum history anyway.    But Satoshi has written a lot of stuff.  Searching would be time consuming as I don't even recall any keyword he used.As for the developpement history, I think I also red that Satoshi showed up on the cypherpunk list, back when Wei Dai made his proposal.  Then Satoshi disappeared until 2009 I think.A full resarch on the historical documents could be appreciated.  It could almost deserve a bounty. Not several years.  I think he wrote somewhere on this forum that the actual coding was quite fast compared to the global mental design of the thing. It is not really a "problem", rather an "issue" IMO.Anyway, it is indeed an issue that still has to be solved.  It has been discussed here several times.There are several solutions, and I think you described one of them correctly.I personnaly think that a credit system would be fine.  Basically some banks would still exist in the conventionnal meaning (hopefully more anonymous though), except that accounts would be labelled in bitcoins.   Of course, an advantage is that withdrawing all your funds would take a few minutes, and not days as it is currently the case in the current banking system.With such a traditionnal centralised accounting system, transactions would be instantaneous.A good stuff would be a combination of this with David Chaum's blind signature, so that everything stays anonymous. Yeah this service is great, but it would be even greater if the cards were physical and reloadable.There is a guy who provides such a service but unfortunately it doesn't work very well out of USA. Well, amongst the difficulies I see, there is the problem for automatisation of paiements for currencies that are not purely digitals.  Basically I'm talking about interfacing the current banking systems.A peer-to-peer exchange system would be feasible I guess if all currencies were bitcoin-like.  But they are not.  We have to deal with the obsolete currencies.  And it's tricky.There is the Ripple project.  But as far as I know, there is currently no real functionnal implementation yet. A p2p distributed exchange client is an idea that is much easier said than done.Some people like the current banking system.  You might regret it, but it's a fact.  I won't try too hard to convince them that bitcoin is a better currency.Plus, if we trully believe in free market and economic freedom, then we must see the current financial system just as an other system.If a marchand accepts only national currencies, I can't force him to accept bitcoins.  That's why we need a compatibility layer that allows me to convert my bitcoins into national currencies whenever I need to to buy stuffs from people who don't like bitcoins.It doesn't defeat the purpose of bitcoins, since I can express my preference towards bitcoins by NOT storing any national currencies in a bank account for more than a few minutes time. A lot of bitcoin newbies don't understand what is the CPU used for in the bitcoin network.   They think bitcoins value is backed by electric energy.  It is not.CPU is used to implement what Satoshi called a "peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server".In any paiement system, there has to be a way to prove that some transaction occured before an other one.  There has to be some time measurement device.A simple clock is an efficient time measurement device.  But it is not trustworthy.  Anyone can modify it and set it to 3:50AM instead of 4:00AM for instance.A decentralised time measurement device must not just MEASURE time, it must PROVE it.CPU power in bitcoin is used to provide proof-of-work, but the real purpose is to provide proof-of-time.Bitcoin is not as accurate as a clock.  Not even remotely.   But it is much more trustworthy.In a nutshell, when a newbie asks "What is all this computing power used for?",  we should answer:  "To provide proof of time".   That's a funny one.  What exactly relates the hypothetically stored silver to the cryptocurrency?I think you haven't thought this through. If tulips could be sent via internet, if they could be divided like billions of times, if I could store them safely on my hard drive, etc...  then I would totally use them as money. There is indeed a 'getMinFee' function in the source code but it's easy to modify.   I'm not an expert of this subject either but I'm pretty sure everyone is free to accept or decline any fee anyway. Well, he also wrote: He's not exactly a huge bitcoin enthousiast.  :-/ I would rather to say that transactions fees are determined in a free market way or something.There is no rule regarding transactions fees, except for offer and demand. Isn't that in the FAQ?  If it isn't, please guys, add it.My answer:  Satoshi never pretended to have found the ultimate tecnology for money in the next ten thousand years.Bitcoin is secure with current technology and scientific knowledge.   To me this is good enough.
 Who's this guy I keep hearing about?  Does he hang around here sometimes? I actually also think that at some point in the future, we will be in a post-scarcity society, where everyone will work on a pure volontary basis (work based on desire, not need), and where everything will basically be free.But I also think such a society will be reached smoothly, not via some kind of communist revolution.Basically free market will gradually price things for their true value, which will slowly tend to zero.  We won't go from a money-based society to a moneyless society in a discontinuous manner.  It will be a slow process regulated by market forces.  Prices will gradually fall as things get more and more easy to obtain.You think we are currently already in this post-scarcity society.  I don't.   But I think it's not up to me or you to decide.  Only free market can tell.In other words, I changed my mind and I think a moneyless society IS possible.  But we are so far from it that first we have to try a sound money, and then eventually price of stuffs will decrease if that is what economic reality wants.   Because with a sound money, what you call a moneyless society is a society where prices of all goods and services are zero.  There's no reason for going to non-zero to zero discontinuously. Then I'd like to nominate this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSLByqTusaQ It is indeed one of the best quote from Satoshi.  I personnaly think you should have quoted it more extensively.In particular, I whish you had quoted this part:It would have been fun to think about banksters reading this. Honnestly I do think a bitcoin address can correctly be called "bitcoin account", although it is a bit misleading.But really, a bitcoin address is technically precisely this:  an account in the block chain.    I was kidding.   Anyway, you were asking questions any newbie could ask, so... The real question is:  who are YOU who asks such questions?If you work for police or governments, it would be pointless to attack Satoshi himself.His work has essentially been done and it is publicly available now. Here is the most recent picture we've got:Zorro: individual talent raising against collective force. Just curious about your opinion about this website. Good point. Well yeah, it wouldn't be different from the way most companies work, you know. Does that mean that buying shares from others would be forbidden?    It is indeed an issue those guys will have to solve.One solution could consist in receiving a code instead of cash first.   Wait a few minutes and then come back to the ATM to get the cash.So basically this:- go to the ATM- get the scan code displayed on the ATM.- send the requested amount of bitcoins for the desired amount of national currency- get a unique transaction code- leave the ATM- come back ten minutes later- send the transaction code- retrieve the cash. I really don't mind if they try to make some profit.   Bitcoin is all about free market, after all. Excellent.Pretty much one of the bridge technologies I was talking about in this post. I have already said it but I'd like to insist a bit and to repeat it.   Bitcoin doesn't need to go mainstream to be efficient and to fullfill its purpose.    Currently the bitcoin project only needs one thing:  an efficient bridge towards the current financiary system.We need a "bitcoin friendly" bank.   Basically a conventional bank that would be aware of bitcoins and would offer  automatic conversion via exchange market, using nothing but your VISA card (possibly in conjonction with a smartphone).In such a bank you could, if you want, not store any significative amount of national currency, nor bitcoins.   When you want to buy something in a store, you use your bank smartcard, and during the transaction process, your bank automatically converts some bitcoins you've just sent into the necessary amount of national currency you need.With this, we don't even need to promote bitcoin and to convince millions of non-geeky people to use bitcoins.   And it's a good thing, because otherwise it would be hopeless.We should never rely on other people's smartness to do things.IMHOPS.  I think the guys from MtGox are currently working on something like that. Before bitcoin reaches 1,000,000$, those people would have been very very little greedy if they resisted selling their bitcoins.High prices are a huge incentive to sell.  If someone is capable of resisting the temptation of selling and if he can wait until bitcoin reaches 1,000,000$, then I say he deserves to get rich.(damn it's annowiing as hell to constantly answer to the same stuffs.  Anyone can put that in the FAQ?) Personnaly, I just whish I had bought more bitcoins. Well, some people would not agree on that, as they'll start talking to you about heritage, social status and stuff like that.But when people give wealth to their children, they do nothing but expressing their natural love for their offspring.  Is it unfair that a mother loves her kid more than someone else's?If so, then I'd say communists don't really have a problem with money, they have a problem with life.  I'm not sure it is really possible to ban a bitcoin address, at least not in any practicle way.Say I own a "bad" bitcoin address with 100 BTC on it.If my bitcoin software tries to use it in a transaction to a currency exchange or anything alike, then police will be called and I'll go to jail, or the transaction will be refused.I think the best solution for me is just to transfer it to several other bitcoin address, mix bitcoins in those address with "legitimate" bitcoins, do this again and again, and finally merge everything in a brand new address (or just leave everything in many different addresses, doesn't matter).Basically, it's what the bitcoin launderer service do, I think it is pretty much efficient enough, and I doubt anyone can do anything to prevent anyone from doing this.
I'm sorry if we gave this impression.Just answer this question please:  how do I convince someone to do something for me in a moneyless society?Say I want to go in a foreign country but I don't own a plane nor I can pilot one.  Should I just find someone who do, and ask him to take me there?  What if this person doesn't want to go there, for instance because he thinks he has more interesting things to do?How do I convince people to work so that I can eat something everyday?  If I can't use money, does that mean that in order to have the right to receive some food, I would be required to work too?  Does that mean that my economic activities would be planified by some central bureaucracy?   Of course I have no problem with working to get some food, but I don't like the idea of people telling me what work exactly I must do and when. In a same way that you think that with capitalism free market eventually ends, I think that communism eventually ends up with forced labour. Nice article.I'd like to mention one thing though.  To me it is not true that bitcoin doesn't require a thrid party for transactions.  It does.  The thing is that this third party changes all the time, every ten minutes or so.   It is elected in an opened, public process, and every node in the network can postulate. I feel like registering, in case there is a forum or a comment space associated to this article.  Is there? lolI was googling bitcoin as I do every day and I saw that someone twitted Max Keiser about bitcoin.   We all know Max and Stacy Herbert have been "bitcoin friendly" for some time now.Maybe we could invite one of them to join us for this lunch?  Who knows, they might accept...I don't have any twitter account, but if you do, feel free to give them a link to this thread.PS.  Max Keiser lives and works in Paris (well, as far as I know...) In a perfectly rationnal world, people would sell currency A against currency B for one of these reasons:- they want to buy something and the seller requires paiement in currency B ;- they have just received currency A but they don't trust it as a store of value so they want to exchange against B ;But in the real world most forex traders are just players who think they can fool all other traders by selling high and buying low and always increase their balance. True, apart from your point #3 (I really think bitcoin is much more secure than traditional online banking).Still, it is a good exposé. Well, after reading this email I have to say that it actually does make sense.  An app that displays quotes as they are on bitcoinwatch.com is indeed a "website bundled as an app". Anyway, that doesn't change the fact that you should get rid of your iPhone.    It would be very easy to do as it is only a statistical analysis of the block chain.However, it wouldn't mean anything, as there is no way to know which accounts belong to the same people (remember you can own as many bitcoin addresses as you want). I'd like to emphasize a bit about how wrong it is to call bitcoin a private currency.Bitcoin is certainly not private.  Sure, it is not organised by the government, nor it is protected by the use of so-called public force.  But it is not private either.Bitcoin is much more public than any national currency.  I don't even have to explain why.  It is obvious enough. Well, at least this sentence is a nice tribute to Satoshi's work. THEY are the worst criminals.  They declare wars with people's tax money.  They conterfeit money.   They prevent people from doing business freely.What criminals are they talking about?  Drug dealers?  Don't care.   Weapon dealers?  Don't care either.  Terrorists?  Pff,  I don't buy that. Damn,  it happened much earlier than I thought.Bitcoin is finally acknowledged.  And even feared.Are they talking about bitcoin.com here?  This stuff is not related to bitcoin.  At all. Tough mission for a guy who only draws stickfigures. Bitcoin doesn't prevent anyone to make loans.I actually don't think the fractionnal reserve system is so bad.   I just think people should be allowed to try an other one.Also, in the expression "fractionnal reserve" has the word "reserve" in it.  Those reserves have to be reserves of something.Those reserves used to be gold.  They will be bitcoins. Oh, ok.  You were talking about the video or the magazine cover?   I very much like this video from the guy of "howtovanish.com":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSLByqTusaQIt's a pretty good exposé.   Make it buzz. I assure you that if one bitcoin was to reach a price of one million dollars (adjusted from inflation), then most of early buyers would have sold most of their bitcoins much before this price is reached.As I currently own a few thousand bitcoins, I can tell you that if bitcoin was reaching just 100$ or 100, I'd sell most of it.People tend to forget this.  You can not know for sure that what you own will reach a certain price until it actually does.   Actually, if someone was hanging on his bitcoins during long enough to see their price make him billionaire, then for sure this guy would receive a well deserved reward for having resisted the temptation of selling before. Yeah, good idea in case only the DNS is seized.Also, just ping bitcoin.org to get its IP (174.143.149.98) and add this to your /etc/hosts file:174.143.149.98      bitcoin.orgAnd that's it.That's not a solution if they also seize the server itself, though. Bitcoin doesn't really need the website to function, nor does it need this forum.Anyway, there will always be the wikipedia page.   I dare the US government to try having a wikipedia article closed.And as a replacement for the forum, there will be IRC until an other hosting solution is found.
Just get rid of your iPhone already. Of course anarchy is a meme, but it's not as strongely associated to bitcoin as Alpaca socks are. Begging is the less efficient way to get money I know. Guys, if we are very numerous it will be hard to find a table in a restaurant.  I can book one but in that case please confirm that you can be in Paris "la Défense" at lunch time on may, the 25th.But in worst case scenario, we'll always be able to find some room in a café.  So I guess it's fine. Yeah I was reluctant to say it, but indeed in a moneyless world, to get what they want, men would have to beg or to use force, and women would have to beg or to spread their legs. I guess you can order one online (paying with bitcoin2cc for instance).This is seriously big news.  This is going to be in every town in Nederlands. Do you see it?Hint:  it's just in the middle, right in front of you http://www.linuxmag.nl/dit-nummer.html Damn it...So many things to learn, and only one life   Here is the alternative to money:With this stuff, when I want someone to bring me a beer or to make me a pizza, I don't need to pay him.  All I need is to whip him very hard in the back and shout very loud. Who needs money really? Well, those people seem to think that everyone should earn 0$, whatever their job is.Amazing, isn't it? Yeah, do you want a free lunch with a free beer, you too ?Seriously, this is so silly that it is scary:http://worldwidestrike2012.blogspot.com/2010/10/world-wide-strike-2012.htmlBut before facepalming this, please talk to those guys and try to make them realize how silly they are.  Try to be as polite and respectful as possible.I whish I could answer to those guys myself but they use facebook and other privacy-hazardous networks.  If you have accounts on these networks, tell them that you can not have free stuff unless someone is willing to work for you for free.  Who's pretty enough to convince someone to get up in the morning and work in exchange of nothing but a smile and a "thank you"?  We should make a bounty to buy this guy a professional graphic tablet or something... Shazow I like your work.One bitcoin sent I hope you'll get to make an anime about bitcoin one day. If I want to do this more properly, i.e. using the MtGox certificate, anyone knows how I could do?I've seen on the web that I can retrieve the certificate with:openssl s_client -connect www.mtgox.com:443 -showcertsbut I see several certificates (I think it's a chain or something).Any idea? I know this is not exactly a business meeting, but I'm not sure I want to be some kind of a touristic guide either Anyway I really think "la Défense" would be a nice place. There is no way to prove your physical identity electronically.   The human body contains no identification nor signature algorithm. Ouais on peut y faire un tour histoire de faire une photo de groupe en face du palais Brognard.  Mais c'est pas idéal pour discuter, même si il y a aussi pas mal de cafés dans ce coin. As I was thinking about a place where to do this, I thought a symbolic place for finance would be nice.So, what about having lunch at "la Défense"?It's quite a nice place with lots of cafés and restaurants, and it's also a large pedestrian place so after lunch we can spend some time there and talk about the project if we want.Any other idea? You're french, S3052 ?  I had no clue.
Sounds good.  I'd do it if I was not so lazy. Bon je sais que c'est peut-être un peu tôt, mais ça ne couterait pas grand chose et si ça pouvait prendre ce serait énorme.Je parle des changeurs commerciaux, parfois appelés bureaux de change, qui ont des kiosques sécurisés dans les villes à fortes fréquentations touristiques, comme Paris.Si on pouvait en convaincre quelques uns d'accepter bitcoin parmi leurs monnaies, ce serait énorme.En gros ce qu'il faudrait ce serait concevoir une maquette par exemple A5, l'imprimer et la distribuer.Je déteste faire ce genre de travail d'édition, mais si quelqu'un est intéressé, proposez vos idées ici. XMPP is just a communication protocol, isn't it?  So it would not be a "base", but just a tool.What we really need is a standard format for orders.  How you publish them is not really a problem. Justmoon, your moon-like avatar is pretty cool.  What does it mean? Proof of work is required to decentralised the network.  Gavin explains that quite well in one of his interview.   Basically in a decentralised network, someone could send two orders in the same time, while both of them can not be fullfilled together (not enough funds).  There has to be a way to decide which order is valid and which is not.  In a centralised system, one would just take the first one to appear.  But in a decentralised network, there is no 'first one to appear'.  The two orders appear at different times in different areas of the network.Proof of work is used to elect one particular node that will arbitrate this and decide which order is valid, and which is not.  Is is basically used more as a "proof of time" rather than a "proof of work", but providing computing power is amongst the best on the market, proof of work IS proof of time.I personnaly don't know.  But it is considered to be at present time.As I understood it, longer target time would not be practical for electronic exchange, while shorter time would create too many chain forks. As far as I'm concerned, I registered to rstat.us because I didn't know about identity.ca. I am currently trying to learn about Atom Publication Protocol and I think it is pretty much everything we need.Basically anyone who wants to buy/sell bitcoins against anything could just publish his orders on his feed.  It would be twitter-like.   Some bots would search such orders on the web and recreate an order book that they could publish somewhere.  There would be some competition between those "broker-bots".   Basically those bots would do both order searching and adjudication. Describe the two cryptographic concepts bitcoin is based on:- public key cryptography (focus on signing) ;- proof of work (explain how this is used for a distributed time server) ; Oh this could be fun. I live in Paris and I'd be pleased to meet you, Gavin.  Anyone else ?I guess we could meet in a café, restaurant or something. Il y aurait éventuellement le salon linuxsolution qui doit avoir lieu en mai cette année à la Défense.http://www.solutionslinux.fr/En ce moment ils en appellent aux demandes de participation, justement. wow,   just had a look at the site.   It got pretty impressive with a large choice of different stuffs. BTW, I haven't seen any equivalent of the "--no-check-certificate" option in curl's manual page. hum... it worked for me.What versions of wget and libssl do you use?Mines are:libssl0.9.8:  Installed: 0.9.8o-7  Candidate: 0.9.8o-7  Version table: *** 0.9.8o-7 0        500 http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ sid/main i386 Packages        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status     0.9.8o-5 0        500 http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ testing/main i386 Packageswget:  Installed: 1.12-3  Candidate: 1.12-3  Version table: *** 1.12-3 0        500 http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ sid/main i386 Packages        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status     1.12-2.1 0        500 http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ testing/main i386 Packages After some hesitation, I voted "remove it".Not that I think dark pools are a bad thing or that it should be forbidden.  I just don't think it's necessary and I'd rather see as many orders as possible.But I really think it's only up to you.  MtGox is your business, not ours. Well, if it doesn't work with curl, at least it does with wget.  See above.However, you might need to use a SSL-compiled version.  See docs. Providing games-related services is a simple and potentially efficient way to earn your first bitcoins.I whish I was a gamer myself so I could do the same. Good luck and welcome in the bitcoin economy. Again:  honnestly Genjix I really think those guys don't deserve your efforts. Not bad.  I suspect this comes from a general theory about how new ideas get adopted.  Am I right? :-)So true.
Ok I guess I had a wrong impression then.  My bad.Somehow it seems that you're working for the "ennemy" though.  Think about it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry17VN5udFEthe guy is quite famous (well, I've seen him on maxkeiser.com).  This brings interesting comments on youtube. This article is a nice tribute to bitcoin.People are starting to realize how huge is this discovery.  Not those people attending this conf though.  I'm pretty sure they thought it was a prank.  There were even some women attending this conference.  That tells you a lot about this public. HAve you tried with www.mtgox.com instead of just mtgox.com?  I think there is an issue about that. Indeed, I could connect with a command like:$ read -s passwd ; wget -q --no-check-certificate --no-proxy -O - "https://www.mtgox.com/code/getFunds.php" --post-data="name=grondilu&pass=$passwd"And I had my JSON string:{"usds":0,"btcs":0}This is pretty cool. MtGox API is weird.They say we should authenticate by sending or login and password via POST method, but they give an example where they are in URL:https://mtgox.com/code/getFunds.php?name=blah&pass=blahI don't get it.  It data is in URL, isn't that GET method? Oh et puis non, j'ai changé d'avis.Je me rends compte qu'une telle conférence n'aurait d'autre intérêt que de satisfaire mon égo sur-dimensionné.Et j'ai même été jusqu'à proposer de payer pour louer la salle en plus !Honte à moi.  Est-ce que Satoshi s'est donné en spectacle à un moment ou un autre ?  Non.En plus, je comprends mal au nom de quoi je devrais parler de bitcoin à des gens qui n'ont pas envie de savoir ce que c'est puisqu'ils n'ont jamais pris l'initiative de chercher "monnaie électronique" ou un truc du genre dans Wikipedia.  On n'a que ce qu'on mérite, et pour certains c'est l'igonrance. EDIT:  mauvaise idée après réflexion.  Voir message suivant.Je crois savoir que pour quelques centaines d'euros il est possible de louer une salle à Paris.  Je peux financer ça sans trop de problème.Par contre il faudrait faire du buzz pour faire venir du monde.  Ca c'est plus dur.Une autre possibilité serait de se mêler à un évènement sur un thème lié (genre le e-commerce, l'internet et les logiciels libres, la finance, etc...)Bien sûr, je serais ravi et fier de représenter bitcoin en étant le conférencier.Des idées ? Genjix you were quite brave to talk in front on those quite "corporate" people.  You seemed extremely intimidated but you kept on and you did a good job.I don't know if those people were capable of seeing through you lack of experience in public talks, but I think at some point some of them were starting to.Well done.  Brave and bold.But you will need more practice if you want to become more convincing.  Keep on anyway!PS.  I so much would like to make a conference too.  In english or french, doesn't matter.   I'll try to see if I can organize something in Paris.PS#2.  I'm not sure those guys "deserve" to be taught about bitcoin.  Why did you do them this favor ? 2 oh, that's nice. Just a foolish poll This is seriously cool.  This means I can convert my income into bitcoins almost automatically.That's a great addition for the bitcoin economy. up up! I like the part "as long as the name is changed".  It's basically the only thing that matters. This is pretty cool.   Thanks for this service. What is the procedure exactly ?  Should we still warn you first via email before making the wire ?  Should we wait for confirmation between the email and the wire ? Oh yeah I like it   "wtfpl" ? Come on guys, gold hits a new record high and bitcoin is getting lower!Current bid is only 224 BTC.  You can do better than that!
Basically this stuff is to twitter what diaspora is to facebook, except that unlike Diaspora, it's already working (you don't need invitation or anything) !I guess you can find me by looking for "grondilu"http://rstat.us +1 I'm ashamed to admit I didn't know about this woman, nor had I heard the song "copying isn't theft" before. They are usefull to buy things between one another.  It's precisely why they exchange bitcoins for. Well yeah I had done this, obviously.But I didn't know about that.   I'll try. Sounds very cliché but it's just plain truth. Yeah, as I tried to explain here, bitcoin starts to be usefull with only three people. Sport sucks anyway.It's fun when you're a kid, but once you're grown up, it's just silly. Don't worry.  Even if everyone hoards bitcoin, at some point they will have a strong incentive to sell them.  And there will be some kind of a competition that will take place.  The less greedy will sell first.   There would be no point in hoarding for ever, unless you want to give your bitcoins to your children after you're dead.I own a few thousands bitcoins.  I can tell you that if one bitcoin was worth 1,000 euros, I would sell mines for sure, so that I can buy a house or something.   Some people would be less greedy and would sell their bitcoins at 500 EUR/BTC, and some other even less greedy.   When people start selling, they stabilize or even lower the price of bitoin, thus adjusting it to its true value.I do actually sell bitcoins on regular basis, because I think there are better investments than cash anyway, and because I need national currencies to eat and pay my rent.But I totally think there is no problem with hoarding whatsoever. On the other end, indian people are the only people in the world who are so obssessed with this weird, awfully complicated game. Zut j'ai vu ce message trop tard.  Du coup je me suis déplacé pour rien :/Bon c'est comme tu veux, on décide une autre date, tu me donnes un adresse bitcoin pour que je te rembourse, ou tu me communiques tes coordonnées bancaires pour que je te vire les 60 euros. omg Tu préfères le matin ou l'après-midi? Not exactly.  It's not that simple.  I make some kind of a mix. People openly begging for bitcoins are actually quite rare on this forum.I am surprised one of them is someone who introduces himself as someone with a "finance background".  Don't you have any money to buy bitcoins, instead of just begging for some? Good point.Thanks for having thought of that for me  You're young, keep some hair while you still have some, really.I am 33 and I lost most of my hair (pretty much like Molyneaux).  When I was younger I thought it would not bother me, but now I can tell you it does a bit. bon, voici l'addresse bitcoin à utiliser:14UnUP6XuFozL5JToUhfrXi1jvtCoVhGatJe te communique l'endroit et l'horaire pour le rdv dès que j'accuse réception des 100 BTC There are more or less independant exchanges in each national currency.For instance, when I trade bitcoins off the counter against euros, I look at the rate of bitcoins in USD but I don't really look at the EUR/USD rate.  I just make myself a grosso-modo value and give my price.  So I'm pretty sure there ARE arbitrage opportunities for motivated people. Amongst important US politics, I think Ron Paul is the more likely to ever introduce bitcoin in mainstream media.I'm curious to have your view on this.
This gives me an idea for a poll Je te propose de t'en acheter pour 50 euros, mais à 0.6 euros le bitcoin.PS.  Ou, pour simplifier le calcul, 60 euros pour tes 100 bitcoins. I up this poll as newbies might be interested in voting. C'est pas parce que c'est décentralisé que les gens n'ont pas le droit de s'associer  I knew it was april fool but I wanted to read those funny comments   So were the founders of Paypal. you believed it, right?Well, it's april the first, guys!    << We no longer accept Federal Reserve Notes as donations!

Why don't you see bigger and raise a bounty to finance an "around-the-world with bitcoins" trip?
Well, ok,  I was a bit pedantic here.  Labels don't matter that much. I have no idea what justifies those two days settlement, but I suspect it is related to clearing.  And there is no clearing with bitcoins. I think it's a standard procedure in bond markets. No, sorry.   You just have to stay awake.  I don't want to wait 10 hours for a paiement. I'm curious to see the result of this one Well, I'll be the first in bitcoin history to actually "do" it   Less than 7 days left.Are you guys going to let ender_x take all my coins or something?  He has already won my two previous auctions. "Anonymous" would not be the correct term.  You'd rather talk about "pseudonymous" credit system.Your pseudonym would be your GnuPG ID.In an anonymous network, all nodes are equivalent and you can't tell them apart.  In a pseudonymous network, they are not, but you just don't know anything about them except their ID, which can be as meaningless as a random number. I'm not sure the timestamping in a GnuPG signature is trustworthy.  If it was, the bitcoin network would use it instead of a distributed time server.Anyway, now that I think about it, signing bids is not necessary.  It is really an auction protocol issue.  Here the proof of concept is about bonds, not forum auctions.What has to be signed is my promess to pay.  So once I get a bitcoin address from the auction winner, I'll sign it along with the bonds terms, and that will be all. Sorry I have not read this whole thread, nor do I know the complete story, but to me it is quite clear that the guy made a fondamental mistake in putting the word "dollar" in the name of his currency. Basically a bid could look like this:-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1XX BTC> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----> Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)> > iEYEARECAAYFAk2UNq0ACgkQq17371C4DmhQIQCg86UwjCUt0q8iyojsOXUI7juB> BpsAn2UtxuFqtXpLPwedvnYap+m2wrx9> =qC0c> -----END PGP SIGNATURE----------BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)iEYEARECAAYFAk2Uc8EACgkQq17371C4DmhXSQCdGnXrJG6/4cA411b6lkXwX5UcLL8AnjuQGKNmI6LEbHpYAPca8P/GMqKL=btiF-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----But I'm not sure it is really important.  It's not related to the bond process, but to the auction process anyway.  I don't think we would need it if we were on biddingpond, for instance.

Idealy people who bid should sign their bid in a message including my initial signed message.This woudl allow the winning bidder to sign the final bitcoin address. The time length is 20,000 - 16,000 = 4,000 blocks.   There are about 6 blocks per hour,  so 4,000 blocks is about 666 hours (?! number of the beast??  didn't do that on purpose!)666 hours is 27 days, so about 4 weeks. You've just overbidded yourself, but why not...Gusti leads with 91 BTC I can't accept this bid, since so far the bitcoin network only allows paiements with 0.01 BTC precision. If you bid 100 BTC, this means you'll pay me 100 BTC at block 116,000, and I'll pay you back at block 120,000.  You would lend me money at zero interest rate. gusti leads with 90 BTC theymos leads with 80 BTC

Reputation would not be on you, as a physical human being.  It would be on the GPG public key.Basically people will think "I know that the guy, whoever he is, who uses this GPG key has always paid his debts.  So I guess I can trust him to pay this one."If you lose your private key, then you'll lose the associated reputation and you'll have to start again with a new, zero reputation key. I don't see any issue.  Just GPG sign a loan contract and publish it. Pretty much anything, after currency exchange.Basically if bitcoin rates are low, this offer would allow bitcoin carry trade.

When I use X I use awesome too, but in the "full screen" mode, which means that I rarely see my bacground screen.So my desktop is very boring and I will spare it to you.PS.  Bah...  here it is, anyway: This seem interesting.  I'll give this a try.  By myself first, and if I can't manage I'll contact you. Last time I tried, I had compilation errors.I've just tried again, I get:Code:$ uname -aLinux aptosidbox 2.6.38-1.slh.4-aptosid-686 #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Mar 26 13:12:20 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux$ make -g++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -D__WXGTK__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" -o obj/nogui/util.o util.cppg++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -D__WXGTK__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" -o obj/nogui/script.o script.cppg++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -D__WXGTK__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" -o obj/nogui/db.o db.cppg++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -D__WXGTK__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" -o obj/nogui/net.o net.cppg++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -D__WXGTK__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" -o obj/nogui/irc.o irc.cppg++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -D__WXGTK__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" -o obj/nogui/main.o main.cppg++ -c -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -D__WXGTK__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" -o obj/nogui/rpc.o rpc.cppIn file included from /usr/include/boost/asio/ssl/context_service.hpp:30:0,                 from /usr/include/boost/asio/ssl/context.hpp:22,                 from /usr/include/boost/asio/ssl.hpp:19,                 from rpc.cpp:12:/usr/include/boost/asio/ssl/detail/openssl_context_service.hpp: In member function void boost::asio::ssl::detail::openssl_context_service::create(SSL_CTX*&, boost::asio::ssl::context_base::method):/usr/include/boost/asio/ssl/detail/openssl_context_service.hpp:73:28: error: ::SSLv2_method has not been declared/usr/include/boost/asio/ssl/detail/openssl_context_service.hpp:76:28: error: ::SSLv2_client_method has not been declared/usr/include/boost/asio/ssl/detail/openssl_context_service.hpp:79:28: error: ::SSLv2_server_method has not been declaredmake: *** [obj/nogui/rpc.o] Erreur 1I suspect it's because I have too a recent version of openssl:Code:$ apt-cache policy openssl libssl-devlibssl-dev:  Installé : 1.0.0c-2  Candidat : 1.0.0c-2 Table de version : *** 1.0.0c-2 0        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status     0.9.8o-5 0        500 http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ sid/main i386 Packagesopenssl:  Installé : 1.0.0c-2  Candidat : 1.0.0c-2 Table de version : *** 1.0.0c-2 0        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status     0.9.8o-5 0        500 http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ sid/main i386 PackagesI've just downgraded openssl, and now I get:make: *** No rule to make target `cryptopp/obj/sha.o', needed by `bitcoind'.  Stop. I personnally prefer not to store any radioactive element.There is an article here where a chemist explains why gold beats other elements as a form of money. Try to put a significative amount of wealth with copper or even silver in your pocket. The more currency exchanges, the better. An idea concerning the next, more technical video:it should really take some time to explain both public key cryptography and the concept of cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work. I confess I am a bit reluctant to use it, though.After all what exactly prevents it to have a trojan inside?I guess I'll wait until there are a lot of people who havve tested it and audited the code. For physical money there is nothing but gold. I understand genjix being kind of angry about that.This is a no brainer:  the bounty should be paid for this excellent video and it would put a shame on the bitcoin community if it wasn't.   No need to wait until april 5th.
Yay, of course.Sure, the video is not perfect, but it's pretty damn good and come on :  if these guys don't deserve the bounty, who will??? Yes maybe I should mention that I too have some minor displaying problems with the new site.I'm using the Arora web browser under Debian GNU/linux.Here is a screenshot: I am amazed how Satoshi managed to sum up his idea so well in only three paragraphs. Smart people would have more money and success than normal people???That would be unfair! Making a "good" wikipedia article is far from easy.I doubt the bitcoin article will be rated "good" any time soon. Ponzi schemes are fun, providing nobody is lying to you about what it is.It's not worse than lottery or gambling, anyway. il faudrait peut-être ajouter le lien au wiki, sur la partie "associations acceptant les bitcoins comme donations". It is not so easy to become rich by hoarding or even cornering a commodity.  First, there is a competition between hoarders.  The less greedy gets his profit first, and reduces the price of the commodity, and thus destroys any hope for others to get rich.Second, even if you manage to corner the commodity, your profit is not guaranted.   See the story of the Hunt brothers with silver.I dare you to try anyway.  You'll see it's not that easy. Bitcoin is a currency.  Not a currency exchange plateform.Do you know any currency that integrates a forex trading system?  I don't. Voui voui, vous avez bien lu:http://www.laquadrature.net/fr/soutien2011Personnellement je ne donne pas souvent à ce genre d'assoc, mais là puisqu'ils acceptent les bitcoins, je vais peut-être faire un effort...PS.  Allez, je me suis fais violence et je leur ai envoyé 10 bitcoins. Casascius, whatever you are proposing, please just do it.It would be quite a relief if we could redirect people complaining about the constant final amount of bitcoins. What about you implement such a service? Hard to tell without spoiling.  Let's say it's a SF story about space travel. I'm sick of this debate anyway.   Again:  just create a inflacoin, if you want.  It is just one line to comment in bitcoin's source code. That wouldn't bother me, really.  At all.  I'd buy some of this new currency too. Problem is that nobody would by a constant inflation currency.  I wouldn't anyway.Nobody forces anyone to buy bitcoins.   I started to buy bitcoins when it was around 0.2$/BTC.  So according to you I was exploited by people who bought at 0.1$/BTC.   And yet I don't complain.  I decided to buy those coins.  On the contrary, I am thankful to satoshi and other bitcoin pioneers. I don't know how to use ftp via SSL.  I tried with sftp but no answer from the server.Anyway, if you want to share these for free, why don't you make an archive and share it via torrent? Why?  Maybe it's a fake bitcoin app that has been detected by the software. I think he meant "constant inflation".  But you make a good point. Yes you can.  All you need is a bunch of bureaucrats who will decide for everyone what money should be used from now on.  Just like we did in Europe with euro.
Here is a small poll about different ways someone can learn about bitcoin.I'd like to show that we should not try too hard to promote bitcoin.  IMO people who are interested in improving the current monetary system find out about bitcoin by themselves.  So my guess is most people will answer #3, as I do. I'm pretty sure that people who are interested in improving the current monetary system, will eventually learn about bitcoin, and adopt it.  It's not difficult to search about digital money on internet and find out about bitcoin on wikipedia for instance.IMO it's useless to try to get the average Joe to be interested in bitcoins.  Those guys will not accept this currency until it is talked about on national TV. Hi,first I want to say that in my opinion it's not very cool what Nefario is having you done.  Basically he forces you to beg for bitcoins in order to pass your grade.  Seriously not cool imo.However, I seriously think you could make bitcoins much easier on this forum by just taking part in it.  Not just in the marketplace forum, but also in other general discussion threads.  We occidental people we are quite curious about life in China nowadays.  You could tell us what you think of capitalism, whether or not you feel oppressed by government, what your life looks like in every day basis, and so on...Basically I advise you to take part in our discussions, and put a bitcoin address in your signature.  At some point if you write something interesting, you'll get some bitcoins without even having to ask for them. Might be a big cliché, but I think they want everyone to live in harmony and non-violence.  Meaning that nobody possesses anything, everybody works for everyone and you have to share whatever you produce. Very true.  But I suspect most anarchists (well at least the left-anarchists) don't like this idea, neither do they like cryptography or money in general. Yeah my examples of utopias were not very good.  I lack imagination about those stuffs.Anyway that was only part of my point.  Power does exist and therefore I have difficulty to imagine a society without it.Truly, in the world there will always be at least one person who will be willing to take the power.  If nobody does, I will.PS.  I hate hippies and in a hippie world I assure you I would build some guns and enslave them all.    I expressed my doubts about anarchy in the thread about riots in London.  I thought we might open a new thread about anarchy in general.  I'll start giving my opinion on the subject.I seriously begin to doubt the concept of anarchy means anything anyway.  To me, anarchy is to politics what nihilism is to philosophy.  It's a paradoxical, contradictory concept.If we consider anarchy to be the absence of central rules or coercion forces, then we have to admit that there is an inner paradox in such a concept:  how can you prevent rules or coercion, without using coercion or rules?In a sentence:   "No rules" is still a rule.Politics is about organisation of power.   But politics doesn't create power ex-nihilo.  Power does exist, because human action exist.  Weapons exist and humans tend to use them when they can.   Anarchist would like to see usage of force disappear from earth, but it is just as utopian as the disappearance of sickness, aging, humger and other bad things in the world.Politics is about opinions about which usage of force can be accepted, and which usage can not.   And to clarify these, there is a set of rules which can be voted by the people or edicted by an autocrat.  Each individual can have his own set of rules, and if his set of rules is totally different from the rest of the society, this person usually becomes a criminal or any other kind of asocial.Honnestly, sometimes I think I understand anarchy, and somtimes I'm not sure I understand it at all.  It's kind of disturbing.So I think I can't declare myself as an anarchist.   And yet, I think there is no real rule about how power should be organised.  Power is not something that should be discussed, it's something that should be taken.  It belongs to whoever is capable of taking it. I have a better advice:  just don't watch corporate mainstream news.  Especially TV.Pictures are most often selected, edited, sometimes scenarized.  They are misleading.Also: now when something happens at 10,000 miles away, you know it immediately, as if such an event had direct implication in your life.  Usually it doesn't.  The result is that you get anxious for no reason.  Just turn your TV of, dump it or sell it, whatever.  Just take care of your own life first. I'm totally ok with mini states.  The more, the better.Moreover, on internet when you're not happy with the rules on some website, it is easy and painless to leave and to go somewhere else.  Things are different IRL. No, you don't.  Unless you are a gay gerontophile. You might consider using text-mode browser.Problem is that you see pictures only if you click on them, and then you see them fullscreen, which is worse, in a sense  Please behave or go away. This has very little to do with anarchy.  If this guy wants to post this kind of picture, he can.  But somewhere else.Just as nobody would blame you if you kick out of your house someone who craped on your sofa, nobody would blame the moderators of this forum to evict someone who post these kinds of pictures.PS.  as soon as I saw this picture, I immediately personnaly reported it with this comment:  "useless offensive picture" It could, but with a few wars from times to times.   Not unlike how the current world works, though. You are indeed missing something.  One line is commented in the second version. As I understand it, in an anarcho-capitalist society, coercion does exist.  It's just that it is NOT legitimised.But I confess my view on these topics are not clear. There is no complicated process to follow, really.  In case of bitcoin, if someone wants to create a version of bitcoin with a constant reward for miners, all he has to do is to comment one line in the code:In main.cpp, replace:Code:int64 GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64 nFees){    int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;    // Subsidy is cut in half every 4 years    nSubsidy >>= (nHeight / 210000);    return nSubsidy + nFees;}by:Code:int64 GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64 nFees){    int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;    // Subsidy is cut in half every 4 years    //nSubsidy >>= (nHeight / 210000);    return nSubsidy + nFees;}That's all.  Then all what one has to do is to run this and hope that other people will be interested in running the same thing. You could claim the same moral issue with basically any currency.When you buy something to someone, you can't know what this person is going to do with the money.  Maybe he's a ganster, a terrorist or a pedophile, and the business you're having with him is just a front or a money laudering scheme. I whish a confidence crisis in bitcoin happens soon, so I can buy them all for say, 10 euros a million of bitcoins. Chaos is part of anarchy as it is difficult to avoid a temporary chaotic period during the decline of an centralised regime.But honnestly I still struggle to understand what anarchy is exactly.If I try to define myself as a market anarchist, or an anarcho-capitalist, I'm afraid I have to admit I'm in favor of emperialism or fascism.Truth is that in an anarcho-capitalist society, the power is free to be taken, by anyone who can manage to take it and keep it.  Such a person is different from a king, since he got his power only from his own merit, and anybody can take his power from him, if he's able to do so.Still, I prefer this to a fake empire based on democracy, mass brain washing and social engineering.
Free software organisations are not democratic.  When someone doesn't agree with the majority, he doesn't have to "obey".  He can just fork the sotfware.  Democracy is not freedom, it's dictatorship of the majority towards minority.   Fortunately it doesn't prevail in FOSS. next episode (#3) is tomorrow. Well, the amount of the dividends are voted during general assembly.  So voting rights matter. Those are three nice animes but they are way too "serious" for my taste.  I actually don't even like ghost in the shell.  "Serial experimental lain" is good but basically the opening is my prefered part in this anime.  The rest is just ok to watch.Excel Saga is an anime I like to mention because it is fun and out of the box.PS.  Here are a few others of my prefered animes:* NHK ni yokoso* K-On!* Azumanga Daioh* Ima, sokoni iru Boku (aka "Now and then, here and there")* Nana* Kino's odyssey* Denno Coil* Kamichu!* Shinryaku! Ika musumePS#2.  I don't read mangas much (I prefer watching animes), but recently I red "Gantz" and it's pretty good, although the anime sucks. first: get rid of Windows© and install a decent operating system. Making a 50 BTC reward for ever is easy.  Basically you just have to comment one line in the code. Just an other stupid poll about Satoshi Indeed. I watch japanese anime a lot.Amongst my prefered animes:- Claymore - Excel Saga - Elfen Lied And many more, but those three are the ones I have in mind right now. Oh yeah I totally forgot about Ripple.  I'm not convinced about it being of any help for a decentralized currency, yet it can definitely be used for decentralised trading. Ok that makes sense.  It is true that the "contact" part was a bit tedious.  We didn't know exactly if we should chose to use regular email or internal biddingpond messaging system.  It was a bit confusing, so I understand getting rid of this part could be beneficial.The thing is that when I had make this auction, I didn't know about this new feature you've implemented, so I feel like I am a bit put in the corner.Right now in my auction there is a part saying "Payment address: xxxxxx",  and there is NO INDICATION whether this paiement address is mine or yours.  I think it is confusing for the buyer, especially since I didn't know I should warn the buyer not to use this paiement method.  Basically now if I wanted to stick with the old method for this auction, I just don't know how I could, since I can't edit the auction message and say something like "do not use the bitcoin address below, I'll provide you a bitcoin address via biddingpond's internal message system, in due time".What I will do for this auction is that I will try your new method, after all as a seller I don't have much to risk, since if I don't receive the bitcoins, I'll just don't send the gold coin.  I've just realised that So, to sum up:  ok, I'll try your new method for this auction.  Depending on how well it works, I might use it in the future too. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1I see no reason why we should discuss this in private, as this might be of interest for other people.  If you're concern is about me being really the same "grondilu" as the one on your site, then I sign this message.Now, please explain me why I should use you as a third party, when so far my auction went fine by giving directly a bitcoin address to the buyer.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)iEYEARECAAYFAk2MxMUACgkQq17371C4Dmjs4QCfSt380p/G0GKTbPVLJhlT3vUUWMwAoKYvoxKworAPWEVh5V+qJeo1mut0=cuiz-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- Biddingpond, on second thought I'm not sure I see any real advantage in using you as a third party.I have to think about it, but for the moment, what could I do to remove this "paiement address" from the auction page? Most of us like the idea of a decentralised internet, and thus I guess everyone would be happy to see a P2P trading system.I doubt however that we should expect a technical solution to do so.  Rather, we should encourage people to provide their own currency exchange service.I personnaly sell bitcoins on a small, cheap website that you can see on my signature.  I accept cash in the mail and bank wire.  So far it works quite well.   I initially decided that I would only SELL bitcoins, because I was hoping that other people would do just as I did, so if I want to buy bitcoins, I could just by some on their website.  This is one of the reasons why I self-published the source code of my website.So, I hereby encourage everyone to do exactly what I did.  The code is public domain.  Just use it or modify it anyway you want.  In order to have it work, you need:* a webserver or a host that accepts CGI.  If you chose a webserver on your own machine, I recommend you use thttpd.  It is WAY simpler than apache to configure.* some knowledge in bash.  My code is not very complicated, and after a bit of time reading the bash manual, you'll understand it easily.* if you selfhost your site, you may need a domain name.  You might you no-ip.com, or any other solution.  You can also consider using TOR hidden service (just google those three words).That's all.  Once a lot of people host their own currency exchange offer, it would be easy to organise some kind of federation.  Basically some bots would inspect those websites and publish best bids/asks.  A full order book could thus be reconstructed.  And then we'll have a nice decentralised trading system. Ok, seems fair enough. Damn it I totally forgot about this upgrade of your website.Had I remembered, I would have been waiting a bit before making my recent auction for a gold coin.I hope the transition will work fine.PS.  What is this "paiement address" about??  This is NOT one of my address.  Please explain. Tu parles de bitcoin en général ou de cette vidéo en particulier ?Dans le second cas j'en doute, et dans le premier j'ai déjà écrit une dépèche bien trollesque sur linuxfr.http://linuxfr.org/news/connaissez-vous-les-bitcoins I think it is nice to promote bitcoin, but it is not essential.  To explain it I'll try to explain why bitcoin is usefull, even if it is used only by three people.Let's picture too old friends, Alice and Bob, who spent a lot of time together during their youth.  As friends, they help one another some times to times.  Whether it is Alice lending her car to Bob for an evening, Bob watching Alice's kids, Alice helping Bob in repairing his bike, whatever.Usually they help one another for free.   They try to keep this relationship quite balanced.  If, for some reason, it seems to Alice that she helps Bob more than Bob helps Alice, at some point Alice might be reluctant to go on being helpful with Bob.  She might consider that she'd rather spend her precious time with her kids, her husband or whatever...With time, Alice and Bob get to take a different life path, and they see one another less and less often.  They are still friends, but now it is more and more difficult to convince for one of them to give help.     Anyway, they don't really want to do it for free:  they want some way to ensure that their overwhole relationship will be balanced.So they start a basic monetary system.  Just for the two of them.   They use a dedicated book, and they write a number in it each time one of them give a favor to the other.  There is no concern regarding centralisation, since they are only two people involved anyway:  each transaction is necessarly seen by everyone in the "network".  Although Alice and Bob have now a little bit "less friendly" relationship, at least it's more efficient now, and it's more adequate with their relationship that was becoming less friendly anyway.  Had they stayed the best friends in the world, they would not have needed the book.That the first thing to know about money:  it allows collaboration between people who respect each other, but don't like each other enough to accept to give or help without expecting anything in return.    Money is definitely not something for christians  Anyway, imagine now that Carl, an old friend of both Alice and Bob shows up.  They all used to be best buddies in kindergarden They would like to include Carl in their help/service/favor relationship network.   But now, suscpicion can appear.  Say Alice makes a deal with Carl:  they both write the transaction in the book, but Bob doesn't have to be there.  So Bob has to trust Alice and Carl not to do anything smelly that would eventually force him to return undue favors to one or both of them.   In other worlds: trouble begins.  I think you get my point.   Alice, Bob and Carl could just use bitcoin.  It would provide them a reliable way to account for the favor/services they provide one another.This is basically why I think bitcoin doesn't have to be mainstream.  It doesn't matter if only a few thousand people use it in the world.  It will still be usefull as a money, mainly because one of the service provided could be currency exchange, thus allowing the bitcoin community to interact with people outside of the bitcoin community, just because bitcoin would allow them to help one another to do so.Say Alice wants to buy something in a shop which accepts only dollars.  She has very little dollars because dollars mainly belong to banksters thanks to B. Bernanke.   But she has bitcoins and the support of the bitcoin community.  Some people in the community do have dollars.  The more they are, the more likely it is for them to gather enough dollars to buy the stuff Alice wants.   Alice will gain a favor if she gets those dollars.  Such a favor won't be free:  it will be measured by the bitcoins she will give in exchange.What I am trying to say here is that currency exchange is really the most important service you can provide for the bitcoin community.  We should focus on that, much more than we focus on promoting bitcoin (although promoting bitcoin is fine, but not essential imo). Indeed, this coin is sometimes nicknamed "angel" and is one of the nicest of the napoleon series. Yeah I understood that too after about 30 seconds.  Most efficient delayed joke ever 
I know it weights the correct weight, and looks exactly the same as many others, but there is no way I can prove it on line.  You just have to look at the photos and video, and consider my selling history:  so far no one has ever complained about receiving a fake coin.PS.  Also:  good quality fake coins of that size are very rare.  The only I know of are actually filled with platinium (they were minted at a period when platinium was cheaper than gold), and are now much more expensive than real coins. Here is a small video of the coin:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhstcm_20ff-napoleon-type-genie-3e-republique-a-vendre-sur-biddingpond_lifestyle I haven't watched the whole video, just enough to get the idea I guess.I want to say this:whatever one can think of this guy's initiative, I'm pretty sure that after doing what he did, he probably didn't feel depressed anymore.   And that's good enough. Not exactly.  My idea was rather of bitcoin being called "bitpoint" and presented not as a currency, but rather as a "worthless" symbolic token to reward textual contribution on any web forum. I guess you know several forums on the web, which use a "points" system to reward authors.  Basically when you like a post you can give it some points, the total of received points is displayed, and this allows readers to get an idea of how pertinent is an article, without even the need to read it.I wonder if the success of bitcoin would have been greater, had it been introduced/marketed as such a solution system. Yeah rigth, and the solution to this, is to print some numbers on some pieces of paper.  Seriously I don't understand your way of thinking.  At all.  What am I missing? I've watched the video with my french subtitles, and it is ok, really.Keep in mind that french people are used to read french, and german people are used to read german.   It's not because those languages are a bit longer than english once written, that german and french people read more slowly than english people!! (well, I hope not anyway). Check it out:http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=410Happy bidding, guys!   Definitely, providing the guy in charge can convince me he is motivated, competent and powerful. My short answer:no. A bitcoin-aware bank would be a major breakthrough for the bitcoin community, for it would provide a gateway between bitcoin and national currencies via smartcards (VISA or other).Basically when you need to purchase something, you first buy the appropriate amount in the national currency with your bitcoins on a global bitcoin exchange place.  Your bank would allow this and provide technical solutions to do so.  Once you bought the national currency amount, you can proceed to paiement as any normal banking paiement.This would be enough to claim a 100% success of the bitcoin project, imo. I voted "debasement"."Theft" is a bit too hard a word, imo.Inflation is theft only if you hoard cash during long period of time.  Very few people do that, precisely because they are aware of inflation.Also:  gold exists (and so does bitcoin, now).So there is no way inflation can steal you any significative fraction of your wealth, unless you are very financially unwise.PS.  You could have added "Tax" as a possible choice for your poll. Here is my french version:http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/what_is_bitcoin-fr.srt I guess it is possible to convert the difficulty into a unit of power (in watt, assuming everyone use a common market graphic card).  But this would give only the consumption for the winning nodes.Some statistics should allow to evaluate the number of nodes, and thus the total consumption.Quite a difficult maths problem, though. This video is a seriously great bitcoin achievment.I mean: it has been funded thanks to a bitcoin bounty.  It's kind of a proof of concept by itself. Je l'ai mise sur freetorrent.fr (l'intérêt par rapport à youtube c'est qu'elle est en HD sous des formats d'encodage libres):http://freetorrent.fr/download.php?id=0428ed06cb92f1ceeb89bdfedafb448405817b49&f=What+is+bitcoin%3F.torrent This is an idea.  How much would it cost to air it on US national TV?Maybe we should start a bounty for that  They just are not the same people.I just think that if, on bitcoin.org, we use a video that redirects to weusebitcoin.com, then the visitor can be confused, and thus we should give some eplanation.PS.  We could place the video with an introduction such as:<<Here is a short indroduction video made by our fellows on weusebitcoin.com:>> Members of the bitcoin community? sure.  Members of the bitcoin.org community?  Not so sure.Otherwise they would have mentionned bitcoin.org at the end of their video.But again:  it's ok if they mention their own website.  It is their work after all.  But if we want to use this video, it worths warning the viewer. This video is the product of their work.  I won't blame them for taking credit for it and putting their own website link at the end.So I don't think it is necessary to edit the video.  However, a small textual note could be added above the video, saying that this video was not done by members of the bitcoin.org community.
It is indeed a bit fast but imo it's ok for a quick introduction video.  It also gives energy and rythm to the thing.  If it were slower, it could be boring.People who want to have a deeper understanding of bitcoin will just have to visit the given link. This is actually a pretty good video Well done!PS.  Am I the only one who thinks that this video could replace Gavin's speech video on bitcoin.org? Hum, do you think this is the reason for the recent surge in Wikipedia's article number of wisits? I whish I could think of bitcoin more as a protocol than as a software.  But I can't since there is no RFC or clear protocol description document.  Satoshi's white paper is nice, but it is not enough I'm afraid. Nefario, please don't take it wrong, but what about you teach them english as you are supposed to do, instead of forcing them to sell themselves on the web for bitcoins? So basically your teacher is having you make some work and earn some money for him!??Tell him bitcoin is money, it's not an educational toy or something... Well, first I'll try the one you posted, which looks tasty   Well, it's not really a simple recipe, but I appreciate your effort.  I'll send you .50 BTC. I like chinese food but I know almost nothing about it and to me it seems quite complex.I mean, could you give us an example of a very simple chinese recipe that I could cook at home?  With very basic ingredients (but don't tell me I should kill my pet, please). Very true. What about not providing any implementation for MS Windows© or Macintosh© ?That would save some space on the page, so that we could make some room for a FreeBSD, OpenBSD or other Free Open Source operating systems. It is, provided you add an unstable entry in your apt repository.For more info,  man sources.listPS.  I have no idea if it would work with Lenny, though.  Normally it should since apt-get is supposed to automatically install all required dependencies. Maintainer is Jonas Smedegaard.You can have his contact information with apt-cache:apt-cache show bitcoind(the name of the package seems to have been changed recently) I very much agree with all this.My toecoin concept was just an thought experiment, and I soon realised that it would not actually work, for several reasons.  I thought it worthed presenting it on this forum, though. To me bitcoin is absolutely fair, because the rules are the same for everyone, and you are not forced to take part.For some people however, bitcoin is not fair because:* people who have the greatest processing power gets to generate more bitcoins than others;* people who get to know about bitcoin's existence first get to generate more bitcoins (since the difficulty was lower when they started);It's annowing as hell to have to respond to those critics.  We should write something good about it and put it in the FAQ. I don't use social network tools anyway.  I don't get the point of these stuffs,  so I'll probably won't use Diaspora.I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. Yeah,  I had missed it. The real flesh toes are necessary only for initial distribution of the currency.  Once created, the toecoins can be exchanged electronically as any cryptocurrency. WARNING:  this topic is just a crazy idea, I don't even know if it makes any sense.  Please be indulgent.Today I was again responding to the classic critic about bitcoin, concerning the initial distribution, which was accused not to be "fair".As I have already explained it, I see no other way than using CPU power to distribute an electronic decentralised anonymous currency.  I have already stated that this is probably some kind of a theorem that could be proved:"The initial distribution of an electronic currency that is both decentralised and anonymous has to be related to the distribution of CPU power in the network."However, I came up with quite a crazy idea about an alternative way to distribute a currency in a fair way.I'd call it the toecoin.  It's just a crypto currency like bitcoin, but with a tiny, and yet quite huge difference.Every human being has the right to receive 2 toecoins for free, just because he is a human being.  That's the rule.  The currency is decentralised and anonymous, and thus, according to my theorem, it can not be purely electronic.Here is how it works.  I am a human being and I have no toecoin.  This is not normal, and I want to claim my right to own two toecoins.  I wait for the next block to be found.  For the sake of the discussion I'll imagine that the average time for discovering block is one day, and not six minutes.Ok, there is a guy who finds a block.  Now here is the first difference with bitcoin:  the guy doesn't receive a reward yet.  He publishes the block, with a spectial generation transaction, but this transaction doesn't worth anything yet.I hurry and I go this guy's place, or some public place meeting address he published on the web.  I have some time to do so.  About 24 hours.Here I am at the place, and I am not the only one.  Basically a whole bunch of toecoinless people who wants to claim their toecoins just as I do.  Now, the guy, because he has found the proof of work, he is granted the right to give 2 toecoins to anyone he wants, under one condition that I will describe later.  He could give them to himself, if he fullfills the condition.Negociation start.  Everybody will promess to give a fraction of their new toecoins to the guy.  There is some kind of an auction which starts.  Let's say I'm the winner.  I promess to pay 0.2 toecoins.  Most people didn't agree to pay more than 0.15.  They'll have to wait an other day, an other block.To have the right to receive the 2 toecoins (1.8 after I give 0.2 to the block discover), I have to do the following:1.  I cut each of my little toes and I film the scene.  This will prevent me from getting more than two toecoins later in my life;2.  I have to put the toes in a machine that will analyse the toe fingerprint and the DNA and turn the corresponding data into a unique ECDSA private key.  This will ensure that the created toecoins do indeed belong to the person who cut his toes, because it should be possible for me to have computed the ECDSA key in the past (I can analyse my DNA and print my fingerprints).  The whole process has to be public and recorded so that anyone can verify there has been no fraud.This sounds silly, but my aim is to show how difficult it would be to distribute something in a "fair" way in a decentralised, anonymous manner.  At some point, I really think you would have to use people's flesh, meaning that the money can not be purely electronic. There has been a patch in the new kernel (2.6.38) that allows a better CPU ordonnancing between Xorg and tty apps.I can confirm that now I can watch a video without any problem even if I have "setgenerate true".Obviously, however, the rate hash is lower than before.   But it's just CPU mining anyway...
Ok I get it now. Why?  It's one time thing, isn'it?  Couldn't a human make the verification? Code:[quote author=Avlin link=topic=4032.msg66452#msg66452 date=1300312367]je n'échange qu'au taux actuel de l'euro et de plus c'est plus difficile d'en générer depuis une semaine.[/quote]Si tu changes d'avis tu peux m'envoyer tes coordonnées bancaires par email, en les signant et en les chiffrant.  Ma clef publique est [url=http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xAB5EF7EF50B80E68]ici Not much, it's just shorter.  Doesn't really matter anyway.  I think one could just put nothing in front of the base-64, since this data is not supposed to be automatically parsed anyway.

Instead of "gpg_identity=", what about some URI style format such as "GPG:"? Very far. Oops, I'm afraid you're right.  That was silly of me but I forgot that.I guess cooling electronic devices is indeed tricky in space. I think you could use the code I wrote in my thread about a full shell script implementation of bitcoin:Code:bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex() {local s=''while read -n 2 chardo s=$char$sdoneecho $s}bitcoinHash() {bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex |xxd -p -r |openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |xxd -p -c 80 |bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex}And then with the following data from the current block:ver=1prev_block=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000mrkl_root=4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33bbits=486604799(this is the genesis "data")You can create a next block by searching a nonce like this:Code:nonce=0while         time=$(date +%s)        printf "%08x%08x%08x%064s%064s%08x" $nonce $bits $time $mrkl_root $prev_block $ver |        bitcoinHash |        grep "some test I don't know exactly"do nonce=$(bc <<< "nonce + 1")doneof course a lot is missing, especially the network part. I'm not an engineer or anything, but I'm pretty sure it easy to cool an electronic device in space.  Sure, you don't have any environnmental fluid to carry heat away, but you have plenty of space that you can fill with zero-weight (considering zero gravity) metallic pans.  Maybe just behing solar panels.   Those metallic surfaces can radiate energy out. Sorry, I haven't read this whole thread but I've seen that some people managed to hash at around 280kH/s.  I know the N900 has some graphic capable hardware:  any chance this device could be used to hash? Well, if your account has been hacked, then you need to publish a message saying:"I used to be xxxx on eBay, but my account was hacked in 20xx." I think you can have your Paypal account verified using a VISA card bought on http://www.bitcoin2cc.com I'm guessing there is an hidden transaction behind, possibly for money laundring. Well, it's not easy, since you must avoid quotes and anything that look like HTML, but I've managed to put "I am grondilu on eBay" in my contact information section on http://myworld.ebay.com/grondilu.Carriage returns are skipped, too.PS.  I've filtered GnuPG's output through xxd -p.  I think it's enough. Not an entire public key, but the GnuPG fingerprint would be fine I guess.You can also qrencode it and show the image in your profile.PS.  This actually gave me the idea and I've just done exactly this for my avator on this forum PS#2:  you can also stenography your public key inside the photos of the items you're selling, although I suspect eBay is altering the pictures.PS#3.  Nah I changed my mind and removed the qrcode 'caus it's ugly. Well, bitcoin is not in this list, is it? You might have a look at davout's website code, if you like ruby.I have also been thinking about that for a few weeks now.  I'm working on yet-another implementation in bash.The problem with this kind of stuff is, as you pointed out, it's easy to make a simple implementation but much more complex if you want to make it optimal.I can't believe there is not more public documentation about these kinds of algorithms.
I don't know much about certificates, so correct me if I'm wrong, but:Basically with a self-signed certificate you just have to accept it the first time you connect to the website, and then, if later I'm being warned that the certificate is not the same anymore, then I can suspect there has been something smelly, and ask around about it.To me that sounds pretty much as good as relying on a third party "certificate authority". True.  Bitcoin has shown that a currency can be decentralised.  This is big news. I think the photo of Anna and the Yap stone is just fine.  It has some surprise effect and has the merit of getting out of tech context. Also, always check out biddingpond, for I often sell gold coins there.I'll sell an other one soon. Pri tio ni jam priparolis, genjix:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2099.0 I think you are overestimate them a bit.1)  Bitcoin's mainstream acceptance is not that important.  An idea would be quite useless if it has to convince every single person in the world in order to be efficient.  I don't want to rely on other people's smartness and awareness, because it would be hopeless.  So I say I don't care if government is using propanganda to discredite bitcoins, just as it chose to promote Keynes's idea about gold being the "barbarous relic".2)  If government is capable of taxing bitcoin, then bitcoin is not that great anyway, and we'll have to think about something else.3)  This is a serious threat but there's notrhing we can do apart from trying to improve the software.4)  They can try, just as they tried with gold, by holding huge quantities of it.  But to do so they'll have to buy some in the first place, which would increase the price of bitcoin and thus draw attentionto the public.  I'm not sure it would be a good strategy for them. I very much doubt Szabo is Satoshi, but I've enjoyed reading his blog article "Some speculations on the frontier below our feet".  Quite fascinating, sometimes people dream about exploring out of space, and yet there are some quite interesting discoveries to make right here on Earth. I am not convinced about that, but I kind of suspect it too.I'm not sure nuclear power really worthed the risks it contains. Normaly people who are Ok to publish this info can do it in their profile.  I'm 32, soon 33.Also, instead of the age you should have asked about the birth year imo. What is spesmilo?  At some point I thought it was the esperantist version of bitcoin, but this word doesn't seem to mean anything in esperanto. Any seller can require any currency for paiement.  There is really no reason why it should be the same.If you don't have the currency the merchand is requiring, then you just go somewhere else. Hang on, I think I finally understand.Saying that dollar is "legal tender" basically means that law can enforce debts only if they are expressed in dollars.Is that it? I don't get it.I mean: if I'm in debt to you, unless this debt was explicetely measured in dollars, it doesn't make sense that you are forced to accept dollars to repay the debt.Say I owe you a chocolate cake.   I don't have a chocolate cake to give you right now, but I have 2 dollars.  So I give you the two dollars and tell you:<< Sorry dude I don't have any chocolate cake to give you back, but I have those two dollars and according to Federal law you must accept them to clear my debt.  So take them and go away please. >>Sounds silly to me.Of course if the debt was expressed in dollars, then the problem doesn't exist, but then saying that the dollar is "legal tender" is a bit of a tautology, isn't it? That's not exactly a bank, rather a data storage provider.  Maybe an Internet/VPN provider.Well that's an insurance business.  Still not exactly banks. I think Kiba meant that the market could have followed the same path than government.  Of course the market would keep good ideas invented by regulators.And I agree about one thing:  sometimes government does good things.  One can not be always wrong about everything. Diaspora is supposed to be open-source.  So if they don't use bitcoin, we will. Ok, that makes sense. Bitcoin makes banks useless.PS.  I've just written this and people might think it's rethoric, but it's not.  Banks are really useless now, thanks to bitcoin.  When you think about it, it's pretty huge.  Banks have existed for centuries (since the renaissance I think).  And now, suddenly, their business model is about to vanish. Let's assume it's a good idea.How exactly is this supposed to work?Ok, so I have an email address that I publish while saying: "if you want to send me a message to this address, it will cost you 0.01 BTC.  I won't read any message from people who will not have paid."How exactly is someone supposed to prove that he has actually paid for the message he has sent?? I know I could check in Wikipedia or something, but I'd like to have your view on this first.I suspect it doesn't actually mean much.
Agreed.  It should not be too flashy nor too advocating.PS.  I don't like the "virtual" adjective in the subtitle "P2P virtual currency".  I"d prefer "P2P digital currency" The protocol could be more permissive about what kind of key could be used.  Basically it could accept not just elliptic curves, but any openssl supported key. And here we go...   That had to happen. Well, maybe the boundary between an application and a part of an operating system is not clear, but at least the GNU project has the ambition of being an OS, since it compares itself to UNIX.Also, there is no program included in linux.  Linux is a program. But not just "linux" either.  Same as we don't call Mac OS X "Darwin".  Linux is just a kernel.You can run a system without Firefox, KDE or Xorg.  But on most systems at least a few GNU apps (at minima a shell) is required around linux.GNU is the acronym for "Gnu is Not Unix".  This means that GNU is designed to provide an OS comparable to Unix, without being exactly Unix.  Therefore its name should appear in the OS name, imo.Firefox or Xorg are not designed to be an operating system.  They are just applications. Please change the "Linux" entry into "GNU/Linux". None of this is bitcoin-specific. As soon as you start buying, unless you find a immediate sell order matching your 500,000$ bid, you will empty the ask part of the order book and then raise the price.I have no idea about how much it would cost to buy 500,000 bitcoins.  I guess it depends on how you proceed, and which time frame you target, but it would certainly cost much more than 500,000$. I very much doubt so.  It might cost you 500$ to own about 0.01% of the total amount of bitcoins, but not 1,000 times more to own 10%.  It is NOT proportionnal.PS.  Anyway what you say can be said about money itself, or even the very concept of "wealth".  It's not just bitcoin.   Some people think money is unfair at best, evil at worst.  I don't, but we all understand your concerns.  Nothing new here, people think that about money since the beginning of time. wb3, manipulating a market as you describe it is probably much more difficult than you think.   Moreover, there is nothing wrong with it, ethically speaking.  If someone has managed to own more than one million bitcoins, somehow he has done something to deserve them.  It is his property and he does whatever he wants with it.You believe in private property or you don't.  Don't try to compromise. +1I have nothing against regulations, as long as there are several sets of them, and you can chose which one seems to you to be the most fair.Otherwise it is just like saying that Poker is the only allowed card game, that other games such as  black jack, bridge etc. are forbidden. I'm sorry I don't share your enthusiasm guys, but I'll wait until I see the video... Anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism doesn't magically prevent human beings from making mistakes or being unwise.  The point is just that no-one has the right to prevent people from acting according to their freedom just because of that.In your example of sex between a boy and an girl:  what do you want to do?  Prevent them from seeing each other and have sex?  Punish them very hardly if they do?  Who the f.ck do you think you are to mess with other people's business and private life?  Oh please... again? Songez à utiliser #bitcoin-otc sur freenode pour laisser vos évaluations Personnaly I'll stick with my view of money as an accounting tool:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2866.0 a. Less than 1 % b. Less than 5 % c. Less than 10 %d. Less than 15%e. More than 15%Personnaly I'd add:f.  Who cares?  Mines are not lost  There IS obviously a strong incentive for hoarders to sell at some point:  profit.I mean, say someone owns 100,000 bitcoins, as many very early adopters probably do.  Didn't such a person have a huge incentive to sell while bitcoin reached parity?Personnaly I own a few thousand bitcoins.  If bitcoin was to worth 10 euros per bitcoin, let me tell you that I'd sell some of them!Of course I won't hoard the euros I bought, but I'd buy a few stuffs with them. Well, I may be a bit biaised, since I'm a bash freak.
I'll add that there are two manual pages that I think are really really worth reading.  One of them is bash's man page, the other one is screen's. Just tried.  Indeed, closing the terminal doesn't kill the screen session. Debian GNU/linux, unstable branch, aka Sid, more precisely the derived distribution called "aptosid" (www.aptosid.com) I doubt so.  If you close your terminal without detaching screen, the screen session will be killed for sure.  You MUST detach before closing your terminal. Just detach your session with "Ctrl-A D".  You can then logout, and reattach later with "screen -r" already mentionned. There is, indeed, a LOT more to know about screen, but that's a good crash course.  I'd like to mention the copy/scrollback mode, which is not so known and yet extremely usefull. screen is a little bit hard to grasp at first, but it totally worths it.  I couldn't live without it now, and I know that a lot of people feel the same. Also, if you want to really enjoy framebuffer linux console, you might need to install fbterm (very easy to use), and learn GNU screen (you won't be able to do much without it). w3m Personnaly I don't even use X when I hang around this forum: Je ne partage pas ce point de vue.Il n'est pas si nécessaire de convaincre une part significative de la population d'utiliser les bitcoins.Comme souvent l'analogie avec l'or est ici instructive.  L'or, tout le monde sait que ça a de la valeur.  Mais qui en possède réellement?  Qui est prêt à en acheter?  Je serais surpris si la proportion dépassait le pourcentage de la population mondiale.  Pourtant, l'or est d'une utilité incontestable en tant que monnaie.  Quelqu'un qui possède de l'or peut aisément le vendre et acheter des trucs avec l'argent obtenu.  Pour moi bitcoin n'a pas d'autres objectifs à atteindre que celui-là. C'est une monnaie.  Tu peux faire tout ce qu'on fait avec une monnaie.  Essentiellement acheter des trucs.  Évidemment c'est une jeune monnaie donc le pouvoir d'achat des bitcoins est limité par la quantité d'utilisateurs acceptant cette monnaie.  Et quand je parle des utilisateurs, je ne parle pas nécessairement des gens qui vendent le truc que tu veux acheter, je parle surtout de ceux qui sont prêts à échanger leur monnaie nationale contre des bitcoins.  Ces utilisateurs là permettent d'assurer la passerelle entre les bitcoins et les commerces qui, pour l'écrasante majorité, n'acceptent que les monnaies nationales.Si tu fais partie des gens qui épargnent en cash, alors tu as intérêt à acheter des bitcoins contre tes euros car les euros sont inflatés et pas les bitcoins.Pas vraiment.   Tu augmentes surtout l'efficacité de l'économie bitcoin.  Donc oui si tu veux tu peux dire que tu augmente la valeur des bitcoins.  Mais c'est une façon un peu trompeuse de voir les choses amha.Une monnaie est un outil comptable.  Tu peux en faire ce que les gens acceptent de faire avec, ni plus ni moins.Tout comme un stylo et du papier n'a aucune utilité pour des gens qui ne savent ni lire ni écrire, bitcoin n'a aucune utilité pour ceux qui n'acceptent pas cette monnaie. On second thought, I don't like this, especially if you try to use these notes in real shops.I think it's ok it you give the note for free, for instance for charity.  But trying to force it into circulation is a bit too an aggressive advertisment method imo. Is it really?  To me if the community is large enough to provide liquidity of exchange to most other currencies, then I think it good enough.I'm pretty sure that if 1% of World population was made of bitcoin enthusiasts, then the currency would be much efficient enough for pretty much anything we might expect from it. And the winner is... : It's really a fair question, and honnestly as far as I'm concerned I have no definitive answer to it.   How many other cryptocurrencies will there be?  I don't know.  Will miners start an other block chain when bitcoin reaches the 210,000nd block?  I don't know either.  If so, would that hurt bitcoin's monetary value?  I doubt so but I'm not sure.Only time will tell. Who on Earth has been silly enough to suggest that?A bitcoin is a bitcoin, it's 21 000 times less than the total amount of the quantity that the sofware called bitcoin deals with.I confess however that we miss a name for the "thing" that bitcoin measures.  "second" is a unit of time, "meter" is a unit of length, Octet is a unit of information data.   So, what "bitcoin" is the unit of?I guess it's the unit of "Satoshi Nakamoto's crytocurrency". Ah j'ai complètement oublié de modifier ma signature suite à mon changement d'hébergeur.  Sur freeshell.org j'avais toujours cette erreur 500 qui s'affichait parfois sans que je sache pourquoi.Alors j'ai déplacé mon site, pour l'instant chez barwen.ch. Let's assume they do.  Let's assume all the factory belongs to workers.What happens if, for some reason, one of the workers wants to sell his share?  He may need some money in short term, he may just not be interested in taking part of the organisation of the factory.  For whatever reason, he has the right to sell his part of the factory, even to someone who doesn't work in this factory.  It's his concern.What I mean is that giving a factory to workers would not change the system, it would just consist in stealing present owners to give to others. Ask Zimbabwean people if there are happy with huge numbers on their bills.
Tu peux forker mon site "eurobitcoin".  C'est un script CGI dont les sources sont publiques. I prefer wait until my current buyer receives the coin.  It can be a week or so. Well, it's not as if I hadn't let you guys a lot of time.  I guess it's the reward for people bidding early.I'll sell an other one once this one has been received by the buyer.  You'll get an other chance  Today I hurt my back and I kind of fear that it will never be the same.This makes me realize how important health is, and how mortal we all are.Take care of your body and enjoy life guys. Only a few hours left. Pour info des soucis de santé me forcent à annuler l'échange de dimanche.  Avlin est au courant et je lui ais remboursé les 150 btc.J'annule parce que je ne sais pas trop si j'arriverai à marcher correctement demain et parce que je vais avoir besoin de cash pour payer les frais médicaux.Je ne pense pas être incommodé très longtemps donc je pense que pour le mois prochain je pourrai proposer un autre échange.D'ici là j'aurai aussi peut-être mis au point ma plateforme de trading  Four version numbers?? Moi plus j'y pense et plus je me dis que le seul service réellement indispensable, c'est le change de devises.Il n'y a à mon avis aucune chance que bitcoin soit adopté par le grand public et par les entreprises avant longtemps.  Peut-être même jamais, car une comptabilité en bitcoins est trop facile à masquer ou à protéger du fisc.  Les entreprises doivent rendre des comptes à l'Etat et donc je doute que l'état les laisse utiliser une telle monnaie.Mais en réalité cela n'a que peu d'importance.  L'essentiel est qu'il soit facile de convertir ses bitcoins en devise nationale.  Une telle convertibilité peut être assuré par un marché des changes performant, et dès lors qu'une telle convertibilité existe, alors on peut entrer dans n'importe quel magasin et acheter ce qu'on veut avec des bitcoins.Ca peut paraître artificiel mais finalement cela ne l'est pas tant que ça.   Mais ça mérite plus de justifications.  J'écrirai plus sur ce sujet ultérieurement.En tout cas moi pour l'instant je me concentre sur l'écriture de mon projet de plateforme de change opensource. +1Unfortunately it seems that davout has kind of got lost interest in his website.  He is very little responsive. Indeed.  I thought I had tried that but I guess I did it wrong.Thanks. Here is the Merkle tree for block 95002, which had three transactions:Code:"mrkl_tree":["4fa598026d9be1ca0c2bff1b531e566b7ea7f90b72e75fda0c1795bc2dfa375c","186640daf908156e2616790d7c816235b0c43f668c3c38351b348c08ca44d457","ef3928700309b4deceac9a992a19a7481b4e520cbc0b1ab74e2645eee39c8da0","688c53517f62f7a65c0e87519c18a4de98f2ccafbf389b269d0bb867f88d166a","01889506f7fe9210045f588361881e2d16a034a62bc48ebd7b6b0a3edeaf5a6d","74f3a7df861d6a58957b84a3e425a8cf57e1e2e3a3def046dd200baeb8714f00"]I rewrote the two bash functions:Code:bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex() {    local s=''    while read -n 2 char        do s=$char$s    done    echo $s}bitcoinHash() {    bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex |    xxd -p -r |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    xxd -p -c 80 |    bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex}The fourth entry of the Merkle tree is easy to reconstitute.  It's obviously made out of the first two.bitcoinHash <<<"186640daf908156e2616790d7c816235b0c43f668c3c38351b348c08ca44d4574fa598026d9be1ca0c2bff1b531e566b7ea7f90b72e75fda0c1795bc2dfa375c"But then, I don't know how to get the fith out of the third. That's why I'm talking about them trying to find "excuses".They obviously can't reject bitcoin by saying:  "oh no we didn't promote this currency because it was a threat to our world domination scheme."So they'll just say: "we didn't know it existed". Ok je confirme réception des 150 BTC.Je choisirai l'endroit et je te le communiquerai par PM.Ceux qui veulent organiser une rencontre plus conviviale peuvent le faire bien sûr mais ça n'a pas à être liés aux transactions réelles. At some point the guys from governments and financial institutions will defend themselves from not having brought up bitcoin to the public, nor to have used such a technology in the financial system.They will say something like:  "We just didn't know this currency existed, so we tried our best with what we had at this moment."But isn't it part of their job to get informed about new tehcnological developpments in their activity?  How hard is it to check out Wikipedia about digital money and to follow a link about a decentralised currency?Those people are supposed to be smart and to know a lot of stuffs.   That why they get so much money, whether it comes from tax payer or B. Bernanke's helicopter.  If they didn't know about bitcoin, they have absolutely no excuse.PS:They could have come up with a fair decentralised monetary system.  Truth is:  they didn't even try. She's quite cute as well:  it's nice to see that bitcoin doesn't get some interest only from ugly geek dudes like myself. Ok je te PM une adresse bitcoin.  Tu peux payer maintenant ou dimanche une fois sur place.C'est comme tu veux, mais plus tu paies tôt plus tu évites le risque que quelqu'un surenchérisse.  Car si quelqu'un propose plus de 150 btc avant dimanche, c'est à lui que reviendront les 100 euros. The same stuff but a bit smaller and smoother:PS.  I think it worths adding a bitcoin address in case someone would like to donate to reward this work:15qwmFseu1r4K4ZByWiN5JB2xSLXXCMPfrPS#2.  I suck at licensing stuffs but I'd like to allow people to use it without too many restrictions.I guess all I have to do is to say that I've made this with blender, ImageMagick, Gimp and the bitcoin logo we can see on Wikipedia.I publish this under the terms of the Attribution 3.0 Unported creative commons license.I hope it's fine. Je t'offre 100 euros pour tes 150 bitcoins, soit un cours de 0.6667 btc/eur.Si quelqu'un peut et veut céder plus de bitcoins pour ces mêmes 100 euros, qu'il se manifeste. Sure, but I kind of hope that there is a way to describe how bitcoin works without being too technical.  Maybe not technical at all.I was thinking of describing bitcoin by replacing computers by a book.As I see it, we woudl say that all the accounts are numbers written in a public large accounting book.  Everyone can read it at any time.  The only thing is that it is not easy to write in it.  And it's a good thing: if we could all write in the book in the same time, it would be a mess.  So we need a way to make it difficult.  So there is some kind of a magic pen (a cryptographic pen).  To obtain the pen, you must solve a difficult mathematic problem.  And you can only write something that makes sense, otherwise people will immediately see the fraud and ignore what you wrote.I say this because if we just say what bitcoin is without trying to explain how it works, people will just don't believe it.  I mean: sure, people would be glad to have a decentralised, taxation free money and stuffs.   But  without any explanation about how it is possible, they'll obviously be suspicious.  I would if I hadn't read Satoshi's paper. What is your script?  I mean: do you try to explain how bitcoin works (double spending, hashes, blocks...), or do you just describe what bitcoin is (bitcoin address, currency/vs paiement method, P2P)?
I gave up trying to understand him long time ago. Finally I made it 160x160.For some reason I can't manage to prevent the frames from stacking up.PS.  Ok I get it but I have to regenerate.  Wait a sec...PS#2.  Ok, here it is:Pretty neat, isn't it?  Here is the blender file, for those who are interested:http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/bitcoin-flag.blend different version of openssl I guess.$ openssl versionOpenSSL 1.0.0c 2 Dec 2010 Sure, let me try.  I'll remove the sky and I'll set dimensions to 160x90I'm not very happy with the lightning either (too many shadows).  I'll try something else.

They are not.  There is a bootstrapping stage which can take about a minute, but after that it's ok.Also, one advantage of TOR is that it is extremely easy to install.  Basically one "apt-get install tor" on debian. Well, one thing about a bitcoin exchange plateform is that you can easily get your bitcoins back, right?Right now I'm in the process of funding my MtGox account for the first time.  Hopefully I'll be able to get my bitcoins as soon as I buy them right?  However, I remember having heard about a 45 days delay.  Does it still exist?  I hope not.  Moreover, if I recall correctly, this delay was due to paypal reversal possibility, and I founded my account with a bank wire.  So I guess there is no reason why there should be a delay for me. http://premier-samedi.org/Je me demande si ça ne peut pas être une occasion d'organiser des échanges de bitcoins contre cash.Personnellement pour ce mois-ci je suis acheteur de bitcoins pour 100 euros.  Faites moi une offre pour cette somme, je vendrai au plus offrant.PS.   Nan à la réflexion c'est pas une bonne idée de faire ça à la cité des sciences pendant cette install-party.  Ce n'est pas un endroit approprié pour faire du traffic de bitcoins.Ma proposition reste cependant valable pour le dimanche 6 mars, dans un parc à Paris. D'ailleurs, la loterie est une bonne analogie.  En gros c'est comme ça que fonctionne bitcoin.  Chaque block est un ticket de loterie.  Le but du jeu est de trouver le numéro (le nonce) qui permet de créer le block suivant. C'est pas un gaspillage puisque ça permet de remplir une fonction (décentraliser et anonymiser un réseau).  Et franchement y'a pire en termes de consommation d'énergie.Par ailleurs encore une fois, c'est pas pire que le chauffage électrique. Bon je vais faire l'effort quand même.Tu ne peux pas avoir un système à la fois décentralisé et anonyme, sans faire intervenir à un moment ou un autre ta puissance de calcul.Imagine que tu dises:  "on va donner un bitcoin à chaque nouvel entrant sur le réseau, et on diminuera progressivement cette valeur afin qu'au final le nombre total soit constant".Bon, ben si le système est anonyme, rien n'empêche un nouvel entrant de se faire passer pour un nouveau plusieurs fois, et ainsi de s'attribuer autant de bitcoins possibles.  Un peu comme avec le "bitcoin faucet".Dans cette optique, tous les "tricheurs" vont s'affronter les uns les autres.  En gros celui qui arrivera à créer le plus de fausses nouvelles connexions à la seconde s'attribuera le plus de bitcoin.  Et cette capacité sera forcément liée à la puissance CPU.C'est presque un théorème, qui reste à démontrer mais qui est assez intuitif quand on y réfléchit amha:  "la distribution initiale de toute monnaie électronique décentralisée et anonyme doit être basée sur la puissance CPU des participants." Le thème du prétendu gaspillage des ressources est un thème maintes fois abordé et personnellement j'en ai un peu marre d'expliquer toujours les mêmes choses.  Effectivement ça devrait être dans la FAQ.Dans l'absolu celui qui génère le bloc c'est le processus qui fait tourner le logiciel bitcoin.Que ce soit un ordinateur ou une ferme de calcul importe peu.  In fine les bitcoins générés appartiennent à celui qui a le privilège d'accès en lecture au fichier wallet associé. 1.  Aux personnes qui génèrent les blocks.  Ces frais obéissent à une loi de l'offre et de la demande.  Vous pouvez choisir une limite sur les frais que vous êtes disposés à payer.  Votre transaction ne sera alors traitée que par les générateurs de blocks compatible.  Par conséquent, le fait d'accepter des frais permet d'accélérer le traitement d'une transaction.  Notez qu'à l'heure actuelle, les frais sont globalement nuls.  Ils ne seront la rémunération principale de générateurs que dans quelques dizaines d'années.2.  Lorsque tous les bitcoins auront été créés, on ne cessera pas la création de blocs pour autant.  Les blocs ne sont pas générés pour créer des bitcoins.  Ils le sont pour éviter le double paiement.  Il est possible que la difficulté, et donc la puissance de calcul, diminue avec le temps, mais à vrai dire personne n'en est certain.  Cela dépend beaucoup plus de considérations économiques et psychologiques que techniques.3.  La création de blocs est ce qui permet la décentralisation du système.  Elle n'est donc pas inutile et n'est donc pas à proprement parler un gaspillage.    Elle n'est, quoi qu'il en soit, pas plus un gaspillage énergétique que ne peut l'être le chauffage électrique, du moins en hiver hors des zones tropicales.4.  Les bénéfices sont équitables dans le sens où rien n'empêche personne de se mettre à générer des blocs.  Et il n'y a rien d'anormal à ce que ceux qui mettent plus de moyens pour le faire obtiennent de meilleurs résultats.  Tout comme une mine d'or qui possède plus de moyens techniques extraiera plus d'or.  Par ailleurs, il y a par définition une limite intrinsèque à la quantité de bitcoins que pourront produire les générateurs de blocs.   Quant aux frais de transferts, ils obéissent à la loi du marché, et vous n'êtes donc pas obligés de les payer (il existera probablement toujours quelques mineurs qui accepteront de miner gratuitement) si vous accepter d'attendre un peu plus longtemps pour vos transactions.5.  Il n'existe aucun moyen de faire face à la perte de bitcoins.  Tout comme on ne peut pas empêcher quelqu'un de jeter de l'or dans la mer.  Par ailleurs, si vraiment un jour la quantité de bitcoins devait diminuer au point de rendre la monnaie inutilisable, alors une nouvelle chaine serait créée par ceux qui le désirent. I agree about the scripting part.  To me this is kind of huge mystery. Still, I wouldn't feel comfortable trying.  Especially since it is written "electronic use only" on the card.  I wonder why by the way, since the User Agreement document clearly states that the card could be used in an ATM and shops.   I'll try, but only if I have some cash aside in case it doesn't work. And the nonce was beginning with 111 Well, I would not try it on a healthy wallet though.   But I'll keep it in mind just in case...
It does indeed!   But you have to get rid of the annoying 'std(...)= ':I didn't know that there were actually 2 sha256 passes, just like for the hash of the block itself.Code:{ bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex <<<"$a" | xxd -p -r ;   bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex <<<"$b" | xxd -p -r ; }  |   openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |   openssl dgst -sha256 -hex |   sed 's/.* //' |   bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex(also, you can use '|' at the end of line without using '\')Now how to deal with blocks with a number of transactions that are not a power of 2? Ok, what about that then?Code:# get balancebalance=$(bitcoind getbalance)# stop bitcoinbitcoind stop# rename corrupted walletmv .bitcoin/wallet.dat{,-CORRUPTED}# restart bitcoin (thus creating a new wallet)bitcoind# generate a new addressaddr=$(bitcoind getnewaddress)# stop bitcoinbitcoind stop# backup new walletmv .bitcoin/wallet.dat{,-BRANDNEW}# put the corrupted wallet backmv .bitcoin/wallet.dat{-CORRUPTED,}# start bitcoinbitcoind# send all bitcoins to addrbitcoind sendtoaddress $addr $balance I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter, since xxd -p -r does only read hexadecimal characters.echo "A 1" |xxd -p -r |xxd -p a1echo -n "A 1" |xxd -p -r |xxd -p a1 Interesting situation.  Would it be fine to just run something like:bitcoind sendtoaddress $(bitcoind getnewaddress) $(bitcoind getbalance)which means:  create a new address, and send all my bitcoins to it? Ok now, let's try to make the Merkle tree.The first block with more than one transaction is the block 170.  It has two transactions and its Merkle tree is:{"b1fea52486ce0c62bb442b530a3f0132b826c74e473d1f2c220bfa78111c5082","f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16","7dac2c5666815c17a3b36427de37bb9d2e2c5ccec3f8633eb91a4205cb4c10ff"}The third is the Merkle root.My first attempt is this code:Code:{ bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex <<<"$a" |xxd -p -r ; bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex <<<"$b" |xxd -p -r ; } |openssl dgst -sha256 -hexNeedless to say, the version without bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex didn't work either. I was looking at the "old" bitcoins:  those of blocks 0, 1, 2....I can't find any of them which has been redeemed.So here are a simple question:what is the oldest non-generation transaction?PS.  Ok, found it using a small script:  http://blockexplorer.com/b/170This means that Satoshi has been running his computer during 17 hours before he tried to make a transaction.  I guess he was testing the difficulty adjustment. Gold is getting closer to its record high guys!I suck at maths, but I'm pretty sure that 205 BTC is not a very high bid! Nice effort.However, I'd like to tell you something.Today on IRC I was almost insulted for trying to promote bitcoin.  And you know what?  Screw them!I mean, if people are not capable of understanding what a good money is, then I don't want to spend my time trying to convince them.  Nor do I want to withstand insults.I learned about bitcoin because I was interested in monetary problems that exist nowadays.  I was looking for something like bitcoin and I found out about it on wikipedia (it was the a just link: the article itself was on a user space at that time).  Nobody came to me saying:  "hey look at that!"So from now on, I won't try to "evangelize" about bitcoin any more.  I'll let people use their stupid beloved paper money if that's what they want. Agreed.  A big advantage on small coins is that they are much more liquid than big ones. Maybe this one is worth to be added in the wiki:http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/44718/htg-explains-what-is-bitcoin/ Yes I will!  But right now I prefer experiment both biddingpond and the bitcoin community purchase power with small coins. Basically it's the ancester of the blog.   It's what people used to make in order to publish opinions and news before the web exists.They basically printed it on paper and sold it in the street.  Many magazines have gained a huge popularity and are still sold despite their obsolescence. Yes, I'm talking to you guys!You probably have a huge amount of bitcoins, and that must feel good, I guess.Maybe you convert it into cash, maybe you just hoard your bitcoins until you can buy really great stuffs with them.  I don't know and that is none of my business.But wouldn't it be nice to diversify a bit and put some of your bitcoins into an other non-inflating currency?  Wouldn't you like to put some of wealth in a nice, classic gold coin?You can do so, and it can even be fun, since you will be taking part in an on-line auction (believe me: auctions can be fun).So here you go:  http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=312happy bidding! Another poll about bitcoin's notoriety. Agreed. I like this idea of bitcoin being a monetary black swan.  I think it could make a nice symbol for bitcoin.  Anyone would like to design a corresponding logo? Very nice broadcast.  Very pro.  Questions asked were very little technical, and yet quite pertinent. yep, I've edited (we actually don't need tr either, by the way).I also tested on the second block.  I worked fine. I don't know what *would* happen.  I don't pretend to know and I don't care.  Moreover, I don't believe in central economic planification anyway.I don't think prices would fall until the end of times, though.  At some point, an equilibrium should appear.  And if it doesn't:  be it!Pro-inflation economists say that a bit of inflation is good because it prevents people from hoarding, and it makes them spend in shops before their money lose its value.I have an other great tool to make people spend their money.  I think in english it's called the "whip".Basically all you have to do is to hire cops to whip people if they refuse to enter shops and to buy stuffs.  Isn't that a great idea?What about slavery?  I think slavery was pretty good for the economy.  It provided stable wages (zero is pretty much a constant number), so it was good for the companies which then could make predictable economic decisions.  So I guess whipping customers and enslaving workers would be a nice way to ensure economic stability and prosperity. Thanks, that helped!Code:#{#  "hash":"000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f",#  "ver":1,#  "prev_block":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",#  "mrkl_root":"4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b",#  "time":1231006505,#  "bits":486604799,#  "nonce":2083236893,bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex() {    local s=''    while read -n 2 char    do s=$char$s    done    echo $s}ver=1prev_block=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000mrkl_root=4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33btime=1231006505bits=486604799nonce=2083236893printf "%08x%08x%08x%064s%064s%08x" $nonce $bits $time $mrkl_root $prev_block $ver |bigEndianHex2littleEndianHex |xxd -r -p | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |openssl dgst -sha256 -hex |sed 's/^.* //' |bigEndianHex2littleEndianHexI can't really give the bounty since the solution was not complete.  But thanks again.

I was joking of course. Nice try  /proc/cpuinfo  is probably your best source of information about your processor. As I see it, there will be nothing like this whatsoever.  It will be much more "wild", for everything will be reputation based. I haven't tried to withdraw cash from an ATM, for I doubt it will work without a PIN.  As of using it as a credit card in a shop, I don't know either, but I'll try.No, I can see the registration form and I could fill it, but it doesn't fit to enter a foreign address (it only ask me for a US state, for instance), and I don't want to enter fake infos. Less than a week left! Indeed it's rather structured like:(amount, amount, amount, ....)By the way, on second thought I wonder why I said that amounts should be integers.  Floating point values are necessary I guess.  But anyway one of the thing that bitcoin inspired me is that floating point values are nothing but very big integers.But for the theoretical study it might be easier to consider real values. Why do you say this?  It all depends of the relative value of the assets.  I could have replaced 40 by 0.001 if asset 1 was extremely valuable compared to other assets. I'm going to write the problem in an even more generic way.An order will be a list of signed integers:(-40, 0, 6, 12, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)This example shows an order that says that the issuer is ready to give 40 units of asset 1 if this can give him 6 units of asset 3, 12 units of asset 4 and 1 unit of asset 7.The order book is a list of such lists.The requested algorithm should return a list of cycled orders lists.I suspect it is possible to solve the problem elegantly with a recursive function. I disagree.   A price emerge when one particular asset acquires a currency status.In a situation where almost all assets are currencies themselves, then the barter model makes sense. I want to implement a generic barter plateform, but the algorithm is a bit tricky to write. Here is the idea: we have a bunch of exchange orders between assets called asset1, asset2, etc.An order looks like that:#n  -q1 assetA q2 assetB#n is the reference of the orderq1 is the quantity of assetA that is givenq2 is the quantity of assetB that is desired in exchange for assetAI've made a simple bash function that generates random orders:Code:randtrades() {    for a in asset{1..10}    do for b in asset{1..10}    do        if [[ "$a" != "$b" ]]        then echo -$((RANDOM%10)) $a $((RANDOM%10)) $b        fi    done    done |    grep -v -e '^-0' -e ' 0' |    sort -r |    cat -n |    sed -r 's/^\s+/#/'}The goal is to create a function that takes the output of randtrades as input, and returns list of possible trade cycles:exemples:#1 -2 assetA 4 assetB#2 -1 assetB 2 assetC#3 -4 assetB 1 assetAreturns:#1 #3because obviously orders #1 and #3 match one another (they make a 2-lenghted cycle).An other exemple:#1 -2 assetA 4 assetB#2 -1 assetB 5 assetD#3 -2 assetC 1 assetA#4 -5 assetB 2 assetCreturns:#1 #3 #4because #1 gives the required asset to #3 which gives the required asset to #4 which finally gives the required asset back to #1.  They make a 3-lenghted cycle.  Hope it's clear.Don't worry too much about quantities.  The only important thing is that an order is capable of giving at least what is required.Of course if there are muliple possibilities, all of them should be displayed, one per line. As it should be in any commercial relationship.http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=credit I actived the card so I'm pretty sure I could use it at least on theweb.   However, the registration process is necessary to get a PINnumber and to use the physical card on an ATM for instance.I'd like to register but it seems that only US citizens can.Any solution for foreign users? I'm not a huge fan of credit either, and yet I don't see any reason why it should be prohibited.  Moreover, there is no chance a credit based money can be confused with bitcoin.You don't like credit?  Fine, just don't buy nor sell any of it. Ok I understand now, and I totally support your project.  It is indeed a good idea to make bitcoin wallets easy to backup, even for retarded people. For the "average Joe" a script is not different from any other executable program.I really don't see your point, unless what you're talking about is a nice icon on a desktop where to click to.  This is very much OS-dependant, and it's really just a marketting/ergonomics issue imo.
Indeed I misunderstood.  I still don't see your point, though.   What do you want exactly that can not be written in a three lines script ?You encrypt with gpg, and you send with scp.  Several scripts have been published on the forum and on the wiki.  Check them out. Basically to make cloud backups, all you need is cloud data storage.Trusting someone to store your passphrase defeats the very purpose of strong encryption.So yes, cloud backups is great, as long as I stay in charge of encryption. Have you seen this video?  (a musical satyr to government plans)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO2eh6f5Go0 That works.  Pretty cool.  Thanks. Oui probablement.Mais quand j'y pense je me dis que l'essentiel est peut-être de se concentrer sur les moyens de convertir des bitcoins en monnaie nationale.L'idéal serait que la communauté bitcoin réunisse le capital nécessaire pour créer sa propre banque.  On aurait alors les autorisations requises pour utiliser directement les cartes de paiement.Tant qu'on pourra pas faire ça, ce sera toujours de la bidouille. Well, my first impression is good.  For instance you have a decent installation of vim, and Ubuntu is much up-to-date than Lenny.It seems like a good service for this price.I don't understand exactly how to run cgi.  I've created a cgi-bin directory in my $HOME, and I wrote a small test.cgi, chmod +x it, but which is the url exactly?I've tried http://s0.barwen.ch/~grondilu/cgi-bin/test.cgi but it doesn't work. Ok I want to give this a try.  I've just signed in and mailed you my SSH public key.  Ok, then here is the client code:Code:#!/bin/bash# server address (todo:  add an option to set it on command line)server=127.0.0.1/stockmarket-server.cgi# private key# you can generate one with:  openssl genrsa -out rsa-test 2048# public key can be obtained with:  openssl rsa -pubout -in rsa-testprivkey="rsa-test"# message is given on command linemessage="$@"# Message authentication code is a random number appended to unix EPOCmac=$(bc <<<"$(date +%s)+$RANDOM")# base64 JSON datadata="$(base64 -w 0 <<<"{ \"message\": \"$message\", \"mac\": $mac }")"# base64 whirlpool signaturesignature="$(openssl dgst -whirlpool -sign $privkey <<< "$data" |base64 -w 0)"# sending via POST methodwget -q -O - --post-data "data=\"$data\" signature=\"$signature\" pubkey=\"$(openssl rsa -pubout -in $privkey)\"" http://$serverAnd here is the code for the server (a CGI script):Code:#!/bin/bashecho "Content-type:     text/plain"echoecho stock market exchange serverechoif [[ "$REQUEST_METHOD" = "POST" ]] && [[ "$CONTENT_LENGTH" -gt 0 ]]then    read -N $CONTENT_LENGTH POST_DATA <&0    # todo:  retrieve post data more securely than using "eval"    eval "$POST_DATA"    if openssl dgst -whirlpool -signature <(base64 -d <<<"$signature") -verify <(echo "$pubkey") <<<"$data" 2>&1    then        data="$(base64 -d <<<"$data")"        echo "$data"    else        echo wrong signature    fielse    echo no data receivedfiSeveral aspects of your specification for the server depend on the kind of database you want to use.  Would you consider using mongodb? I may have missed that.  Please give me a link.Do you offer web service with CGI? openssl doesn't do whirlpool for signed digest.hash options for dgst are:  [-md5|-md4|-md2|-sha1|-sha|-mdc2|-ripemd160|-dss1] The client part is very easy:Code:#!/bin/bash# server address (todo:  add an option to set it on command line)server=127.0.0.1# private key# you can generate one with:  openssl genrsa -out rsa-test 2048# public key can be obtained with:  openssl rsa -pubout -in rsa-testprivkey="rsa-test"# message is given on command linemessage="$@"# Message authentication code is a random number appended to unix EPOCmac=$(bc <<<"$(date +%s)+$RANDOM")data="$(base64 <<<"{ \"message\": \"$message\", \"mac\": $mac }")"signature="$(openssl rsautl -sign -inkey $privkey -in <(echo "$data") |base64)"wget -O - --post-data "data=$data&signature=$signature" http://$serverNotice that the signature process will fail if the message is too long.  In that case, a hash of the message should be used instead of the message itself.  We might then consider using dgst instead of rsautl.I think the client should also send its public key, otherwise I don't know how the server can guess it  So basically, the last line should rather be:Code:wget -O - --post-data "data=$data&signature=$signature&pubkey=$(openssl rsa -pubout -in $privkey)" http://$server Personnally I stick with the bitcoin.org tarball install, but I guess that once you've installed the bitcoin-cli package, all you have to do is to run "bitcoind".What message do you get when you try that? Well, I might sell them a few bitcoins.  If the government is giving me 1kg of gold per BTC. I think it is wrong to call bitcoin a "private" currency.On the contrary, imo bitcoin is much more of a public currency that any national currency is. I keep thinking Satoshi Nakamoto is his real name. Well actually, no, I can't.  I'm not good at anything else indeed.I'm not a very good programmer and bash is the only language in which I manage to do usefull stuffs. I'd like to show off my own bash script:Code:#!/bin/bashname=grondilusftp_address=grondilu@somewhere.fremail=grondilu@nospam.frbluetoothaddr="00:XX:YY:ZZ:UU:TT"private="$HOME/Private"backup="wallet-$(date +%s).dat"error() {    echo $1 returned error code $2    rm -f $private/"$backup"{,.gpg}    exit $2}if    echo -n "making backup file..."    bitcoind backupwallet "$private/$backup"    r=$? ; ((r != 0))then error bitcoind $relif    echo ok    cd $private    echo -n "encrypting..."    gpg -e -r $name "$backup"     r=$? ; ((r != 0))then error gpg $relif    echo ok    rm "$backup"    echo -n "copying to distant server..."    scp "$backup.gpg" $sftp_address:    r=$? ; ((r != 0))then error scp $relif    echo ok    echo -n "adding to distant archive..."    ssh $sftp_address <<< "tar rf wallet-backup.tar $backup.gpg && rm $backup.gpg"    r=$? ; ((r != 0))then error ssh $relif    echo ok    echo -n "copying to smartphone..."    obexftp -b "$bluetoothaddr" -c /Data/backups -p "$backup.gpg"    r=$? ; ((r != 0))then error obexftp $relif    echo ok    echo -n "sending backup via email..."    mutt $email -s backup -a $backup.gpg < /dev/null    r=$? ; ((r != 0))then error mutt $relse    echo ok    rm "$backup.gpg"fi I know a bit about this software and I think it's pretty cool.  I really would like to see an implementation of bitcoin using this as a database handler.One of the reason why I think it would fit bitcoin nicely is the fact that mongodb uses JSON directly to represent data.   An other reason is that it is very easy to connect to an other mongodb on the net.  Thus, the network handling would be easy.Also, it's very easy to handle from a bash script.www.mongodb.org Ok, that's cool.  How can I do CGI? +1
I see that you don't run any web server.   Could you, please?If you don't want to run Apache, please consider installing thttpd, which is pretty easy and fast to install.Then I guess it would be easy to serve any www directory for each user. The amount of money you own is definitely NOT related to your wealth.  Rich people don't hoard large amounts of cash, unless they are stupid.The golden rule in finance is diversification.  Rich people own things that money can buy, not money itself.I'm a huge fan of bitcoin, and yet I don't own 5,400 BTC, though such an amount has probably passed through my wallet. I'm interested.I understand we can't mine, but can we run a bitcoin client? This is my current project.Basically it will be a trading plateform where your GnuPG key is used to send orders.For instance, when you want to see your balance, you just enter your GnuPG ID, and the webserver returns the info ASCII encrypted.  This should also make automation very easy.To make an order, you'll basically just have to sign a phrase such as:SELL 1000 BTC @ 0.6 EUR/BTCAnd post it in a textarea.The webserver will NOT do any actual bitcoin or banking transfer.  It would be account based.Deposit and withdrawal of bitcoins will be free but will have to be done manually.Idem for withdrawals of Euros (I won't do USD).  You will NOT be able to deposit in euros, though.To withdraw euros, you'll have to post your signed banking coordinates first.  You may also post a signed postal address, so that you receive bank notes in mail.  There might a small fee for this option.I'll try to keep it as simple as possible, in the same style that my BTC/EUR exchange site.I write it all in a bash CGI script.  Because I don't like PHP and I suck at any other web programming language.  Also, bash is universal, for almost everyone has one on his linux box. Just want to let everyone know that I've received the card.  Haven't tried it yet, though. Hopefully someone will soon compile bitcoin on a smartcard.   Interesting concept of a "bitcoin note".  I also like the design you suggested.However, such a note is different from usual bank notes, since it has value only during a limited period of time.  Basically until someone redeem  the bitcoin on the address and transfer it to an other address.That's why I think there should be a note saying what exactly this is.Something like:<< This is a private key of a bitcoin address which was holding 1 BTC at block number NNNN. >> Notice that gold is reaching back the 1400$/once: It seems that putting the mp4 file on the freeshell messes with file rights somehow.So I put the video on dailymotion instead:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xh4on0_20chf-gold-coin_lifestyle http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCzsCmhkjMM after the #287, security now is answering questions about bitcoin in #288.It's on youtube. Oui je pense organiser ça début mars.  Ce sera le premier dimanche de mars.Personnellemnt j'achèterai pour une centaine d'euros. Tu peux faire une enchère sur la pièce d'or que je vends sur biddingpond   (cf. ma signature) Guys, you know I'm a huge fan of bitcoin.  I've been waiting for this for years, and I can't tell you how glad I am that someone made it for real.However, I have some doubts sometimes.  It's human, right?One of my concern is the capability to create a new chain.  Anyone could.  Of course, there has to be some good reasons to do it, and it would probably not hurt the previous chains, but still...Money is a weird thing.  It's been a very important tool for human interactions since neolithics.  It's a very important stuff.  Some people would kill for money.  Just for pieces of paper, for pure symbolic proof of value.  Somehow this is stupid, but people are that stupid.One of the thing people don't like with money, is the fact that some people can hoard it, and other people can have none of it.     Some people can have tons of gold, and other not a single gram.That's one thing which is not possible with bitcoin: you can't be an ugly capitalist pig.  Say you want to dominate the world and have all the money in it, then immediately people will say "screw this guy, let's start an other chain".Is it a good thing?  I don't know, I'm not sure.  If creating a new money becomes easy, then at some point it has to devaluate the very concept of money, doesn't it?So what would be the solution?  Go back to gold and stick to it?  I don't think so.  Gold as money would be a convention just as bitcoin is.  So what?  Is it possible that a new technical possibility has actually reduced economic possibilities?  Is it possible to lose a capability when adding a capability?   Could the scarcity of money be actually just as usefull as the scarcity of a currency?Will bitcoin kill the very concept of money?I don't know guys, I guess we'll have wait and see if we want to figure it out. Just use Satoshi's alphabet:$ grep abcde bitcoin/src/base58.hstatic const char* pszBase58 = "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"; Ok but how do you plan on making a transaction without having the key in your wallet ? To me the difficult part is the modification of the wallet.dat file.To decode base58, one can use my bash library:Code:#!/bin/bash# # Requires bc, dc, openssl, xxd#base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})bitcoinregex="^[$(printf "%s" "${base58[@]}")]{34}$"decodeBase58() {    local s=$1    for i in {0..57}    do s="${s//${base58[i]}/ $i}"    done    dc <<< "16o0d${s// /+58*}+f" }encodeBase58() {    # 58 = 0x3A    bc <<<"ibase=16; n=${1^^}; while(n>0) { n%3A ; n/=3A }" |    tac |    while read n    do echo -n ${base58[n]}    done}checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -hex |    sed 's/^.* //' |    head -c 8}checkBitcoinAddress() {    if [[ "$1" =~ $bitcoinregex ]]    then        h=$(decodeBase58 "$1")        checksum "00${h::${#h}-8}" |        grep -qi "^${h: -8}$"    else return 2    fi}hash160() {    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -hex |    sed 's/^.* //'}hash160ToAddress() {    printf "%34s\n" "$(encodeBase58 "00$1$(checksum "00$1")")" |    sed "y/ /1/"}publicKeyToAddress() {    hash160ToAddress $(    openssl ec -pubin -pubout -outform DER |    tail -c 65 |    hash160    )}timestamp() {    hash160ToAddress "$(hash160)"}$ decodeBase58 2qy6pGXd5yCo9qy3vxnN7rALgsXXcdboReZ9NZx5aExy1B66FF9F63ACE537B537BE1F7F0CB585649C226C72EEFF43D59FAC4677BE50CA$ !! |xxd -r -p |base64G2b/n2Os5Te1N74ffwy1hWScImxy7v9D1Z+sRne+UMo=FWIW Damn it Hal, that's very mean.  Now we have to work on this or we'll look like fools.I think I could manage to do that by tweaking the bitcoin code and recompiling.  But I'd have to use a brand new wallet cause I don't like to mess with my wallet.PS.  pff  I give up.  I've tried to tweak the code for generating a new address.Code:vector<unsigned char> GenerateNewKey(){    RandAddSeedPerfmon();    CKey key;    key.MakeNewKey();    if (!AddKey(key)) throw runtime_error("GenerateNewKey() : AddKey failed");    //  this is what I tried    unsigned int nSize = i2d_ECPrivateKey(key.pkey, NULL);  // I had to set pkey public in Ckey    if (!nSize) throw key_error("CKey::GetPrivKey() : i2d_ECPrivateKey failed");    CPrivKey vchPrivKey(nSize, 0);    unsigned char* pbegin = &vchPrivKey[0];    vector<unsigned char>& vchRet;    DecodeBase58("2qy6pGXd5yCo9qy3vxnN7rALgsXXcdboReZ9NZx5aExy", vchRet);    strcpy(pbegin, vchRet);      key.SetPrivKey(vchRet);     //  end of what I tried    return key.GetPubKey();}The idea was to create the private key with the getnewaddress command.It doesn't compile since vchRet is not a CPrivKey object.   I don't understand well enough what CPrivKey is.Good luck to other people who will try.  No bid yet?  I'm kind of disappointed.I'm afraid it's because of these pictures that I've made without the flash under artificial ligthning.  The colors are not very good.Here is a short video of me playing around with the coin:http://grondilu.freeshell.org/20110220_013.mp4 Well, for what it worths, I confirm that bitcoin doesn't show any window on Fluxbox.  I've just tried.Personnaly I use "awesome" as a window manager.  It is about as cool as Fluxbox.http://awesome.naquadah.org/
It's certainly more efficient to use your computing power for mining, instead of using it to guess a founded bitcoin address with brute force.But Hal's calculation is eloquent enough, I guess. Fluxbox is quite an exotic window manager.Have you tried with an other WM ?  xfce or Gnome for instance ? too late, but ok, I'll wait. Ok so I'll go for 100 stickers then.    I'll PM you my postal address. Forget it then, I'll go for "a better currency".Please tell me your shipping fees for a 100, 50 or 10 stickers packages. I think 100 stickers might be a large volume.  Maybe I should just order 10 first, since it should hold in a standard enveloppe.Also, instead of "a better currency", could you write "une meilleure monnaie"? I'd definitely buy some.  At 15c each, I'd buy an hundred.  Would you ship to Europe? 2 weeks auction.Starting price is 0.99 BTC.I'll pay shipping fees to wherever in the world.I'll use a tracked UPS letter.Have fun bidding   !http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=312 I like this comparaison a lot. I agree with theymos.  eMail is already peer-to-peer, since anyone can install a mail server.However, it's a bit difficult technically, and it's kind of useless if you don't own a fixed IP and a domain name. Je connais mal ces gars-là mais on dirait qu'ils organisent une conf sur bitcoin:http://www.tmplab.org/wiki/index.php//tmp/gaiteLe conférencier sera un certain Renaud Lifchitz, qui d'après Google est un membre du Chaos Computer Club I can't guarantee I'll pay for it, but I'd definitely would like to see that. Pour une question aussi technique tu devrais vraiment poster en anglais sur le forum support.Tu auras une réponse bien plus rapidement amha.Moi je ne peux pas t'aider en tout cas, désolé. Well, even if they do, then the difficulty will decrease and the mining will be done by CPUs...I really think there isn't much to worry about. I don't mind if there is a bit of centralisation, as long as it is not coerced.There can be many pools, with different rules.  Plus, nothing prevents you from investing in a lot of CGU and do your own mining. Indeed, and it is much less fun than I thought.  I'll make the test one day, though. Damned it ribuck has been quicker than me.I'd like to make an experiment too.  The purpose is to see how many people are willing to pay for a silly experiment.  So, this experiment has no purpose.  It is just a silly experiment.In order to contribute to the experiment, please donate 1 BTC to:186k1qpkn26Gd45Bznhh5SRReo93XLPvuu I'm pretty sure one of the objective is to allow someone to donate credits to someone else.  If you can donate, then you can sell. For some time I've been considering whether it could be possible to create some kind of a "mind fingerprint", using a decent number of Yes/No questions.Results could be printed as a box in the above area.As I see it, it would consist in something like 100 yes/no questions, and as a result you'll see where you are on a political map.Questions would deal with death penalty, divorce, capitalism, freedom of speech, abortion, minimal wage, retirement, gun control, and so on... I don't see the problem.  Those people just made poor financial decisions.  There are some losses.  Nothing to be offended about.
I think it's amazing that millions of people are about to accept using that.  But anyway, I'm all about free market and I have nothing against private currencies after all.So, what should we do about that?  Is is good news for the liberalisation of currencies?  Will it contribute to make people think about what is money?I think that it will be important to offer a plateform exchange with this currency.  I hope the main bitcoin exchange websites will integrate it as soon as the facebook credit is released. +1 I think you got all mixed up.I like the idea of a chart with economic freedom on the horizontal axis and moral issues on the vertical axes.  But I don't like your labelling.To me it would be pretty much more like this:                libertarianism                    ^                    |communism <-                 -> liberalism                    |                    v                conservatism With this I agree more or less.  But not with what you wrote above: That's not how I see things.To me left/right is the capitalism/communism antagonism.  So basically it deals with economic freedom.Conservatism/liberal deals with moral issues.  Basically all social stuffs, i.e. everything which is not related to commercial activity: mariage, divorce, education, crime, drugs, free speech, suicide, guns, religion, ... Shareholders can not be screwed by lack of regulation.  If they need more regulation, they'll make their own regulation.  Get rid of government regulation, and shareholders will price this increased moral risk.   Market will take this into account.   Good management can bring private regulation.  Good managers can be nominated during the assembly.  It can be decided by share holders just in order to raise the capital value of the company, and thus to make benefits.Nobody is against regulation.  It just doesn't have to be done by government.I don't know well the Enron case, but at some point this company failed, right?  Well, failure is part of free market regulation. I answered rightist libertarian, which to me is just the true form of any libertarian. For what it's worth, here is the phpinfo() output of the server I intend to use:http://grondilu.freeshell.org/infos.phpPlease let me know if you see anything that would prevent me from using prestashop or your prestashop module. I really suck at PHP and I need to check out how Apache works exactly on my web provider, so it's gonna take some time for me to test that, but I've just sent 1 BTC already, as I promessed.Thanks.

Well, we need to tell exactly that to people who advocate for a World Government. I think people who claim that experiment is a good thing are cessessionists.This means that when a nation is divided on an important issue, they just cut the country in two parts and put each camp in each sides.We did that for the communism/liberalism antagonism and it was a mistake to try unification. I'd say piranha.  Each of them take only a small bite, but when thousands of them do, they finally take everything except the bones. I have never used the bitcoin faucet and will never donate to it.  Bitcoin is free money as in free speech, not free beer. Well, if there are several sets of rich and powerful people using force, at least we can hope some balance will be created, and at least we can chose the side we want be part on.   With democracy, when you are in the minority you just have to obey and do whatever the majority tells you to do.  With anarcho-capitalism people just associate and organise their defense against the majority. Bah les vidéo c'est sympa à regarder.  Et ça a un coté vulgarisant. Bitcoin is a bank account system where people elect a new bank every ten minutes.15 words Ahhh  tio estus ege tro multe da laboro por mi !  Mi ecx ne uzas la X version de bitcoin.  Mi nur uzas la tekstan version.Pardonu al mi, sed nun mi ne estas tre laborantema.
No, it is not indeed.  But if you want to celebrate bitcoin each Jan 3rd, it is not because it will be "Jan 3rd", but because one more year will have passed since the first bitcoin.  And a year, to me, is the time Earth takes to revolution around the Sun.PS.  Oh, and by the way, "jan 3rd" is certainly not by any kind of "Jesus Christ calendar".  JC has never designed any calendar system.  The word "January" comes from the roman god "Janus" in julian calendar. Well, the BIG advantage of solo mining is that... yout can keep all the money for yourself!   mojosa!!(mi jxus lernis tiun vorton  ) The most original feature of bitcoin is the distributed time server.  It is the first ever artificial unstoppable time clock.We should definitely use it instead of the rotation of Earth around the Sun. I rejected it.Multiples of 210,000 block numbers will mark much more important dates. I suspect it is possible.  But we need someone with a big brain, or someone who has enough time to think about it thoroughly. Well, maybe Nokia abandonning open source will revive the openmoko initiative. Just make a bash script that checks your balance and whistles if it has increased.Code:#!/bin/basholdbalance=0if ! balance=$(bitcoind getbalance)then     echo coudn't retreive the balance 2>&1    exit 1elif (($balance > $oldbalance))then   mpg123 someCoolSoundFile.mp3   oldbalance=$balancefiAnd then in the bash command line (or in you .profile or whereever):$ while thenameofthescriptabove; do sleep 60; done & I just don't trust smartphones for security.  Most of them don't even ask for a password to connect.  How is that even possibly secure? Check this out:http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoin&date=ytdCertainly due to the slashdot article about BTC/USD parity. Nice try, anyway.  Not especially smart, but quite an amusingly naïve attempt. Même si c'est économiquement inférieur, les gens ont le droit d'essayer.  Avec ce genre d'argument on pourrait interdire les bitcoins.Le seul moyen de prouver l'inefficacité économique, c'est la mise à l'épreuve. Voui Bastiat est une référence incontournable, surtout pour nous les francophones.A noter qu'une bonne source pour lire Bastiat est http://bastiat.org I'm actually in favor of trading vote rights, which is mentionned at around 8'10'' in the movie.I'm not sure those guys would like the bitcoin idea.  Just as I'm pretty sure those guys don't like gold or money in general. Bah les gens qui plaident pour les monnaies locales ne prônent pas l'usage de la force pour imposer leur monnaie.  Pour moi si c'est un protectionnisme, c'est plutôt à rapprocher du protectionnisme qui consiste à dire "achetez français".  C'est juste une sorte de préférence nationale individuelle.C'est comme les produits Bio:  ça coute plus cher et rien ne prouve que c'est meilleur pour la santé.  Mais si y'a des gens qui les préfèrent, c'est leur problème. I very much doubt it is a good idea to run a full bitcoin client on a smartphone.  But this is my personnal opinion. Amongst the numerous questions you have, one is worth answering right now:Yes, it is possible to backup your wallet, and you really should do it once you got a significative amount of bitcoins.  Check out the FAQ and the wiki. Je n'ai rien contre le protectionnisme.  Tu peux regretter que des gens souhaitent se "protéger" ou affirmer leur différence culturelle, mais c'est leur droit le plus absolu.D'ailleurs, bitcoin n'est rien d'autre qu'une monnaie locale.  Pas au sens géographique du terme, mais au sens communautaire.  La communauté en question est simplement les utilisateurs de bitcoin. lol  thanks  Bitcoin has some attributes of cash, but it is really not that exactly.Digital cash is rather David Chaum's e-cash, which is based on blinded signatures.
It is the downloading part which takes some time.  Not the verification.It is therefore a matter of bandwith, not computing power. C'est très bien les monnaies locales.  Je n'ai pas besoin de lire l'article pour m'en convaincre.Pour moi en économie, "small is beautiful".  Je n'ai personnellement absolument rien contre ce genre d'initiatives et je leur souhaite le plus de succès possible. Oh this reminds me of a calculation I made few months ago.In order to back gold by bitcoins, or bitcoins by gold, we'd have to set up the price of gold to 8 BTC per kilogram.And I think I was wrong about that, it's rather 8 kg of gold for 1 bitcoin. LLOOOOLLyeah right I want a golden meteorite falling in my garden, and also a super good looking woman knocking at my door, requesting to be my slave.Like this will ever happen lol True.  And as far as an anarcho-capitalistic society is concerned, conflicts are resolved by force.  Just as it is in the current society (policemen do have guns), except that this force is not monopolised by one entity. Well, if you present it like this, I guess it could After all, we only have one implementation.  There is a lot of room for improvement. I agree with 1.  Indeed I'm not sure bitcoin could be used simultenaously by billions of users.However, point 2. is not limited to bitcoin.  If security of personnal computers is compromised, then any electronic transaction is.  Not just bitcoins. I don't understand how this was a "trick".The URV was actually displayed in all grocery stores, right ?So to me this money was not that virtual.  Basically it was existing via these marks that were put on products.  They had to come up to consistent numbers, and the cruseiro was only used as an intermediary.It's great story anyway.  I had no idea this was how the real was introduced in Brasil.Notice that in some way this is how the ancester of Euro, the Ecu, was introduced too. Well, I just think exactly the same. I've not always been libertarian.  I'm sure at some point in my life I could have been offended by a sentence such as "tax is theft".  Indeed I used to tolerate taxation, because I thought that, globally, the government was doing more good than arm.It seems to me that this is what this guy thinks.  To him, taxation is indeed technically a theft, but it is acceptable as an exception to a moral rule.  So to him, there is an acceptable amount of liberty that a government can take out from its citizens.Now, this is just a quantitative question.  To him, governments has not yet overpassed this acceptable amount.  To me and other libertarians, it has.  It is a very subjective question, imo.I could tolerate governments if it took me only some very small amount of my work, depending on what it does with it.  Just as I won't try too hard to fight against mosquitos sucking my blood.  But as soon as I think "enough is enough", I feel that I have to stand up and do whatever I can as an individual to make this stop.  And if my vote is not enough, then I'll try anything else.And if to do so I have to say rethoric sentences such as "taxation is theft", I will. People who really own a LOT of bitcoins should consider giving me some at the following address:1MHT1WZxPwH5gLdUb7gmum3xgqcTdFS5j1I'm a good person.  Plus, I will contribute to the bitcoin economy, for I won't just hoard those bitcoins.  Don't hesitate to give me 1, 10 or even 100 BTC.  Thanks. EDIT:removed because it's just not a good idea.  I have to think it more through. I bought many things with bitcoins.  Usually not directly though, but by using a currency exchange first.  Most often via bitcoin2cc, or via my selling site on my signature.Does that count for you?  I think it does but I'm afraid you meant a "direct" purchase from bitcoin to goods and services. I think you can do that on a OS level.  For instance, running "htop" you can press 'a' to set CPU affinity. This would be extremely easy.First, just make a modified version of bitcoin, with a different Genesis block.  In the genesis, all monetary units will be attributed in the transaction (a generation transaction).To increase the capital, the company would just issue a new currency, and she would guarantee an appropriate exchange rate.   Or she can modify the code directly and claim that this new code is the "official code".Retiring shares is just as simple.It would be very easy, really. The quantity of money you own has very little to do with your wealth, really.It's actually silly to hoard large amounts of cash.  Somehow it's a kind of acetism, because money you hoard is money you don't spend, it's consumption you refuse to enjoy.  There is no reason to envy someone who owns a lot of cash, really.  You might even mock him.  Because it's foolish.I own about 1,400 bitcoins, and about 150 euros.  Most of my wealth is in stock holdings and precious metals.  I hate owning cash, even in bitcoins (although I prefer bitcoins to euros).   You may have made the transaction while you had no peers connected.  Then the software has to wait about 30 minutes to resend the transaction.  Don't ask me why, I don't know.  Ask on IRC, to theymos for instance.  They know these kind of stuffs. J'essaie de faire une vidéo xtranormal qui explique comment bitcoin résoud le problème du double paiement.Voici où j'en suis actuellement:http://grondilu.freeshell.org/bitcoin-dpaiement.flv Since there is efficient contraception, sex has very little to do with reproduction nowadays. It is not what show empirical facts.  Longevity does not compensate for decreasing natality.  This is called "Demographic transition" and so far it has never led to an increase of population.If women make less than 2.1 children, unless people become immortal, then there is just no way this can not result in a dramatic collapse of population, possibly extinction.  It is just a pure mathematical law.  The number of fertile women will decrease geometrically, and noone can know how much it can lower until women start to decide to make more children.Population dynamics is much more complex than you seem to think.  Things have changed since Malthus, you know.Do you know for instance the chaotic behavior of the logistic sequence (u_{n+1} = \alpha u_n * (1 - u_n)) ??This equation is a basic model of a demographic evolution.  Basically it states that the future population number is proportionnal to the present one (which is logic since there are more fertile women), but with a proportionnal factor that tends to decrease when this number reaches a limit (which can happen for instance when people are afraid of overpopulation, as you seem to be).
Then I guess it can be privately funded, right?  If so, I have no problem with it.  I may even buy a few shareholdings. Human population won't increase forever.    We're not rabbits, and we have contraception.  Developped countries have shown than when women have the choice of the number for their offspring, they make less children than what is necessary for renewing generations (2.1 children).  Overpopulation is only a short term problem.  We should rather fear the demographic crash that will follow.This is just science fiction. It is also a weird point of view.   You're advocating for a goal that you will never witness.  Who does that?Why should I wake up in the morning and go to work in order to finance something that only humans in several centuries will enjoy?  This is a ridiculously huge social abnegation.  Just as silly as an ant which sacrfices itself for its queen.   I dare say that I'm not as silly as an ant.If you want to work for mankind, I advise you at least do it for present mankind, not for the mankind of a very hypothetical distant future. Well, maybe the fact that those millions of years of evolution you describe all occured ON EARTH !Evolution is a gradual process.  Going and flourishing suddenly out of earth in a totally different environnement is something that has just never been done.Also, evolution is contingent.  You see only what has succeeded.  For one success, many failures.  So there is no reason why humans should succeed in everything they try to achieve.Seriously, you can try to go and live on Mars if you want, I don't mind if you do that by your own means.   But I will try my best to prevent you from funding this crazyness with tax money. Yeah, I should have written this the other way around: we are not designed to live on Mars.  Nor are we designed to live under the ocean, in Antartica or at the top of the highest mountains.  Pretending the opposite is just silly.Yeah adapting our environnement is cool.  But there is a limit to that.  We don't live in deserts on earth.  We don't even live on water, although we technicaly could, I guess.  There is just no benefit in doing so.Now, maybe you can talk about terraforming Mars, but this is a very different topic.  It is just basically a very, very long term investment.  Who would finance this?  Why?   Why should I work to finance something I will never personnaly benefit from??   It is just an economic non-sense. Lol  great we're going to have this debate about space colonisation again.I like the part when Zubrin says:Well, yes!  I'm pretty sure that, if Colombus, when arriving in America, found only a deserted dangerous place, with very little resource, only rocks and a deadly solar radiation, then I guess he would have say exactly this.Instead, he found a luxurious country with gold everywhere and indigeous people who were offering their topless wives as a welcome gift.  No wonder he wanted to establish there!The Colombus comparaison is just ridiculous.  To me, the first men on Mars should be compared to Tenzing and Hillary, the first men who climbed the Everest, not to Colombus.Mars is a distant place that we know it exists, we know what it looks like, but we can't go there.America was a place we didn't know it was there, we didn't know what it looked like, but where we were able to go.Dreaming of establishing on Mars is just as serious as dreaming of establishing cities in Sahara or farms under deep oceans.It is just *not a place designed to sustain human life*. Well, yes that's the idea.  But it's no different than what any broker do.I've actually finished it, thanks to dirtyfilthy wich made a C program which allows a user to extract private keys from a wallet.  But I don't like the ergonomic of the result, and I'm pretty sure people won't like the idea of using an other program to sign stuffs.I'm now considering going back to the idea of using GnuPG.Bash will be fine to this.  It's the whole design of the thing that I have to think more through. blockexplorer is missing about 40 blocks. +1yet I enjoyed the pilot and I'm about to dl 1x02PS.  I've changed my mind and I donated 1 BTC.  I'll give more if I enjoy the second episode too. Yeah I'm working on it too.  I'm not sure how exactly would this be implemented.  I've experimented several solutions.I want to mention something though.  Such a stock market doesn't have to be organised by corporations themselves.  Stocks can be sold on "second-hand", in a parallel market.I've already sold 1 eBay share and 1 DRDGold share, using an auction process.  Search those terms in the marketplace forum. Well, I guess anyone who is incapable of learning a few prefixes does not have much economic value anyway.  So I don't mind if these people don't use bitcoin.PS.  If I ask my mother what scientific notation is, she will obviously say she has no idea.  But if I ask her how many millimeters there are in on meter, I'm pretty sure she'll have to give it about 10 seconds thought, but hopefully she'll come out with the right answer. Come on.  He doesn't know what a millimeter is?  He doesn't ever use words such as kiloWatt, kilogram, MegaHertz, GigaOctet, and so on? ... Will satoshi be back to sign the tarball if gavin increases the decimal precision?I'd feel much more comfortable if it's satoshi who stays in charge for this. I don't play WoW but I'm glad this service exists in bitcoin, because it is something that anyone can easily do to earn bitcoins.  It's certainly a good thing for bitcoin economy. I suggest you add Satoshi Nakamoto to this list  Just read this quickly, skipping some boring parts about morality.It is indeed a good text, much more clever that what I read usually from states-lovers.I'll write more about it later. It's just like a normal bank, with the folowing differences:- there are several bank accounts per person.  You can actually create as many bank accounts as you want.- accounts are anonymous.  Nobody can know who own a bank account, unless you publish the account number and declare it is yours.- owning a bank account consists of having a mathematical key associated to it.  This key allows you to transfer bitcoins from this bank account to another.  You must keep this key secret and store it on your PC.- all transactions between bank accounts are public.  Every transaction is stored on everyone's PC.- every 10 minutes or so, someone is elected to play the role of a central bank.  He clears the transactions, checks balances, and creates a few new bitcoins for himself.I doubt I could make it less technical. Keeping 2100 BTC is a good symbolic number since it is 0.01% of the total amount of bitcoins. Currencies don't inflate one another.When Bernanke print USD, he doesn't hurt EUR or JPY Yeah, and when they DON'T agree with such rules, they don't have to live like ermits as you suggested.  They just separate and gather in groups of people agreeing with a different set of rules.I think this is called separationism (or maybe cessessionism), and to me it is better than democracy. This is an error statits often make.  They see society as a whole.  You're part of it or you're not.A society is basically a group of people interacting with one another.  If you reject one, you can join an other. Basically what I advocate is the right for individuals to chose who they want to work and collaborate with.
I very much doubt so.  Private capital accumulation doesn't lead to slavery, as long as it doesn't use force to coerce people to work.Well, it is NOT a volontary contribution.  If you don't agree with it, you have to pay anyway.  If you don't, armed people threaten you and put you in a cage.  It is not slavery, but it's pretty damn close.The lack of counter examples??  You're obviously biased.Anyway, even if that was true, think about what would happen if suddenly government stopped funding those research.  Would all the scientists who were working for gov. suddenly become dum?  Would they stop thinking, creating, innovating?  Would they become too poor to organize themselves the funding of their research?  Wouldn't some private companies be glad to be able to support them financially?In science, the governement is like an elephant in a room.  Once you get rid of it, there is plenty of room for other things.PS.  And again, it's not even a matter of efficiency.  Science is great, no doubt of that.  But I don't value it more than my freedom.PS.  Also, please stop using public scientific research as an excuse to legitimate taxation.   It is a very tiny small part of taxation.   I don't care if taxes and public funding are more efficient for research, scientific developpement or whatever.  It is probably.I'm pretty sure that a scientist will be more efficient if you give him one hundred slaves to help him for his research (building him a home, a laboratory, shining his shoes, whatever...).It's not the matter.  With the same ideas, we could solve unemployement by rehabilitating slavery.Domestication of humans is probably an efficient economic model.  I have no doubt about that.  Still, I don't want to be part of it. Anyone working on the mybitcoin API? I'd like to book two or three girls in order to celebrate the bitcoin parity.  They have to be tall, caucasian and good looking.  If they can bring cocaine, I buy that too.  Girls have to stay the night and accept anal, ass-to-mouth, gaging, deepthroat and spanking.    I'm sado so at least one of them has to be maso.  If the others accept to be beaten, it's good but I'm ok if they refuse that.  Yet all of them have to accept at least a few strong slaps in the face.Please PM me photos and fares. Agreed.One thing people should do when they explain bitcoin, is to compare a bitcoin address to a bank account number.  Because it has exactly the same purpose, basically.  Except that this account number has a mathematical key that you keep secret.An  other thing is to explain that everything works a bit like in the conventionnal banking system, except that the person who plays the role of the bank changes every ten minutes or so.Once you've explained that, I think you got the global framework of bitcoin. To celebrate this day, I suggest we all donate 1 BTC to our favorite organisation.Personnaly I'll give one to EFF and one for Hayek's institute. Also, consider adding nodes manually with the -addnode option or something.  It's somewhere in the wiki.  If you can't find it, ask on IRC. nice one, ribuck. Probably not on the short term.  On long term, I have no doubt about it. <<  Bitcoin has reached parity..  YEEEEAHHHHH!!!! >> So true.  Let's party!!!! Has a podcast URL been published yet? Cornering a hard currency is a tough enterprise, for the reasons explained above.  See Hunt brothers with silver.Not only it's difficult, but even if you succeed, it's not sure you can turn it into profit. bah il te suffit d'augmenter ton prix au fur et à mesure que ton stock diminue. When I think about it, I realise that this is exactly why we should not vote.Because if some people like this guy argue that taxe is part of a social contract, then the closest thing to this contract is the vote.  Basically when you vote you accept the idea that you will obey to people who are elected, even if you did not vote for them.I think I will never ever vote again. I stopped reading here, for I don't remember having signed anything.  Forget it.  Copyright laws are just plain stupid.  Copying is good.  The whole story of scientific, artistic and cultural developpement is a story of people copying and learning from each other.  Whether or not you get the agreement of the person you copy doesn't matter.  You didn't ask him.  You just did it.Without the right to learn and copy people, we would not be better than apes.
I don't know what more we could do.  I think the bitcoin community makes it quite clear that you have to make backups of your wallet.  Maybe we could had some reminders in the GUI, but I think it's best to assume the user is responsible from what he does or does not. Moi cette façon de voir les choses ne m'intéresse pas trop mais je ne doute pas que ça plaira à beaucoup de monde.   Tu as donc l'air motivé pour tenir une sorte de "boutique en plein air" où le public pourra acheter des bitcoins physiquement.Tu pourrais donc faire ce genre de chose à intervalles réguliers, par exemple chaque premier dimanche du mois.  Si tu le fais je te ferais de la pub partout où je peux. Indique au moins ton prix de vente. Place tes ordres d'abord stp. Ben comme je le disais dans mon post de tête, de nombreux parcs à Paris ont un hot-spot Wifi.Il y a aussi les bibliothèques, dont certaines sont ouvertes le dimanche.  L'intérêt des bibliothèques c'est qu'on peut y faire l'échange sans même avoir à se rencontrer physiquement.  Il suffit, une fois sur les lieux, de communiquer via IRC et de placer l'argent et le login/motdepasse mybitcoin chacun dans un bouquin bien précis (si possible à des endroits qui n'intéressent pas grand monde). Ah oui effectivement c'est possible aussi.  Mais il y aurait un frein psychologuque assez important pour les acheteurs amha.  Quand on donne du cash, en général on attend quelque chose en retour immédiatement. Hum...    I think I shouldn't have talked about the generationn process, but instead I should have talked about the "election" process.My point is that CPU power has to be used in order to determ which node in the network will be in charge of validating transactions.  The reward for this task is not really relevant for my point. Anyway, I think it would be very cool if we could use this to log into this forum.   But I guess cookies do pretty much the same job. I doubt there are many well "connected" people on this forum.  Bitcoin is way too underground to be of any interest for the establisment.  They just don't have time to wander on the net and to find it by chance.Personnaly I'm almost certain I would never have discovered bitcoin if I had kept my previous job.   Or I would have discovered it in the same time than everyone, only once it is discussed in mainstream media.IMO Je ne pense pas qu'il soit opportun de dévoiler l'endroit exact où auront lieu les transactions.  Ne seront au courant que ceux qui auront négocié en MP ou par mail.Pour la vente, j'envisage de créer des comptes mybitcoin sur lesquels je mettrai les montants négociés.  Je donnerai alors un bout de papier avec les login/mot de passe.  Il appartiendra alors à l'acheteur d'utiliser son terminal pour vérifier le compte en question, et les transférer sur une de ses adresses.Cette méthode permettra de ne pas avoir à apporter un terminal sur lequel se trouverait le portefeuille complet. Switch this computer off right now (hard switch off: you want to avoid any writting on the disk) and use an other computer to search for "recover formated data" on the web. As you know many people don't like the idea of using CPU power in order to make so-called "useless" computations.I suspect it is possible to rigorously prove that any cryptocurrencies, providing it fulfills a few conditions, has to be based on proof-of-work, and thus on CPU.So far I can't prove it seriously, so it is just a conjecture.    I'd be glad if someone with a solid maths and IT background could bring a demonstration.So it would look like:Obviously this relies on a theoretical, more general definition of "cryptocurrency".  I won't give such a definition here but I guess you get the idea. Found it by chance on the web:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJTMr_ofgr0I'm glad some people have real logistics to talk about bitcoin. Commencez par placer vos ordres dans cette file.Moi pour dimanche prochain je peux acheter jusqu'à 100 BTC à 0.5 EUR/BTC.Je ne vendrai pas à moins de 0.7 EUR/BTC par contre. Hum, I don't think it's that simple.  I'd be very unhappy if I had to pay for email, for instance.The thing is that I think anonimity should be part of Internet provider service.  They are legally forced to montitor and log all IPs they assign.  So with TOR you would pay to counter the law.  I hate this idea.   If I must pay for something that would be free without a stupid law, then I'll go broke very quickly.   Writing a stupid law doesn't cost much.  And if it does cost, you'l finance it by stealing people anyway.  I can't fight against that with money.  Fighting against laws should be free. I really think that at least some of the cards should be sold on an auction based system.That's one good thing about markets: it can handle shortages.  I mean, when there are few resources, prices have to rise.  This allows to ration the ressource, and allocate it to people who need/want it the most.At least, prices should increase when stock decreases.  Thus anybody could buy at any time, providing that he is willing to overpay. My first impression:the frog is much cuter  On second thought, I'm not sure it's that a good idea.First, it would be tricky to implement.  I don't say it's not possible, but I guess it would be an entire project.Second, bandwith is actually some kind of "money" which is exchanged on the TOR network.  Basically the incentive to give their bandwith would be some bandwith.  I mean that you give some bandwith and you get some bandwith on the TOR network.  Well, sort of.  But again I don't know well enough how TOR works, so I can't discuss seriously about it.Anyway I don't like the idea of paying to use TOR.  We already pay internet providers.  It's kind of a double bill. I do think that a capitalistic TOR network would be quite a good business model.BAsically all nodes could receive bitcoins depending on the bandwith they provide.  If they provided less than some amount, then they have to pay in order to use the network.I don't know well enough how TOR wroks, but to me the very fact that there is a single point for donations is a problem for something which is supposed to be deregulated. lol
Well, you were kidding but a good bitcoin song would be very cool.I'll see if I can think of something. Yet, the bank creates 90% of the loan out of thin air.But it's not as if they were creating this money for themselves, either.  I mean, the lender is the first one who benefits from this loan, amongst with the people who will receive this money (real estate agents, workers who built the house, and so on...).When the lender gives the money back, the bank destroys it.  It only takes the interest.  To some extend, interests are the reward for the accounting and legal work.  The whole system is not that bad.In my opinion, the only thing which is outrageous, is the "too big to fail", and the overcomplex regulation which prohibits any competition and free market in the banking economic activity. Yeah I remembered that just after I posted my message.  Sorry. Bitcoin has quite a decent monetary value, so we should consider an alternative way of promoting bitcoin.Instead of saying "It's great, you should use it!", one could say "Some morons are paying for this stuff, let's hack the whole thing and make a lot of money!".One advantage of this approach is that it can help improving the security of bitcoin, and failures of hacking can be used as a promotional argument.  I'm pretty sure that one day, I'll wake up one morning and I'll realize that the bitcoin.org website has been block.  Then I'll go on IRC and I'll ask where is the TOR hidden bitcoin website.One minute later, I'll be connected to it. Despise against a cultural or ethnic group is usualy assimilated to racism. I would be impressed if you could guess the nationality of someone that easily.  Which was this mistake you're talking about? You could work on a script. just one hour guys Maybe you don't know yet but there is a huge bounty (about 10,000 BTC I think) for a good introduction animation about bitcoin. I don't think they have to be mutally exclusive anyway.  I mean, I have enough room im my brain to remember several notation systems, as long as they are not too complex.In my opinion, yours is not very usefull, since it doesn't even give any prononciation rule. But at least it's simple.Let's just let people pick the system they like. Wow this sounds pretty cool.  Does that mean that we'll be able to implement our own tradebots?Where is the doc? Jim Rogers advises to buy Japanese Yen, chinese RenMimbi (not sure about the spelling for this one) and Swiss Franc. Looking at the auction history, it seems that "ender_x" has some kind of automatic bidding.So I think it's pointless to try to bid at the very last minute, unless you can guess what is ender_x's max bid. LOL ok this deserves a littly reward too. +1What about a short video of a girl mentionning bitcoin for her personnal service?EDIT:  oops I +1ed this although it's actually the opposite that I thought.  This picture is obviously a fake, imo. I guess this means you intend to bid.  Good. corrected. Well, you didn't really "lost" them.  You destroyed them on purpose, because you didn't value them much.It may be not to late to recover it, though.  Check out "recover lost data" on Google.In some other thread a guy formated his disk just as you did, and yet he managed to recover his wallet. Well, on second thought, maybe the need for anonymous money in prostitution is higher than I thought.   Prostitution is legal in several countries, but proxenytism is still forbidden in France, for instance.I guess that using bitcoin, it would be very difficult for police to prove that a sex intercourse is the result of an electronic financial negociation.It depends on how bitcoin-aware organized crime is, I guess.  So far I think that mafia using bitcoin is still some rumor.  I doubt these guys are that technological-oriented.
I voted "No" I do not believe that, sorry.It is certainly way too early for bitcoin proxenytism.  Your post is nothing but a bad joke, imo. Ready?... Steady?  ... GO!!ok I know current bid is correct already, but I'm sure you can do better guys. C'est clair que ce type de magasin a toute la logistique et l'expérience nécessaire.   Ce serait l'idéal.  Il y a aussi les buralistes.Ce qu'il faudrait c'est imprimer des tracts d'information et les distribuer rue Vivienne.   Si quelqu'un peut construire une maquette je peux envisager d'investir un peu pour les imprimer. And still no progress whatsoever??  Damn Maybe you say that because you are american and most american are not familiar with the metric system, but I assure you that everywhere else in the world people know these prefixes.Yes they are, at least for "kilo".  I'm pretty sure I've heard an american person talking about how he earned 50 'K', meaning 50 K$, ie 50,000$.Also, with computers people are getting used to standard prefixes.  They talk about the speed of their processor in KHz, the size of their RAM in Go, the length of a transistor in nm, and so on...I'm pretty sure they won't mind talking about mBTC, µBTC etc.Moreover, if the period of variation of value for bitcoin is slow enough, then people will only talk about one our two units in their life time.  They will trade in mBTC for their daily expenses, and talk in BTC for their wage.  50 years later, their children might talk about µBTC or KBTC, who knows,  but the range of their expenses will probably not cover more than 3 or 4 prefixes, I guess. Dans un récent article de ploum sur sa page utilisateur sur linuxfr (http://linuxfr.org/~ploum), je lisais une réponse sur la difficulté avec laquelle on peut acheter des bitcoins.  C'est vrai, je confirme, car je suis passé par là.  Mes premiers bitcoins j'ai du les acheter en envoyant des dollars aux états unis par la poste.  C'est dire!Ce qu'il faut comprendre c'est que le bitcoin c'est une monnaie électronique "dure" (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_money#Hard_vs_soft_electronic_currencies), donc c'est normal que ce soit pas évident de l'acheter avec une monnaie légère (soft money).  Parce qu'une transaction dans une monnaie légère peut être annulée du jour au lendemain.Ça me fait penser à une remarque que me faisait quelqu'un quand je lui disais que l'or, ça s'achète pas avec une carte de crédit.  Il ne comprenait pas pourquoi, et sur le coup j'avoue que je ne savais pas trop quoi lui répondre.  Maintenant je sais. Bref, j'envisage sérieusement d'organiser des rencontres physiques, par exemple dans un lieu public avec accès internet, pour échanger des bitcoins.  Les jardins publics parisiens ont un accès wifi gratuit, et me paraissent donc un bon endroit.  En cas d'intempéries un cyber café ou une bibliothèque devrait faire l'affaire.C'est peut-être un peu tôt, mais si des gens se manifestent, j'organiserai ça par exemple une fois par mois.  Genre, chaque premier dimanche du mois. I removed my comment because on second thought I don't want to promote this website in anyway.Isn't there someone who could sell a laptop to TheKid? This offer is really too tempting.  I've sent you an email. I don't use bitcoin everyday and thus my client is not always running.  I don't even have a permanent internet access.I doubt I'm the only one in that case.  Thus I don't think the number of running clients is relevant. 0.37 BTC for you already. Oh yeah I forgot about the vending machines.  Good idea. LOL  I'll give you a few cBTC but I seriously doubt you'll be able to use those notes now. I always fail to understand or remember what exactly is reddit   That's a nice thread.Although most work in the FOSS community is done for free, a little monetarty incentive can help  I doubt there is any way to know exactly how many bitcoin users there are.However, using some statistics both about bitcoin users and the block chain, it should be possible to make an evaluation.For instance, we could make a poll about the number of bitcoin addresses people have in their wallet (with a non-zero balance).  Then, by comparing the number of such addresses in the block chain, I guess we could make an extrapolation. I don't like "What is bitcoin?".  To me it seems to be an akward way to bring the subject.What about:  "consider using bitcoin" ? There is nothing wrong about monopolies, as long as it is not coerced.A monopolistic company is just a company that fullfills whole market demands by itself.  We should congratulate, not blame it.Google for instance has almost a monopoly on web research.  They are just that good about that.  But anyone who think they can do a better job, are free to try. I don't really need this but I pledge 1 BTC. Damned it Kiba, you gave him something to bite on.  Be carefull.For minarchist, defense of property is one of the very few things a government is usefull for.For anarcho-capitalists, the owner of a property must defend it himself, or with a private police.
Doesn't Satoshi work for IBM, Intel or something? Before you do you might consider changing them into 1$ bills since it will give you more bitcoins here  No problem if they just speak and hope to have influence.  I'm not fluent in english but I think it's called "advise" or "opinion", not "decision".Free market is capable of doing things right, but it's made of human being's actions.  Humans have the right to make mistakes.  Humans have the right to try things.  One thing is sure: noone has the right to use force to coerce him to do things just because he things he knows better.PS. nobody forces you to buy a chicken if you don't like the way it has been farmed. I have nothing against freedom of speech.As far as how nature should be ruled, it should be ruled by whoever owns it.  Free market has shown already that it is perfectly capable of maintaining and protecting natural resources, including livestocks.  And if it can't, be it. +1 for standard metric prefix.We only need a name for the smallest unit (10^-8 BTC), since unfortunately is not any of the 10^3 subdivision.  bitdust woudld be fine I guess. What about people just post the photo on this thread, along with a bitcoin address, and people will just donate which ever amount they want to reward it? Bonvolu skribi al la esperanta ejo cxi tie http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1568.0 +1 +1 for bitcoin.org OMG  Do you realy believe this?So you'll allow people to use public force at their will, only because those people have a piece of paper called a diploma, saying they are "philosophs" or "scientists"? It's basically based upon PHP and MySQL.Good thing about this is that it is open-source, although I had never heard about this license (Open Software License).It might be interesting to modify it and to have it support bitcoin, possibly using the PHP API to mybitcoin.com, for instance.I suck at PHP though, and I hate Apache.But hopefully someone would like to work on this.www.prestashop.com During my studies the sysadmins had some weird rule to come up with 8 letters-longed usernames.  They used to take the first 6 letters of the name, and the 2 first letters of the firstname.  With my name, this gave "grondilu" and I thought it sounded pretty cool.  So I kept it later on. Those debates are useless.Nobody should decide for me how I should spend or save my money.   This is only my decision to make.People who think that a bit of inflation is good for the economy can just use paper money.Other people will use precious metals and cryptocurrencies.Planified economy sucks and has always failed. If it is profitable then it is not, by definition, a waste. I have to agree with caveden, although I'm not that extreme.In any way, what we should do about tropical forests, is not for a bunch of ecolocrats to decide. +1My username is made out of my real name. Less than two days left guys. Nice tribute to vintage video games indeed. It can actually be done, but it requires a particle accelerometer.Also, if you detonate a H bomb next to a kilogram of lead, I guess you might create a few atoms of gold. I've been thinking about that some time ago, but now it appears to me that GPG is definitely not appropriate for such use.However, normally openssl makes use of key pair cryptography.  I can SSH to a distant server without having to enter a password, for instance.  Basically I just have to put my ssh public key on the distant server.I don't know why no website is doing anything alike.  There is something I must be missing, because as I understand it, HTTPS relies on the same technology.
What do you mean?  Should I remind you that ECDSA doesn't support encryption? Also, correct me if I'm wrong but, it seems to me that bitcoin doesn't need much more developpement, does it? I don't like this one, since you can't really send bitcoins via email, can you? I think Bitcoin developpers don't need donations.  Supporting bitcoin just consists in contributing to the bitcoin economy.  Moreover, developpers can always sollicitate donations by putting ther bitcoin address in their signature.That's why there is no "donate page" on the bitcoin website. It would much more expensive. Ok, I think I'm beginning to see where you getting at, although it's still not quite clear since in your article you actually mention several solutions that are quite close to what you're advocating (such as Diaspora).I guess I just have to re-read your article. In your article, you write:"It is not possible anymore to be active on the web without an email address. Most services require that you provide a valid email address."Don't you know about the excellent www.mailinator.com ? http://www.google.com/search?q=distribution+argent+interdite+%C3%A0+Paris It is.  Since you're french, I'm sure you remember the affair that happened few years ago with a company that wanted to distribute cash money in Paris.  It has been forbidden by police, because "using money as support for advertising is illegal". in the same spirit:"This is just a piece of paper.  If you want real money, visit bitcoin.org" Much better !Just :"Google 'bitcoin'" Sounds too much like what companies such as Paypal, MoneyGram or whatever could say.However, you're right about being too inflammatory.What about:"Check out the new decentralized digital currency on www.bitcoin.org"? Where could I but a stamping device? Davout has to do all this manually.I guess he'll be ok for keeping it free as long as we don't complain about the time he gets to do things. Ok let's go for it, then.   I doubt so.  If the note is marked somehow, I think they can refuse it. The stamp has to be small, though.  Otherwise it might be difficult to have the note be accepted by marchands.I propose a Bitcoin symbol, with a very short slogan, such has:"stop central banks, visit www.bitcoin.org"Written in very very small characters.PS. hum, I wonder if we could not just give 5EUR notes or 1$ notes to poor people. Peut-être "entreprises et communautés". True. Using national currency notes for any kind of advertising is illegal in most countries.
Vous êtes français, ou du moins francophone?  Bienvenue !Sur ce fil je vous propose de vous présenter brièvement, et de nous dire par exemple comment vous avez découvert l'existence du Bitcoin.Je commence.Moi je suis un ancien informaticien vivant à Paris. (en Picardie depuis 2012).J'ai appris l'existence des bitcoins sur Wikipedia, alors que je cherchais à m'informer sur les alternatives en matière monétaire.Je suis l'auteur de l'article au sujet des bitcoins sur linuxfr:http://linuxfr.org/2010/09/30/27430.htmlvoilà, à vous.Update:  Faites-nous aussi savoir comment vous prononcez le mot "bitcoin". You can't create as many real gold bars as you can create fake gold bars.Gold is useful as money because it can not be created out of nothing.  It is therefore reliable as an accounting tool.  Tungsten is not.See my thread "money as an accounting tool":  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2866.0 That would be great.  I could buy a LOT of bitcoins.I would also love to see this happen in the gold market. Les Rencontres Mondiales du Lociel Libre, qui auront lieu cet année à Strasbourg en juillet, font un appel à conférence.Je me demande si on ne pourrait pas tenter une conférence sur Bitcoin et les cryptodevises.http://2011.rmll.info/appel.html To some extend a Google share holding is already a "google currency".At some point they will be smart enough to understand that they can use the bitcoin software to share their capital.   I am so hoping for this, since IMO it will revolutionnize capitalism.I'm not sure I will live long enough to see it though  It's not a threat at all, it's just normal, healthy competition, and it has been discussed many times already on this forum.And anyway, if GoogCoin is based on open-source software, with similar principles than bitcoin, then soon enough the GoogCoin will not be related to Google Inc. except for its name.  I then might sell some of my bitcoins to buy those GoogCoins.  I won't mind. No.   Currencies don't devaluate each other.  Mugabe didn't hurt the USD when he printed trillions of zimbabwean dollars. I'm pretty sure that at some point big companies such as Google or Apple will try to start their own block chain.But even with their huge processing power, I doubt they could create a longer block chain than bitcoin.  Although the reputation of these companies might help to gain user base, bitcoin will always have a huge time advantage, and thus much more cryptographic weight. Ok so it's simpler than I thought.  I also notice that there is a preference for low prices (a 1.1 bid and a 0.9 ask leads to a 0.9 transaction price, not 1), which does make sense I guess. Say Alice places a bid for a quantity of 20 at a price of 1.1Bob places a ask for a quantity of 10 at a price of 0.9Carl places a ask for a quantity of 20 at a price of 0.95How does this gets adjudicated ? Can't you just declare your business income in BTC, and pay whatever the government asks you for that?My point is that as long as you tell the government exactly what you do, I don't see how it could blame you for anything. It is.If you don't trust bitcoin to have a little stability in the future, then I guess you're unlikely to use bitcoin anyway.The currency you want to use to price your products is an economic decision you have to make for your business.  Whether it is USD, EUR, JPY or BTC doesn't matter: it's always the same problem. I'm pretty sure that, as long as you declare what you do, it's perfectly legal.  I guess for IRS bitcoin is nothing but a "foreign currency" and it should be treated as such, nothing more.Forbidding it would be completely crazy. Well, yes, this is true.I guess in the past (especially in the last 6 months), the increase of bitcoin notoriety has been huge.  Even greater than inflation. This will be true if and only if we double our user base in two years. Well we're at about half of the first 4-year period.That means that the total amount of bitcoins will double in two years.  Thus 50% a year. We should not forget that we are in inflationnary phase.  A lot of bitcoins are created right now, and will be until 2013.So unless we have an even bigger and faster increase of user base, bitcoin value should not increase that much.So even if it seems that the market wants to see the BTC/USD parity, we have to expect a big correction after this happens.IMO Ok then, I guess I'll just have to keep on working on my own implementation. Davout,would you consider offering an exchange place for stock holdings on bitcoin-central?Here is the idea:people owning some share holdings would accept to sell them on "second-hand".  This means that their share holding would stay officialy theirs, but they will convert whatever dividends they receive into bitcoins and pay the holders of the shares on bitcoin-central.I've down it with an eBay and DRDGold share but I don't have any trading plateform. Riak is not even in the debian repo :/
Maybe we could ask davout to include FlattrEUR in bitcoin-central. What about XMPP for network communications ?And a NoSQL database for storing blocks ? Good, good./mode advertising onAlso, don't forget about my current auction for a gold coin on biddingpond : http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=246/mode advertising off Well, no, unless they have a really large amount of money to waste buying those bitcoins.Right now the current market value of all bitcoin stock is about five millions USD, but if someone wanted to buy a significative part of that, he would raise the price dramatically.  Therefore I doubt one could do it with less than say 50 millions USD. High frequency trading would not be directly possible with bitcoins.But one can use an accounting-based trading system, as you would do with any currency. Even if it was possible, and I think it is, it wouldn't change much.   It would just be a different kind of gold mining. Don't forget about my ongoing auction for a nice classic french gold coin on biddingpond.http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=246Only a few days left! Well, yes, if you want.  But in the same way I could say that one gram of gold is a "share of the total amount of gold in the world".  I'm not sure this point of view is much pertinent, though.By "share holding" I meant a share of a company's capital.You don't seem to understand how bitcoin works.  Bitcoins produced by such modified miners would be rejected by my client.  Basically only people who would agree with such an increase of bitcoin total amount could use them. http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/11/18/131430755/a-chemist-explains-why-gold-beat-out-lithium-osmium-einstein It brings more names to bitcoin subdivisions. Well, this is Nystrom hexadecimal representation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Nystrom#Tonal_System_.28Hexadecimal.29), isn't it?It doesn't seem stupid to me.  Anyway, it's just a complement to the standard 10^3-based prefix system.However, it's a bit unfortunate that the smallest amount is not exactly a nanobitcoin, but rather 10 nanobitcoins.  It would have been simpler. Well, yes.  It's obviously more efficient to go directly GBP->USD.  I don't see your point.Personnaly I don't believe in money as a storage of value anyway.   But it's common belief.  As far as I'm concerned, I never hoard money, in any currency.  There are many better ways to store value (real estate, share holdings)...A run to what, whom, where??  People know that bitoin is not redeemable to anything.  Personnaly if bitcoin price was to decrease dramatically, I'd buy everything, just as I'd buy several kilograms of gold if the price went to 35$ an once.  I doubt I'd be the only one. One of the things you can hear from opponents of bitcoin is :I once answered that you can exchange bitcoins just in order to buy something.  I once bought T-shirts on-line using canadian dollars I just bought for this purchase (using the excellent MadHadder's bitcoin-to-credit-card service).I know it's not the same as buying directly in bitcoin.  But is it, really ?   I mean, if currency exchange is quick and efficient enough, there is no practical difference between buying in bitcoin and making a currency exchange just for a product purchase.Oil is priced in dollar.  So I guess when I buy some gaz at a station in Europe, at some point in the exchange chain, there has been some euro-dollar conversion.  Yet, nobody would claim "you can't buy oil with euros".As always, the comparaison between bitcoin and gold is also pertinent.  I can't enter a shop and buy stuffs with a gold coin.  There are very few things that I can buy directly with physical gold.  And yet, most people agree to say that gold is money.   Actually, when I need to buy something I sometimes sell a few gold coins in order to get just enough cash to buy the stuff in the same day.  So I consider I bought this stuff with gold.Amongst the usages of money there are 1) intermediary for exchange 2) store of value 3) unit of accounting.  To me it seems clear that the currency exchange market allow people to use different currency for each of these usages. Oh this seems cool.   Sorry.I should look at this wiki more often  I strongly disagree.We should keep the idea of using standard prefixes.1 centibitcoin = 10^-2 BTC1 millibitcoin = 10^-3 BTC1 microbitcoin = 10^-6 BTC1 nanobitcoin = 10^-9 BTCIn Satoshi's code, the smaller unit is called "the coin".  We should use this.1 coin = 10^-8 BTC = 10 nanobitcoinsEven if the nanobitcoin is too small a unit, we can still use it, as long as we only talk about multiples of 10.  10 nanobitcoins, 40 nanobitcoins, and so on...An other, yet compatible possibility is to start from bottom :1 coin = 10^-8 BTC10^3 coins = 1 kilocoin = 10^-5 BTC10^6 coins = 1 megacoin = 10^-2 BTC10^9 coins = 1 gigacoin = 10 BTCSo one bitcoin would actually be 0.1 gigacoin, or 100 megacoinsEither way, the bitcoin should keep being "10^8 times the smaller unit" Don't be offended.  I just thought the sentence was itself extremly funny.  I see your point, and it's perfectly valid, even if I think you're overestimating this psychological aspect a lot.If I own one kilogram of gold, I don't feel richer if I tell myself that I own one thousand grams. LOOOL Don't write this.  Some people might be silly enough to think you're serious, and we'll have to explain them again. Yeah, forget about floating points.  Use integers. Mathematicians don't control mathematics.  They only study it.
Why on earth would anyone forbid that ? Well, if we want bitcoin to be immune from government intervention, at some point we will need such a test.  We won't know if bitcoin is governmentproof until government actually tries to stop it.I'm afraid it's a bit early though. Ah oui l'auteur de Forban a fait une apparition ici.  Je lui ai même donné un bitcoin. Ok forget it, then.  There are quite a lot of very young people here. Lesquels stp ?  Les projets utilisant bitcoin ne sont pas si nombreux, on aimerait bien en connaitre un maximum. Hi Cédric.If you're french as I suspect you are, please join the french thread on the "other" forum and let us know how you came to know about bitcoin. Ok I get it now.  I don't have any problem with it.  Go for it, then.   It would be nice if we could read a sample of your work, though, in order to see how good a writer you are.PS.  Being french myself, I'm always curious about how french people get to know about bitcoin, since I always wonder if it is not due to an article of mine.  So, where did you get to know about bitcoin? I don't get it anyway.  Isn't a writer supposed to have enough imagination to come up with a story himself ?  There's not much fun reading a story that I would have ordered.  I want to be surprised.There is some guy here who wrote a SF novel and sold it for a few bitcoins.  You could do the same. Well, if you want to write a story that would be both erotic and bitcoin related, you could imagine the story of the first ever hooker accepting bitcoins. Yeah there is a problem.Right now in the LREUR book there are matching orders at 0.27 LEUR/BTC but nothing happens.PS.  I tried to reedit my order and I got this : Easier said than done. Am I missing something here or what ?  All I see is a childish drawing.  What's going on here ? The story about people living in internet cafes is scary. thks I've just noticed that the auction says (in "shipping conditions") :"Buyer pays shipping expenses, international shipping".I don't understand what this mean exactly, but I think that's a mistake I've made.  I will pay shipping, but it would be more accurate to say that shipping expense will be included in the selling price.Anyway, it seems I can't modify the auction to say "Seller pays..."    Biddingond, could you make the modif please? One email should be enough.  Why should we make so much efforts in order to give money to someone ?This guy is far from stupid.   He's perfectly capable of understanding what bitcoin is and how it works.  If he's not, then he's not so smart and I don't care about this guy, nor am I willing to give him anything. Indeed. Haven't heard of such a crazy idea.   Anyway, imo unless we're talking about a name-address style authentication, there is nothing to worry about. It's indeed an important symbolic time. Maybe you should post a md5sum of your bitcoin tarball, if this can reassure you.Here is mine, which I downloaded December, 13th :67c0d4a5c7310a94ee1ed8b2effa22cb  bitcoin-0.3.19-linux.tar.gzAnd here is the sha256, in case you're paranoïd enough not to trust md5   :59e9caf30db34e6a5a86569c07c34305b4c4eae4e3f9b7757aaecc02fba83583  bitcoin-0.3.19-linux.tar.gz
Ok so bitcoin is Moon compliant.  What about Mars ? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the longer is the delay, the greater is the likelyhood of a double spending. Has this currency hyperinflated zimbabwean style or something ? You can also email him a link to this thread, in case he doesn't know about bitcoin yet  Ahh I think you're right.  My bad. I'm not sure you need a worm hole.I think a large entangled set of photons would do.   But however large the number of photons would be, you could only send a finite amount of data.  But it might be enough if you plan on coming back on Earth some times to times (every century or so).  Or if you accept visits from Earth.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement Yeah, and what about we let people who like inflation use an inflationic currency, and let the others use an other kind of currency, hum ?What do you think of that, fergalish ?  You like paper worthless money ?  Good for you.  Personnaly I'll stick to gold and bitcoins.What I mean is that with current IT technology it should be easy to have many currencies cohabitate.  Currency conversion should take seconds so that it should be easy to enter a dollar only accepting shop and instantanously convert bitcoins in dollars in order to pay the merchand. I don't know about what happen in your country guys, but here in France there is something funny about commitees.Most of time commitees are just stupid waste of public money and nothing very good comes out of it.But if by any chance something interesting or pertinent comes out of it, the government puts the report in a drawer and makes sure it doesn't lead to any actual measures.  There was a famous Pebereau report about our public debt for instance.  It was wonderfully ignored by the government.http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapport_P%C3%A9bereau_sur_la_dette_publique I use w3m so I had to wait a few seconds to see the pic.When I finally got to see it, let me tell you that I was quite disappointed. Indeed, with QC we won't use DSA, we'll just use quantum cryptography, which will be much better than prime numbers based cryptography.I guess it will then be easy to create a quantic cryptocurrency.  Is there a quantum computing version of proof-of-work ?But anyway so far this is just science-fiction.  We might as well talk about space tourism to Alpha Centauri. Hum...  Interesting thread.However, this is too a serious subject.  We should create a commitee to discuss about it. Yes.   But pretty much also for everything you consider safe on the internet. Well, I don't have a mobile phone (or at least none with an active SIM card).   Yet, I'm still breathing.I don't get it.  Do you actually whish you lived in Huxley's world ?Most people here think that personal gain doesn't have to be at the expense of others.  We beleive free market is a win-win game.  Most of the things I use in my every day life come from free market, i.e. from people wanting to reach personal gain.  I'm thankful to them.F.cking prisonner dilemma, I always forget about it.  Nah, I don't see it as important as you seem to think.  Yes, cooperation is usefull.  But please let people make their own associations and decide how and with whom they want to cooperate.  Forced cooperation is not cooperation, it's slavery.If they have no money then money has become useless and people will use an other one.  It's just an accounting tool, it's not real wealth, damned it !  Think about this.PS. The very success of bitcoin could prove this point.  We're not happy with national currencies, so we're using a new one.So   Some people kill themselves too.  It's not because some people do silly or desperate things that I should copy them. Oh sorry I had you confused with talkinrock There are many reasons why someone could make an early bid.One of them is that he doesn't want to wait the very last minute and be outbidded by someone who has a program such as yours  So it makes sense to bid to the max amount you are willing to pay and just forget about it until the auction is finished. Are you arranged by Duke Ellington ?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YKWKIfEN8Y Chill out, man. Be aware that the seller can end the auction at any time if he's happy with the current bidding. OMG I had missed that part.  Yeah I know about this kind of emergence of complexity out of a large number of small simple entities.  Very interesting stuffs.But I am not an ant, nor am I a brain cell or a DNA molecule.  An ant would immediately give its life for its queen, just because it will blindely obey olfactive orders.  I won't.  Maybe it's because I am diploïd, and not haploïd.  Maybe it's because I have a bigger brain, and thus I don't obey simple chemical and olfactive signals.I don't consider myself as a part of a larger organisation that I would value more than my own existence.  Call me selfish if you want, I don't care.Please feel free to cut your arm and give it to society if you think it's better for human kind as a whole.  But don't expect people to be as fool as you are. I very much doubt so.  I don't see how anyway.   To me if somehow the amount of money in circulation decreases, because of hoarding from a few people, then there is deflation and thus falling prices.  Then people can buy again with whatever money they have left.I wasn't quite serious.   It was rather ironic.Yeah, but I don't remember anything about policemen beating people to force them to shop.I'm not advocating for removing cooperation from society.  Not at all.   Is it possible that you think the state is the only kind of social organisation ?
that's much better indeed  I know there are still 9 days left but come'on, 106 BTC ?You can do better than that, guys. Do you mean we'll be able to make EUR/LRUSD, LREUR/LRUSD and LREUR/EUR orders ? Does it work if you try to encrypt the file yourself from the command line ?This should be easy to debug, just try different things. Yeah, margaritaville is indeed quite a smart South Park episode. I'm not russian but I'll give you a few bitcoin cents. I think the keynesian's point of view is the one of a farmer.  Sure, a farm would be a mess if cows were free to do what they want, and if chickens could just wander everywhere they want.But we are not cows, nor chickens, damned it. I don't agree at all.  This has been discussed many times on this forum.All money is a debt from society to its owner.  Thus, someone who hoards money without actually spending it, is actually freeing society from this debt.  There is nothing wrong in that.This 2% target comes out from nothing.  It is actually a theft of increasing productivity which should normally make prices reduce.You don't have to give people any incentive to spend money whatsoever.  Who are you to tell them what they should do ?  If they want to spend money only for what they think is absolutely necessary, it is their right.  Don't you believe in freedom at all ?Why don't you just have police beat them in order to force them to go shopping ?  It would be much simpler. Thanks for that.  Just read the introduction chapter and I like it.  I like when he says, for instance : Hum...  selling funded mybitcoin accounts is a neat idea.  It could be used for my project of setting physical meetings for bitcoin exchanges. Concurrence.  Free market.  Offer and demand.What I mean is that bitcoin allows all miners to compete as far as their fees are concerned.  Hopefully this free market approach should reduce mining fees.Am I right ? Please do so.  I won't buy such a currency, but I think it is important that it exists, only to get rid of people complaining about constant aggregate aspect of bitcoin.Indeed I forgot to mention that you might use a different version number.   Possibly also a different port, but to me it doesn't seem absolutely necessary.  Please also use a different name than "bitcoin".  "Timecoin" could do, as suggested by FreeMoney, for instance. Well, that's a relief.  Because I'm still too lazy to work on this right now.  It will be done, but not today. In the very unlikely event of the lack of bitcoins in the economy becoming a real problem, we'll just start a new block chain.PS.  Also, let me make it easier for you.  If you really want a cryptocurrency with 50 units reward for eternity, all you have to do is to change this function into main.cpp :From this :Code:int64 GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64 nFees){    int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;    // Subsidy is cut in half every 4 years    nSubsidy >>= (nHeight / 210000);    return nSubsidy + nFees;}to this :Code:int64 GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64 nFees){    int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;    // Uncomment this line if you want    // Subsidy to be cut in half every 4 years    // nSubsidy >>= (nHeight / 210000);    return nSubsidy + nFees;}That's it.  Normally your program should run fine with other people having done the same modification. I'm adding a feature that will allow anyone to add its own asset in my bitcoin asset exchange plateform.  I'm too lazy to finish it today, but I promess it will be done for tomorrow.http://grondilu.freeshell.org/brokerage.cgi I agree with the scond part.  It's not a competitor at all. It's rather a first step towards bitcoin and private currencies. I think that too but we should not discourage people for mining.  The more miners there are, the stronger is the network. kakigarden.com redirects to a facebook page.Why should I read anything more from someone who does that ? For some reason the file could not be encrypted.Has the file /tmp/wallet20110124-04-46 been created by bitcoind backupwallet ?I suspect backupwallet doesn't accept full pathnamesPS:  Here is a proposal to make the script more robust :Code:#!/bin/bashTS=$(date "+%Y%m%d-%H-%M")WALLET=/tmp/wallet${TS}WALLET_E=/tmp/wallet${TS}.cryptif    echo -n making backup...    bitcoind backupwallet $WALLET     [[ ! -s "$WALLET" ]]then echo failedelif    echo done    echo -n encrypting....    ! gpg -r myusername --output $WALLET_E --encrypt $WALLETthen echo failedelif    echo done    echo -n copying to distant server...    ! scp $WALLET_E user@myserver.org:~/wallets/then echo failedelse echo donefirm -f $WALLET $WALLET_E The banker is the closest person from the money supply.  His salary is paid directly with it.  Again, a financial director from an investment bank told it to me himself : "stay near from the tap".
Well, if you believe in gold, please consider making a bid for my 20FF gold coin auction on biddingpond.com http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=246 Most of the time when I read an article or watch a video about how terrible is inflation to economy, I kind of feel that there's something missing.Usually the author insists on how much the price of goods can have increased in, say, fourty years, and therefore how futile it is to save money.  But who saves money for fourty years anyway ?  I mean, there are certainly many better long term savings than cash.  Nobody saves large amounts of money for that long.To me, the most obvious problem with inflation is the theft of value from the money printers.  And this occurs in real time, not with a 40 years delay.  When a banker receive some freshly printed money from a central bank, this money looks exactly identical to currently existing money.  Thus, this guy can obtain some good or services, ie real value, for this money, although this money has been obtained with absolutely no counterparting real value, apart from the pressing of a button.When some banker wants his shoes to be polished, all he has to do is to print money and to give it to a shoeshiner.   The shoeshiner is immediately stolen, although he will probably realize that in a few years, when he witnesses inflation.  This, is what's outrageous with inflation.This is not rethoric.   I used to work in an investment bank and I was personnaly advised not to seek a job in an other sector because it was important to stay "near from the tap".   Money supply was compared to a tap from which it was crucial not to be too far away.  Do we really need a better explanation of how corrupted is this system ? That's quite a clever point of view.  Indeed, if something better than bitcoin comes up, it will be great news. Je vends un napoléon sur biddingpond :http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=2462 semaines d'enchères. Just started a two weeks auction for a french gold coin on biddingpond.http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=246 I personnaly like what Satoshi wrote in P2Pfoundation (http://p2pfoundation.net/bitcoin): My stuff is back on line :http://grondilu.freeshell.org/brokerage.cgiI've just tested and it works.I still have to add the possibility for anyone to add his own asset, though.  But meanwhile, tell me if you want a testshare. Kiba, do you do some 3D modeling (blender and stuffs like that) ? I seriously doubt that homophobes want to kill all gay people, as nazies wanted to eradicate jews.But this is a useless debate.  It brings nothing but anger.  We have much more interesting things to talk about on this forum.  Or at least people who want to continue this should go in "off-topic". Using steganography, you could put child porn pretty much anywhere, for instance in Wikimedia.  It would be much more efficient than using bitcoin. Yeah, when people don't agree about something, at some point ther can be blood.But at least no one pretends to be more legitimate than the other.  Nor will they use ressources from unconcerned people to fight.  Nor will they force people to fight for them.  And so on...Anarchy doesn't prevent war.  But democracy doesn't either.   Democracy actually instutitionnalize war : you have to pay taxes to send soldiers to some wars you are absolutely not concerned about, or wars that you even disapprove.   How is that better ?At least those guys from downstream and upstream decided to fight from their own free will. Ne gravas.Kaj al soc.culture.esperanto ?  Cxu vi tie skribis ? I just found out about this thread.The 21 millions problem ?   Again ?Just see the bitcoin as a measure unit.  Does it make any difference if you get one ton of gold or one million grams ? Ripple focuses way too much on currencies, loans and stuffs like that.I just want something that deals with stocks paying dividends in bitcoins. Let me also remind everyone that the source code is already available.http://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-toolsSo if anyone wants to host it himself, please feel free to do so.I want this stuff to exist, whether it is me or anyone else who host it doesn't matter much. Just give me a few days and I will show you my bash script in action.http://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools I suspect most people here use linux on their personnal desktop.  I'd just like to see if I'm right.PS.  Personnaly I'm on Debian GNU/linux Sid (aptosid) Pff.  I shouldn't have written that anyway.  I don't want to make any ennemies on this forum.  It's pointless. There has to be a solution to that.  I have one in mind, but I'm not sure you want to hear it. I'm in the process of getting more user priviledges on freeshell.org.Hopefully that should permit me to host my bitcoin stock exchange plateform.
Après réflexion, ça ferait quand même pas mal de boulot.Ca n'a pas bcp d'intérêt si ça n'est pas très réactif.  Genre, une fois que le client a consituté son panier d'achats, il n'a pas envie d'attendre trois heures pour que quelqu'un change les bitcoins en euros et fasse la vrai commande sur le site d'origine.Donc sauf à trouver le moyen d'automatiser le processus, ça me parait pas viable.A moins bien sûr de vendre ses propres produits, mais là c'est pas le même business que celui que j'évoquais. Il y a des tas de sociétés qui proposent de faire ses courses en ligne : houra.fr, coursengo, ...Donc c'est tout un catalogue de produits le plus souvent alimentaire qui sont livrés à domicile.Ce serait cool d'avoir un service de courtage qui servirait de passerelle vers ces services.En gros tu passes ta commande en bitcoins sur bitcoin-coursengo-courtage.fr, et eux font la commande équivalente en euros sur coursengo, en donnant ton addresse pour la livraison.Un peu sur le modèle de la livraison de pizza déjà évoqué sur le forum. Ok, thanks.  The code is on http://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools.Clients will also have to download bc_key.c, a C program to export bitcoin private keys from the wallet into a PEM openssl format.It's on http://github.com/grondilu/bc_keyBasically the plateform requires the following files :* base58.sh : a set of bash functions to manipulate bitcoin address (pretty much a translation of base58.c in Satoshi's code).  Normally nobody needs to use that directly.  It is just used by other files.* bc-sign.sh : a shell script that uses bc_key to sign any document using a bitcoin address  (only clients need that, not the server)* brokerage.cgi :  the main CGI script, which allow a client to transfer some amount of some asset from a bitcoin address to an other* brokerage.csv :  the full transaction list (which can easily be aggregated in a spreadsheet to determin current balances)* brokerage.tar :  an archive which contains public bitcoin keys, signatures for each transaction, and documents describing assets What about just getting rid of Android and join the MeeGo project ? Does it ?   Like Freenet ?If so, I really don't want to use it.  I don't like java. It seems to be a nice idea but the tough part for them will be to maintain an exchange rates.  To me their current rates seem to be way too generous.  They obviously give arbitrage opportunities here. +1 Nice little story  Well, I guess you're right.  Thanks for reminding me why I dislike Androïd. I whish I knew more GUI programming, because to me everything could be easily done with a bit of shell scripting.   openssl would do all encryption/digest/signing you might need, just as in my bitcoin-bash-tools.  There is also a qrencode program for encoding a QR code, and zbar-tools for scanning.  Obexftp would handle bluetooth communications.  Everything else could be done withh the bitcoind command line client itself.  So all we need is a GUI scripting language that could organize all this.  So : is there a port of zenity on Androïd ??  lol Funny thing is :  Isn't that possible, with modern technology, to give a proof of the presence of some asset in real time ?I mean for instance with the storage of gold, isn't it possible to have some kind of a web cam, continuously filming the gold stock?  I know there should be a way to prove that the shooting is real (not recorded or something), but come on, there is certainly some technical way to prove that the shooting is actually the real stuff.I'm pretty sure that, with a little bit of ingenuosity, one can find something similar for other kinds of assets, even non material ones. I seriously doubt that.  Being homeless is certainly not fun.PS:  Also, anyone who uses bitcoin owns *a lot* of keys in his wallet. See what they do with gold.  An ETF manager receives a phone call from an auditor :"- Hi, I want to make an appointement for an audit.  I will come with my team tomorow morning.- Ok, no problem."Then the ETF manager calls his buddy and says that he ugently need to borrow one ton of gold for one day.  If it's too soon, the guy calls the auditor and says :"- Oh I'm sorry, we actually have some difficulties right now, can we schedule this for next week instead ?- Well, yes I guess we can.  But that's the last time you delay this, ok ?- sure.  I promess."As long as an auditor doesn't have the keys of the companies he's supposed to audit, I'll consider he's useless. You're kidding, right ? A third party just moves the trust from one place to an other.  It doesn't solve anything.PS.  I'm wrong.  It actually improves the situation a bit.  But it's far from perfect.  And it adds costs : you have to pay the auditor.  I'm not sure it always worth it. Non Gimp n'est vraiment pas fait pour le vectoriel.  C'est plutôt Inkscape qu'il faut utiliser. I like this one I'm not sure you meant exactly that, though. It's been edited on the first post of this thread, FreeMoney.I've sucessfully downloaded the second chapter. Well, maybe biddingpond will be to bitcoin what eBay was to PayPal.
I liked the first chapter and I want to buy the second.  But you should give each buyer a different bitcoin address, otherwise you can"t know for sure who actually paid.Also, have you read my thread about selling information ?  You could set up a price for the whole book (say 100BTC for instance), and publish it to everyone once the amount has been raised. Lol.  Mrs Ben Ali doesn't buy gold.  She just goes to the central bank of her country, and she demands immediate delivery of gold bullions. Have you tried to installed the previous version ?  Have you tried to launch bitcoin with a brand new .bitcoin directory ? I use debian GNU/linux.I should indeed look into i2p, but somehow I can't find any clear straitforward howto for installation on debian. Indeed, the decree doesn't have to come from a government.  It can come from people. Few days ago I was talking with some left-anarchists on IRC (#ranarchism on freenode).We were having the same old debate between right and left anarchists about capitalism and money.  Somehow, this debate wasn't as sterile as I thought, for it allowed me to clarify my mind about what money is.Bitcoins are truly worthless, apart from their properties which makes it useful as a money.  I've always suspected the same about gold, but with gold it's not that clear, for gold does have some use in jewelry and industry.  So, I was a bit uncomfortable with the absolute "fiat" aspect of bitcoins.Anyway, the interesting part began when one of the guys asked me the following question :- Name one thing that you feel passionnate about, and that you couldn't do in a left-anarchist society.I thought it was quite an interesting way to ask things, but after a few seconds, I just answered :- Eating, for one.  I just don't see how I could earn my life in a communist world.Then the guy described me his kind of ideal society,  how I would have to farm 30 minutes a day to get some food for instance.  Now, I don't know exactly what I feel passionnate about (or more precisely, this is my business), but I know I don't feel passionate about farming.  I also don't have any skills for that.  Workers have to be specialised in what they are doing.  I think specialisation has been a characteristic of human economics activities since neolithics, right ?Anyway, at this point this was not the anwser I had in mind.  I felt it more in the lazy approach.  So I asked :- What if, for some reason, I don't feel like farming and I'm willing to pay someone to do the job for me ?Then the guy denied the very existence of money so I had to imagine I pay the guy with gold.  At least the guy can not deny the existence of this metal.  However, he couldn't imagine I could find someone who would accept some gold.  "Gold is worthless", he said.  And other sentences of the same kind.  I had to say : "maybe gold is worthless, but maybe my worker just doesn't hate farming as I do.  Maybe he's just bored, or maybe he even enjoy farming.  Also, perhaps he wants to offer his women a gold ring."I think I was going on the wrong path here.  Now, here is my idea of how money arise from an anarchist society.In order to have some food, you have to work.  If you don't, you don't get any food and the communauty rejects you.   Therefore, the communauty has to remember, somehow, who worked and who didn't work.  They could, for instance, write this in a book.   In front of each name, they write a boolean saying "did work for his food", "did not work for his food".  Even if this book exists only in people's head, it still exists.  But it's obviously more efficient if it's written down on paper.  This is the beginning of money :  a symbolic proof of work.Now, a boolean data is not very good either.  One could expect people to eat more if they worked more.  So, it's more efficient to write a number in front of each name, instead of a boolean.  That's already something which is very difficult to do if people just have to use a "mental book".  Numeric data is tricky to memorize, not even mentionning that we're talking about a large number of numbers (for a large communauty of workers).  Denying the usefullness of a real physical book, is just as silly as denying the usefullness of writing against just speech.If you have a book with quantified values representing amounts of work, or value, you just have everything that makes money what money is.  You can transfer value by exchanging values, providing the two people concerned agree to it.  You can do pretty much any thing you can do with money, but there is a drawback :  it's centralised.  Only one person can modify it at a time.  Usually it's the job (a specialised job) of a specific person called the book keeper.  The communauty has to trust him not to write down phony numbers, nor attribute himself some work he hasn't done.So the next idea is decentralisation.  Every unit in the book could be represented by some token.  Whether it is a piece of paper, a precious stone, whatever.  It just have not to be faked easily.  It is just a way to decentralise and distribute the book's units.  It's nothing but an accounting tool.That's it.  That's how I see money now.  A pure conventional decentralized accounting tool.And as such, it doesn't have to have any value per se.  It just has to permit to represent a limited amount correctly.  It has to be divisible (as numbers are), limited in quantity (each number is supposed to represent a fraction of the wealth produced by the community, therefore the total amount has to be limited), and it should not be easily faked (otherwise anyone could claim any amount). Your stuff seems too complicated for me.   Apart from a ssh access to a standard unix-like environnement, I'd be lost. Well, ok then. Are you trying to sell some of your virtual hosts on the Super Dimension Fortress (sdf.org) ?If so, this is not cool, man. Well, it's not that great once you make a zoom on specific areas.  There is only one node in London, for instance.I actually think that those marks are way too big on the global mark.  This gives a false feeling. Ayé j'ai réussi à générer la vidéo en qualité normale:http://www.xtranormal.com/watch/8271874 I don't like talking on SDF actually.Anyway, I can't use freeshell.org for this project, since it has only openssl 0.9.8q and I don't have arpa rights that I may need to compile a more recent version.  It's also possible that even with arpa rights I couldn't compile.  What can you suggest ?I'm on IRC right now, on freenode #bitcoin-dev Can't we do this here ? OMG yes we could create a "chesscoin" :  it would be a cryptocurrency where the proof of work would be the victory in a quick chess tournament between all nodes of the network.In order to have the tournament last only ten minutes, the speed of each games could be adjusted to the number of players.This would be so cool. Ouais je me suis aperçu de l'erreur pour l'addresse bitcoin.  Corrigé sur mon site mais pas sur Dailymotion.  J'ai mis un erratum en commentaire.Pour le rôle des genres, vu le sex ratio sur ce forum, je crois que le casting actuel est approprié  Le rendu français de la synthèse vocale sur ce site est étonnamment bon.Du coup j'ai fait une petite vidéo sur bitcoin :http://grondilu.freeshell.org/bitcoin-fr.flvhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/xglotj_bitcoin-fr_tech Yes.  We have disgressed a bit.   And you don't need a graphic card to play chess anyway. Thanks for letting me know about this site.I've just read the article about Simpson's paradox.  I didn't know about it, but it confirmed my feelings about medecine making poor use of statistics as a inference tool. Yes you can.  When playing chess on internet, you can never assume your opponent is a human being. lol
If for some reason Satoshi doesn't want to go, I'm ok to take his place I could use some time on the bea... on conferences. I don't think I need much bandwith.  I doubt I'll have many clients at the beginning.   I need a web server which accepts bash CGI script, and which have tools such as bc, dc, sed, awk, xxd.  And also a recent version of openssl.  I know openssl 1.0.0c works fine.  openssl 0.9.8q doesn't. I know from experience that strong players usually don't accept to play against weak players.   You need some incentive to convince them. Anyway I have already written a bash CGI that does what I wanted.Basically the owner of an asset is identified by a bitcoin address.   Thanks to dirtyfilthy, it is possible to extract a bitcoin private key from the wallet, and thus to sign a transaction using openssl.  Using a bitcoin address as an identifier makes it much easier for stocks (dividends just have to be paid on this bitcoin address).Unfortunately I have to wait until I get a better web hosting solution to show it to the world.The source code is already available on github though :http://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools Money is a way to transfer value.You give a service or goods to someone, and you receive money which you expect to be able to give back later in exchange for some other good or service.  It's nothing but a convention between people.  Therefore, all money you own is some kind of a debt society has towards you.If you lose money, you relieve society from this debt.   It's just as if what you did to obtain this money, you did it for free.I don't see how people working for free could hurt society. On my website, I have a formula for my offer :  the smaller is my stock, the higher is my price.I don't know if that's the best solution, but it works and it makes sense economically. If you don't mind I'll ask you my questions here.  There's no reason why it should not be public.I don't like OT very much.  Seems quite complicated right now.  But I will take a deeper look into it when it implements stock markets.  According to the main page, it should come soon, right ? Those guys have dared make a live performance in front of keynesian economists.The text is an other one, quite good as well imo.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k7ob438hk0 There is a bounty for an animated video describing and explaining how bitcoin works.You could work on that. Well I have to agree.  It wouldn't be much interesting for human only players.  But it could be a nice way for chess programmers to compete with one another. Impressive. Just bet very small amounts if you are afraid to lose.  You may lose some bitcoins, but it might worth the chess lesson.There is no cheating as long as you don't pretend you are a human being.  Kasparov himself is an advocate of "advanced chess", where players are free to be assisted by computers.And even a computer-only network would be interesting (for it could give some nice chess games).  Chess programers could compete for bitcoins and it might still be fun. Anyway I doubt something like bitcoin could have come sooner.It needed the financial crisis to happen.  I'm personnaly convinced that Satoshi wrote his code after the "Too big to fail" thing.And if not, at least IMO many of bitcoin early adopters came into being interested in it after having been disgusted by financial bail-outs. Indeed. I've just downloaded "chessd", a free chess server used by "Free Internet Chess Server"  (www.freechess.org).I'm wondering how difficult it would be to modify it, so that players would play for bitcoins.  Basically my idea is that each player would have a bitcoin address in their name, and would have to put bitcoins in a public clearing address (owned by the server) before accepting a game.  At the end of a game, the server would give the bitcoins to the winner (or to both players in case of a draw).Here is the protocol document in the source code (http://sourceforge.net/projects/chessd/files/chessd): Well, from players obviously.  Basically players agree to a certain amount before playing.  Could be a different amount for each of them, depending on their relative strengh.For instance, a 2000 ELO player could engage 100 BTC for a game against a 2500 ELO who would engage only 10 BTC.  The winner takes the engagement of the loser.The system could work with a clearing process, or be based only on reputation of players (which would require that each player use a key pair cryptography).I've just checked into my debian repo and I've seen a program called "cutechess".  It might do the job after modification.PS.  Actually when I think about it, the ELO rating system would be useless if we can play for bitcoins.  Because you're very unlikely a weak player if you are willing to play only small amounts for each games.   Strong players would be recognized by their self-confidence, and therefore by the amount of bitcoins they are willing to engage. Hi, this is an old thread, but anyway...I'm too a poor player (about 1600 ELO) to play for money.But I like the chess game and I think it might be interesting if good players (both humans and computers) could have a plateform to play for bitcoins.Some pretty good games could emerge from a purly electronic bitcoin chess tournament.It could also be a great intencive for programmers to developp a good chess programm. I know there is already a famous game tournament plateform (ICS I think).  It should be easily modified to male players play for bitcoins. I'm thinking of a bitcoin chess plateform.   There are numerous electronic chess tournament system, for both humans and machines.   It wouldn't be very hard to modify it so that players and computers could play for bitcoins. Ho that's good  
That's indeed how they would proceed.   Just like with drugs.  They have policemen disguise themselves into drug addicts, and they try to record an actual drug sell.I actually think that war against drug will be a good model for a future war against bitcoin. Yes I do assume it is voluntary.  That's the definition of free trade.If a farmer is forced off his land, then this land is not "his".   He was working on a land he doesn't own.  Working in a city doesn't improve his situation, but it doesn't make it fundamently worse either. I have modified dirtyfilthy's program so that it can export the whole wallet in an ascii format.http://github.com/grondilu/bc_keyJust use "ALL" instead of a particular bitcoin address.Be careful with this command, for it shows all your private keys in clear !  In particular, you should never redirect the output of this program to a file.  Unless you use an encrypted file system.Anyway, I'll add a few bash functions that can be used to create a new address, sign a transaction, and so on...Here is a function to create a new address already :Code:#!/bin/bash. base58.shwallet="$HOME/.bitcoin-bash/wallet.dat"generateNewAddress() {    privkey="$(openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey)"    openssl ec -pubout <<<"$privkey" 2>&- |    publicKeyToAddress 2>&- |    if [[ -f "$wallet" ]]    then        tee -a "$wallet"  # storing and showing the address        printf "%s" "$privkey" >> "$wallet"  # storing the private key    else        # showing address and private key        cat        printf "%s" "$privkey"    fi} Cooperation and improvment of each other condition is just what free volontary trade is about.Why do want it to be "at the expense of others" ?   Free trade is volontary : it's a win-win game. Guys, I've been knowing about bitcoin for a few months now, and I'm still fascinated by this stuff, and how well everything is going so far.To me it's like I'm witnessing the realisation of what would otherwise been described as an utopia.  This is an internatinal money, which emerged without any support from any governement, with no publicity from any big corporation whatsoever, only thanks to the smartnest of a few people.I'm so glad I can contribute to this.  This is great.Thank you Satoshi, wherever you are. This is ... amazing.   This kind of reconciliates me with human kind, although of course I guess Somalia is still in terrible situation, but to know that anarchy has actually improved the economics and even security there, is just a great news. lol.  I hadn't read that far.  Thanks for pointing it out.  You saved me a few precious seconds of my time  I don't know much about US tax code, but my guess is that you should pay taxes only if you ever sell your earned bitcoins into US dollars. Please, keep in mind that bitcoin is less than two years old.  And though it has reached quite a success despite the fact that it is not supported by any government.  No wonder it is not accepted in local stores yet.Give it time. I confirm.  If it wasn't free I'd use the marketplace bitcoin forum. Exactly.  Also, there is no way you can prevent this usage from happening, with any money. You challenged me to explain to a local marchant what a bitcoin bank note would be.  I answered you.  The fact that dollars are defined differently is an other matter.  On a bitcoin bank note we would write :  "This note can be redeemed against [XX] bitcoins in [some place]". Easy.  It will be written on it.  A bank note usually clearly states what it is. True.  Especially since that's what a bank note is supposed to be after all :  an IOU.  It could easily be backed by bitcoins.  A bank note is not a currency.  It's a method of payment. The ability for a currency to be transfered physically with no electricity, no computer, just "from hand to hand", is very good indeed.  And indeed you can't do that with bitcoins.But the thing is that the ability to be transfered instantanously in very long distance with almost no cost is just about as good.   You can't do that with physical bank notes.There are things you can do with bitcoins, that you can't with bank notes, and reciprocally.  Both currencies are "portable", but in different spaces :  physical space for bank notes, cyberspace for bitcoins.Now you can deny cyberspace has as big an economic importance than physical space if you want.  I don't. I think you are talking about liquidity here.I'm not sure about the meaning of the word portability in english, but from what I understand of it, bitcoin does very well apply.  In a different manner than cash though, but it does apply. I didn't know this guy but I like the way he speaks.Check out what he says about money in this video for instance :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2690Fy0sM8He makes a good sum up of characteristics for good money :* durability* divisibility* recognisibility* portability* scarcityNotice that bitcoin fullfills all of them. By the way BiddingPond, I kind of got used to pick a block number as a deadline for auctions.It might be cool if sellers could chose this as an option. Normal.  There is no magic :  you can't use key pair cryptography properly if you don't physically own the machine where your private key is stored.Hopefully this will change in a few years when Smartcard readers will be on most computers and/or smartphones.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenPGP_card He hasn't shown any life sign since december 15th.  We have good reasons to worry.Has anyone heard from him recently ?PS.  I also have to point out that his disappearance occured only a few days after the wikileaks article mentionning bitcoin ...
Oh, please, you can't get rid of the observer here, otherwise it doesn't make any sense.  The concept of value doesn't mean anything if there is not at least one human being involved.  Same for colors, sounds, and so on.  If you want to think things like this then it's a bit like the old lame debate about a tree falling in a forest where there's noone to hear it.   I doubt anybody has ever tried to suggest a notion of value as intrinsic as the atoms the ice-cream is made of.  I'm pretty sure people mean intrinsic value as opposed to trade value.If you deny the existence of at least one observer, then the world itself doesn't exist. One day left. Bah c'est vrai que bash peut être un peu dûr à lire quand on connait pas.  Il est un peu comme perl, de ce coté là.On a tendance à ignorer bash vu qu'il est dispo d'office en ligne de commande et que du coup on peut croire qu'il ne sert qu'à ça.  Mais mine de rien c'est un excellent langage de programmation. Maybe we should make him take a Turing test. Yes it can.  I can enjoy a tasty ice-cream.  It has some value for me.  This value is due to chemical and nutritic properties of the ice-cream, which are intrinsic to the ice-cream.   It's a subjective intrinsic value.Now I can desire cigarettes.  Not because I could smoke them .  I don't smoke.  But I can desire to own some, because I know that a lot people smoke and would do many things for cigarettes in dark times.  It's extrinsic value.But if I was to reformulate my initial question in order to avoid this debate, I would ask :"Should money have value other than trade value ?" Why doesn't he just title his article "the fallacy of objective value" ?? Good.  I hope your friends generate with their graphic card as you do. True.   Governments are powerless in cypherspace.  There are no guns nor jails there.   Force in cypherspace is mathematics, and thanks to free software, it belongs to whoever wants to use it. It seems to me we should try to focus on promoting bitcoin to teenagers.First, young people are more open-minded than old established people.  They also don't have any savings so they are not personnaly invested in any national currency.Second, young people are the future of the world.  Success of bitcoin will depend on them.Finally, teenagers like video games.  Thus they own graphic cards, and I'm sure they'd be happy to use them to mine if we can convince them that they will be able to buy video games with the bitcoins they will produce.  Whether we show them the plateform exchanges, or we provide them a bitcoin video game shop (we should work on that).  I guess there is also amazon gateway that could allow them to buy video games with bitcoins.I don't know any young people, nor do I contribute to any video-game forum/website.  But if you do, please spread the message that bitcoin exists and might be a way for them to buy video games easily. Ok, my bad. Just wondering.  What if I bought a second-hand PS3 ?  By doing so I haven't signed any contract with Sony.  I only bought some machine to a guy. Note aussi que le "truc de grondilu" est libre et open-source.  Tu peux mettre le code en téléchargement sur ton site, comme ça n'importe qui possédant des bitcoins peut les vendre facilement par la poste ou par virement bancaire.  En gros il suffit d'avoir un serveur web qui accepte les scripts CGI génériques. +1But when you put the word "entropy" in a sentence, you make it sound much more clever.   Just compare "I'm cleaning my room" to "I'm reducing the entropy of my room". -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)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F7zV-----END PGP MESSAGE----- Well, I'm pretty sure that if you remove nicotine from tabacco, people would enjoy it much less.I don't see what misunderstandings you are talking about.  Some people believe in objective theory of value, if that's what you mean.  But almost no one here does, I think.  It's a completely different matter.The point is, even in a subjective theory of value, the question of the intrinsic value of money has some pertinence, because it is not the same if you chose to use a commodity (such as wheat for instance) as a currency,  or if you use a completely abstract, otherwise worthless, unit of account such as bitcoin.  This problem has interesting issues per se. Come on...  Tabacco has intrinsic value.  Because many people like smoking.If you are one of these person, then for you tabacco has value because there is an INtrinsic property INSIDE tabacco (actually probably nicotine) that you like.  Such a value doesn't rely on anything EXterior to the tabacco leaf.Now you consider a $100 bank note.  It has some value, due to the fact that many people will do some stuffs to have some.  Those people are OUTSIDE of the bank note.  Thus this value is EXtrinsic.So to sum up, whether a money should have or not intrinsic value depends on whether or not you might desire it for itself, if you were alone on a desert island, for instance.The fact that value is subjective has nothing to do with this.  It's *orthogonal*. Damned it I thought we agreed on that.  Intrinsic/Extrinsic has nothing to do with subjective/objective. I want to think that he is just too busy coding and planning for world domination  lol.  Indeed !The guy is talking about bitcoin, without even knowing it  Well, until I find an hosting alternative, I can open an hidden service using my personal computer.    It is not always connected to internet, though.http://3p3y4pqhrgpxoqw6.onion/brokerage.cgiThis is my personnal laptop, so don't try anything funny, ok ?
When you become a real linux geek, you'll use mutt and you'll find out how easy it is to use with GPG. Comme tu dis  Ouai en fait j'ai jamais réussi à la voir.  Les modérateurs ont peut-être changé d'avis à la dernière minute.  Bah... pas grâve.En vectoriel ce serait mieux amha.Sinon, où as-tu appris l'existence des bitcoins si c'est pas indiscret ? Well yes, I buy and I sell.    But I've been selling for only about two weeks. IMHO, you shouldn't care that much about definitions.  In french, we don't even have a proper name for "money".  Most usual word is "argent", which is the same as the word for silver.  The word "monnaie" existe but is also used for "change".  We use "devise" for currency, but never for money.What I mean is that things exist beyond the name you use to call them.  You both have your idea of what money is.  Why one of you should be wrong ? Do you plan on filming or audio-recording the event ? And have you managed to actually install linux on it ? I don't use accounts much, but UTF-8 would be cool indeed.   (utf-8 is actually always cool) LOLthere are so many websites now that I wonder if we should not create a .btc primary domain.  A .com website would be similar to a .com (business related), but the official money would be bitcoin. Also, I don't believe in this psychological threshold you're talking about.  Maybe it's because I'm a HUGE bitocin fan, but really I trust bitcoin MUCH MORE than I trust euro, dollar or whatever.  I have therefore no problemn in buying bitcoins with so-called "real" money.I'm pretty sure people would easily do the same once they got a fairly good idea of what bitcoin is exactly. Well, my way of answering was a bit rude, I confess it. What do you have against symlinks ? LOL  check out at 37 min.   Very funny part when they explain that sony used ECDSA signatures with a constant "random" number. Yeah I get it.  It's not a bad proposal.  It's just that you asked a question, so I gave you my answer  . Wow davout I guess you have plenty of bitcoins now.  Would you like to buy a gold coin ? I doubt the amount of bitcoins you are willing to pay would worth my precious time.So the answer is "no, thanks". Cool, mon annonce a été acceptée.http://www.leboncoin.fr/collection/166550434.htm I want this stuff to exist, even if I'm not the one who publishes it.  So I've just added it to github :https://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools Hum,  it seems that there is a bug with the installed version of openssl on freeshell.org.  The guys there don't seem much keen on doing anything about it  A command such as :openssl dgst -sha256 -sign <(openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey) -hex <<<testworks fine on my PC but returns an error on my website.I have to find an other place to host my CGI script. Hum...  I should have tested more.  I get an error when trying to transfer a test share to you.Give me some time.
J'avoue être tenté par ton offre.  T'es sérieux ou non ?  Parce que t'as mis un smiley alors... Damn it.By the way, I've added a "test share" which aims only in testing the plateform.If you want one, just post a bitcoin address in this thread. Je viens d'essayer de mettre un napoléon en vente sur leboncoin.fr.Je ne sais pas si le fait de proposer un prix en bitcoin sera accepté par la modération du site.  On verra.Si ça intéresse quelqu'un ici, le prix est de 1000 BTC.  Envoi par lettre suivie si France metropolitaine. It seems to be quite complicated but I guess it's possible.I don't think it would harm the bitcoin network anyway, so go for it. No, I won't give it for such a low price, sorry. Am I missing something or what ?  If you give the smartcard, the only way for the receiver to check that it realy has some value is to proceed to a transfer.  Then the card doesn't have any value anymore.  So what's the point of keeping it ? Yeah but to pay with a smartcard, you don't give the smartcard !  It's a completely dofferent purpose than a monetary token. IMO, you're taking this way too seriously guys.A physical bitcoin is cool, but it's nothing but symbolic.  There is obviously no way to have any physical object store a bitcoin.  Otherwise we wouldn't need bitcoin in the first place.  A physical object can be counterfaited, and if you plan on putting ECDSA keys in it, it can be copied.  And you still have the double spending problem.  And I'm sure there are many other reason why a physical bitcoin can be nothing but some kind of a marketing toy or something alike.Still, I'd like to have one.  Especially if it's solid gold. I will give something when this comes out.  But not 100 BTC. I'm considering selling a 10g mini gold bullion.It's not brand new : it has been bitten a bit but it's still 10g pure gold.I'm planning on making an auction but I might sell it to you directly if you offer me a good price in bitcoin.  If you're in Europe I can use a traceable letter. 5 days to go and highest bid is 105 BTC.I'm sure you can do better than that guys  Would you like to buy a brand new graphic card for mining ?  Or some other ultra-expensive hardware ?  But you don't have enough money ?With my new stock exchange plateform, you could do so quite easily.You just have to walk the following steps :* Write an IPO document describing what you intend to do, pick a name for your company and chose a number of shares for the capital you want to raise.* Send me this document (possibly GnuPG signed), along with a bitcoin address that you own.* Sell your shares pretty much wherever you want :  #bitcoin-otc, marketplace bitcoin forum, biddingpond,...Personnaly I don't mine, for I don't have enough processing power, nor bandwidth.  But I'd gladly put a few bitcoins in a mining company. Ok but where is your public key ? Hum that's interesting.  Ain't that the first ever attempt to use bitcoin as backing for a fiduciary currency ?If so, that's an important initiative.  I hope it will work fine, for paper money is not completely useless  (doesn't require electricity to store or exhange, for instance). Hum...  Why does it seem to me this is a fake ?I guess that's an other reason why we want videos.  Much more difficult to forge. Salut.Je me sens généreux aujourd'hui.  Laisse-nous une addresse et je vais doubler ton stock PS.  Voilà, c'est fait  Hum, I've pledged 100 BTC for this.  Can I change my mind and cancel it ? After a few weeks of work, I finaly release my version of a bitcoin stock exchange plateform.It's kind of a proof of concept, but it's for real, as I have already to owners of two shares (one eBay share and one DRDGold share).Ownership is identified by the bitcoin address where dividends are to be paid.  Nothing else :  no GPG key, no DSA key, nothing but the paiement address for future dividends.The site allows an owner to transfer some shares to an other bitcoin address, and thus to an other person.Once transfer is possible, trading is possible.  But so far I don't offer any book keeping for order.  Trading and negociation must then be handled somewhere else (IRC, forum, biddingpond, whatever...)Making a signature for transfer requires the use of bc_key, written by dirtyfilthy.  I whish this app was added to the main bitcoin client, but I suspect the dev-team is not keen on doing so.The site is open source, so anyone could do exactly the same.That's about it.  Here is the address :http://grondilu.freeshell.org/brokerage.cgi I've added two functions : decodeBase68 and checkBitcoinAddress.I think it might be usefull to check the validity of a bitcoin address in pure bash.Requires "dc", the unix desk calculator.  Few people use this reverse polish notation calcultor but it's much easier to handle in scripts.Code:#!/bin/bash# # Requires bc, dc, openssl, xxd#base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})bitcoinregex="^[$(printf "%s" "${base58[@]}")]{34}$"decodeBase58() {    s=$1    for i in {0..57}    do s="${s//${base58[i]}/ $i}"    done    dc <<< "16o0d${s// /+58*}+f" }encodeBase58() {    # 58 =0x3A    bc <<<"ibase=16; n=${1^^}; while(n>0) { n%3A ; n/=3A }" |    tac |    while read n    do echo -n ${base58[n]}    done}checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -hex |    sed 's/^.* //' |    head -c 8}checkBitcoinAddress() {    if [[ "$1" =~ $bitcoinregex ]]    then        h=$(decodeBase58 "$1")        checksum "00${h::${#h}-8}" |        grep -qi "^${h: -8}$"    else return 2    fi}hash160() {    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -hex |    sed 's/^.* //'}hash160ToAddress() {    printf %34s "$(encodeBase58 "00$1$(checksum "00$1")")" |    sed "y/ /1/"}publicKeyToAddress() {    hash160ToAddress $(    openssl ec -pubin -pubout -outform DER 2>/dev/null |    tail -c 65 |    hash160    )} Now that I have implemented base58 code in bash, I don't even need to connect to blockexplorer Code:#!/bin/bash# # Timestamping program# Returns a valid bitcoin address made from stdin# To timestamp, just send 0.01 BTC to this address## Requires bc, openssl, xxd#base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})EncodeBase58() {    # 58 =0x3A    bc <<<"ibase=16; n=${1^^}; while(n>0) { n%3A ; n/=3A }" |    tac |    while read n    do echo -n ${base58[n]}    done}checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -hex |    cut -d\  -f2 |    sed -r "s/^((..){4}).*/\1/"}Hash160() {    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -hex |    cut -d\  -f2}Hash160ToAddress() {    printf %34s "$(EncodeBase58 "00$1$(checksum "00$1")")" |    sed "s/ /1/g"}Hash160ToAddress $(Hash160)
Writing in POSIX is much less fun.  To me GNU is a better standard de facto.Also, what's the point of those excellent GNU tools if we can never use them ? And yet, still no asian bitcoin article on Wikipedia.  This would be a clearer sign imo. Maybe you make it as some kind of a user preference ? I think that, instead of pricing bitcoin in other currencies, you should price other currencies in bitcoin.In the same idea, order books should orders to buy/sell other currencies.  For instance, if I want to buy bitcoins against euros, I go on the EURO book and I put a "sell" order.This would make things much clearer.PS.  It would also make the graph easier to read, since all currency prices could be expressed in the same unit. I want to implement an exchange system where owners are identified by a bitcoin address.So in order to transfer an asset to an other person, one just has to sign (with the bitcoin address key) the new bitcoin address.The advantage is that if the asset is a bond or a shareholding, paiements of dividends or coupons can be done on the bitcoin address. Would this work with any key for sure ? Yes !  It works  Code:#!/bin/bash# # Requires bc, openssl, xxd#base58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})EncodeBase58() {    # 58 =0x3A    bc <<<"ibase=16; n=${1^^}; while(n>0) { n%3A ; n/=3A }" |    tac |    while read n    do echo -n ${base58[n]}    done}Hash160ToAddress() {    printf %34s $(EncodeBase58 "00$1$(checksum "00$1")")|    sed "s/ /1/g"}checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -hex |    cut -d\  -f2 |    sed -r "s/^((..){4}).*/\1/"}Hash160() {    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -hex |    cut -d\  -f2}PubKeyToAdress() { Hash160ToAddress $(tail -c 65 |Hash160) ; } lolThat's exactly what I thought  I'm trying to implement the base58 functions.  I'm almost there but I have difficulties with the checksum.Code:#!/bin/bashbase58=({1..9} {A..H} {J..N} {P..Z} {a..k} {m..z})EncodeBase58() {    # 58 =0x3A    bc <<<"ibase=16; n=${1^^}; while(n>0) { n%3A ; n/=3A }" |    tac |    while read n    do echo -n ${base58[n]}    done}Hash160ToAddress() {    ADDRESSVERSION=00    EncodeBase58 "${ADDRESSVERSION}$1$(Checksum "$1")"}Checksum() {    xxd -p -r <<<"$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -sha256 -hex |    cut -d\  -f2 |    sed -r "s/^.*((..){4})/\1/"}Hash160() {    echo -n "$1" |    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |    openssl dgst -rmd160 -hex |    cut -d\  -f2}H=0057b0dc5aac7c215a9a458d6c3c85cd21089af8Hash160ToAddress $H# I should get     112p3sLidyEptFEfx3C2RCvFoRPK89HyBT# I actually get     2p3sLidyEptFEfx3C2RCvFoRPK7JQWdq Yes it is.  Thanks. Feel free to use the code source of my own exchange page   ! Isn't DER format the same as raw byte ?   Anyway I opened an other thread and Hal found out that the key has a "ASN.1 cruft" or something.  So I add to add a tail -c 64.I have to read about this ASN thing.

Yeah I like the "Red shield" idea.  Pretty clever. Capital is made of means of production :  companies, tools, knowledge, machines,...Bitcoin doesn't make capital, just as it doesn't make orange juice.  It only permits you to buy it. I have only watched the few first minutes but I wanna be the first to say :THIS KICKS ASS !!PS.  I think this video is one of the best, along with the Hayek/Keynes rap. Yeah right, I forgot about loom too.  Beat me.Let's just say I want my own implementation And I want it in bash. A short video would be better, in order to better evaluate how many people could have seen the sign, and during how long it was visible.(a photo could have been shot in 1 sec and then the sign would have been removed). I'm on IRC right now if you want to talk. Yeah I'll definitely look into it.It requires OpenSSL version 1.0.0, which is quite a high version number.  I'm on debian Sid and I only have version : 0.9.8o-4.The 1.0.0c is on debian experimental, though.  I'll have to install it.

This is my secret project I'm currently working on.  A full internet anonymous/pseudonymous banking service.Basically it will allow anyone to own financial assets anonymously (or pseudonymously) and to trade them.It will be free and open source, because the more implementations, the better.It will be centralized.  Yes, centralized.  Not P2P.  Because a financial asset is not a money.  You NEED TO trust someone who promesses to pay revenues from this asset.  So until an other genius like Satoshi invents a dividend-paying cryptoasset, we got to stick to the reputation/trust/responsabiliy model.Every asset account will be indentified by a cryptographic key.  Several types will be accepted.  GnuPG, DSA, ECDSA.  Any request to accept any other kind of key will be studied.     Public keys can be large, so we'll use hashes to designate accounts.  Again, no restriction on the type of hashes.  But only "good" hash function.   RMD160, sha256, sha124,...  all those hases from the same public key will be accepted to identify any asset.Asset transfer will be possible by signing a document made of the asset transfered amount, the destination public key (or its hash) and the current bitcoin block hash as a time indication.All transactions will be public, so that everyone can check signatures and balances.  The full transaction history will be available via HTTP.The server will be hidden on the Web using Tor.The bank will offer a clearing/escrow/compensation service for trading assets.  Crossed order books will be maintained for all possible asset pairs.  Real-time fast trading should be able via XMPP/IRC/Jabber, whatever.Bitcoin would make all this much easier.  I doubt I could do that all alone, but I very much would like to live long enouhg to see this becoming reality. There can be no such thing as a forever stamp.At some point they will need the money, so they'll just limit the supply of those "forever" stamps.People will still have no choice but buying normal inflationnary stamps.IMO Good, good.Now, you definitly should make one book for LRUSD, and an other one for LREUR.  Possibly one for EURcash and USDcash if you have any.Otherwise, congratulations and thanks.  This is getting pretty nice. Seriously, what you've done davout is great.  Releasing the source code for such as wevsite is great.I won't donate because I'm too selfish.  But I will take part in this and I've already add a few bitcoins to my account.  I'll probably give up my own site.  Just because yours is better.Now, one question : why can't we have a proper presentation for the book order ?   Decreasing bids on left, and increasing asks on right ?   We actually don't care about the time an order has been sent.It should look like what I wrote once about order books on issuepedia :http://fr.issuepedia.org/Comment_marche_la_bourse#Etablissement_du_cours_de_bourse Yes.  It's the only language I can use for free on freeshell.org.I like it.  It might have some performance problems if my site is much visited, but it's fun to write. This is nice.I've also released my website source (just click the link "voir la source" on the bottom of the page).I think the more exchange plateforms we have, the better ! This is actually pretty good.   I don't know this guy well, but clearly I should listen to him more. It's not a matter of "mining difficulty", it's just a matter of statistics.The more gold you extract from the ground, the less gold there is left there.  So the likelyhood of finding some gold decrease exponentially.  It's the same for any substance hidden in an other.Put 100 black pieces of paper in a bag with a billion white ones.  Try extracting them one by one, and you'll see an exponential decrease of your production of blacks.This exponential rule was one of the many things that I liked in the bitcoin protocol.  I'm thankful to Satoshi to have implemented it.  It's perfect to mimic a commodity extraction process. Don't you ?  Sorry then. It's not just about being legal or not.  It's a huge disrespect for the author, imo.
Hum.  This book is NOT yours.  Do you have Irwin Schiff's agreement ? Done.  I hope they'll put their bitcoin address on the main page though. Oh my god, seriously !??This WM is my prefered WM !I'm going to donate right now PS.  hum... a bit too early I guess.  I'll have to wait a bit. Well, I haven't quite decided what status I will put in the history table.  Probably this :* apport :  this a line I add when I want to bring some fresh bitcoins in the system.* attente réception lettre :   waiting for letter receipt* paiement effectué :  payment done.  This will also be an hyperlink to bitcoinexplorer.com page for the bitcoin transaction.* périmé :  outdated.  I will write this when (hopfully never) I will not have received anything after, say, 15 days.* annulé : cancelled.  I may write this if I receive an email or something telling me the buyer changed his mind.BTW, I updated the source code ahead.  You can use it directly to make your translations.This site is free to mirror/fork !  Just change the name "Grondilu" to your own name.If you mirror it, I'd appreciate you had a link to my own site. Indeed !I searched once "apt-cache search steganography" and I had found nothing.Now I see why, the description was in my mother tongue, so I should have written "stéganographie" instead.Thanks, I'm sure this thread will be usefull anyway, for it will allow people to be aware of this tool. Well, I guess we more or less agree then. Because I don't i2p very well.  I don't know how to install and run it.  Is there a debian package somewhere ? If the market really wants price instability, so be it.Sure, it's easier to plan on a business activity with relatively stable prices.  But such a stability doesn't have to be artificial.  It's possible that price instability destroy businesses, but it will only be a consequence of the inaptitude to adapt to market.I mean, say you sell audio CDs.  Suddenly the MP3 comes out.  Your product suddenly doesn't worth nothing.  So that's a huge and rapid price instability.  Are you going to blame central banks for not having printed money to fight this deflation ?Economic factors influence prices.  They can make them increase or decrease.  Nobody should try to do anything against that. Let me make it clear, stenography is only a way to hide data.  It's not proper encryption.  It's quite useful, though, since then you can store your wallet pretty much anywhere (any image storing web service), or even wikipedia.But if you want to store your two images (both images are required to retrieve data) on the web, then you must use an encrypted wallet, not the wallet itself.  You might possibly use a passphrase that the image reminds you of. Hum, would you consider using tor instead ? Edit:  I realised during this thread that there are FOSS programs to do this.  "steghide" is one of them.I was starting to write this but I'm getting lazy so I just put the beginning of it, in case someone would like to end it.The idea is to store your wallet, or an encrypted version of it, into an image file.  The program creates a quasi identical image, with the data steganographied in it.   The data can be retreived by comparing the two almost identical images.  Therefore you need to store both images, possibly in two different places on cyberspace.Requires ImageMagick to convert the file in Ascii PPM format.Code:#!/bin/bashif [[ -z "$1" ]]then echo "usage: $0 image-file [input-data]" 1>&2; exit 1elif [[ ! -s "$1" ]]then echo "$1 is empty or does not exist" 1>&2; exit 2elif image="$1"; ! identify "$1" 1>&2then echo "couldn't understand image format for $1" 1>&2; exit 3else    ppmimage="${1%.*}.ppm"    convert "$image" -compression none "$ppmimage"    data=$(mktemp)    xxd -p "${2:-/dev/stdin}" |    while read -N 2 x    do        n=$((0x$x))        : please continue    donefi You mean a lottery, right ? I'm off-topic but :  anyone has a spare USB cable for n900 to sell for bitcoins ? We definitely should give this a try.  I unfortunately only have shell CGI on my webserver (no Perl, PHP, Python or stuff like that) so I can't do it myself.   But I'd be glad to help if someone wants to create a test-plateform.PS:  However, I keep thinking we should avoid making a huge monolithic application for handling with everything.  Accounting is already taken care of by several FOSS project.  IMO, we need two applications : one for clearing and one for adjudication. Nope.  I tries to load during half a sec, and then it stops without changing anything in the page.I'm using Arora 0.10.2 with libQT 4.6.3 on Debian Sid. Yeah but in order to make this useful, we have to wait for someone to make a tool for extracting a key from the wallet and output it in a openssl PEM ascii format.  Gavin said that he might be interested in adding that in his bitcointools program suite.But as I said accounting is not the difficult part.  We should separate activities of accounting, clearing and adjudicating (I may be forgetting some).Each of them should be able to interact with one another, unix-style.Because I'm pretty sure developpers will want their own accounting system, or they might want not to implement clearing, and so on... Well, it's good you presented it as a beta.  Because I've failed passing through the first step twice.  With two different browsers :  Arora and uzbl. I'm not saying we should not use accounts.  I'm saying it's a completely different application.There are actually several free and open source accounting softwares.  Check in the corresponding category in http://www.gnu.orgWhat we need is a software that takes charge of exchanges.  Such a software can ignore accounting data, and focus on adjudication. No account. I've decided to give this site a try.It's a two weeks auction.http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=197
This is silly.  Imagine the nightmare if every single application was using a password to protect its files.The operating system is in charge of the file system security.  Not the application. Hi,I've set up an experimental bitcoin via euro cash in the mail.  Due to lack of imagination, I've called it "eurobitcoin".http://grondilu.freeshell.org/eurobitcoin.cgiI extract rates from mtgox and bitcoin4cash, and I offer the average ask.It's a CGI script that allows to make reservations so there's normally no need for human intervention, apart from sending the enveloppe and receiving it.It's written if french, since after all euro is not the national british currency, so why not writting in my mother tongue, hum ?I'd welcome german and other central european languages translations.  If any one wants to help.I'll attach the source code here. I'd like to see a Unix-style program that would parse ASCII column format for orders on stdin, and would output matching, adjudicated orders.So the usage of the program would be :$ adjudicate < orders-fileWhere "orders-file" would be a column-oriented data file with the following columns :ID:  some random unique string to identify the orderDATE: date when the order was signed in seconds since EPOCHASSET: identification string for the asset/currencyAMOUNT: quantity of the order.PARTIAL: 0 if the order can be executed partially, 1 otherwise.PRICE:  limit price for the order.  Positive for a bid, negative for an ask.  Price is in bitcoins, of course DEADLINE:  limit date for the validity of the orderFINGERPRINT: the fingerprint of the issuer's GnuPG public keySIGNATURE:  a hyperlink to the signature of this order.So there is one line for each order.   Therefore the program can be easily inserted in an pipe.The program searches for matching orders, and determines a selling price, according to some rules that we have yet to decide.Consider for instance those two matching orders :A. quantity=1000, bid=110B. quantity=100, ask=90So at which price should the trade be done ?  90, 110, 100 ??  Should the relative quantities intervene in chosing the amount between 90 and 110 ?What about this situation, where one bid matches two asks :A. quantity=1000, bid=110B. quantity=900, ask=90C. quantity=500, ask=100Which order should be executed fully between B. and C. ?  Would the criterium be only the date at which the orders were posted ?  Would B. be executed preferentially since it has a lower ask ?Those rules have to be made clear, and integrated in the adjudication algorithm.Anyway at the end, if some matching orders were found, the program returns pairs of order IDs. One pair per line.  Orders that are not valid (deadlime in past for instance) are printed on a single line.For instance this output :foo1  bar1foo2  foo3bar2means that the order foo1 matches the order bar1 and both should be executed.  Same for foo2 and foo3.However, bar2 is an order that the program has detected as being non valid.An other porgram could then use this ouput to update the order-file, and then input the modified version again to the adjudicate program, while adding new orders if there are some.  And the process repeats until there is no more orders. Here is the one I use :Code:#!/bin/bashname=grondilusftp_address=grondilu@XXXXXXXX.XXXemail_address=grondilu@YYYYY.YYYwallet=someobfuscatedfilenameprivate=$HOME/Privatebitcoind backupwallet $private/$walletcd $privategpg -e -r $name $walletsftp $sftp_address <<< "put $wallet.gpg"obexftp -b "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" -c /Data/backups -p "$wallet.gpg"mutt $email_address -s backup -a $wallet.gpgrm $wallet{,.gpg}I use the Private virtual encrypted directory  made with ecryptfs.The obexftp line is to transfer to my N900 via bluetooth. Try to think about the bitcoins you will earn when the software is done and you use it to do business. Come on guys...  Don't you like coding just for the fun of it ?  I'm currently working on something else right now, I will release the source code once it's done, and yet I don't expect to get any bitcoin for it.It's very easy to pay someone with bitcoin, and yet I don't think this is a reason why we should pay for everything.Moreover, I actually tend to think that the code is better when it is done for free, because the developper really enjoyed his work, and did not do it just for the money. Pretty cool.  A gold coin like this would be nice.Anyone knows someone who could mint it ? What would do such an exchange plateform exactly ?To me it should give tools to maintain order books.User should be identified with a key pair.  Whether it is GnuPG, DSA, or even bitcoin ECDSA extracted from wallets.  Depending of the format of the public key, the software should be able to recognize which one it should use.It should allow to exchange any kind of asset.  Not just currencies.  Yes, I'm thinking about share holdings.  But actually any kind of asset, like with the loom project (https://loom.cc).It should maintain all possible book orders.  With N differrent assets, there will be N * (N-1)/2 possible kind of books.  But if we want to trade everything only against bitcoins, then we'll have only N books.The software should do adjudication.  Given a set of orders, extract matching ones and decide which should be executed and which should be postponed.  Execution would only consist in contacting issuers of the matching order, so that they can proceed to the actual trade.  Unless we want to implement an escrow or banking account service too.A rating system should be available.So basically what we need is a protocol, rather than a software.To sum up, the features would be :* publish an order.  Characteristcs are :  - identification of the asset (Paypal USD, 20 EUR via mail, company share,...) using an asset code ;- quantity ;- price ( bid or ask ) ;- public key and signature of the issuer of the order ;- an indication whether or not the order can be executed partially ;- time validity of the order ;* adjudication algorithm.  This might very well be the toughest part ;* rate a user.  Each member signs a rating of the public keys of other members.Maybe I miss something but that's how I see the whole thing. I don't knwow what this is,  I've just found out about it.The description looks very much like bitcoin.<<Geek Credit is a digital complementary currency for internet. It is decentralized, secure, interest anddemurrage free. It is backed by mutual credit (time). There is no central issuing and control authority, so itis a true peer-to-peer currency.It is a digital form of WATT local currency system that is used in Japan.Like any complementary currency it is best fit for paying for services within a community. So for internet it ispaying to free software, mp3s, books, best blogs, items from MMORGs, etc.>>http://home.gna.org/geekcredit/ Would you consider cash in mail in order to put in some funds ? +1 "First you're ridiculed, then you're ignored, then you're violently opposed, and then you win."We're clearly in the first step. It is not that different.  Think more.  It is really similar.Anyway hopefully I won't be the only gold seller.   Being resilient to government coercion is not just a matter of geographic location, but also a matter of number of people.The government is already in war against people selling drug.  I doubt it would start an other war against people selling gold. Your "credible entity" is nothing but a normal market agent.  There's no reason why one of them should decide of a correct price of gold in bitcoin.I am currently selling physical gold for bitcoin.  Check out on the marketplace forum.  So I am your "credible" agent.  And yet, I have not decided any particular price :  I sell my gold in an auction process, with no starting price.If you hesitate to buy a currency that is backed only by true market forces, just diversify and keep some gold.  As I do. Can you transfer your sand dollars via internet ?  Can you make sure there will never be more than a certain amount ?  Can you divide them up to hundreds of millions times ?  Are they all indistinctable, do they have all the same value ?Your sand dollars kind of look like diamonds.  Diamonds are precious.  But they are not money. Cornering a market is not that easy.  See the Hunt brother's story.As far as backing bitcoin by gold, or gold by bitcoin, it's not a good idea at all.Basically this would mean a turn back to a centralised monetary system.  Bitcoin advocates don't want that.  Neither do gold ones. +1 I think that too and I whish I had said it clearer on this forum. I try not to keep too much cash.   Cash is not a good investment.  Even with bitcoins.I'm pretty sure bitcoin will become a leading currency so buying bitcoins now might be a astonishing trade.  But I have no idea whether it will reveal as such in one year or twenty years.Therefore, I'll try to keep only a few thousands bitcoins and spend the rest to buy shareholdings and conventionnal assets.  So I answered  2% but my real answer is not really a proportionnal factor, rather a constant amount. That was a pretty good interview.  Clear and concise.
I was talking about bitcoin on some forum and at some point I was explaining that all transactions are public.  I gave bitcoinexplorer.com as an example of a website where people could have details about any transaction.At this point there was a misunderstanding, for one of the guys I was talking to thought bitcoinexplorer.com was part of the system, that during a transaction, both parties had to refer to this website in order to perform the transaction.  Of course, I had to explain that this is not the way bitcoin works,  that bitcoin doesn't need any website to function properly.However, this made me think of something.Right now there are a few websites that are very useful to the bitcoin project.   bitcoin.org and its forum of course, Bitcoinexplorer.com, bitcoinwatch.com and others.Would the use of bitcoin be really the same without those websites ?  Isn't bitcoinwatch.com quite reassuring for instance, since it allows a user to check that "everything is right" by comparing his block number to bitcoinwatch's block number ?So, if governments decided to shut down all bitcoin related websites and forums, then bitcoin would need to work in "silent mode".  People would have to trust their client only.  They would communicate via encrypted email about their chain length, making sure it is more or less the same.  It would be the same system, but I guess it would surely "feel" different.I'm pretty sure it would work fine, but we should be mentally prepared to use bitcoin in such a "silent mode". Good.  I'm glad you're interested.  I'll wait. I also recommend Madhatter.  I had my first bitcoins thanks to him. Yeah, sounds better indeed. Hum, I'd like to register, but there's something wrong about the certificate.  I don't know much about these stuff.  I guess I should download the certificate somewhere. This is great news.   I'll definetely open an account now. Let my try this comparaison :Bitcoin is to Paypall what email is to telegraphy.Now it's obvious that email is better than telegraphy, but I'm pretty sure that 15 years ago we could have found people saying that email has no future and that telegraphy is better. Good point. Auction has ended.Brocktice wins the auction with 1270 BTC. 25 blocks before the end.Brocktice still leads at 1270 BTC.Anyone at 1280 ?It seems there is not much interest for this auction anymore, so I won't end this one on IRC unless someone outbids brocktice. I actually only need an "export" feature.   I also don't think we need a special bitcoin header.  We can stick to the header openssl use.  I actually want to, for I want to use openssl with this key.so the format should be :-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----BgUrgQQACg==-----END EC PARAMETERS----------BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----MHQCAQEEII84GK/wX8stbmJWYL/WUM1nPAK1miIBDBeyNuo2vyf4oAcGBSuBBAAKoUQDQgAE/yRZIKrOj4GBfLFtMYuocJ5QF1Tr9rWMh2ixCyfodDWRWTIU21v3ehDRNJiAXHKwkhDqQ//i46NHoNUhjvx/lw==-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----(I got this output from "openssl ecparam -out key.pem -name secp256k1 -genkey")The  bitcoin address should be built from this file using an other program. Anyway there must be a way to get the public key, since after all the bitcoin program uses it to verify transactions.But I confess I have to get a better understanding of the whole key signing process. Hum, right.  My bad.Ahh I have to think this more thorously.PS.  I've edited the original post in accordance. *** EDIT:  Bounty has ended.  Program was written. ***I give 100 BTC to whoever can make the following program :The program takes a bitcoin address on command line.If the bitcoin address is not one of in the user's wallet, then the program does nothing apart from returning an error code.If the bitcoin address is one of the user's wallet, then the program ouputs the corresponding Private key in PEM format, so it can be used by openssl.That's all.  100 BTC. By everyone I think genjix meant "everyone who is using encryption for their personnal messages".Personnally I don't know any other encryption/signing software. When bitcoin becomes world famous, then international finance is gonna get wild.  It will be fun.But right now nobody has enough reputation to make it come true.  But it will happen, I'm sure of it. Very true.  Some financial instruments could easily be used by people.  I'm not sure about futures, but I know warrants are very easy to buy. Gold is rising guys : omg your regex is ugly.Code:    sed -r 's/([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)/\1:\2/g' |And I'm pretty sure there is better. Yeah I've already been advocating for that on this forum.  I just hope I will live long enough to see this happen.  It would revolutionize capitalism.
All current montetary politics is a joke.Basically it consists in adjusting money supply (via interest rates) in order to maintain a relative price stability.  But why would we want price stability ?  Theoretically it's because it's difficult to have economic activity without it.  How to pay wages if the value of money varies from one month to an other ?  How to sign a long term contract if we have no way to know exactly what 100 monetary units will be able to buy next year ?  This is the whole idea behind current economics and monetary policy.  And this is bullshit.Prices are not something that have to be decided by anyone.   An apple is an apple, and there is no reason why it should cost more next year than right now.  That's what some people think.  But what if the production techniques have been improved ?  What if suddenly less people like to eat apples ?  Or if an other fruit gets invented (why not ?).They say that when there is economic growth, we should increase the money supply in accordance, so that prices remain stable.  But if bankers increase money supply to counter production improvement, isn't that a theft of consummers, who otherwise would have benefited from this improvement of productivity ?  Isn't that also a theft of the producer, whose products gets to be at the same price although he had increased his productivity ?Who on earth are those guys who get to decide what should be the price of the things we produce and  consume ?It's tough to pay wages in deflation.  True.  But sometimes the market wants it.  The labour of someone may have some value at a certain time, but the same labour can have a different value a few months later.  Some things can have happened.  A machine can have been invented that does the same work.  Other workers can have come up with more motivation to work, or better skills.   Price stability has no reason to be prefered if it does not reflect economic reality. What happens if  Warren Buffet suddenly sells all his assets and burn all the corresponding money ?  Won't that significantly increase the value of USD ?Basically someone who burns money is someone who decides to work for other human beings for free.  There is nothing to do appart from thanking him. Less than 2OO blocks to go.brocktice still leads at 1270 BTC. Well, yes, I forgot about this credit aspect.  So basically CCs are a generalised form of credit.  When someone needs to borrow money, he would issue CCs, instead of going to a bank.   Or, in other words, everyone is his own bank (when seeing a bank as a company offering credit, not a place where people store their money).So somehow credit coin would be to credit what bitcoin is to money.It has the merit of clarifying things. No offense, but I think Paul Grignon's ideas are just reinventing the wheel.CC is just privatly issued currency.  It's a good thing, but nothing new under the sun.As you pointed out, his PC concept is kind of nebulous.  Indeed BTC would make a clearer PC.Anyway, I think that in such a ystem, PC will tend to have a far bigger importance than CC, so that CC will be quite anecdotic compared to PC. Exactly.I also wonder if all communications could not be done using HTTP.  Blocks would be published via http GET method (giving the hash of the preceding block), and transactions could be sent via POST method.One advantage of using  http would be that it would be very hard for governments to forbid. lolif it was that easy to transfer money, we wouldn't need bitcoin at all  Sorry Cryptoman, the card was sold on #bitcoin-otc for 375 BTC Come on guys !  Anybody is going to bid this ?!Or if anybody wants it, at least can someone help me to turn it into bitcoin ?- I give you the card numbers ;- you sell it on MrGox or whatever ;- you give me the bitcoins ;- you get a commission.No brainer gain for you, right ? Let me try :* Scam!  - to the benefit of who ?* Ponzi scheme!- bitcoin price can go up, or down.  I'm aware of that.* Name calling.

Let's just make the final count with awk too...Code:#!/bin/sh# Display foreign IP addresses coming from port 8333 --or-- connected to local port 8333.# Append line at end with date and count of addresses displayed.netstat -an |awk -v date="$(date)" '$6 == "ESTABLISHED" && /:8333/ { split($5, a, ":"); print a[1] ; n++ }END { print "# " date " : " n " bitcoin clients seen." }' Didn't know about the trap command.  I doubt we need it though.Being a bit anal :- The standard way to create a temp file is to use the mktemp command.- You can end lines after |.  This makes the code clearer.Code:#!/bin/sh# Display foreign IP addresses coming from port 8333 --or-- connected to local port 8333.# Append line at end with date and count of addresses displayed.t="$(mktemp -t bitcoin)"netstat -an |awk '$6 == "ESTABLISHED" && /:8333/ { split($5, a, ":"); print a[1]}' |tee "$t"echo "# $(date) $(wc -l < $t) Bitcoin clients seen."

Unfortunately, now that this thread exists, we can not be sure that this woman is not a feminist man who tries to disguise himself in order to increase female ratio here. You're right guys.  We should definitely try to have women know about bitcoins.  We can't just ignore them, since they are so numerous and have such a huge consumming power.I suggest we start a campaign, aiming mainly at hair-dressing salons and shoes shops.  On the web, maybe we could reach them on health, beauty or astrology forums. /mode troll onIf you are talking about a feminine contribution to the forum, I'm not sure it worths 3BTC./mode troll off Indeed you have to look at the source code.  I've just check and the EC curve used is : secp256k1, which is in the list given by openssl.I think a scripted implementation is feasable.
Eble oni devus traduki la artikolon de Satoshi :http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfMi kredas ke gxi estas gravega, tradukinda dokumento. Faudrait peut-être qu'on s'y attelle.  Le "white paper" de Satoshi est le document important qu'il faut lire et relire pour comprendre le fonctionnement des bitcoins.  Je pense qu'il serait important qu'il soit traduit dans plusieurs langues.Je propose qu'on se répartisse le travail s'il y a des volontaires.PS.  Rien  que le début, j'ai du mal :  comment on traduit "cash" ??En tout cas, voici déjà ma version du titre et du résumé :J'ai choisi de ne pas garder "cash" :  quand on fait une traduction, on la fait à fond ou on la fait pas !  Pas d'anglicisme, donc. Je connais rien à Jabber.  C'est quoi le client que je dois utiliser sous linux ? The threadhttp://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2459.0make me feel like suggesting a full shell implementation of bitcoin.  I've actually been thinking about this for some time but I'd like to see if other people would be interested in such a crazy project.Here is the kind of architecture I'd like to see :- nodes communicate transactions via IRC, XMPP or similar (a shell script communicating with such a protocol should be easy to implement) ;- each node publishes its blocks via its own http server (possibly via a TOR hidden service to avoid NAT traversal problems) ;- each node also publishes the list of nodes it is currently connected to ;- nodes store their blocks using GnuNet or maybe a NoSQL database such as MongoDB  (easily scripted) ;- cryptographic functions are performed via the openssl command line ;- blocks and wallets are stored in an human readable ASCII format ; Is it possible to use ECDSA with openssl ?  I've looked for this in the openssl manual page, but I haven't found anything apart from DSA and RSA.  Anyway indeed most of the parts of the program would be called with command line programs, especially cryptographic stuffs.(PS.  you don't have to put a whole pipe in a same line.  The '|' character can end a line.) Oh this is cool. I confess I didn't know the commant netstat.It could be cleaned a bit I think :netstat -an |awk '/8333/ && /ESTA/ { print $5 }' |sed 's/:8333//' |tee >(echo "# $(date) $(wc -l) Bitcoin clients seen.")It's funny :  while I was starting bitcoin to test this,  I couldn't get any connection even after a few minutes.  It's just when I read a post about IRC bootstrapping that I have problems which bootstrapping.  How ironic...PS.  You might consider adding a "Content-type" line in your script (assuming it's a CGI):Code:#!/bin/shecho "Content-type: text/plain"echonetstat -an |awk '/8333/ && /ESTA/ { print $5 }' |sed 's/:8333//' |tee >(echo "# $(date) $(wc -l) Bitcoin clients seen.")PS#2.  I like this idea a lot.  Especially since it's quite easy to install a mini http server such as thttpd for instance.This makes me even dream of a full implementation of bitcoin via pure shell scripting.  The http server could also publish his blocks, that could be requested by giving the hash of the block via a simple HTTP GET request. Please notice that having a huge CPU power isn't enough for conering the market.  Even if you can generate ALL bitcoins in present and future, there are still the bitcoins of the past in circulation.  You'll have to buy them with some other currency.You should also be aware of the difficulties related to a corner of ANY market.  Sometimes, success in this domain equals failure.  It seems paradoxical, but it was quite well illustrated by the Hunt brother's attempt to corner silver a few decades ago.I'm pretty sure one of these days bitcoins will be confronted to such a corner attempt, probably with the same result. For local filesystem encryption I use ecryptfs which is free software (Truecrypt is open source but not free software).  It's pretty cool.  It can encrypt a whole partition or just make a virtual filesystem on a ~/Private directory. It will certainly happen, but to do so the initiator will have to gather miners around him, otherwise his block chain will remain very weak compared to bitcoin's.This has been discussed several times in the forum.  Most of us think that there's nothing wrong with competing currencies, whether they are cryptographic or not is not the issue.  Competing currencies are good for the economy. Thanks but unfortunately I can't use Perl, Python or any of this kind of advanced scripting language on my web server.  I have to stick to shell scripting.I'm slowly working my way through though.  I will definitely use GnuPG and not RSA finally, for GnuPG is much more known.  I'll just have to read the manual page many times. I don't understand much but it seems to be a nice project.  I also like the idea that your protocol could be implemented with a script language (you're talking about using wget and tcpdump, which is cool).So I'll give you 1 BTC. This explains a lot. I didn't know this one.  It looks pretty good.PS.  Just donated a few BTC to this. unixtime2date() {  date -d "1970-01-01 $1 sec" ; } I am currently programming a bitcoin asset exchange plateform, and during this process I came up with an idea which is, in my opnion, pretty good.I needed some way to identify the owner.  He should be able to prove he is the owner of the asset, and he should be able to transfer his ownership to someone else.Using passwords is the quick-and-dirty way to do so.  But there are many drawbacks to this method.  I won't discuss them here.At some point I wanted to use ECDSA signing capabilities of bitcoin address.  But it's not easy, and the bitcoin client doesn't provide any tool for that.  And I was convinced that it should not.Using GnuPG would be nice, but I realised that it's a pain in the ass to program with.  It realy doesn't seem to me that it is suitable for scripting.So I decided to use RSA keys, using the openssl command.  It was much easier than I thought, and particularly easier than GnuPG.Anyway, here is the idea I came up with.At some point I have to associate a bitcoin address (where future dividends are to be paid) to a public RSA key.  Keeping a database of these relations is necessary, but not sufficient.  Basically it would give exactly the same problems as with passwords.  Anybody who would access to the database could modify it and then claim ownership of the assets.So the idea is to timestamp the relations into the bitcoin block chain.Here is an exemple.I want to associate this bitcoin address :1Hy9dexzNzjvQYkYy6zKRVZMU8k2j5vuPtto this RSA public key :-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA67nZtqz41rGFdUsVMC/EHsvhfyG7dreTeIfOO+tA1fUuyooiodsYw73qM4qKZFJduBdtrMqAiQhGkfUjhqbfaIlc/5yR+0ZUHI6eiCcPtDi95MdpmDtlXg/9YkQ36ACZX2ccCIiUIaHVK4lc2MzT6Io9FaXCejkoZiEsAK+XqUxc3X5B0VFVxyq4i/S7qOQKABfEDaF56OhtW3URGX7VLTOxMmSccL/tVeN3cwUfNOHsoVF7g1bqPGYvdEGOzEklzJ3i2IYMah7d4So3BlXrOMI6HCZTfCd+J64c5h6dh2ciQr27XDUKBVQhm3s5gwQl0WRcQhQ4LRG3ur+Rud5q2QIDAQAB-----END PUBLIC KEY-----All I have to do is to use a timestamping function like this one :timestamp() {    wget -O - -q http://blockexplorer.com/q/hashtoaddress/$(openssl dgst -rmd160)}this way :{ echo 1Hy9dexzNzjvQYkYy6zKRVZMU8k2j5vuPt ; echo "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA67nZtqz41rGFdUsVMC/EHsvhfyG7dreTeIfOO+tA1fUuyooiodsYw73qM4qKZFJduBdtrMqAiQhGkfUjhqbfaIlc/5yR+0ZUHI6eiCcPtDi95MdpmDtlXg/9YkQ36ACZX2ccCIiUIaHVK4lc2MzT6Io9FaXCejkoZiEsAK+XqUxc3X5B0VFVxyq4i/S7qOQKABfEDaF56OhtW3URGX7VLTOxMmSccL/tVeN3cwUfNOHsoVF7g1bqPGYvdEGOzEklzJ3i2IYMah7d4So3BlXrOMI6HCZTfCd+J64c5h6dh2ciQr27XDUKBVQhm3s5gwQl0WRcQhQ4LRG3ur+Rud5q2QIDAQAB-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" } | timestampAnd I get a bitcoin address :13CWM9MmeyP1MA6SgAiqAq7cGxXaLWhnTGNow, the owner of the RSA just have to send a small amount to this address, so that no-one could claim ownership of this bitcoin address.  Why would anyone claim ownership of someone else's bitcoin address ?  Only because this could give him the right to transfer it to an other bitcoin address, one that he actually owns.The whole point of all this is that with such a method ownership of assets can be identified by bitcoin addresses, providing that these addresses are timestamped with a RSA public key.PS.  Hum... as I write this, I realise that this method might make the use of GnuPG easier than I thought.  Maybe finally easier than RSA. I just want to tell you that I am currently building something similar and it's gonna kick ass !It will be a bash CGI script and it will just use RSA keys to identify owners of shares.  I'll use the excellent "openssl" command that I've recently learned. The US governments could not do that alone, because it can control only its own territory.Do you think it can convince other countries to track their citizens and prevent them to run the bitcoin client ?I doubt so.  USA's influence is not that strong. It's very much possible that some of Keiser's watchers convert part of their gold into bitcoins, as I do. OMG it's true :<< Max and Stacy talk about stock market riots, p2p currencies and the banking solvency crisis. In the second half, Max talks to Mike Maloney of goldsilver.com about currency crises, China's gold and the silver market. >>I love this guy.  I haven't been following him for a long time but I'm glad he's one of the first to talk about P2P currencies.PS.    Just listened to Stacy Herbert talking about bitcoin.  That's great !  Stacy Herbert and Max Keiser are, with others such as Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, Jim Rogers, some of the guys I was listening to every day during the crisis.  I'm glad they get interested in bitcoin ! lol aucune chance de trouver un tel site.  Comme tu l'as compris, le bitcoin est encore ultra-confidentiel en France.  Par contre c'est pas une raison pour ne pas poster ton annonce sur leboncoin.  Après tout ça coute rien et si il y a un début à tout.  Comme ça tu pourras dire à tes petits enfants :  et bien moi j'ai été le premier à vendre des trucs en bitcoins sur leboncoin.  Note que la consonnance des deux mots est amusante aussi (boncoin...bitcoin).Bref vas-y, poste ton annonce, t'as pas grand chose à perdre.
Gold might rise in the next few days too.  Wait and see. J'ai malheureusement passé l'âge de faire du patin à roulette, donc je ne pourrai pas t'acheter ces trucs, désolé.Par contre ça me fait penser qu'on devrait inciter les gens à publier ce genre d'annonce sur leboncoin.fr.  Non seulement c'est gratuit mais ça peut être bon aussi pour la promo de notre cryptodevise préférée.En effet si quelqu'un tombe par hasard sur une annonce affichant "475 BTC" comme prix, il a toutes les chances d'être intrigué. I think this could be nice but it needs some thinking.So the idea is that the robot would supervise an auction on IRC.The seller tells the robot (Bot) to open an auction for an item (Item) until a deadline (Dl).Bot opens a channel #auction-[short name for Item]It also sets the topic as something like "Auction for [full description of Item] until Dl.  No starting price."To place a bid, a user just enters his amount in one of these format:123.456 BTC : plain explicit bid (unit may also be bc, kBTC,...)123.456 : bid with no monetary unit (assuming BTC)+1 : relative bid (1 BTC more than last bid)'35: implicit format.  For instance after several bids of value close to 34000, '35 would actually mean 35000.Or after several bids such as 10.29, 10.32, 10.33,  '35 would mean 10.35The main rule for the robot would be to take the value closest to the previous bid, keeping it beyond a 110% increase.  For instance, after a bid of 1000 (with no decimal), then '20 would mean 1020, and not 20000.  If no interpretation can fit the 110%, then the robot takes the closest and ask for confirmation.At then end the robot adjudicates the auction by declaring the winner.  He then sends a log of the whole auction to the seller.Here is an exemple of how such an auction would look like.Code:-- Bot sets topic to "Auction for an ... until ..."-- Alice joins channelAlice> 10Bot>   Alice leads at 10 BTC-- Bob joins channelBob>   ;;leadBot>   Alice leads at 10 BTCBob>   +1Bot>   Bob leads at 11 BTCAlice> 20Bot>   Alice: Do you confirm bid at 20 BTC, which is more than 110% of previous bid ?Alice> yBot>   Alice leads at 20 BTCand so on until :Code:Bot>   Auction has ended.  Alice wins the auction with 30 BTC.  Congratulations.* Bot sends log of this auction to the seller who will contact Alice for transaction.I know there is biddingpound.com but I just don't like websites. throttle or block ?  If it's just throttle, I doubt it would have a major impact, since bitcoin doesn't use much bandwith.Also, there is always the possibilities of bypassing restrictions, such as VPN, I2P, Tor etc. If some people created a bitcoin-dedicated ASIC, I'd be amazed.  It would be a strong indicator about how involved are some people into the bitcoin project. 1000 blocks to go.brocktice leads at 1270 BTCanyone at 1280 ? After an epic IRC battle one block before the end, Kiba wins the auction with 13 BTC.  Congratulations to him.Thanks everyone.Please notice I have an other auction for a gold coin that is currently running until block 100,000 :http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2209.0 Hum...  I see a Godwin point coming ....  This thread will be locked at block 98,990.The auction will then continue on IRC until block 99,000.It will be on freenode, #bitcoin-auctionhttp://webchat.freenode.net There is no jew:goy ratio on this forum. I don't know.  I guess I should.Does someone want an IRC for this auction ? Only 35 blocks left.It's late her and I'd like to get some sleep.Is everone Ok if I close this auctionn now ?(I'll take no answer in the next few blocks as a yes) Yeah I know right now there are only two companies, and a grand total of 2 shares (one in each).But it's just the beginning.http://grondilu.freeshell.org/brokerage.cgiBasically all you need is a GnuPG key in order to identify yourself and to authenticate your orders.  All signatures are logged so that you should audit everything which is done.It has been tested but I would not be suprised if problems would appear.This does not make compensation :  you transfer ownership of shares.  You have to trust other party to give you the bitcoins you expect.  Later I'll make a compensation service, plus a book order system. Come on guys, why can't you just admit that women are less interested in this kind of stuffs ?  To me it's not sexism, it is just realism.Women have a lower tendancy to be interested in pretty much anything.  Whether it is art, sport, games, science, whatever...  Almost all cultural movements have been initiated by men.I see two ways the sex ratio on this forum could reach 1:1 :1.  some people on this forum will create fake female members just in order to defeat what I've just written ;2.  bitcoin would have gone mainstream ; http://grondilu.freeshell.org/splosh-satoshi.wav I'm just realising that if bitcoin was to get some success as a currency (I think does already, but I may be a bit partial), then we'll have a truly international monetary system.Now when I hear politic leaders or economists or IMF's chairman Dominic Strauss-Kahn talking about the necessary international monetary reform, all those people sounds so dumb !They are just trying to make a terrible system work and they are completely unable to re-think it from scratch. I doubt xtranormal uses open source software for speech synthetisis.Here is "Bitcoin is a new digital currency created by Satoshi Nakamoto" made using the open source "festival" software.http://grondilu.freeshell.org/bitcoin.wav 100 blocks left to go. The .bitcoin file could look like this :Code:1Hy9dexzNzjvQYkYy6zKRVZMU8k2j5vuPt;1; some commentThe associated command would be :Code:#!/bin/bashif [[ -z "$1" ]]then echo "usage: $0 bitcoin-file" ; exit 1elif     addr="$(cut -d\; -f1 $1)"    [[ !

A bitcoin party !?Where ?  When ? ahh forget it.I'm about to finish writing my CGI script using GnuPG to transfer share holdings.It's a centralised method, but I think it's fine since the shares are holded in a centralised manner anyway.PS.  I'm just discovering openssl.   This programm is great.  It's kind of a swiss-army cryptograpihc knife.  I'll use that instead of GnuPG. If you don't have access to a machine you actually own, then you have to trust someone to hold your bitcoins for you.   Most famous here is mybitcoin.com.   But you should definitely try to install bitcoin in a machine at your home.  Maybe a smartphone if you don't have any PC where you currently live.  bitcoind has been reported to run on the Nokia N900.An other possibility would be a SSH access to a distant machine.  Some organisations offer free unix shells, which could be accessed from a web interface, I guess.   I personnaly use freeshell.org. I guess.  However I keep thinking it should not be integrated inside the client but as some kind of a bitcoin-tools package, amongst which we could also find the explorer functions of blockexplorer.com.I didn't know about gavin's tools.  I'll give it a look. Give it up, davout.  Gene is right.   It's a feature that is not necessary to bitcoin, and that could be implemented with an external, optionnal, program.Therefore, there is no reason to add it in the official client.  It would give unecessary additional work for programmers and would add potential points of failure.But I wish someone will eventually implement it as an external tool. Ah, my bad.  Isn't there really no easy way to send amounts from a particular address (apart from creating a wallet with only one address)  ? True.  We actualy don't need it.My initial post was intended to allow people to prove they own a private key.  It was intended to claim ownership of future paiements into the bitcoin address.  The idea was to ease a process a asset transfer.  It's completely different than proving you own a certain amount of money, which is in my opinion quite impossible  (since money could have been borrowed).Also, proving you own some money doesn't prevent you from lying about your intent to spend it. I was not very much convinced by my proposal for a system to transfer assets with the bitcoin network, so here is an other idea.The asset is defined somewhere on cyberspace, with a full textual description.  In this text there is a bitcoin address where coupons/dividends/whatever are to be paid. In order to transfer this asset, the owner basically just have to change the bitcoin address it is assigned to.I'll use again the idea of coding information into the amounts.So basically we need to code a bitcoin address into transactions amount.Let's take the following address as an example :1Hy9dexzNzjvQYkYy6zKRVZMU8k2j5vuPtWe turn it into hex :$ openssl dgst -rmd160 <<<1Hy9dexzNzjvQYkYy6zKRVZMU8k2j5vuPta370e25093b51a83e13864ff880afd5b95ff2615Split it into 4-characters-long parts :$ H=a370e25093b51a83e13864ff880afd5b95ff2615$ while echo ${H::4}; [[ -n "${H#????}" ]]; do H=${H#????}; donea370e25093b51a83e13864ff880afd5b95ff2615Turn them into sequentially ordered amounts :$ n=10$ for i in a370 e250 93b5 1a83 e138 64ff 880a fd5b 95ff 2615do echo $((n++*10**6+0x$i))done10041840110579361203781313006787140576561502585516034826170648591803839919009749we compute their sum (we could have done that during the previous step but it is simpler to present it like this for you)$ echo $((10041840+11057936+12037813+13006787+14057656+15025855+16034826+17064859+18038399+19009749))145375720We send this sum from an account called "treasury" to the address :$ bitcoind sendfrom treasury 1Hy9dexzNzjvQYkYy6zKRVZMU8k2j5vuPt 1.45375720We set an account for it :$ bitcoind setaccount 1Hy9dexzNzjvQYkYy6zKRVZMU8k2j5vuPt testaccountAnd finally we send the 10 amounts from the testaccount back to the treasury :$ addr=$(bitcoind getaccountaddress treasury)$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.10041840$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.11057936$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.12037813$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.13006787$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.14057656$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.15025855$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.16034826$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.17064859$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.18038399$ bitcoind sendfrom testaccount $addr 0.19009749Finally all we have to do is to write a programm that inspects the block chain in order to trace the full transaction log of the asset. True.  Sending *from* the address is good too.Also, the method doesn't have to be secure, since anyway it is not really very usefull to prove to someone taht you own some money.Alice could prove Bob she owns enough money, but at the end the moment of truth occurs during the real transaction from Alice to Bob.  It's easy to prove you own any amount of money.  Bacically you could even borrow it during a short period of time.  Big money owners could also sell this kind of proof to people (selling the "proof", not the money).What I mean is that proving you own some money is actualy quite useless in commercial relations anyway.  But if people really want to do it, they can do so with a relative security within the current bitoin implemenation. I've just realised that proving you own a particular address is actually not very difficult, even with the current bitcoin client.Say Alice wants to prove Bob that she owns the bitcoin addres $addrAll she has to do is to send a certain amount of bitcoin to this address.  This amount has to be high enough to convince Bob that it wasn't lost, and it has to have some entropy (so that it can be used to prove that it comes from Alice).So Alice tells Bob :A: ok, give me a high enough amount, with a few decimal numbers.B: hum, let's say pi :   3.14159264A: wait a sec...(Alice runs "bitcoind sendtoaddress $addr 3.14159264")A: here you go, check out the following transaction :  http://bitcoinexplorer.com/q/transaction/...B: fine, I guess you wouldn't accept to lose 3.14159264 bitcoins just to fool me.  So I beleive you own this address. I agree with gene when he says it should not be a bitcoin feature.  I was wrong to ask for an other subcommand of the bitcoind command.But could someone please work on a completely separate application that would read the wallet and use private ECDSA keys to sign documents ? I'm not sure about assassination, because you need facial recognition, plus a very long  operating range in order to find your target.But once you give those machines a good battery (maybe a fuel cell or something), then have it carry a gun and I fear for soldiers on battlefiled. kiba leads at 2.31 BTC Gosh I've just noticed that this thread has gone long.I haven't read everything, but I'd like to explain why I wanted this feature.I am writing a CGI script for my private stockholdings brokerage system.To that end, instead of using passwords, I wanted to use private keys.  So naturally I was planning to use GnuPG.  But during writing, I realised at some point the owner should send a bitcoin address where to receive dividends.  It seemed to me that I was using two keys pairs (a GnuPG one, and a ECDSA one), in order to identify the same person.  Since only ECDSA is really necessary (dividends have to go somewhere in the end), I realised that it might be better to identify owner with this pair.  It would also be better for confidentiallity (since most GnuPG keys use real names). Grant leads at 2.30 Well, I guess you're right. Ok then someone tells me how I can :- extract an ECDSA private key from a wallet file ;- use this key to sign data ;- verify data signed this way ; +1 Personnaly I'd be ok with that but I'm pretty sure most people won't.   Ploutocracy hasn't been moraly accepted since ancient greece. I'd like to be able to use one of my wallet keys to sign an ASCII text.syntax of the command would be :Code:$ bitcoind signwithaddress BITCOIN_ADRESS < somefile > somefile.asc$ bitcoind verifysignature < somefile.asccorrect signature done on DATE by address BITCOIN_ADRESSMessage was :....somefile.asc could be written in a form such as :---- BEGIN ECDSA SIGNED MESSAGE ----...---- END ECDSA SIGNED MESSAGE ----Or something like that.
Why would you want anything else ?  If you ignore moral aspects, then those activities fullfill what you were claiming for.I don't use gold as an ornementation personnaly, and yet I own gold because I know some people love gold jewelery.  Imagine how cool that would be :  you're walking in the street, minding your own business, suddenly a pizza delivering robot accidentaly drops its payload.  And here you go :  you got nice ready-to-eat pizzas falling from the sky !   Nice.  The important feature here is perching on a vertical surface, for it can allow the quadricopter to charge its battery.Indeed all you have to do is to place an induction loop on this very area.Verticality is important for it can dramatically reduce real estate price for the recharger building (One can use the main wall of a high tower).Those stuffs will be in cities delivering pizzas soon  ! Woow...  Indeed we have a winner.  This device has impressive stability, speed and acceleration.All it needs now is a performant battery and a way to recharge it without human intervention.  Then you put some guns on it and we're in Terminator...  kiba leads at 2.26 BTC Problem with a vote is that it brings bureaucraty in the system.  Peole will have to register to github, remember to participate to the votes, check on regular basis for new votes, and so on.  I don't like that.  Democracy doesn't fit cyberspace well, imo.  I very much prefer anarchy. Ok but in order to mine don't you need a full VHDL implementation of the miner code ?Because if you must communicate between your PC and your FPGA, this might slow it down quite a lot.Also I don't understand :  have you just done simulations or have you tried on the actual device ? kiba leads at 2.24 BTC This would be ideal, unfortunatly  0.01µBTC would eventually disappear due to mining fees.Also, I'm not sure those ten nanocoins could not be used by the bitcoin software in order to realise other non-related paiements.Moreover, what happens exactly when the address holds more than 0.01µBTC ? The owner could send to several addresses, and I don't know how one could know which destination was the "correct" one. There is no such thing as an identified "coin" in the system.  There are only transactions.  Once a coin is spent, it is just like a water drop in the sea. Well, he IS now, isn't he ?

In an other thread an asset exchange service was presented :  Loom  (https://loom.cc).This is quite an interesting service, although it is private, it requires invitation, and is centralised.I very much think it should be possible to do something similar using bitcoin and GnuPG.Say I own an asset which is fully described by an ASCII text file "myasset".In order to give it to Alice, whose GPG fingerprint is "Alice-FPT", I just sign the following document :In order to prevent double spending, or more precisely to prove that I have not already spent it, I timestamp the signature of this document into the bitcoin block chain.Then, when Alice wants to give Bob this asset, she signs this :And she also timestamp it in order to prevent double spending.And so on, each owner has to imbricate transfer documents, sign it and timestamp it in order to give it to someone else.

I think it would be a good candidate for an other implementation of bitcoin concepts.  Basically it would be the same service as Loom, but it would work in a decentralised manner, using bitcoin's time server.This could be neat, but it has to be more thought through.PS#2.  Hum, it's open source !  This is good, for it means anyone can run his own loom server.  This makes decentralisation not necessary. I think for the robotic courier network you want a quadricopter.  Seems much more accurate flying, with a much bigger payload.This one looks pretty neat :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cShsyaV1j6s This toy is so amazing that I consider making it possible to buy it for bitcoins.Basically I would invest some money to buy a bunch of them, and then I would sell them back against bitcoins.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oD3yAkT9sI Unfortunately the code is quite a bit more difficult to write.  Thus, until then the password system will be used.I did improve the CGI script though.  Now there is a proper form to enter password and hash.  It's also not limited to eBay any more :  DRDGold will be there too.http://grondilu.freeshell.org/brokerage.cgi kiba leads at 2.22 BTC
You'd better ask yourself whether you trust the US dollar more than gold.Gold is gold.  It is what it has always been.The US dollar is in terrible shape.  If USA don't default soon, they'll have to pay their debt with printed money.  And then the price of gold will go zimbabwean style. You can make a bid to nanotube.  I've tried to make it possible to sell the share after this auction.He owns the password that identifies the owner of the share.  You can buy him this password.PS.  I'm working on a CGI script that will be GnuPG based.  No password would be required to transfer ownership, you would just sign a text saying you give the share.

You don't get it.  It's not steganography at all.  You don't really send any data to the network.  It is the same amount of "data" injected, whether you timestamp a "hello world" or a 1Go tarball !It seems that I have to make an example to make it really clear.So, I'm going to time stamp the tarball version of bitcoin, version 0.3.19.First, I make a GPG signature of it :$ gpg -s bitcoin-0.3.19.tar.gzThis creates a bitcoin-0.3.19.tar.gz.gpg file, whose sha256 sum is :$ sha256sum bitcoin-0.3.19.tar.gz.gpg9e3d69700386772814b0e8c9723d8162c8d88c94479dbd24f18f280bI turn this hash into a bitcoin address using the convertor in bitcoin block explorer$ wget -O - -q http://blockexplorer.com/q/hashtoaddress/9e3d69700386772814b0e8c9723d8162c8d88c94479dbd24f18f280b1BehjJ4trLTY1G148PntLkzb99UYYg5qWEotEAGudWXaWFinally, I send 0.01 BTC to this address.$ bitcoind sendtoaddress 1BehjJ4trLTY1G148PntLkzb99UYYg5qWEotEAGudWXaW 0.01Hum...  bitcoin tells me it's an invalid address.  There must be a bug, but you get the idea, right ? Ne, mi ne partoprenas al iu esperanta grupo.  Mi lernis la esperantan nur rete, kaj babilas malofte (ne neniam, sed malofte). Please PM Satoshi.  That worths a try. Voilà j'ai créé quelques pages, et modifié la page d'acceuil.J'espère que je suis bien dans l'esprit du truc. Ça fonctionne bien quand je me connecte depuis un autre navigateur.  Ç'est clairement w3m qui fait des siennes amha. I thought is was clear since we've already talked about that in an other thread.I was obviously talking about a GPG signature.  But indeed a ECDSA signature would do.So I make a signature of my text, compute the sha256 hash of this signature, turn it into a valid bitcoin address(there is a function to do that somewhere), and finaly I send 0.01 bitcoin to this address.It doesn't cost the network more than a ordinary transaction would.PS.  The thread where this has been discussed :http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2077.msg28775#msg28775 That's what I thought : you don't really understand how it works.You are supposed to post a hash of the SIGNED file (in other words, the signature).   There's no point sending a hash of a file signed by someone else. Very true.Satoshi has created some kind of a decentralised giant clock.  It's ticking at an approximative rate of 6 ticks an hour.  Such a clock that can't be controlled by no one in particular will necessarly have some use in the future. Using publications, blogs and so on are not that good.  It's not as robust as bitcoin would be.  Because it depends on the assumption that the used public editor wouldn't care enough to take advantage of his status.  Basically an agreement could be secretly done between one of this editor and a wanna-be counterfainter.  So essentially this method is good as long as it is not too much generalised and that it doesn't catch too much attention.  Also, such methods are not systematic.  You basically need to find a good source of digital entropy, and hope that it is reproduced enough in the cyberspace, so that you can make sure that your added data will be preserved there.  It's not systematic, and requires quite some human work.I also don't understand why you consider using bitcoin for timestamping would "waste" the currency.  It's fondamentaly the same function that is used, only for different purpose.  Anyway I very much doubt the volume of timestamping transactions would be large enough to disturb the network.  As I see it, monetary purpose would be way larger than timestamping.Well, if you question the security of the hash algorithm, then you question everything.  This is way too much a big hypothesis.  Especially if you consider the possibility of a collision, as you seem to do.Doing a separate block chain specialised in timestamping of signed documents could be a possibility, indeed.  But I doubt their would be enough nodes to keep it running.  What would be the intencive for those nodes to mine ?  It is way much simpler to just use the current bitcoin network. I'm well aware that bitcoin timestamping is not accurate, but it is really not an issue at all.Since there is one new block every 10 minutes or so, globally bitcoin timestamping precision is more or less 10 minutes.Imagine I make a nice audiovisuel file (movie, song, whatever).  I can sign and timestamp the hash of this file, and now all I have to do is to wait at least a few hours before releasing the file.  Then there is no way anyone could sign my file and timestamp it inside a previous block.  It's just as much impossible as it is impossible to steal some bitcoins from the block chain.Accuracy is not the issue.  Robustness is.PS.  I don't care at all about what courts of law accept or not as a proof for time. Satoshi himself pointed out that using bitcoin as a timestamping service is something we can not prevent.  See here : http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2162.msg28533#msg28533.  Therefore, there is no point trying to prevent it from happening.And it does not add any complexity to the system.  At all. Grant initiates and leads the auction at 0.00001 BTC *** Edit:  THIS AUCTION HAS ENDED.    See end of thread.  ***Ok after I've successfully sold one eBay share, I'm quite exited about all the possibilities of this.I understand people prefer to buy shares of dividend paying companies.  Usually I don't sell this kind of shares.  But I've looked in my portfolio and I've found something.I own 10 DRDGold shares.  I'm ok to sell one of them.   This company DOES pay dividends.Last time I received dividends was on November, the 11th 2010.  I got ZAR 0.05 for my ten shares.  This was converted into EUR 0.05.Good thing about bitcoin is that it will be easy to convert it into bitcoins, since we have much enough decimal precision.So I'm selling one DRDGold share, with the same process than the one described on the eBay auction thread.  This will give me an opportunity to prove that I'm honnest since you should receive dividends within a year (I know it will be small with just one share, but we're just on the beginning of the bitcoin economy after all).  See this as a proof of concept if you want.No starting price.  Auction will end at block 99,000.PS.  Some info about DRDGold :ISIN :             ZAE000058723 mnemo euronext :   MLDUR.PAyahooquote MLDUR.PA :MLDUR.PA   DRDGOLD   0.38   12/16/2010   Paris    I've changed the code a bit so that the log is a bit more explicit.But I can't see the result until nanotube change the password.  I'm waiting for him to do so  hum... ça n'a pas l'air de fonctionner très bien chez moi.J'ai créé un compte mais dès que je suis déconnecté à chaque fois que j'essaie de suivre un lien.  En gros y'a que la première page après la connexion qui fonctionne.J'utilise w3m qui est un peut pointilleux sur les cookies, c'est peut-être pour ça. Good.  I've PMed you the current password.Again, I advise you to chose a bitcoin address for your first password.Then you change it to any other password (not necessarly a bitcoin address), so that your bitcoin address will appear in the log.http://grondilu.freeshell.org/eBayShare.logThe log is basically a list of all used passwords.The most recent bitcoin address I will see there will be the one which will collect dividends.So essentially in order to sell this share, all you have to do is to sell the pasword. Nanotube wins the auction with 10.01 BTC.I've set up a HTTP service in order to transfer the share.  See CGI script up in this thread.it can be called "by hand" or with the following program :Code:#!/bin/bashread -sp "Enter current password :"  currentread -sp "Enter new password :"  new1read -sp "Re-enter new password for confirmation :"  new2if [[ "$new1" = "$new2" ]]then    hash=$(openssl dgst -sha256 <<< "$new2")    wget -O - -q "http://grondilu.freeshell.org/eBayShare.cgi?passwd=$current&?hash=$hash"else    echo "confirmation failed"fiWhen eBay pays a dividend (if it does), then in order to claim it, the owner just has to change the password into a bitcoin address where he wants to receive paiement.Then he changes it again in order to make it appear in the log.I'll always use the most recent bitcoin address in the log for paiement.  So if you want to make sure you'll get the dividend, chose a bitcoin address as your first password, and then swich it to any other password.If you lose your password, theoretically you won't be able to transfer the share anymore.  But you will still receive dividends.I hope it's clear.Nanotube, I'll PM you the current password once I acknowledge the paiement of 10.01 BTC at the following address :1NkfLHmCRb7uYMwYiDpgxZwc9naxnxxQSCThanks everyone.
Recently I heard an interesting point of view concerning the Hunt brothers's attempt to corner silver.So they were carefully hoarding silver in switzerland.  At the beginning, everything went fine.  Silver price was surging from a few dollars to about 30$ an once.Problem was that at some point, silver was beginning to be scarce in the world, and the Hunt brothers were trapped because everybody understood what was happening.  They had a huge amount of silver that was theoretically priced at 30$/once.  But they just could not sell it at this price, because if they want to do so, they'd have to give their silver away and then the price would drop dramatically.That's the good thing about fixed aggregate money :  in order to benefit from it, you have to give it away.  Therefore a corner is generaly harmless. As announced, I lock the thread.The auction continues on freenode, #bitcoin-auction Using several trusted parties does improve the global trust, but it doesn't change the model.It's just as if you were advocating in favor of bankin gystem against bitcoin, saying that basically if you don't trust bank A, then you can withdraw your funds and go to bank B or C or D and so on...The model is alsways the same :  at the end of the day, you have to trust SOMEONE to take care of your data.With bitcoin, the model is completely different. Again :  timestamping is pretty much the core of bitcoin service.  The distributed time server is the most original idea of Satoshi's design.I just don't think any other solution is better. Also, if timestamping was to gain any importance in the future (for instance if it was used to validate official documents and so on...), then some people might be willing to counterfait them.  So there would be some fake Wikipedia mirrors that would make some fake timestamps.  It would then be difficult to prove that your timestamps are more genuine than others.Finaly, your trust in Wikipedia gives Wikipedia's bureaucrats a power they don't deserve imo.  They could, if they want, forge fake timestamps and then claim ownership of some intellectual work.Bitcoin's timestamping would be much more robust against counterfaiting.Truth is that if wikipedia was really reliable as a timestamping server, then we would just not need bitcoin at all (!).   Timestamping is pretty much the very core orignal service provided by bitcoin.  I doubt there exist anything in the cyberspace that can do it better. I'm not talking about a full destruction of the whole Wikipedia database.I'm talking about a cleaning of its history by most mirrors. Yeah, but then you'll have to trust those mirrors not to remove any data in the edition history.Personnaly I won't believe in Wikipedia's full persistence until it is fully P2P.  Just mirroring won't accomplish that, imo. Still, a would prefer a trust-free system.  Personnaly I don't think Wikipedia will last long.  Too much centralised.The fact that they depend on donations is a proof of that.  Had it been designed in a purely decentralised manner, they would not need that much money. Who needs a form anyway ?Just provide your password and new hash on url :http://grondilu.freeshell.org/eBayShare.cgi?passwd=XXXX&hash=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...Code:#!/usr/pkg/bin/bashecho "Content-type: text/html"echoif [[ -z "$QUERY_STRING" ]]then echo "no query string was given"else    eval "${QUERY_STRING//&/ }"    CURRENT_HASH=9790cacbd1dd2f886b3b251f3e3a087cb8484a3d6266a68ad00cc62b294d8960        if [[ !

This article will probably be removed, for it has no reference whatsoever.  It very much looks like original work, which is forbidden in wikipedia.You might consider write it in an other wiki, such as wikiberal. Now that Bitcoin is back on Wikipedia, we have an even better way that google trends for measuring bitcoin's popularity :http://stats.grok.se/en/201012/Bitcoin There is.  Again :  zero brokerage costs.  Better confidence in the system.  And so on. You're kidding but this will happen.  Private companies will issue their own cryptocurrencies.My guess is Google and Apple will be amongst the first ones to do so. bober182 leads at 10 BTC.I will soon lock this thread and continue the auction on freenode, #bitcoin-auctionthere is a webchat place for people not familiar with IRC :http://webchat.freenode.net 40 blocks to go.Cdeker still leads at 7.5 BTCShould I end this auction on IRC ? I'd like to mention that the idea of a local cryptocurrency doesn't make much sense.How do you intend to prevent your currency from spreading abroad and thus becoming an international currency ?  Do you plan in controling internet and restrict access inside your geographic area or something ?This doesn't make much sense.  Sure, you can initiate a cryptocurrency in your country.  But it's not much different from bitcoin, which probably started in USA (or maybe Japan, only Satoshi knows). Different Genesis block, different port, but also a different name please !   It's not that difficult.  Dark pools exist and are actualy quite successful.
Corporations are NOT creations of the state.  They are private associations of people.I can't ensure that the corporation won't fool me.  This is what trust, reputation, and responsability is about in a free market.  If I get screwed, I get screwed.  Period.  State should have nothing to do with that.Yes, stocks and bonds are counterparty risk.  So what ?  It's up to me to price this risk during my bidding. The password idea is not so bad after all.I'm planning on making a CGI script on my website, in order to allow the buyer to give the auction to someone else without having to bother me I suck in HTML forms, but basically it should be a pretty simple bash script :Code:#!/bin/bashecho Content-type: text/htmlechoecho "<head><title>Grondilu's brokerage</title></head>"echo "<body>"echo "With this form you can give the eBay share to someone else,"echo "providing you know the current passord, whose sha256 is :"hash=$(tail -1 ebay-passwd-sha256)echo "<p>$hash"echo '<form> <input type="text" name="newhash" value="">New hash: </input> </form>'Or something like that. I don't knwow github well.  Is there a tarball somewhere ? As a human being, and more generaly as breathing animal, I sometimes have to inhale oxygen, turn it into carbon dioxyde and then expell it.  So I do emit CO2 sometimes to times.Should I have to buy CO2 rights in order to be allowed to do so ? A decentralized equity market would hve no brokerage fees.  This is good enough a reason do make it real, to me.I don't care if it's illegal or if it can be used for money laundering or whatever.  Laws are decided by people.  I'm part of 'people' so I give my opinion and I say I wish anonymous ownership of shares was legal. No, I don't.  There is only the rpcpassword line. The share is currently held in my boursorama account.  Boursorama is a famous french online bank (http://www.boursorama.com).   I doubt it is possible to transfer a specific share from one account to another.  Selling the share would cost me almost the price of the share itself, for brokerage fees for US shares are enormous (about 20EUR).   So the answer to your question is no, sorry.

Franchement avec une architecture AMD64, ce serait bête de mettre un système 32 bits.Tu devrais vraiment réinstaller.  Pour ton home, fait une archive que tu redéploiras sur ton nouveau système.  T'as pas trop le choix, désolé.PS.  Voilà les instructions que j'ai trouvées sur le manuel de ma distrib (aptosid) : Oh ça a bougé depuis quelques jours !  Je pensais que je recevrais un email...Vivement que ça aboutisse.  Ce sera très bon pour bitcoin si le programme fait partie des dépots officiels, même dans la branche instable. :-/ ?  Cxu estas lakto en pico !?   Cxiukaze, ne gravas.Nu, tion mi certe provos.  Dankon. J'ai essayé Arch jadis.  J'ai pas été convaincu par le gestionnaire de paquets.  Le poids des habitudes, peut-être. No, I haven't modified my wallet.  However I've noticed that "generate" is put back to "false" each time I restart bitcoind. The block number IS the timestamps ! I'm running bitcoind version 0.3.19I've noticed that generation halts for unknown reason."getinfo" tells me "generate" : false,Yet I've never runned bitcoind setgenerate false (as far as I know).
I pledge 1000 BTC if the girl is topless. It's quite similar to currencies but I'd like to mention possible use of bitcoin for equities market.A company would modify the bitcoin software to create its own cryptocurrency.  The total amount would be much lower, so that the company could make it possible to own the whole initial stock (running the software alone during some time before realease, for instance). I'll add 100BTC for a working implementation.I doubt it will be done any time soon, though. bober182 leads at 5 BTC Jes, mi interesegas pri tiu picoservo.  Eble mi partoprenos.Mi ankaux partoprenos je la IRC kunvenado morgaux, sed nur se mi gxin memoros ! If by "standard unix tools" you mean ASCII output to stdout, then ok : just have the export function ouput private keys in an ASCII format to stdout.  Such a function should be used with care though, because it's easy to forget to redirect stdout. Ok but could I be registered in your website as an escrow for my local area ? Then I think what you really need is an "export" function, which has been requested several times in this forum.Basically it would allow to export some bitcoins into some private keys in a wallet file.  Of course there would be also an "import" function, for antagonist purspose. That's what I thought too. We could do the same for pretty much any shop that offers home delivery.I could exchange Suchis for bitcoins, for instance. Is that even possible to put a transaction into a file ?  What would that mean exactly ?I mean : I don't understand what would such a file consist of. What do you mean, mizerydearia ?  Am I missing something ? Cdecker leads at 2.5 BTC I'm ok to act as a third party for pizza deliveries in Paris, France.

Ouhh le vilain troll    The problem is that I keep those shares for myself  ! Cdecker leads at 1.5 BTC
davout leads at 1.00000001 BTC(yes, I don't care how small is the increment.) Cdecker leads at 1 BTC. I don't understand.  Please be clearer.  Do you bid at 1 BTC ? You can't know for sure if it will pay a dividend or not.  eBay's policy is not to pay any in short term.  But it might change.And you will be able to sell it, providing you find a buyer. Tiens nous courant.  Ça m'intrigue ton histoire.  J'aurais pensé que le programme 32 bits aurait tourné sur une machine 64 avec un système 32. Une distrib 32 bits peut tourner sur une machine 64 bits, mais c'est pas réciproque.Tu devrais installer la version 64 bits d'Ubuntu amha.  Ou mieux :  installe la vraie Debian (Ubuntu, c'est naze).Je pense que ça devrait régler ton problème.Tu peux vérifier que c'est bien ça le souci avec un live CD (ça t'éviteras de changer ton OS pour rien).  Si tu veux pas perdre de temsp en téléchargeant un live CD complet d'Ubuntu ou Debian, tu peux essayer avec Damn Small Linux, qui fait environ 50 Mo.PS:  j'arrive pas à me décider à t'écrire en français ou en anglais  Hum,  weird.  What's your Ubuntu version ? Donc comme je disais : pas de sudo, et pas de sh.Juste :.../bitcoin/bin/32 $ ./bitcoin It's not a shell script, but a binary executable !  And you don't have to sudo it.So you must run :Code:pogo@pogo-desktop:~/Téléchargements/bitcoin-0.3.19-linux/bitcoin-0.3.19/bin/32$ ./bitcoin davout leads at 0.00000101 BTCCome on guys, won't any of you bid at least 1 BTC ? grrr....  Well,  I guess it's better than nothing.Grant leads the auction at 0.000001 BTC Kio estas softvaro ?  Aro de softvoj ?   Indeed their bitcoin address for donation is on their "helpout" page, whih is less easy to find :http://www.eff.org/helpout I don't quite follow you.  You should trust nobody.You don't intend to store your wallet without encrypting it, do you ? I don't like passords.  It's much simpler to just sign bitcoin addresses.  If we can't do it with the very ECDSA addresses, then we'll just use GnuPG.A gives me his public key and I sign a document saying :I give my eBay share to A, whose public key is ....Then if A wants to sell it to B, he writes and sign a similar document :I give my eBay share to B, whose public key is ....and so on.It's basically the same as the way bitcoin works, except that we don't need all the double spending check, since I'll take care of that. Splitting your wallet is not a bad idea.  Just be carefull to leave more than one instance of each part, though.Actually if you use N computers, then I think you should make N copies for each Nth part of your file, otherwise you increase the risk of loosing everything in case one computer is down.  But you need to study it more seriously if you want an exact probabilistic approach to this.Anyway, spliting a file in several parts is easy in unix.  Just use the 'split' command. I don't get it.  If you buy my share, you give me a bitcoin address where I will put the dividends.If you sell it later to someone, you just give me a new bitcoin address which will not be yours but his's.Seems simple enough to me.Maybe to make it even clearer the seller can use the signing feature of ECDSA to indicate the new address. As I said, at any time you will be able to sell the share, providing you find a buyer.  Therefore there is no reason to put a end date, especially since I doubt eBay will pay any dividend in the next two years. Well, it's not as if you were investing thounsands of dollars, anyway.  We're talking about ONE share of ebay, which is about 20$ I think.  Hang on, let me check ::r!yahooquote EBAYEBAY   eBay Inc.   30.75   12/14/2010   NasdaqNM   Ok... $30.75 is a little more than I thought.  Still, it's not exactly a huge amount.  So I hope you will agree with me that it's too a small amount to speculate on someone's death !I'm not in killer shape but I'm ok and I'm pretty sure I will survive at least a few decades more. Men do more stuffs.  Both good and bad.  Women are just followers.
Well, what other explanation do you have to the 3.5:1 sex ratio on this forum ?PS.  I've just checked :  the sex ratio is actually 5:1 ! Although I think bitcoin is the best currency ever invented, in my opinion it is NOT the best method of paiement.  It is not the fastest, and there are limitations on the number of transactions per unit of time.What I mean is that for many small daily purchases, the conventional bank account system is probably a better solution.  We have talked about it many times on this forum.  Personnaly I think using David Chaum's digital cash would be a very good solution for most daily purchases.So, in order to buy a coffee in your shop, you first get an bitcoin account in this shop.  And you fund this account on regular basis.  Once a month, for instance. Again, this is essentially what any broker do.Also, nothing prevents you from pricing this risk and thus to give a low bid, considering that I might be a thief or die next year.An eBay share that I sell certainly worths less than an eBay share sold by an official broker.  But it doesn't worth 0BTC. I can't unfortunately "give" you the share.  Too much fees would be included for transfering it.Basically owning a share means you have a vote right (but who cares about that for such a small quantity of shares ?) and the right to get the dividend.I can promess I'll transfer the dividend.  All I can do to convince you that it is the same as owning the share, is to engage my reputation.Basically I do pretty much what my bank is doing for me :  they own the share and they engage their reputation when they promess they'll pay me the dividend.As for eBay's dividend policy is concerned, they have NEVER paid any dividend, but they might do in the future.  It's up to you to beleive in that or not.I don't.  That's why I sell the share.Notice that if you buy the share to me, you will be able to sell it to someone else later.  Basically all you'll have to do is to give me a new bitcoin address. *** EDIT:  THIS AUCTION IS CLOSED NOW.  See end of thread ***I own one ebay share in my portfolio.As an experiment, I sell it for bitcoins.  What this means, is that I hereby promess (yes, you have to trust me), that if at any time I receive some dividends from eBay, I will convert them into bitcoins, and transfer it to you.I'll make a short auction for this.  No starting price.  Auction will end at block 98,000 brocktice leads at 1270(in english should I say "leads at" or "leads with" ?) Serait-il opportun de créer une association loi 1901 ?Une telle association pourrait s'appeler AFUB :  "Association Française des Utilisateurs de Bitcoin".  Malheureusement cet aconyme est déjà pris, ironiquement, par l' Association Française des Utilisateurs de Banques".En tout cas, parmi les éventuels objectifs d'une telle association, je vois les suivantes :- informer sur les cryptodevises, et en particulier sur bitcoin ;- offrir une place de marché pour les échanges physiques cash/bitcoin ;- rechercher et répertorier les éventuels commerces acceptant les bitcoins ;- offrir un stockage physiquement sécurisé pour les archives de portefeuille (après chiffrage par le détenteur, bien sûr) ;- défendre et représenter des éventuels utilisateurs menacés par la justice ou par quiconque, du fait de leur utilisation de cryptodevises ; Ahh...  My bad.   I'm afraid I can't change it now, unless I send an email to the webmaster.I could write a surfraw elvi now, though.PS.  Nevermind I created a "bitcoin" command with the search feature. I disagree with you when you say a bitcoin address is ugly or unfriendly.  It is fine.I actually prefer a plain ASCII address to a "bitcoin button" because I don't know exactly what a "bitcoin button" really do behind the scene.We should not adapt to people's intellectual laziness.  Ultimately they'll grow up and understand why a plain ASCII address is better. Lol.  Mi sxatas vian cinikecon.  Certe la legxaro estas grava temo.  Bedauxrinde cxi tie homoj sciaj ne multe pri legxo.

What is the purpose of the program ?Because if it is what I think it is, I guess we could solve the problem in a completly different way than with a chrome extension. davout leads at 1269.64380952 BTCAnyone at 1270 ?

I don't play poker but I have to say that I'm interested in the technical problem of fair online poker games.I know that poker used to be played on IRC and I'd be delighted if this habit could come back.  If poker was played on IRC with a free software I may start playing. I'll be there thursday if I remember it. Physical gold ? My first gold auction was concluded on block 90,000 if I remember well.  Log can be found on this very forum.Before this I sold some silver coins.  I guess it was in the beginning of october. It is.I know you can use a service such as mybitcoin, but this is different.  Any currency can be "used" with a service like that.But indirectly, the bitcoin is necessary *at some point*.  Mybitcoin.com does use the bitcoin software.  It is just behind the scene. If I'm poor, I chose USD.  Because short term will prevail, since everything will be spent in a few weeks anyway.If I'm wealthy, I chose BTC.  Because in a few years dollars will worth almost nothing.PS.  I voted BTC
It really does way too much look like a advertisement.  I'll try to make it sound more neutral when I get some time. brocktice leads at 1202 BTC S3052 leads at 1201 BTC davout leads at 1163.418 BTC brocktice leads at 700 BTC S3052 leads at 651 BTCNb.  I should stop saying this auction is "fun".Let me remind everyone :THIS IS A REAL AUCTION.  DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T REALLY INTEND TO BUY THE COIN !Also, please avoid using smileys inside your bid.  Let's keep it serious, if possible.We don't want to attract non serious bidders. davout leads at 650 BTCNo, it's funnier without any increments minima.   Yes, right now BTC is not as liquid as USD.  Give it time.  This currency is only about 1 year old, after all. It happens that this morning I heard about a french company who offers a service for paiement via mobile phone.  Basically it uses only sound to transmit data, so it can be used with pretty much any phone.  I forgot the name of the company, though.I'm pretty sure there are hundreds of solutions like this.  No offense, but I believe your stuff, cyclos, is just one of them.PS.  ok I've found the name of the company :  TagPay.http://www.tagpay.fr I think there are many banking/accounting systems that could be used with bitcoin.Beyond being a method of paiement, bitcoin is a CURRENCY.  As such, it can be used in conjonction with any of the current financial system techniques.I personnaly prefer the use of the digital cash from David Chaum, but this cyclos system looks good as well. Hum...  good question.Because if he mentions bitcoin in 2011, and gets elected as PotUS in 2012, then technically the correct answer will be 2011, right ? Yeah I know it's a stupid poll, since nobody could guess that.  But I'd be curious to have an idea of how quick bitcoin users think this money could get famous.PS.  I voted 2013 True.  I'd say we may already see this as we can see an other surge for the keyword "bitcoin" in google trends :http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoin Indeed I see only "Pass" for each assessment.However, I guess only an administrator can put the page back.  I guess they won't hurry. Hum...  seems like a good candidate for a gateway from bitcoin to Visa/ATM. Oh sorry I hadn't pay enough attention.  Indeed deb.tuxsoul.com is the repo from the author of the first post of this thread.  My bad. Tell me about it !  Maybe it just passed below their radar...PS.   check out the history of the page and see who is the main author  yeah that's what I thought.You have a pb with your repository.  Anyway it's not related to bitcoin at all. Well, if a CGI script generates a new address (or account number ?) for each visit, there is no way the public could make a list of used address, could it ?  I mean, each address would be visible by the donator and by the donator only, right ? And from stable repo come only php4-eaccelerator.[/quote]hum, I'm sorry but what is this the output of ?
Well, a new address would only be generated on each visit of the "donate" page, not the main page.  I don't think it would be that much space consuming on disk.Also, is there any other way to prevent public to know how much have been donated ? I'm tempted to buy it but I kind of feel like I will regret it.Not because I will lose 0.10 BTC, but because it may hurt my eyes irreversibly. Please notice that if you want to use a different address for each donation, you can.A small CGI script can do the trick.  See there :http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1796.0 I actually do see a bitcoin address on the I2p webpage.This is good news.  I'll give 1 BTC. Those debates about coding style in C++ are part of the reasons why I've never been much enthusiastic about this language.What about a plain C implementation of bitcoin ?  Do we really need object paradigm for this anyway ? What are you talking about ?  Why would this destroy the internet ?? I usually create a specific chann but if I'm welcome on #bitcoin-auction, ok why not.  Thanks. wobber leaads at 503 BTC Well, after some thinking, I think it's finally not a good idea indeed.First, indeed there is no incentive to seed torrents.  Therefore, you can not be sure all blocks will be available unless you store them on yur own node.Second, bitcoin requires quick communication between nodes, for transactions.  Therefore it needs its own communication network anyway.  So using it to exchange blocks is a small payload.Anyway, I now kind of trust Satoshi to have come up with a pretty good network structure.  I doubt we could do much better. I don't know.  Maybe.   Anyway, what we really need is a distributed database, imo. +1 !I've already smitted this idea on the "python client" thread.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=231.msg28952#msg28952I also whish those files would be in ASCII, so that we implement the bitcoin client in a scripting language.One question is :  is it possible to share several hundreds of thousands of files in P2P ?We could consider using the GNUnet framework, because I think it can be used with a datastore, instead of files. I think it's important to be ready for a change in the sha function when it's necessary.  It might require a change of both the software and the block chain, I guess.However, there is no reason to jump into it until SHA256 is cracked.I also hope it will not lead to any weirdness/incoherence in the code or in the blockchain.What I'd like to see is a fork of bitcoin with this new hash function, so that people/market can decide which is better. I think the title was fine.  It any case, it wasn't "lazy journalism".The journalist asked if the "wikileaks scandal could lead to a new currency".  This is a legitimate question, for the seizure of wikileaks's accounts revealed the NEED of a decentralised currency.  To put it simply, this affair is not linked to the creation of bitcoin, but to its upcoming notoriety.  En Belgique peut-être ?  Un belge de ce forum peut-il se renseigner ?Je me rend parfois à Bruxelles donc je pourrais en profiter pour acheter des cartes si nécessaire. Well, I guess you're right :  at least ther should be a comment.But anyway we know Satoshi's code is poorly commented.  It is just an example amonst many others. LolAs the name of the variable indicates it, it's the genesis block.   I guess it's the public key of the first ever bitcoins.This is certainly not the best critic of Satoshi's code you can make. I agree.  Actually I'm amazed this is the product of only one person's work. Was it ?   It's certainly correlated, then.  The amount of new visitors blew up the bitcoin website.Thanks for pointing it out. Please confirm your bid at 502 BTC S3052 leads at 501 BTC
davout leads at 500 BTC From France.   All informations about the coin can be found on the web.  The swiss 20 CHF gold coin is quite famous.  It has the same gold value and purity as the french napoleon. S3052 leads at 210 BTC MagicalTux initiates the auction and leads at 100 BTC. After a few successful sellings of 1g mini gold bars, I now start the first ever gold coin auction on this forum.So, this is a standard 20 CHF (swiss franc) gold coin.  See internet for details about this coin.No starting price.  Price will include postal fees to wherever in the world.  It will be a standard letter.  I will just hide carefully the coin into the letter.  It should be fine.Auction will end at block number 100,000.  At this time, I will lock this thread and thus close the auction.  I might close it a bit earlier and end the auction on IRC, though.DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T REALLY INTEND TO BUY THE COIN.   I will require paiement before sending it anyway, so there is no point making fake bids.Do not PM to make your bid.  Just post it in this thread.Have fun ! I've always thought that the only known possible attacks could allow double spendin or freeze the whole network.I doubt any attack could steal private keys, apart from conventionnal attacks to the file system.But I'm not an expert at all. Good.  There is a official packaging in progress for debian :  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=578157But it's progressing very slowly.  Hopefully you could help. Personnaly I think Satoshi's code is quite tough to understand, that's why I'd like to see other implementations, for instance in python.I also wonder whether it could be possible to split the program into different parts.For instance, blocks could be downloaded and shared with a standard P2P program.  One file per block.  I know that may be beyond the maximum number of opened files on most OS but...  I'd like also to see those files in ASCII, and not in binary.  Same for wallets.  Performance is not an issue with bitcoin anyway, execpt for generation.  So ASCII could be fine.Also, the libcrypto++-utils package contains command line tools to use cryptographic functions, such as ECDSA.Using standard P2P program, command line tools and ASCII files could allow to write the full bitcoin client in a bash script.  I think this would be pretty cool. Having people working for you, for instance.Or building your own business.  It is work too, but by work I meant the kind of work you were talking about : the waged work. The more implementations we have, the better.Unfortunately, writting a client is no easy task.   Satoshi's code is far from from trivial. Because the banker might have paid him to do so, for instance. Dude, quoting a signed email like this is totally not cool...I hope you won't do that with the mails I sent you. A 3rd party audit is just a displacement of the trust from the bank to an auditing company.  It doesn't solve anything. +1 Well, they'll tell you you can.  Truth is you won't.What I mean is that even with a bitcoin bank, despite the technical possibility for a customer to withdraw his funds at any time, statistical laws can be found, allowinng the bank to determine an optimal reserve ratio. Notice that nothing prevents an islamic banker to lend your money (with no interest of course), to someone.This means that you could also lose your savings with this system.There's nothing wrong in fractionnal reserve banking, as long as the customer knows what is is doing.  He is giving his money to someone else.  There is necessarly a risk involved. This is a highly important post, imo.  Thanks.When I first red Satoshi's design paper, I immediately thought that there would be something very useful with this concept of a distributed time server.  However, I wasn't quite able to see exactly what it would be.I think you've pined it.Say I'm an artist and I've just created something that holds into a file.  In order to protect the paternity of my work, signing is not enough.  Because anyone could sign a copy of the unsigned file.  Therefore I have to find a way to prove that I've been the first one who signed this document.Bitcoin can allow me to do this, just as you described it.  I sign my file.  I turn the hash of the signed document into a bitcoin address, and I send a small amount to this address.I think this could have a huge impact on artistic creation. Well, you're supposed to trust a bunch of bureaucrats who will audit the bank and check that everything is in order and that the accounts have not been falsified. I think those activities come naturally once you start collecting and storing money from the public.When you collect money from the public, you can not just sit on that money, doing nothing.  It would be a waste of resource.  You will eventually decide to do something with it, without telling your clients if necessary.That's why banking is usually described as an unseparable set of apparently different activities :  collecting, storing, offering credit and so on... How do you know they are 100% reserved ?Anyway, it might be a good idea to do it.  The banker could make money on transactions and the deposit could be rewarded with an interest.  This would be a comeback to basics of banking.  It could be fun and educational.I would not be interested as an investor anyway, for I've always prefered equity shares than debentures.
Which banks are you talking about, exactly ? Insist.Give them a link to mybitcoin.com and to mt Gox. Ouais j'avais vu ça aussi.  Mais effectivement c'est nominatif et il y a un délai de plusieurs jours je crois.Je doute qu'une version anonyme et en libre service existe en France. Madhatter cherche des collaborateurs pour proposer des cartes VISA (giftcards) contre des bitcoins.J'ai bien trouvé des "cartes cadeaux" (KADEOS) à la poste mais ce ne sont pas des cartes VISA.  Ça y ressemble mais non, ça permet juste d'acheter dans divers magasins (genre Fnac, printemps, conforama, en fait les ensignes du groupe PPR on dirait...).D'après lui on doit pouvoir trouver de vrais cartes cadeaux VISA dans les stations services ou dans des "épiceries" ("grocery store").Comme il fait super froid en ce moment j'ai pas très envie de faire le tour des stations services pour trouver ça...Vous en avez déjà vu de telles cartes en France, vous ? Ok I understand now, but a political system is not a philosophy.Politics is all about making decisions, including those implying the use of coercion.  Therefore, I doubt it makes any sense to claim being both socialist and libertarian.  Socialism is about forbidding free market and private ownership.  Socialism can not be libertarian. Petitions !?  You're kidding, right ?  lol This will be great news once it is confirmed on their official website. No, there isn't anyone who "decides" that, apart from the collective result of individual behaviors. There is actually a sex ratio available on the forum member stats  (remember you're asked about your sex during registration).I think it's currently 3.5:1, which imo probably under evaluated.Women are too busy shopping and grooming, to be interested in stuffs like cryptography, monetary systems, economics or politics. I'll attach here my synfig file as I'll be working on it. Well it is/was anonymous banking, it's not cryptocurrency, is it ? I don't know exactly what you mean by "left", but to me it means "communism", or "socialism".  It is very much incompatible with free market.So to me, "free market socialism" is an oxymore.  I guess I'll have to read about that. No offense but, what does that mean ?  How can you be in favor of free market and claim being "left" ? Ne estas nur pri facileco, sed ankaux pri konfideco.Mi ne volas klaki tian butonon.  Kiel mi povus konfidi tion ?Ni parolas pri pagado.  Pagado estas serioza ado.  Gxi ne povas esti nur klakado.  Oni devas uzi la veran bitkojnan ilon.Se estas uloj kiuj estas tro stultaj je iun komputilon uzi, jen ili ne meritas uzi gxin. Shares are property.  You can give some to employees only if there are shareholders who agree to give part of their property.  In the same way, a employee can buy shares only if they are people who agree to sell. Wages and capital are not equivalent, realy. You confuse *benefit* and *income*.And even so, salaries are *part* of the income of the company, they are not *shares*.People working on commission receive a part of sales, not benefits.  An employee can receive a huge commission even if its employer has made no benefits.Again, benefits are whatever has been earned, minus whatever has been spent.  Salaries, commissions and things like that, are expenses. Indeed.  I don't understand those people making some browser extensions to send bitcoin tips.  Seriously, how hard is it to copy paste a bitcoin address ? I'm sorry but no, it is not.Salary is not a share of the benefits.  Benefits are what's left once salaries and other expenses have been paid.Salary is a previously agreed amount of money that is paid to an employee in exchange for his work.  It is the same whatever is the financial situation of the company, whether it is in deficit or in benefit. Well, are you ok with people working for a  salary instead of a share of the benefits of the company they work for ?If you are, then you're ancap.  Otherwise, you're leftist. I own a n900 too so I might think it's cool to have bitcoin running on it.An yet, I doubt it will be useful.  Especialy since I don't store any personnal data on my phone (except for backup after encryption).I mean, the n900 is awesome but anyone who gets his hands on it could see all my personnal data.  :/I don't know how you guys cope with that, but personnaly I can't.
Keep It Simple, Stupid ! Check out a thread I've just opened about a project I've started :http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2136.0 I used synfig once to do small animation on the wikipedia page about time travel.  Check it out there :  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel#Ideas_from_fictionI'd like to do something similar for bitcoin. First, we explain the current banking model with a classic Alice and Bob situation :Then we show how such a model tends to make people dependant on a highly centralized organisation :We explain that such centralisation induces complexity and therefore costs.Thus we introduce the P2P model, getting rid of the bank :We explain that everynode receive every single transactions, and in order to determin who will play the role of the bank, we have them perform a CPU spending task : Finally we explain what happens when a node has finally performed this task :This is just a first draft, but it's the global way I see it.Suggestions welcome. Bah, c'est mieux que rien...    Et puis s'il ajoute des machines, il finira bien par générer un peu.Faut pas le décourager. I've just been reading the introductory brochurehttp://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Lojban%20Introductory%20Brochureand it seems interesting enough for me to start trying to learn it.Who knows, maybe in short time I'll translate the bitcoin main page into lojban  Hum...  I don't get this.  Why do fees have anything to do with this ?  Fees are added to the subsidy from existing bitcoin stock.  It doesn't reduce creation at all. You can get real time bitcoin support on IRC on irc.freenode.net, channel #bitcoin-dev for instance.I advise you to learn about IRC.  Learn the basics commands and install a good IRC client :  irssiYou will run irssi inside a terminal.  Once you'll be comfortable on IRC, me or someone else will help you in real time. Are you familiar with IRC ?  I have time right now I can help you with this if you want. Hum... yes indeed.  I don't know then.  I don't know much about OS X anyway.  But it's a Unix, right ?  I don't see why it should not be possible to run bitcoind.  Have you tried "make -f makefile.osx bitcoind" ? OMG, you're kidding, right ?   Do you plan on reinventing NNTP or something   ? Yes it would.  Check out the file "build-osx.txt" on the bitcoin source code. You don't need awk for such basic tasks.  Use grep and sed.   They are vey useful basic Unix filters.  You should learn them.And throw your Mac away.  Use a real operating system.  Not this marketting crap.PS.  You don't want the <"> ?   Then just use sed 's/"//g'     Well if someone has really no choice, it's ok I guess.   But as far as I'm concerned, I won't claim anything until I am really really broke, starving and with no roof upon my head. The problem with that is you won't be able to defend your liberal ideas.  People will, with good reasons, claim that you oppose the very thing you live on.If you want to stand as an example, you can't accept any money from government. There is just no good reason why one should put something in someone's healthy body without his agreement.  No matter how hard you tried to convince him.  If at the end you failed, you just can't force him.  Period. +1 Sounds very reasonable.  Don't try too hard to rationalize though.It's not just a matter of arithmetics of economics.  It's also a matter of self-estim and being capable of sticking to your principles. It just occured to me how similar are these two projects.  Somehow, I wonder if one can not consider bitcoin to be to money what esperanto is to language.I just hope I'm wrong, because I wish bitcoin gets more success than esperanto did.Anyway, here are the similarities I'm talking about.First, it's an artificial construction from one person.  Zamenhof for esperanto, Satoshi for bitcoin.  The "artificial" aspect is what most opponent of esperanto and bitcoin are willing to advance when rejecting them.  Esperanto is not a "real" language, and bitcoin is "backed by nothing", will they say.Second, both have the same empire as an opponent.  English for esperanto.  Dollar for bitcoin.Finally, both are international projects.  They are designed to put every countries on the exact same level.Esperanto is more than an hundred years now.  It's quite an efficient language and it has shown many times that it is a better language for international communication.  Unfortunately, people are still not much convinced by it.I'm afraid something similar could happen to bitcoin.  A few millions people will use it and will prove that it is a better money than any other else, but they will just fail in convincing other people about that.  Even after an hundred years.Again, I hope I'm wrong. Cxu bitkojno  havos la saman ontecon ol la internacia lingvo ?De pli ol cent jaroj, tiu lingvo ekzistas, sed ni devas konfesi, ke gxi ne vere sukcesas.  Nur kelkaj milionoj da homoj parolas gxin.Cxu bikojno estos por la dolaro kio, tio la esperanta estas por la angla ?Mi esperas ke ne. Well, I did try to modify the code and surprisingly enough, it DID compile without warning !I just changed the function in main.cpp :Code:int64 GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64 nFees){    int64 nSubsidy = 69.314603663439556*exp(-log(2)*nHeight/21e4)*COIN;    return nSubsidy + nFees;}I'd like to try that in a test network.
This guy is good at making explanatory animations, but he has some biased ideas about money imo.  I'm not sure he likes the bitcoin concept anyway.We'd better brainstorm to come up with a good script, in a first place.Here is an idea :First we remind the viewer how the traditionnel banking model is organized.  We show how a priviledged node, the banker, holds *accounts* of customers, and how every transaction has to pass through the banker, who just checks signatures and amounts.Then we show how bitcoin model is similar, except that everybody has a copy of the accunts book, and that eveybody can play the role of the banker.  Who is actually the banker is decided randomly thanks to a CPU task that takes about 10 minutes to complete.   We show how this avoids the problem of double spending. With a small CGI script, it should be possible to create a new address for each donator, so that it would be impossible to trace donations.I've posted something like this on an other thread...  I'll try to find it.PS.  Here it is :  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1796.msg22114#msg22114 Hum...  Are you using bitcoin instead of bitcoind   If so, don't.And don't chain "grep -v" instances.  Use -e option.  And read the grep manual page for your own sake. Use grep.  Or use a language that reads JSON, and have this language print what you want. Jolie métaphore ! Won't be enough IMO.  They still can receive donations from cash in the mail or Bank wire.They might turn into bitcoin once Governments cease Wikileaks's bank accounts. I don't know.I don't even know how the software deals with "concurrent" block chains.  How can it know which one will be the longest one before it downloads them ?  Does it download both ?Here is my guess though :  the program downloads whatever blocks are available on the network, without any particular order.   In the same time, it attempts to find out the linear sequence.  Thus, blocks who doesn't fit, or fit a short sequence, are simply ignored.   That's how I'd do it.Also, I doubt the program takes only the chain length into account.  Otherwise it would be too easy.  It has to be rather the sum of difficulties, or something like that. Well, isn't difficulty easy to guess with the hash of the block itself ??  I mean, difficulty is related to the threshold the hash must be inferior to in order to be accepted.  Therefore, the smaller the hash, the bigger is the difficulty (although it's rather a majoration or something). I'm gonna go a bit off-topic but honnestly I kind of doubt that working is the best way to earn money in life :/ Do you plan on publishing your production numbers and how it will have been distributed amonst participants ?I'm quite skeptical about pool mining but maybe if you can show me it actually works I'll be convinced to join. So true  I doubt bitcoin can be considered as "scientific" and personnaly I think that edition as you seem to understand it is not much needed nowadays.I think Satoshi's white paper was quite good, and it is already publicly available.   I appreciate his pragmatic attitude consisting in actually doing stuff instead of claiming and waiting for other people's help or recognition. Dude, is that supposed to be funny ? We're not here yet   Anyway I believe granularity could be increase without too many difficulties, whether by a change in the code, or by the use of 128-bit processors.Also, other cryptocurrencies could be used for small transactions, same as silver and copper were used during gold standard. Has anyone ever succeeded in selling you 1g of coffee for the price of 1kg ??More seriuosly, bitcoin is nothing but a unit of measure.  At some point, well talk about centibitcoins, microbitcoins and "coins" (the smallest unit, which is 10 nanobitcoin).Here is a summary :MegaBitcoin :   1 MBTC = 10^6 BTCKiloBitcoin :   1 kBTC = 10^3 BTCcentiBitcoin:   1 cBTC = 10^-2 BTCmilliBitcoin:   1 mBTC = 10^-3 BTCmicroBitcoin:   1 µBTC = 10^-6 BTCcoin:      1 COIN = 10 nBTC = 10^-8 BTC"coin" is a exception to the naming convention because it's how Satoshi call it in the source code. Agreed.  The good thing with commercial exchange is that it allows people to interact without killing each other.  Commercial exchange should never involve any use of violence.If you got screwed in a commercial transaction, it's not the end of the word.  Don't ask society to raise hell just to repair your mistake. There is no magic in the existing financial system.  If you can get your money back, it means THERE IS an escrow service included.  You've just not been consulted about it.  But it does exist and its price is part of the transaction cost.Bitcoin system just makes the two processes (money transfer and compensation) more clearly separated. You can do many things with guns, indeed.  Maybe at some point governments will torture citizens to obtain passphrases.Anyway cash can not always be re-appropriated, because it can just have been spent.  There are many irrersible ways of spending money.So again bitcoins are not much different from cash for that matter, really. Tyler's answer was way funnier than the joke itself ! Bitcoin is not worse than cash, for that matter.  The concept of money doesn't provide any security nor insurance for your transactions.Yes, some governments might dislike bitcoins.  But the whole point of the design of bitcoin is to make them incapable of doing anything against that.
1) Even if a client was redirected to fake other clients, then he would probably retrieve a ridiculously short block chain.  This would look much suscpicious.2) DoS attacks are indeed an issue.  It is partially resolved with transaction fees mechanism.  And remember this could in no way result in acquiring other's bitcoins.  I think it might allow double spending, at worst.3) All transaction history is in the block chain.5) Hum...  About this I confess I don't know.  I guess it would result in the irreversible fork of bitcoin into two separate cryptocurrencies.For your final point, remember that bitcoin transaction are irrevocable.  There is no way you can force someone to give you your money back.  And, no, this doesn't make it unsuitable for commerce.  Some compensation/escrow services can be used for that. Indeed I meant that it's not under a free software licence.  I'm a FOSS integrist, therefore I can't install it. There are many ways bitcoin could be used in physical stores.Some guys here are planning on creating printed bitcoins, using QR code or stuffs like that.An other possibility would be to do everything wia wifi, for instance using smartphones running a full bitcoin client, or using a web interface such as mybitcoin.com.I personnaly think the best would be if each store could act as a bitcoin bank.  Basically you would have a bitcoin account in the shop, and you'll use with conventionnal banking-like transaction for every day purchases.  You would only transfer bitcoin something like say one in a month, just to fill up your account.   Such accounts could also use David Chaum's digital cash, so that stores could act like private money issuers.I don't think bitcoin will put a end to banking system.  On the contrary, it will democratize it. Wow I was just wondering if something like could be possible...  I'll check it out immediately.Decentralisation of internet is going fast !PS.   Just checked it.  It's not free software.  So I can't install it. IMO the bitcoin chain is probably the most indestructible piece of Data on the Internet.(and gold is not a molecule) Well done Bruce,you were quite intimidated at the beginning, but once the dialogue was instaured, it was actually a very pleasant conversation to hear.Great promotion for the network,PS.  It's too bad bitcoin.org was not more mentionned, though.  Exactly. Then opposite to "subjective" is "objective", not "intrinsic".I've been defending subjective theory of value for a long time now, and yet I consider that "intrinsic" value keeps a meaning even in subjective theory of value.  Exeamples have been given.In subjective theory of value, I can value an object because I desire it.  But if I desire it for itself, i.e. I don't intend to trade it for something else, then I say this value is intrinsic.  It's an intrinsic subjective value.  There is no paradox here. And yet, they do.I mean :  the value of an ice cream is obviously more "intrinsic" that the value of a 1$ bank note.    Don't you get it ?I can eat and enjoy the former, while I need to trade the latter against something if I want to get any benefit from it. "cryptocave" is a funny word once you consider the ethymologic meaning of "crypt". Ah maybe intrinsic is not a correct word, but still, it has some meaning.To me, value is a mesure of desire.  And I think desire is a bit different when it is only motivated by the belief in someone else's desire.  Maybe I should have talked about "real" value as opposed to "speculative" value. I wrote this article in a very famous french linux website.   It brought 1067 visits to bitcoin.org.http://linuxfr.org/2010/09/30/27430.html Agreed.  It has to be indestrucible, divisable and scarce. By "intrisic", I didn't mean beyond human judgment or anything.It was rather as opposed to "conventionnal" or "arbitrary".Value is the faculty for something to be desired by a human being.  Now, someone can desire something because he thinks someone else will desire it and thus it will be possible to trade it.Therefore, I think we can say that something has intrisic value when there is at least one human being who can desire to possess it without ever giving it away to someone else. Sure, but it's quite marginal.  I think we can, for the sake of the argumentation, consider it has no value.Anyway I'm just realizing how futile is this debate, considering that fiat currencies ARE money with no intrisic value.Somehow it's amazing people accuse gold of not having any value when they don't do the same to fiat money. Well, unless I'm wrong about the difference between those concepts, I'm currently talking about money. Well, this is not characteristic to physical commodities.  It's the whole point of bitcoin.  It is hard to produce, though it has no intrisic value. Thanks for that.  It's actually the first time I visit such a link.Some websites have difficulties with governments (wikileaks, piratebay...).  Do they know about this stuff ? The thread about "money as debt" from P. Grignon makes me think about this old debate concerning the intrisic value of money.It's a debate I had many times with people having contempt for gold, describing it as a "useless soft metal" or a "barbarous relic".  I also think that gold is mainly useless, or more precisely, that its use is only based on the fact that it is ideal as a money, due to its remarquable properties.However, I confess I'd have some difficulties explaining why money doesn't need intrisic value.  I have ideas about this but it's still quite confuse.What do you think about that and can you elaborate ? A producer issueing papers redeemable for his future production, isn't that just the definition of a future contract ?Basically it seems to me that modern finance has already created Grignon's ideas and much beyond...He just wants to make them available for everyone, which is a good intent.  But I don't get exactly what is his proposal from a technical point of view.Anyway, I have the feeling that Grignon just can't accept the idea that money can have no intrisic value.  He seems not to like gold for this reason.  And I guess he will not like bitcoin for the same reason.Some people think that money should be backed by something real, whatever it is.  I totally disagree.  I beleive money is a pure abstract medium of exchange.  If money had intrisic value, we would not use it as money.
I once suggested this idea too.  But it appeared it might be a bad idea.  It would be a bit as if you were claiming publicly that you fraud tax. I've just received my Vim and Debian T-shirts that I bought thanks to this service.This is very cool   AIDS comes from a polio vaccine.I know most scientists think it is not true, but I'm still waiting for a better explanation.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPV_AIDS_hypothesis brocktice won the auction with 230 BTC. OMG How close are we to provide a way to survive in this world without a bank account ? What exactly are [comment] and |comment-to]  ??  I thought it was not possible to attach a comment to a transaction.And what are the size limits ? brocktice leads on IRC at 210 BTC.I lock this thread now.  Make your bid on IRC please.#1gGold-auction on freenode Yeah I have some trouble.  That's why I can't lock this thread yet.fergalish leads at 205 I made a #1gGold-auction channel on freenode 30 blocks to go.Highest bid is still 200. and cleaned it thorously. Seriously, GUI doesn't have to be part of the bitcoin project.  There are many free software project that had only console client during long time.  GUI came after, as a different wrapper project.  And this is the way things should work.  For exemple, GnuPG can be used inside different kinds of MUA.  I'm sure there are many other exemples. this story is crap. I've just watched this first video.  Nothing new under the sun.This is privately issued money.  It is a good thing, and it should be more used.  It's based on the trust from the public towards an issuer.  It should be easy to do on internet.  By the way, to some extend, one can consider stock shares to be such a kind of money.Also, I don't believe hoarding to be a problem.  Especially if the money is divisable enough, as bitcoin is.  But we've discussed about that already in this forum.  Search deflation in topic.Finally, I find it hard to believe that at the end, he proposes his perpetual coin to be related to the US dollar.  WTF !?His perpetual coinn obviously has to be bitcoin, or at least a cryptocurrency. The size of a message is not a matter of bandwidth, but rather a matter of mind lazyness.  If you read a long message just to realize at the end that it was just crap, then you can consider you got screwed.  You would have prefer a shorter message.Therefore short messages has to be rewarded.  Thus, to me it make sense to pay more for longer messages. In your ideal society you would soon realize how ineffective it is to sollicitate your direct neighbors for security.  You'll realise it's better to hire some people just for this task.  They would get some special training and, unlike your neighbors, they would be ready to act 24/7.  You'll give them some guns and a uniform.  And finally you'll call them "police".   Only difference with the current police, would be that your police would be a private organisation, founded by your neighborhood, in your neigborhood's interest. 90 voters out of 1200 members, that's too few imo.Isn't there a welcome message or something where we could direct newbies to this poll ? Indeed.  I'll send an email in case they need any help. It seems that the debian bitcoin team is getting close :From: Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>To: Matt Taggart <taggart@debian.org>, 578157@bugs.debian.orgSubject: Re: Bug#578157: bitcoin 0.3.17 availableDate: Sat, 27 Nov 2010 11:27:59 +0100[Message part 1 (text/plain, inline)]Hi Matt,On Sat, Nov 27, 2010 at 01:36:07AM -0800, Matt Taggart wrote:>I was just looking at bitcoin and found this ITP.

What about a system where people pay to post ?  0.01BTC per word, for instance.  This way people would think twice before posting.The question is :  what to do with the money.  It could be sent back to previous posters, proportionnaly to their amount of posting.PS.  There could be a market for "words".  It could be fun. I wrote this already on this thread.  FRB is ok as long as it is not enforced and if other systems are not prohibited. Maybe but many of them are confronted to the problem of money transfer, for they have to transfer the money they eran in Europe to their familly.So they could be much interested in bitcoins. It's too bad we don't have any Indian nor african people.  And only one chinese.We should promote bitcoin in these countries. +1 Why ?  The creation of money comes both from the borrower AND from the lender.  It's an association.  The borrower gets the money he asked for, and the lender gets the interest, which is the reward for the paperwork and the risk. I like anarcho-capitalism, but I don't believe in anarchy, for I can't ignore the paradoxical idea of forbidding the use of force without using force.  And to me, "no rule" is still a rule.I could consider myself as a minarchist, since I think the state should not care about economy, and that it should only focus on the monopole of force.I'm considering objectivism and individualism.  But it's kind of new for me, I still have to think it through. I was thinking about the whole business activity, not just as far as money is concern.  Sales, acquisition of material, expenses, salaries, etc...  All this can not be reduced in terms of monetary transactions. As I understand it, whether I got this from books or web or whatever, capitalism is a vision of economy based on the possibility of ownership of means of production.And beyond that, it's also the idea that this property can be divided into shares.  Those shares can be exchanged as any property, and they are used to divide the power of decision concerning the capital, amongst which is the distribution of profits via dividends. But relying on a regulation authority only moves the problem from one point to an other.Anyway, a bitcoin-like system is no solution for this, for no cryptographic currency will check the accounts books of the company, nor will it make sure the voting process during the assembly is honnest, and so on...You can use regulation authorities if you want, but they have to be private and based only on their reputation.  And companies can chose to hire one, or to be their own. When you buy a share of a company, you are already supposed to have some confindence into this company.  Otherwise you would just not buy any of its shares.Therefore there is no point looking for a third trust party.  The trust party IS the company itself.PS.  By the way :  companies ARE oversight, by shareholders.  During general assembly, they are shown the books of the company, and any shareholder can ask any question he wants, even if he owns only one share.  If shareholders want even more control, they can decide it.  The company is their property, there is almost nothing they can not do. brocktice leads at 200 BTC I'm sorry but I keep thinking it does make sense to keep a centralised model for equities.Equities are issued by a precise entity : the concerned entreprise.  Therefore it does make sense thazt this enterprise is responsible of issuing and managing its shares.  Using a decentralzed model such as bitcoin would make the system more colmplex with very few benefit. Yeah I've been thinking about that for a long time, but finally I concluded that it is not appropriate.1.  this means you will have a different block chain for each stock.  With CPU power used for each of these chains.  Doesn't look good ;2.  You need to trust someone anyway : the person who is holding the "real" stocks, or ultimately the enterprise.  Therefore there is no point using a decentralised network. There is also the problem of the vote right.  But this is easy, since when I receive a convocation for a general assembly, I am always given the possibility to be represented by someone else.So I could easily give the name of my buyer if he wants to attend the assembly and use his vote right. Hurry up guys, gold is rising !  (cf. attached file) I personnaly own several hundreds lines of european stocks.I could sell them for bitcoins.  Basically this will mean that I will agree to convert all dividends into bitcoins and to tranfer them to my buyer.Only problem is taxation.  Because I'll have to declare those dividends as my personnal income.  So it's not that easy but hopefully I won't pay any income tax anyway... I've just posted a topic with more or less the same concern.Indeed the issue is much more political than technical.  It would, indeed, be illegal in almost all countries.Still, I don't care if it is illegal.  This should exist, and I hope it will.But such a black equity market would have to be extremely cautious, in order not to get caught.Transactions should be negociated via encrypted communications, but even in that case there is the risk the network gets infiltrated by a government agent.Therefore, it is tricky. That THE thing I would like to see :  a trust network for buying or selling stockshares with bitcoins.Here is how it would work.People would own conventionnal stockholding accounts on conventionnal banks.But those people would not be the real owners of these stocks.   Real ownership will be managed on a encrypted network, whether it is centralized or not.When a dividend is detached, the conventionnal account holder is supposed to transfer the corresponding amount, after conversion into bitcoin, to the "real" owner, who is identified only by a bitcoin address.The amounts between conventionnal accounts should be adjusted (using conventionnal bank transfer), so that the amount per owner is as low as possible, in order to avoid excessive taxation.Utlimately, the number of participants would be large enough so that the amount for each account would be small enough not to induce any taxation on income. fergalish leads at 190 btc
300 blocks to go.brocktice still leads with 180 BTC.Anyone for 190 ? Actually when I think about it, the focus should be put on the halving of reward every 4 years instead of continuity to the current scheme.This means that :(1-A)^210000 = 0.5And thus :A = 1 - exp(-log(2)/210000) =  3.3e-6Which means that the initial reward would have been of 69.314603663439556  instead of 50.A reward of 50 would have occured at block n where :A * (1-A)^n * 21000000 = 50n = 98958.561684339962I guess we could round it to block number 99000Anyway : it's not too late !!PS.  I'm not very serious here because I agree with you that it's a bit more complex and it may not worth it.  Still, I think it's quite elegant. Indeed.  That was silly of me.  I just have difficulties to realize how easy it is to create a Visa with this stuff. You're kidding ?  Of course it would be nice.  Although I'm not sure I could use them in Europe.  But that would worth a try. Lol.  I'm french and I thought that was common knowledge.  But indeed I realise now that it is not obvious for non french people. I kind of fear the 210,000 block.  As you know at this time the reward will half from 50 to 25.  I'm not sure the behavior of miners is predictable.  I wonder if weird things could happen at this moment.Anyway, why not just use a more continous formula ?  I mean if we want to simulate extraction of a commodity, all we need is a geometric progression, right ?So, say N(i) is the remaining number of btc to be extracted at block number i.The reward is then r(i) = N(i) - N(i+1)We then need A such that :  r(i) = A * N(i)Of course, we have N(0) = 21,000,000 = \sum r(i)  and N(i+1) = (1-A)* N(i)We need to chose A so that we can switch smoothly from the current situation (r(i) = 50 BTC) to the coninuous sytem.Let's say we do the change at block 100,000.   At this point 5 million bitcoins will have been extracted.     That leaves 16 millions.N(1e5) = 16e6So :   A = 50/16e6 = 3.125e-6Then r(100,000 + i) = 3.125e-6 * (1-3.125e-6)^i * 16,000,000So the generation is a continuous function of the block number. Very true.  Fixed aggregate money system have this in common.  There is no point hoarding the money if you never spend it, and when you do spend it, then you share it with other people, which solves the initial problem.But I think that's something most socialo-anarchist don't seem to understand, and that's why they dislike gold, and probably they will dislike bitcoins too. Well, yeah it's pretty much exact, although thecurrent banking system isd not as outrzgeous as presented in this movie.Basically when a banker makes a loan, he does indeed creates money out of nothing but the promess from the borrower to repay this.  But this is not as wrong as suggested in the movie.  By doing so, the banker kind of work as a juridic notifier : he makes the promess official before the public, the law and society.   I think it's quite a clever system.   In my opinion it's ok as long as it is not forced and if other systems are not prohibited. I was trying to be ironic here.  Truly I believe bitcoins are much harder to control than cash, for cash has a physical existence, while a bitcoin wallet, once encrypted, is just a bunch of bits. I'm sure you can't ignore that police checks mail when it's suspicious.I've bought some gold in the past.  I was receiving it by mail and many of my letters had obviously been instpected. Am I the only one who thinks it would be way more simple to just rent distant shell access ?? Yes indeed.  Governments can't do anything against people sending some stuff via mail, of course Therefore there is no reason why we should worry about governments doing anything against bitcoin. I don't know what you mean by "stable", since we're talking about pricing in $.   I know the dollar has not already plunged, but in the long term, we can't hope for any stable BTC/USD rate anyway.  Otherwise, it would deny the whole purpose of bitcoin. A lot of people have just been hoarding bitcoins so far.  And suddenly Madhatter makes it possible for them to spend their bitcoins anywhere on the web.  No wonder his cards are sold quickly.I think he should raise his prices, or sell his cards with an auction process. I did.Somebody (I think it was you) said it was not a good idea to publicly brainstorm about how to counter bitcoin.I thought it made sense. I can't help noticing the irony of these T-shirts being sold in $ Have you been living in a cave or something  ?  I'd like to have your views on my post about the selling of information with bitcoins.  See there :  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1344.0In order to sell an image, one solution would be to sell a blured image.  You would display the blured image on your website, and you would improve it for each additionnal paiement.To do so you could use for instance imagemagick :convert original_image.jpg  -blur ${N}x${N} blured_image.jpgWhere ${N}  would be the size of the blur filter (the smaller it is, the better is the image). Sorry, your system seems quite well thought, indeed.  I hadn't been paying enough attention.Still, I keep thinking that renting ssh access would be much simpler a solution. hum... l'auteur de cet article, c'était pas un certain grondilu, par hasard  ?Sinon concernant ce qu'on prévoit de pouvoir acheter avec des bitcoins, grâce à Madhatter on peut déjà acheter presque n'importe quoi, vu qu'on peut acheter des cartes bancaires jetables.Moi j'ai commandé un T-shirt Vim et un autre Debian.  Je devrais les recevoir bientôt.
To me it seems that cooperative mining is a tough task, because the honnesty of participants has to be checked.  What's preventing someone to run a modified version of the client, that would just keep generated bitcoin for himself, while receiving bitcoins from others ?I wonder if it wouldn't be simpler to just rent processing power.  For instance by renting a ssh access to each machine.The price could be directly proportionnal to the total number of computed hashes. Salut,tu as de la chance de pouvoir générer.  C'est quoi ton matériel ?Sinon si tu cherches un acheteur pour ta production, fais le moi savoir.Comme tu es en France, je peux t'envoyer un chèque.  ça me coutera seulement le prix d'un timbre poste.PS.  et aussi, stp dis-nous comment tu as appris l'existence de bitcoin. Isn't cooperative mining a form of communism ?Personnaly I gave this a thought and I think it's useless and much harder to do than one might think.First I thought it was a problem if only a few nodes were capable of mining.  Now I don't care anymore.  Even if only one was mining all new bitcoins, I wouldn't care much.  This node would do all the work recquired, and in the best way.   Plus, anyone can take its place if it can hash more. My market webpage is back in business.  I removed many of previous order, because too much water has flown under the bridge.There is no reason why I should only sell metal there :  so I changed the presentation to say that it is a place where you can exchange bitcoins against pretty much anything that can be sent via postal mail.  This includes bank notes.http://grondilu.freeshell.org Nope.  A software is immaterial.  It cost nothing to copy.  It's different in robotics, unless you build a self-reproductive robot.  Wild science fiction again.If someone has really no hope in hopening the safe,  they would throw it for sure.Plus, throwing a safe is certainly less fun than destroying a robot. It would be way more easy to use bitcoin directly.  But until people realize that, a compatibility layer is a good thing. This is wild science fiction.  Moreover, I doubt such autonomous robots would be a good thing.Robots belong to people.  There is no point building a robot who belongs to no-one.  I also disagree about vandalism being discouraged.  If I had such a robot in front of me, I could destroy it, not for the bitcoins, but just for fun.  That's what vandalism is about : it is not theft, it is pure desctruction for the sake of destruction.The only way to prevent vandalism would be to give robots some kind of rights, which is even wilder science fiction. Done.  Basically I'm just offering to provide euros and bitcoins in order to add EUR/BTC exchange to your website. I don't use the GUI anymore.  I use only the headless client.I think it would be much easier to integrate bitcoin in linux distributions if there was no gui.And I think it would be good for bitcoin if it could be directly available through package repositories of main linux distributions.Wouldn't it be great if debian users could just "apt-get install bitcoin" ? Maybe you should PM satoshi about this. Gosh I'm way too lazy to do this kind of stuff... Well, freewear.org 's paiement methods were Paypal or bank transfer.  So I had to create a Paypal account.Still, Madhatter has done something great.  I can't deny it. I doubt a peer-to-peer system is appropriate if you have to make thousands of transactions per minute.   Because all transactions have to spread to the network.  This necessarly takes some time, and I'm not even talking about the process time (hashing of the blocks).Therefore, cryptocurrencies have an intrinsic limit to the speed it can process transactions.For very fast transaction, the account/centralised system can be used, as long as it is backed by bitcoins. If you really need huge number of micropaiements per client per day, I'd suggest you to use a different paiement system.You could use an account-based paiement system.  Optionnaly this could use David Chaum's e-cash system if you want anonymity.Anyway, your clients would have an account on your server, and they could change their balance into bitcoin when it reaches a significtive amount, or on a daily basis. With bitcoin, everyone is his own bank.  Therefore I doubt the idea of an iternet open bank would be much different than the bitcoin system. I finally managed to pay for my Vim and Debian T-shirts on freewear.org.I had to create a paypal account though  But I very much prefer giving Paypal a virtual card, rather than my "hard" card number.Seriously what you've done is great, Madhatter.  You might have a serious business model and financial activity, there.In conjonction with your bitcoin4cash service, this just kicks ass !Do you have any idea if this could be done in Europe, too ?If you need a financial partner to make similar services in euros and in Europe, let me know.  If you need investors to help you get some funds, let me know as well.Also, could you explain this ?  (it's from your FAQ)    <<    How do I check the balance of my card? / How do I activate the    card? / How do I set the name/address on the card for online/telephone    use?    Due to the fact that we use more than one bank these details are revealed    after your purchase has been made.    >>For instance I've just bought for about CAD$70 of T-shirts.  Now I should have about CAD$30 left on my balance.I'd like to make sure of this in order to sell the remaining amount against bitcoins.Edit.OMG this is so cool !   I've managed to credit my shareholding account of EUR20 (a little less than CAD$30) directly using this.This is great.  I guess now my balance is about EUR2.2.  What would happen if I try to transfer 10 ?  I guess the paiement would just be refused, right ?Edit again.  Ok I get it !  I can check the balance here :  www.mybalance.caOMG this is really a great stuff !  Damned it Canada is quite a liberal country !! Just bought a $100  virtual card.   The process was quick and easy.I'm looking forward to buy some stuffs with that.  I hope it will work fine.Thanks again Madhatter ! Agreed.  I don't see many other solutions than this one. Indeed.  We should write a "Why you should mine" document.  We would explain why it is important to contribute to the CPU power of the network, even if it is likely that this will not be rewarded in bitcoins. Anyway, it wouldn't be so bad for bitcoins.  The top miners bring something valuable to the network :  a huge CPU power.  This improves the network stability and security.  It's normal that this is rewarded.
I think people should keep hashing anyway.From an individual point of view, it's not very interesting.   But many small computers make a significative CPU power, so it's good from a community point of view.Therefore I think we should keep encouraging people to mine, even if they only have small computers. Hum, thanks for that.  I'm reading it.  One question.  When you compute \lambda_10, you obtain :\lambda_10 = C*h/DAnd you compute C = 10 * 86,400 * H_{min}/H_{max} = 0.0002 s^-1Are you sure C is in the dimension of seconds^-1 ?     I think it's rather in seconds.One thing you did not take into account is the fact that you will probably buy other machines in the future.  Anyway, it's an interesting document.  Thanks again.  It should be in the wiki or something. brocktice leads at 180 I'll try that soon.  I'll try to buy a Vim t-shirt with bitcoins.  I've been wanting to buy one for some time now.  I'll use this as a pretext to do so. Idem.  I hope there will be more stuffs to buy in the future. I partially agree.  Indeed there is no real point in hoarding any kind of money.  There are much better ways of investing :  shareholdings, precious metals, gov. bonds (if you like this crap), and so on...However, saving money is not that bad either.  It's pretty much a matter of personnal choice.  But I don't think it's bad for an economy.  Besides, "economy" in some languages (such as french) litteraly means "savings".I'd say it's ok to save in monetary units when you have some value to preserve, but you don't trust any other asset. OMG  If it really works as it claims, it is just REVOLUTIONNARY.It seems so awesome I have difficulties believing in it. Still, it would be nice if the bitcoin website had a japanese translation. WTF is a bounty ?? mikegogulski leads at 150 I'm not sure I understand your pb correctly but...  I guess you could make a symlink from a virtual fs to $HOME/.bitcoin, and crontab a backup of your wallet. davout leads at 90Nb.  well a subway ticket is actually more expensive than a postal stamp.  And I don't like walking that much   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Want_Your_Soul I red somewhere that the only 100% sure way to erase data on a disk is to expose it to a 1,200°C temperature. Sorry for your loss  Always backup your wallet.  One on a distant server, and one on a portable storage device.  Encrypt both.Doesn't really matter for the bitcoin system.  It's just as if you did throw an once of gold in the ocean.BTW, maybe your wallet is not lost.  Search for data recovery tools. Very true.  The point is indeed that such a monopoly would not be enforced in any way.  Nothing prevents you from competing for hash generation.  Basically all you need is a powerful machine, an internet connection, and a little motivation. brocktice leads at 75 En tout cas j'annonce que si des parisiens génèrent des bitcoins et souhaitent les vendre, je peux les leur acheter cash, pour des transactions de quelques dizaines d'euros (pas plus sinon c'est risqué amha). brocktice leads at BTC50Anyone at 60 ? Edit.  Please notice I won't always be able to aknowledge bids as quickly as I've been doing it so far.  I'm a human being and sometimes I have to sleep, work, eat, and so on...   There would be no point for them in generating bitcoins if they don't sell them at some point.  And if they don't, that gives even more value to the remaining, circulating bitcoins.I really don't care if bitcoins are generated by a few people.  As long as this generation has a quantitative limit, it doesn't really matter.  At some point they will have to abandon their bitcoins if they want to benefit from it.  That's the good thing with fixed aggregate money.
I think it is the fourth time I sell gold on this forum.  Each transaction occured with no problem.  Ask around.I bought these mini bars with some certificates, but I dumped them.  I'm not interested in owning paper.I think 1g is enough a small amount so that it doesn't require any insurance.  I'll hide the bar carfully inside the enveloppe, and I'll send it as a normal letter.  It should be fine.I aknowledge your bid of 25 BTC.So, fergalish leads the auction with 25 BTC. nanotube initiates the auction and leads with 10 BTC. ** Edit.  THIS AUCTION IS CLOSED NOW.  See end of thread. **Here is an other auction for a 1g mini gold bar (see attached photo).Price will include postal fees to wherever in the world.  No starting price.DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T REALLY INTEND TO BUY THE BAR.  Payment will be required before the bar is sent anyway, so there is no point making a fake bid.The auction will end at block number 95,000.  At this time, I will lock this thread and thus end the auction.I may lock it a bit earlier and continue the auction on IRC if I see several people interested.Do not PM to post your bid.  Just put it in this thread, so that others can see what's happening. Well, I wouldn't mind.   Those people would just have a fair reward for their contribution to bitcoin security.  It would be fine with me. It seems higly unlikely. I mean : the higher the difficulty gets, the more people are using bitcoins, right ?I know that it may also be seen as a result of the increase of computing power of commercial machines, but I doubt it is that significant.So :  can I consider the difficulty as a good indicator of bitcoin's popularity ? Je sais pas si tu m'as inclu, mais moi aussi je suis à Paris.Ce serait bien d'avoir un lieu physique pour les échanges, en effet.  L'idéal serait quelqu'un qui possède un bureau de change.  Amha ça viendra tôt ou tard.L'ennui c'est qu'à mon avis pour l'instant il n'y a que des acheteurs.  A moins qu'il y ait ici quelques hasheurs qui souhateraient écouler leur production. Précise ton idée stp.  Tu parles d'une place physique ou juste un site web ? +1 This has absolutely no reason to be integrated into bitcoin.  Just make it as a separate software if you really want something like that.K.I.S.S. Sure you can do that.  But in a separate project.  The whole point of bitcoin is not to depend on someone else trust for security.  Therefore, I don't care if some people are unable or unwilling to be responsible for the security of their data.  Those people could just as well use only mybitcoin.com.If you want you can create a software that will wrap the headless bitcoin client and add a nice security layer around it.  But there is no reason to put any of it inside the bitcoin client itself. I think mesh networks, such as Netsukuku or Batman, work more or less like this.  But these are not internet networks anymore.  They are alternative, quite experimental, networking protocols. J'iamgine que c'est possible.  Ça a quelle taille une clef privée ? Check this out : http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoin I agree, even if that was not really my point.  Motivation, initiative and will are highly important in any human activity, including scientific research.  Clearly intellectual energy would be much better used in a liberal manner. This is very much NOT my point.  Please read my initial post again.  Or maybe I should rewrite it.What I call useless is the intellectual work which is dedicated not to actual research, but only in the determination of the smartest people.  Once those smart people are detetected, they are given high social status, without any real requirement for them to do any real actual scientific research.  This is a waste of good brain power, and it is a very wrong basis for society. You are responsible of the security of your data.  So there is no "best practice".Personnaly I encrypt backups with GnuPG, and I use a ecryptfs virtual encrypted Private directory to store my wallet.dat file.None of this solution should be included in bitcoin, because I think bitcoin should adhere to the UNIX philosophy : "do only one thing, but do it well". Agreed.  For many reasons.Maybe it makes sense to keep a list of organisations which accept bitcoin donations.  But such a list should consist in organisation names and website links.  Nothing more, and certainly not the actual bitcoin addresses. What exactly is the purpose of this site ?? +1
Still, it's good stuff.  There's nothing wrong in criticizing.   And I think consumer society actualy worths some critics.I like left-oriented people when they make these kinds of things. I like it .  It's actually good music. Democracy is certainly not the best system in cyberspace, where scarcity doesn't exist.In real life democracy, the minority has to comply to the decision of the majority.  But in cyberspace, there is room for everyone.  Any minority which doesn't agree with majority can build its own "kingdom".  Sessessionism and autocratism are better fit in cyberspace.For instance, Satoshi is bitcoin's autocrat, as Linus Torwalds is for linux, Marc Shuttleworth for Ubuntu, and so on.  And there is nothing wrond with that. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTUY16CkS-k bitcoin4cash.comIt's humanized, but it has worked fine so far. Thanks !I'm sure some people will find this useful. There are transaction fees which were designed for that.And no, there is just no way I'll buy a currency whose total amount is constantly growing, no matter how slow is this growing rate.  I don't want to spend days and days watching a total amount number on my computer, wondering if I should or not sell the corresponding currency. WTF ?!  What's preventing him from just BUYING some ?For me you sound just as if you were willing to have some stuff for nothing.Bitcoin is a money.  It doesn't come with a free beer.Edit.I'm sorry to say that, but this whole speech about "it would be more fair if we give everyone a same amount for starting", smells so much like communism, I can't help saying it loud.  Yes, it seems to me it is just a way to put some socialist ideas about money.Cryptocurrencies are like gold.  Socialists don't like them.  Because they can't control it.  Because they can't steal it "to the rich to give to the poor".  They think it's "unfair".Let's imagine we can distribute a same part of the 21 millions bitcoins for everyone in the world.  Say, 7 billions humans.  That will be 0.003 BTC.  Ok, everything is fine and fair, now, hum ?  For how long ?  What to do with every new born child after that, hum ?  And after some time, when some people will just spend their bitcoins and return to nothing, while some others will just hoard bitcoins, you'll have the same inequalities you were complaining about.  So what was you point ?  You were happy to create a fair and equal world during a few days, a few weeks maybe ?  This is stupid. A usefull command if you like to watch your wallet evolve in real time is the command "watch" :$ watch bitcoind getinfo I know that one of the good things whith bitcoins, is that you don't need a complex code into your website in order to accept donations.  Basically all you need is to display a bitcoin address.However, I wonder if using a single fixed unique address is a good idea.  Because it could allow anyone, including the tax-humgry government, to know exactly how many bitcoins you have received.I'm not concerned about this, because I don't maintain any website.  But I might be in the future.  Therefore I'd like to suggest to publish a small CGI script that would create a new bitcoin-address for every visitor who would like to make donation.I suck a CGI programming, but at least I know that any programming language can be used to do that.  So I guess a simple "bitcoind getnewaddress SOMELABEL" could be used, where SOMELABEL would be any string the donator would like to enter.I'd appreciate if someone could post an example of such a script. Oh yeah that was silly what I was writing.  Forget it.  I need to get more sleep  Still 2 blocks to go but I'm sick of waiting, so I'm ending this.Anon01 wins the auction with 200 BTC.My next auction will probably be on biddingpound.com.  It will be an other 1g mini bar.EDIT.Finally I made my next auction on this same forum.  See here :  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1887.0 My guess is : deflation ends when even rich people have no choice but spending their money.  But when this appends, I don't know what poor people would habe been passed through... Oh, I didn't realize.  I was just considering the price displayed on bitcoinwatch.com.But I guess bitcoinwatch does not very frequently update its price for one gram gold. Well, I'm sorry to observe that very few of you are interested.However, let me just remind you that there are about only 20 blocks to go.I won't do any IRC auction if anybody shows up and ask for it.Highest bid is still 200 BTC Nobody should have to force anyone.If some people want to make their crappy inflationned, socialistic distributed crypto-currency, then be it !  All they have to do is TO FORK BITCOIN.  That's what is good with free-software :  there is room for all ideas, even for stupid ones !All I want is a name for a sound crypto-currency, so that I can buy it without having to check every single line of the source code. There are already simple ways to buy bitcoins.  Cash via mail is one of them.I personnaly never succeeded in generating any single bitcoin, and yet I own a lot of them now.  So buying bitcoin is not that difficult for people who really want to. Which means that the auction will probably end in the next 9 hours. A customer is a customer only if he buys.People who complain about how difficult it is to generate don't buy any bitcoins, almost per definition.So we can't consider them as "customers". Basically what you are saying could be said about the very concept of money itself, not just bitcoins.  Discussing about this would lead us to discussing about communism vs liberalism.  This is a debate that goes far beyond bitcoins.
This is quite a good idea.   Some kind of a mind trick, in some way.Also, instead of suggesting the installation of the software, one could point to mybitcoin.com. That's one of the reason why I won't sell all my gold for bitcoins.  I mean, scarcity of gold is due to a physical reality.  Scarcity of bitcoin is only due to a form of consensus.  If for some reason most people decided to increase the number,  I'm not sure there is much I could do, apart from selling my bitcoins and buy some gold.I don't see any way to prevent that from happening, though. Well, bitcoin forks will have to use different names, at least in order to differentiate themselves from the others.  I think it wouldn't make much sense to use "bitcoin" for any cryptocurrency other than the one where the total amount is 21 millions, for it has been the name of the original one.I know we can ultimately inspect the code in order to know what kind of crypto-currency we're dealing with, but come on... My mistake. Because some people are that dumb. Thanks for noticing this in this thread.  It might help insuring confidence in this auction.Don't you want to make a bid for this gram ? Satoshi's white paper (http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is actually an excellent specification document.  It is this document that convinced me about how great is the bitcoin concept.However, Satoshi is making regular slight modifications to the protocol.  Therefore, I think the document lacks a clear and exhaustive list of features that are absolutely necessary to define what bitcoin is.Such a list could be used to audit the source code and make sure it is compliant to the bitcoin concept.Amongst those features would be :* The halfing of bitcoins reward every 210,000 blocks* use of SHA-256 for hash* a target of 6 generated blocks per hour Brilliant, indeed. And highest bid is still 200 BTC.Anyone at 220 ?  Maybe stenography could also solve this issue.  But I find it difficult to find good doc about that. People who print money do it with no effort whatsoever, and there is no limit to their greed.On the contrary, bitcoin miners are just extracting something which exist in a limited amount anyway.  As it has been said many times, it's just the same for gold.  Can't blame someone because he has found some gold in a river, or because he decided to spend some time there looking for some.Seriously, mining is a perfectly respectable activity.  And there is no unfairness in it, since anyone can do it if he really wants to.  Powerfull machines are not a priviledge.  Anybody can buy one. Well, this is not good for my confidence into bitcoin. I am amazed by the number of people (most of them being newbies) who complain about how difficult it is to obtain some bitcoins.  Bitcoin is a money, so what did they expect  ?  Did they think they would just start the program and that bitcoin would just magically generate money ??   How valuable would be bitcoins in that case ??It's perfectly normal that the casual user have difficulties generating any single bitcoin.  A casual user uses a very common machine, such as mine, a laptop with a Intel 1.6GHz processor.  Obviously, if it was easy to generate bitcoins with such a machine, then there would be something wrong with the whole cryptocurrency concept.  To me, it does make sense that only state-of-the-art machines can generate bitcoins.Is that unfair ?  I don't think so.  Not at all.  Anyone who really wants to own bitcoins can just buy some.  There's nothing wrong if some effort is required to obtain something.  Whether this effort is technical (acquiring and running powerful machines) or financial. Bitcoin is the implementation of a protocol.  The fact that the software is in a version inferior to 1 doesn't mean the protocol is in developpment.When we say bitcoin is a beta software, it means that the software is an experimental attempt to implement the protocol.  But the protocol itself must not be changed, otherwise it would be a different software.Any idea for a change in the protocol should not be applied to bitcoin, but to a bitcoin fork.  I can't talk for Satoshi, but I guess he would accept new ideas only if they allow a better implementation of the protocol, but not a modification of it. Good.  unfortunately I had no other order, so I'm reducing my price.9 BTC per sticker.   The keyholder is not available anymore (it's mine now   ) Let's just say it's an other reason always to use a different address for each transaction.  So that in case of a collision, you won't loose all your wallet. Well, to be fair, the number of atom in the universe (10^80) is not a good comparaison.I just checked, and the total number of addresses is actually much lower.  It's about 1.5*10^48, according to theymos.   It's a huge number, but not as huge as 10^80.  I'll see if I can find an other physical comparaison. I guess there are people on this forum that are good in maths too.  So let's compute this.Let's say 10 billions of human beings are using bitcoin and that each of them generate a new address per second, 24/24h, 7d/7.How much time do we have to wait so that we have 1% chance that at least one address has been generated twice ? You don't have to say that, ribuck.  A probability of 10^-100 is ridiculously small.  It is just silly to think otherwise.Even if it was tested every nano seconds, I could easily bet 100 years of intensive non-stop torture that such an event will not occur during my entire life.
It's perfectly normal to be willing to own physically something.  That's why I think gold and bitcoins are so complementary.  None of them will replace the other.  You can't hold bitcoins in your hands, nor can you pass gold through copper lines or electromagnetic waves. Ok you passed the Turing test.  Congratulations, and welcome. Seriously, you should give up on this idea that a non-zero probability is not negligeable.A probability of 10^-100 is really impossible.  Do you know that according quantum mechanics, the probability that your ass crosses your chair when you seat is not zero ?  I can't compute it, but I wouldn't be surprised if such a probability was about that small. Still, I doubt FreeNet is suitable for backup.I wonder if online mail provider, such as Gmail, is not a good idea for that.  I don't like webmails.  I think this concept is silly, but it exists and it provides almost unlimited amount of storage.  It's also easy to access, for all you have to do is to send an email and attach your encrypted wallet.  Of course, it should not be the only backup solution, since at any time Google could destroy your data.  But still, it can be added as a complementary solution.  The more backup copies you have in different places, the better.I don't have any Gmail account right now, but I seriously consider creating one just for this purpose. Collision is theoretically possible but is astronomically unlikely.Remember that there are much more addresses than there are atoms in the universe.If two people were randomly choosing an atom in the universe, how likely do you think they are to choose the same atom ? Good thing about this battle is that it will be easy to judge.  We'll just have to see which money will survive the other.Even if it's quite an unfair game, since dollar is basically backed by US army and police force, my bet still goes to bitcoin. Not really.  The "limiting" factor, if this makes any sense, is rather the number of transactions.  Too many transactions could make too a big block chain for disk storage.  But the use of Merkle tree makes it unlikely to be a problem.As for the total number of possible addresses, it is much bigger than the number of atoms in the universe. Two very important paragraphs, thanks for this great idea.  DigitalCash + Bitcoin = PGMS = Pretty Good Monetary System Personnaly I think the point about bitcoin is not really anonymacy.  The point is encryption.  Even if the states knows who you are, and what kind of transaction you've done, they can't steal the money you've earned.  The only thing they can do is put you in jail.  I dare them to do that.  It would be so obviously outrageous.  I know they would do it anyway, but I don't care.  Bearing injustice is an honor, sometimes. Oh, ok.BTW, is storing a file on FreeNet reliable ?  I mean, as I understand it, FreeNet is P2P.  This means that a file is there only if people use it.  If I am the only one who need a file, isn't it likely to disappear from the network if I don't consult it regulary ? CHK ? I have a 200 BTC bid from a user who wants to be anonymous.  I'll name him Anon01.So, Anon01 is leading at 200 BTC.You can PM me for anonymous bids, but please avoid this.  It's easier to use this thread, and it gives better transparency to the auction process. Highest bid is still 180 BTC.Anyone for 200 ? something like this maybe ?Code:gpg -ac $HOME/.bitcoin/wallet.dat | lp No rush for that right now.  But eventually when the governments will begin to be aware of bitcoin, Freenet will be an appropriate place for this site. Thanks theymos.  Number of chain forks is indeed the limiting factor for block generation rate. The size of your wallet is very unlikely to be a problem, imo.If empty addresses realy bother you, you can create a new wallet and put all your bitcoins in it.  You could do that with a VM or using mybitcoin.com as a temporary storage. I thought that too but couldn't express it that well. I think the word "community" is missing in the first sentence.Otherwise it looks fine. Yes, I think gold is immune to new technology, at the very least for a few centuries.But even if cheap gold synthesis was possible,  it is a very huge hypothesis.  And above all :  it is not present reality.   Personaly, I prefer base my investments strategies on actual reality, instead of science fiction.
Yeah I may have written rtfm a little too quickly.  I just felt like writing it when I red the first questions, especially "Is it open source ?". Doesn't make much sense.  Hashing power doesn't hurt a cryptocurrency.  On the contrary, it enforces it.  I just don't understand what you mean by "dominate" or "surpass". RTFM ! An other hint concerning Satoshi's goal.Have you seen the timestamp for the Genesis block ??extract from main.cpp :Code:const char* pszTimestamp = "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks";Seems quite clear to me that Satoshi was angry about the "too big to fail". I don't care about market price.  I only care about how much people are ready to actually pay in order to get this 1g gold mini bar.If you think you can sell it later at 322 BTC, chose your margin M% and place a bid at 322 * (1-M%). Moi j'adore l'idée d'un truc, que même si les flics débarquent avec l'intention de te le prendre, ils peuvent pas.ça n'a pas de prix une telle possibilité, amha. +1 Agreed.  This will happen.  I wouldn't be surprised if big companies such as Google or Apple started their own block chain.  In this perspective, cryptocurrencies could be used as a replacement for equities.  I think it would be a great improvment for equity market, and more generally for capitalism.Also, some people will want different versions of cryptocurrencies.  For instance one with a non-fixed aggregate.The market will have to decide which of all these currency will have more value.  Personnaly, I'll stick to bitcoins.  But I may buy a few GoogleCoin if this appears. jgarzik leads at 180 BTC Yeah, as if taxing rich people was the solution for all problems in the world... It has to float.  At least a bit.  Because the total amount of bitcoins can not be perfectly controlled.  Nor can be the total amount of gold.Wallets can be destroyed.  Gold can be lost (in the ocean for instance).Therefore it's better to let the market fix the price of gold.  But it will likely be more or less constant. jgarzik leads at 150 BTC. LobsterMan initiates and leads the auction with 1 BTC. Well, I have just started an auction for a 1g gold on the marketplace forum.  Direct bitcoin to gold market.  Not mtgox nor dollars involved.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1730.0 EDIT:  This auction is closed.  See end of thread.I launch an other auction for a 1g gold mini bullion this time (see attached picture).Price will include postal fees to wherever in the world.  Payment will be required before sending.No starting price.DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T REALLY INTEND TO BUY THE BAR.Auction will end at block number 92,000.  At block 92,000, I will lock this thread.  I may lock it a bit earlier and organise a IRC auction just before the end, though. I think we don't need value injection.  Right now bitcoins are generated without any relation to gold, but it doesn't mean a fixed rate can not be reached in the future.I personnaly like to compare bitcoin to silver.  There is no "official" price of gold in silver.  Those two metals are not convertible into one another.  And yet, there is a more or less constant ratio in price.  It's only due to their relative constant scarcity.Same would apply to bitcoin, imo.  Even if bitcoin is generated with no value injection, as you say, it is anyway in fixed amount, and therefore can be used as the unit of account you are hoping for. That's what I have been thinking from the beginning.  The main use of bitcoin will be to exchange gold.I doubt however that it would require a fork of bitcoin.  It's much easier to use the mainstream bitcoin block chain.I mean, say I own 1 Kg of gold.  If I trust bitcoin to be in a fixed amount, then I can ensure the convertibility of 1kg of gold into the whole bitcoin stocks.That would price a gram of gold to 21,000 BTC.If someone thinks the same but owns 10 Kg, the price of the gram will be 2,100 BTC.Eventually, the price of gold will be the total amount of bitcoins, divided by the maximum amount of gold owned by someone who is willing to use bitcoin as an exchange tool for his gold.I confess that I'm not so sure about that right now.  I still have to think this more thorously.  But it's my opinion right now. Please use paragraphs. I indeed underestimated the problem of food, especially in US.People who use food stamps do get some food.  So there is no shortage of food, and the demand is here.  The problem is therefore the fact that prices do not adapt to this demand.  I personnaly think this is only due to excessive market regulation and terrible monetary policies.  Maybe a good micro-payment system could solve that. Most of what is said here could ne said about any fixed aggregate money, such as gold.I guess this guy also thinks gold is useless and will never be used as money.
It's just that, as I was reading your post, when you were talking about exploited and starving to death people, it seemed to be very very far away from the reality of the society I live in.  There are problems in our society, but ... starvation ?  Hum, I don't think so. Well, when is the last time you saved someone's life just by giving him some food ?If you never did, then where does your concern about starving people comes from ?   If it can't come from personnal experience, then where can it come from, apart from television and other medias, i.e.  mass propaganda ?   I think I've never ever seen a starving person with my own eyes.  And as far as "exploitation" is concerned, this is very much a subjective judgement.  We talked about that already. Then do it.  With YOUR money.  YOUR work.  Don't force people to do the same.You can't make laws on assumptions like that.  You can't say :"If we don't do this, then that will happen, and it would be not good."It would be too easy.  This is almost similar to blackmailing.  It reminds me the banking system, crying for some money from the government : "If you don't give us 700 G$, it's gonna be the end of the world...".  Are we supposed to just believe it and comply ??  No way.Your predictions about what would happen if we do or do not something, are no justification for taxation.   Therefore I won't even try to explain to you why I disagree about your belief in government being necessary for scientific progress.  It would be irrelevant. This would be nice.  Unfortunately I'm not a student anymore.  I hope that some young people will learn about bitcoins and get enthousiastic about that.  Young people have indeed access to large places were they can gather and exchange stuffs.  They could indeed trade bitcoins. Yes, it is.  I should have explained that earlier.   There is indeed a maximum difficulty for SHA-256, but it means being able to invert the hash function.  And as pointed upper in this thread, it is just impossible using brute force. That's a huge hypothesis.  We'll talk about it if it happens, ok ?  But meanwhile, there is no need to mess with the protocol.  Especially about a change of the hash function.  Again, if you really want a sha512 cryptocurrency, then fork bitcoin.That's the good thing about free software, if someone is not happy with the direction of the code, he can fork it.  We don't have to argue endlessly about those stuffs.Changing the hash function would imply the coexistence of two hash formats inside the block chain.  This is not good for the coherence of the protocole. This seems very hazardous.  If you really want to do that, I suggest you fork bitcoin.As far as I'm concerned, I very much doubt sha256 will be broken any time soon. Is it only possible ?  I mean, sha512 requires twice as many bits of space than sha256.  Therefore I wonder if it would fit the current block structure. I can buy or sell bitcoins for cash in Paris, France. Thanks.  I think it's great that the main page has so many translations. Well, that wasn't very clear.  After all, you *did* write "criminal is whatever gov says is a crime".But, to be fair, this sentence make sense, if you consider "crime" in a purely juridical meaning.  The thing is that crime is also a common notion, which is based on philosophy more than law. It is indeed very impressive.  I suggest Macho to consider laws of the past, for instance.  Prohibition in US, homosexuality in UK, slavery in France (not so long ago), and so on.Saying that crime is only what gov says is criminal, is just amazing.  If the governement says the Earth is flat, I won't believe it.  It's just the same for crime. I think those workers should form unions, go on strike and those kind of stuffs, in order to gain some better labour conditions.  I would understand that.  But I don't see what the employer is doing wrong, as long as he doesn't force anyone to work for him.I disagree.  Crime has some objecive sense, and law is only an attempt to express it.  As whether or not I approve sweatshop, it just seems to me that the notion is very subjective.  If a job is not forced, you can call it sweatshop if you want, but I will approve it.Concerning Ponzi schemes, I don't really care about that.  I'm not even sure it's that bad if it is based on a lie.  Again, moral risk exists anyway.  You just have to be aware of it. Well I'm not sure I know the exact meaning of sweatshops (I'm not english native speaker), but according to what I can read about it on wikipedia, sweatshop workers don't have chains on their ankles, nor are they beaten up to death if they resign.Toxic waste is criminal if it spoils someone else's property, including public property.I don't know about Ponzi schemes.  To me, the bad thing about it is when there is a lie behind it.  And even a lie is not a crime.  Moral risk is one of the things you have to deal with in finance. Capitalism is not liberalism.   The former is compatible with slavery, the latter is not.In a capitalist world, slaves could be considered as a mean of production, like any other.  But such a society would not be liberal.The thing is : most people here are BOTH capitalists AND liberals.    Well, at least I am. Other points are easy to refute, but this one is interesting.Honnestly as a capitalist I reckon there is a little philosophical issue here.  It's all about the concept of "wage slave".  Is a worker really free to resign if he doesn't like his job ??  If this means he has to face financial difficulties, possibly poverty and starvation, is it compatible with freedom ?I personnaly think so.  Personnaly I resigned several times in my life.  I've never regretted it, and I just don't believe in the "wage slave" concept.  But I understand it is a huge debate, which goes way beyond the debate about money and bitcoin.If you are afraid of material factors such as lack of money or lack of professional perspective, then you will never be free.  If you believe you are a slave because you need money, then your master is not your employer.  It is your lack of courage. Well, this enters the category of "mental poker" games, and thus it is indeed a bit complex.  But complexity is a price to pay if you want your website to be a fair game place.I'd also have a few things to say about when exactly should the paiement occur.  I'll talk about that later.Also, if someday I can manage to have my website working again on freeshell.org, I may implement an prototype of a fair playing roulette game.I don't bet nor gamble.  I don't like this kind of activities, but I'm surely interested in the "mental poker" problem, from a purely technical aspect. Read those wise words, Macho. Why do you need to compare a commercial exchange to a situation where someone is falling into a trap and the other one is laughing about it ?  When to persons exchange goods, it is because it is in their interest, of both of them.   A gives x to B, and in exchange B gives y to A, because A needs y more than x and B needs x more than y.  It's a win-win.  Nobody is fooling anyone.   The thirsty one gives food to the humgry one, and the humgry one gives water to the thirsty one.Stop thinking of capitalism as a way for people to fool others.  Capitalism is part of free martket, which is nothing but the voluntary exchange of stuffs.  There is nothing wrong about that, even in the hippy society you might be dreaming of.
Seriously, Macho, you should reconsider what you are writing.If someone thinks that for some reason the price of rice will rise, buying it when the price is low is a way to allocate capital in a way to predict future, thus preventing future shortage.  If he's right, he's allowed the rice market to have a good foresight of coming difficulties.  Which is good.  If he's wrong, then he just gave up some money for no reason to rice procucers.  Do you complain when people give you money ??I think this is the point you are missing with speculation.  The speculator is never alone.  There is a second party.  THe spectulator buys or sell something to someone.  If Alice trades something with Bob, even if you consider that Alice is a shamefull speculator, the thing is that she helped Bob to fullfill his needs.  And Bob could very well be an honnest, productive person, according to you.  If Bob is also a spectulator, then those two persons have just exchanged some stuffs :  it doesn't change anything to the rest of the economic picture.  One of them will lose, the other one will gain.I keep thinking that speculation is globally neutral, economically.When people say that speculation has risen food prices, for instance, this is just non-sense.  Why exactly, suddenly, has speculation arosen ??  Did people, suddenly, become more greedy and more gambled-minded ??  The truth is most probably that a central bank or some other centralised finantial institution has flowded the market with money.  That is the real event that triggered the rise of prices.  Not speculation.  Speculation existed before the buble, and will exist after.  Speculation alone doesn't explain a buble, for it is a human character such as courage, greed, fear and such.  It doesn't appear suddenly to create bubbles out of nothing. I very much hope no such thing will be done.  If it is, I might very well sell my bitcoins as I will lose confidence in this money.Speculation is a zero-sum game.  It is mainly harmless.   Doing something against it would only add useless complexity into the system.If some people would like to see an non-fixed aggregate cryptocurrency, I suggest they fork bitcoin.  NOW.  Or as soon as possible.  The sooner they fork bitcoin into such a currency, the more sure we will be that bitcoin will never be like that. +1 ! Bitcoin is a young money.  It"s thus quite turbulent. Oh, ok.  Although I don't understand the one month delay I heard of, then. How do you get the bitcoins you're selling ?  Do you really have enough sellers ? Every 210,000 blocks.  It should be about every 4 years. I don't get your point.I didn't want to talk about any morality of money.  What I am saying is that nowadays brains are not used to produce wealth, but only to gain the right to enslave people (I'm exagerating a bit to make my point clearer).In a extreme version of this, society would be divided in two parts :  people whom intellingence would have been detected during youth with IQ tests, and other "dumb" people.  The formers would have the right not to work in life.  They would just collect the fruit of the labor done by the latters.  This fruit of labour would be stolen via organized force. I thought the target blocks creation rate was 6 blocks/hour.On bitcoinwatch.com I see that it is usually 9 or more.Is there something wrong about that ? Well, if gaining bitcoins was very easy, it wouldn't worth that much, would it ?Yes, it is not as easy as buying some shoes.  Because bitcoins seller will not be very happy to use current paiement method (credit cards and stuffs).  So you have to accept some risk.  Personnaly I bought my first bitcoins with cash in the mail.  I lost 10$ trying to deal with bitcoin2cash.  I succeeded in buying for 30$ though, with bitcoin4cash.You can consider selling real stuffs for bitcoins.  I sold some linux stickers (you want some ?  PM me) for 40 BTC.  I also sold some silver and 7 grams of gold.Earning money is no easy task.  If you find a good way to do it, let me know. Ok you're funny.  I gave you 0.01 bc. Nice try   Well, you have to do something with the money you don't spend.Moreover, if you don't invest, then you don't have money and thus you have to work.  Working :   Errrr... FreeMoney won at 1,200 BTC.I'll soon make an other auction for a 10g mini gold bar.Who knows, someday I might sell a 1kg gold bar for bitcoins  France Cxu la linuksa versio ne funkcias ?Aldonita :Versxajne vi povus kompili la programon cxi tiel :http://lickthesalt.com/2010/08/19/compiling-bitcoin-on-ubuntu-10-04-karmic/ Well, although very few people seem intersted, I've started the IRC auction.It's on freenode, channel #btc-gold-auction. You still have some time to put your bid on the forum.So far FreeMoney leads at 1,200 BTC. I thought that too, until I read a book from some french demographs "Essai de prospective démographique".  Main author is Pierre Chaunu.  According to their studies, even if indeed it's in western countries that the phenomenun is the more acute, developping countries do also follow this line, in an alarming rate.  Many of them have already a natality rate below replacement rate.  And yet, their population is growing rapidly, which gives a false impression of a vivid population, while it is only aging.  Contraception may be a recent invention in human history, but it is of a huge importance, probably very much underestimated, imo.I think that "Demographic winter" is a serious hypothesis that should not be ignored. +1, creighto.Couldn't say it better.
Longer lifespans doesn't do much for human reproduction.  Whether a woman lives 60 or 110 years, she will have the same amount of babies, and this will probably be below replacement rate.  If you like to folow long term trendline, don't look at total population number, but look at this rate.  In every countries, natality is sliding below replacement rate.  Longer lifespans only hides this phenomenum, giving the impression of a growing population.   But it's not growing :  it's aging.  And after getting old, all these people will just die, leaving behind them a dramaticly smaller number of people.  And don't think it would be good news, you would be very wrong, imo. +1We might also take bitcoin as an example.  Satoshi's white paper is the smartest document I had read in years.  And yet, correct me if I am wrong, but Satoshi is not a State employee, nor is bitcoin any part of a government project. Oh my god.  You are hopelessly brain-washed.My initial post is not against science or technological progress.  Please read it again. I also very much doubt we need energetic resources that bad.  I mean, it's true that we are currently facing environmental and energetic difficulties, mainly due to our recent dramatic demographic increase.But this is only temporary.  Most countries have already entered demographic transition phase, so that we can very much predict that there will be a drastic decrease in human population, not even due to wars, social unstability or whatever, but only because of the decrease of natality due to contraception and rise of feminine condition.  Some people even think it could lead to human extinction.  Anyway, this will cause major social problematic situations, and will require a full refundation of societies, but it will also make the need of resources a problem from the past. It doesn't help us to spread in any way.  It tries, but so far it has been a fantastic failure.  And if $10 billion / year is that little of an amount of money, why don't scientists just finance it themselves, instead of stealing it from non-scientists ?  And as far ar war budget is concerned, this is not an excuse.  A bad doesn't justify an other bad.When I see how humans are unable to just put some solar cells in Sahara for instance, or to explore resources in deep oceans, to me it just stupid to announce they want to go to Mars.  This IS propaganda, you just don't realise it.  They will spend trillions of tax money to go there, they will put a nice flag on the surface, and then they will eventually come back to Earth, litteraly.There is almost no resource on Mars.  Water ?  Maybe.  Minerals ?  Sure.  But most of the energy we use comes from the Sun (and we don't have to go to Mars to get it) and from fossilized biomass.  Now, here is some news for you :  THERE IS NO BIOMASS ON MARS !   It is nothing else than a huge desertic place.  Show me you can fertilize the Sahara, and then I might take you seriously when you talk about going to Mars.And again, I'm still waiting for you to justify why you would have the right to force me, via taxation, to work in order to help you to fullfill your silly dreams.Human is a life form and as any life form it tends to spread.  But as any life form it is designed to spread in a earth-like environnement, not a huge 0°C cold, irradiated, 1% thick atmosphered, unoxygened, nolifed land.Well this is a nice allegory of life, because I have an other big news for you :  we will all die anyway.Don't worry about what could happen in a few billion years.  You will probably die in less than a century, anyway.  You'd better start living with this idea.  Enjoy present life, carpe diem, and don't live in fantasy. On freenode.  I'll create a channel. Less than 200 blocks left, which should be less than 24 hours.I will probably start the IRC bidding around block number 89,950Again, so far FreeMoney leads at 1,200 BTC.  Anyone for 1,300 BTC ? I doubt it would change anything.  It would not discourage dishonnest bidders, while annoying the honnest ones.  Imo. I'll try that, thks.  Indeed if you don't show the hash before the player bets, there's nothing preventing you from chosing a losing outcome after the player has bet.Edit.I've tried again, and I still don't understand.  Sure, it gives me a hash before I send money.  But that doesn't prove anything.  It doesn't even tell what hash function has been used.  It doesn't prevent you from chosing the lose/win ratio you want.Edit #2.Here is what I suggest.First, you chose a random string and you keep it secret for now.  Let's call it $sYou then show the sha256sum of this string.Code:$ sha256sum <<< "$s"Then you ask the player for an integer $n.  Once the player has given you this number,you can show him $s, and everything that you will do next doesn't have to be secret.You compute n successive hashes of $s.  You have to use a different hashfunction that the one used previously, otherwise the player could chose $n in order to obtain a winning outcome.  So let's use sha224 here instead of sha256.Code:$ f() { sha224sum <<< "$1" |cut -d' ' -f1; }  $ while ((n--)); do h=$(f "$h"); doneOnce this is done, you compute two more hashes, and you build your two coordinates with them :Code:$ x=$(f h); y=$(f x)$ x=0.${x//[a-f]/}$ y=0.${y//[a-f]/}Finally you can use those coordinates for your dart game. As far as I'm concerned, I prefer the "buy and hold" strategy, plus a strict diversification discipline.Never sell, and buy a lot of things :  shareholdings, commodities, precious metals.  If you are really wealthy, you can also buy things that cost a lot :  real estate, art and other stuffs.Avoid monetary funds, government bonds and anything which is assimilated to cash.   Buy what money can buy, don't keep money for itself. FreeMoney leads at 1,200 BTC Ahh,  please don't try to ruin my business Still, 1,500 BTC or even 2,000 BTC wouldn't be outrageous. Gold is almost at 1,400$/once right now.   You still have a few blocks left to have a chance to get 5g of gold for 1,200 BTC only !Don't delay too much before you send me your bid.Edit.Also, let me remind you that according to bitcoinwatch.com, one gram of gold worth 478$.  That means that 1,200$ for one gram is about 50% below the official price !  Go for it ! I don't know if it's bad or not.  That's not the point, imo.Is a storm a good thing ?  Is the wind a bad thing ?Whether deflation is a good or bad thing, when market forces want it, it has to happen.  The government should not interfere to prevent deflation.  It can only make things worse. jorgen leads at 1,150 BTC.Anyone for 1,200 ? So far, Loki leads with 1,100 BTC.Don't wait the last minute to make your bid ! I confess I am a bit disappointed with the number of orders I got.  Only one, to tell you the truth.Is 10 BTC still too expansive ??  Or do you just don't like Linux enough ?Please tell me what you think about my offer. I'm not sure you should be proud of that but somehow I think it is good that this kind of thing is possible.It gives liquidity to the market.  Plus, it's fun.Although I would not do this kind of thing, I won't blame you.  Should I bother googling "Dyson Sphere" ?  Or can I just ignore that ?
Basically genjix is talking about how important it is for human kind to explore solar system.  I'm telling him that it is just some technocratic propaganda, and it should not be founded using taxation.I also told him that the moon and Mars are nothing but giant desertic places.  And nobody wants to live in a desertic land.Going to Mars and trying to live there is about as weird as going to the south pole and establishing a permanent camp there. I don't understand this paragraph.  But I guess trying to be humoristic on Internet is even harder than I thought. Pardonu al mi, sed cxi tio, laux mi, estas nur teknocia propagando.  Mi ne zorgas pri la ebleco je vivi en Marso.Oni povas kredi aux revi pri tio.  Sed ONI NE DEVAS UZI PUBLIKAN FORTON POR FINANCI TION !!!Viaj revagxoj estas viaj.   Gardu ilin por vi. Any progress in that direction ?  I red somewhere that some people wanted to work on a Python implementation of the protocol. I think that's pretty much the same for any free software.  At some point, there is someone who is responsible from signing an official release, and people must have some confidence in this person.   I mean, everything that tentative is saying could be said about SSL, for instance.  And SSL is the root of current security on internet, isn't it ?  We could also say that about Linus Torwalds towards the linux kernel.  Maybe someday Linus will modify the kernel and put a troyan horse in it.  It would be a one shot scam, as everybody will soon find out and he won't be trusted anymore.  We will put our confidence in someone else. LOL ! Maybe one day gold will be backed by bitcoins.    I still would like to see tentative explain me how he could create a chain of 90,000 proofs of work with the same difficulties that are inside the current block chain, and then be faster than the current bitcoin network, so that he could always make sure his chain is longer than the bitcoin one. Please do so and thus prove us wrong. Behind the concept of "money", there is necessarly some kind of a "consensus".  The current block chain is accepted because it is the longest one in existence.The software could easily be modified to accept an other block chain.  So if you can build a longer block chain, I will accept to buy some of your "coins" and I'd use a modified version of the software to do so.  But it would be extremely difficult for you to build such a chain, since it would require a huge amount of CPU.  You could not do this alone.  Nobody could. I tried this site but I failed to register !  I'll try again though. If, for some reason, I can't be online at the 90,000th block,  if I'm not on IRC either and if this thread is still open, then you will be able to post some bids until I wake up or get connected.  It should not be long.  I will then immediately lock the thread and the highest bid will be the winner, even if it was actually posted after 90,000.Is that Ok with everyone ? I'm considering organizing an IRC meeting just before we reach 90,000.Indeed if many people try to put a bid here just before the end, it could be messy and unfair, since some orders will be delayed.  And a forum is not designed to do real time conversations, anyway.So what I am planning to do is to lock this thread at about block 89,900, and then open an IRC channel on #freenode.My IRC login name is password protected, so it should be alright. I don't feel comfortable accepting a bid if there is a smiley aside to it.Please confirm.Edit.  Ahh it's ok.  I don't know why I wrote that.  Your bid is accepted.Loki leads at 1,100 BTC I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Some of them are shiny and rounded indeed.  I attached here a detailed photo for those "bumped stickers".I don't have many of them and they are much better quality than flat tiny ones.  So I'll sell them for 20 BTC.Edit.  Oh sorry I've just realized you were asking about the size !  I'll take pictures of them above a credit-card sized card, so that you can make an idea of the size. Has anyone got any accurate idea of a script for such a video ? I sell some brand new Linux, Debian and FSF stickers for PC.  There is also one Tux keyholder for 50 BTC, and a Tux magnet for your fridge (40 BTC).  See attached photo.The smallest ones are only 10 BTC.  This is BELOW my purchase price, but I don't care.  This is my way of contributing both to free software, and to bitcoins.Price includes postal fees.  PM me your postal address and tell me the kind of stickers you want.  I'll send you a bitcoin address.I will add some detailed photos on this thread if someone wants me to.If this sell is a success, I'll buy more.  I bought all this at www.it2l.com, but this website is temporarily closed. You got to understand them : what would those guys do for a living if they had no-one to rule and to tax from ??Having people work for them while they give stupid orders and pointless regulations, that's their job !  They are just defending it. About making a video, I'd like to mention the "synfig" software.   Basically it's kind of a inkscape but with animation feature.It's free software and it can do some nice things.  I'm not good in this kind of artistic stuf but if someone wants to give it a try, just search synfig.  On debian like systems :  apt-cache search synfig
I don't know what will be the price of gold in a few years, but I'm pretty sure I would not feel confident if I had a lot of dollars in cash right now.  Those people are flowding the banking industry with trillions of worthless dollar.  Not only this will eventually lead to massive inflation, but above all, it's unfair enough for me not to want to participate to this by hoarding dollars. Eble *vi* devas fari tion.  Sed vi ne povas forci aliajn ulojn je helpi vin je fari tion.  Mi ne kredas en la ebleco je vivi al Marso.Voli vivi tie estas stulta.  Ni povas *iri* tien, sed neniu volas vivi tie.  La Luno pruvis tion :  ni iris tien, ni plantis flagon, kaj ni revenis.  De pli ol kvardek jaroj ni ne reiris tien.Vivemi al la Luno estas same stulta ol vivemi al la supra parto de Everesto :  oni volas esti la unua ulo je iri tien, sed neniu volas vivi tie !!Luno, kaj Marso, estas nenio, sed grandegaj dizertoj.  Neniu volas vivi en dizertoj.Eble vi esperas oni povos terigi Marson.  Nu, terigu unue la terajn dizertojn, antauxe revi pri tio. Yeah, sure.  I have been hearing this one for quite some time, now. Current highest bid is 1,000 bc.Anyone for 1,100 ? As such a symbol been decided yet ?If not, I would suggest a drawing of a key, with the two traditional vertical bars for currencies. Looks nice !Thank you.(check your bitcoin balance   ) [/quote]Yeah it's true. Why bother about requiring some reserves, hum ?I actually agree :  let's abandon all this crap.  Then the federal reserve will have no reason to exist, and we'll go to a free banking industry.  Everybody will have the right to be his own bank :  and in this scheme, I'm sure bitcoin will be the best money ever. This guy *really* just wanted to introduce himself.  I mean, that's the only message he posted !  He really just wanted to do that. La demando estas :  cxu estas akceptinda, je uzi publikan forton prenante laboron de multaj homoj, nur por sendi kelkajn homojn al la lunon ?Tion mi ne akceptas.Quick translation for others :Basically the question is whether or not you would accept someone to tell you :" I am an officialy recognized scientist, and you're not.  Give me 10% of your savings now because I earned the right not to cope with economic reality.  If you don't agree I'll tell the police and they will take it by force. "Also : this is not just about scientists.  A young person becomes a bureaucrat by learning by heart many silly and unfair rules.  His only merit as a bureaucrat is to be able to memorize all this crap. They can't force you to use a money if you don't want to.  Sure, they can try.  And they have some success.  But the very existence of alternative money such as bitcoin proves you that they are failing. +1 Doesn't prove anything.  It's still quite experimental.  And I assume Google cars are driving very slowly.If it was already perfectly reliable we would see more of them.  There is a huge demand for companies for such an application.  They would save a lot on human drivers salary if they could just have robots drive their cars and trucks. Then I guess it will be done soon.  The car will park in front of your house, will send you a SMS with code for opening the car's door and let you retreive the package.  Maybe Google is planning to do that.  Could be a very lucrative business.I still think it's far from being ready for production, though.  Automated driving is still a very tough AI application.  It's a bit like voice to text application :  it has existed for years now, but it's still not much convincing. This will happen, imo.  Sooner or later.Protecting packages won't be an issue.  If the technology exists to allow a robot to navigate through a complex urban field, then it will almost certainly have also some equipments to track/watch the package and prevent theft.  Also, nobody has to know how valuable is the package, and therefore random theft won't be lucrative.Small flying drones already exist.  What we would need now is enough AI to allow those drones to fly from a address to another, while avoiding obstacles and such.  I think it will happen, but not in this century. People should not focus that much on mining anyway.  Mining is just a marginal way to get bitcoins.   As it has been said many times here, it's the the same as for gold :  yes gold mines exist, and they allow some people to make a lot of money just by digging ground.  But the mined amount of gold in a year will always be ultra small compared to the overall existing amount of gold in circulation.Personnaly I don't care if some people generate a lot of bitcoins.  I don't care at all.  I actually consider that those people are working for me, since I will buy their generated bitcoins. Mi ne volas diri :  "scienco ne estas bona".  Tion mi ne pensas.  Neniel.Scientistiuloj estas utilaj cxiam, kiam ili faras sciencon.  Sed se junuloj studas sciencon ne por sciencemo, nek por scienstistigxi, sed nur por akiri rajton je sociala dominaxjo, jen tio estas ne enda.Se mi devus elekti inter scienco kaj libero, mi elektos liberon.   Sendube. Nature mi gxin komprenas.  Sed mi ne ofte uzas gxin Estas la babilejo #esperanto cxe freenode.  Mi tie babilas pli malpli otfte.Gxis  At least it should be said somewhere how important it is to mine, not just to get some bitcoins, but above all to contribute to network security. As it has been said on some other thread (I forgot which one), bitcoin doesn't really need to be mainstream to be successful.  It can't be compared to esperanto for this matter, imo.As long as there exists a community that provides convertibility of bitcoins to other currency, it won't matter if you can't buy a hamburger with bitcoins.   Think about gold :  I dout I could go in a McDonald's with a gram of gold and buy a menu with it.  And yet, gold is of course successful (especially nowadays).Of course, it will depend on the volume of transactions the community can provide.   But such a volume won't have to be huge, imo.  Actually I'd also like to compare it to collector's stamps.  Those are really a niche :  very few people collect stamps and are willing to pay a lot of money to acquire it.  And yet, I heard that some jews during WWII were using them as storage of value (much easier to hide than gold or diamands).I'd say that bitcoins are even easier to hide than stamps PS.  I don't say that I wouldn't like bitcoin to go mainstream, though.  Of course I'd like that.  But going mainstream is not a requirement for bitcoins to be considered as a success, imo. A republic in a house ??
I doubt Esperantist community is a good example of a potential niche use of bitcoins.  I guess you mentionned it because you saw the esperanto link on the main bitcoin page, or because you know I am esperantist.  But honnestly I very much doubt I represent esperantists in any correct way.However, I believe their are definitely some niches where bitcoin could florish :  internet poker, porn, IT freelance business, etc.  Maybe some very small countries could adopt it, also.   I don't know.But anyway, my approach was explicitely "naive".  There are indeed a lot of factors to take into accompt.  So I don't think there is anyway to get a theoric price for gold in bitcoin.  See precious metals compared to one another :  although there is a very rouhly constant ratio,  it does vary a lot in short time.  I think it could be just the same for bitcoin. Kongratiev maybe ? jorgen leads with 1,000 BTC.Please let me remind you not to bid if don't really intend to buy the bar.  The bitcoin paiement will be required first before the actual sending of the bar.  Therefore there is no point anyway in putting fake bids.  You will just destroy your reputation. Ok, good.  I confirm my intention to buy your ring for 100 BTC then.It would be nice if you could decide a deadline for the auction, though. Honnestly I don't understand you guys.  When I buy or sell something, I don't really care much about the spot price.If I sell something, it's because I need money.  I don't want to spend time and effort to make sure I get the best possible deal.If I buy something, it's because I want to own it.  I give whatever price the seller is asking, if I can afford it and if my desire to get the thing overcomes my reluctance of losing the required amount of money.The spot price is only valid in a short period of time.  If you don't intend to sell back or buy back during this time frame, the spot price doesn't matter much. +1 100 BTC if it's ok to send to France. Thing is :  bitcoin is not just a currency amongst other currencies.  Bitcoin is a form of money that can't be taxed.Keynes called gold "the barbareous relic".  Imagine what he would say about bitcoins.   It's only up to you to find the answers of these questions.Edit.ribuck leads at 600 BTC Yeah great :/Even if that was true, 100 scientists that accomplish great things can not be used as an excuse to pay 10,000 others (amongst them not all are scientists) who actually don't do anything for society.  Or at least, not at a fair price, since they use public force to finance their salary.In science history, not all great minds were state employees. Indeed !  (I confess I hadn't even thought of it in this way  )I actually came up with this idea of using block numbers because I had heard about an old tradition of auction using burning candles.  This kind of auction is still in practice in some european countries.  I guess you pointed out the exact reason.  There is a element of randomness involved. Looks fine.  I'm interested in buying, now. These kind of things happen.  It's not even rare.  I don't know the english expression, but basically it should be something like  "IPO failure" ("échec de l'introduction au capital", in french). Well, in an auction, you can always buy yourself before the end, in case you're really not happy with the highest bid. I don't have 500 kbc, but I'm in for 1,500 bc.  However, you don't seem very serious about selling this house. You can't buy something unless one agrees to sell.If what you're suggesting is the only solution, then you are the only buyer.  In that case, you can buy these shares at almost zero, since those shares don't worth anything unless you buy them.  This puts you in a huge dominant position (many sellers, only one buyer).This would be exactly similar to the option 4 previously described. Well, that's part of the fun of it Maybe I will have to wake up at 4am.  I don't know.  I don't even know if it's possible to know. FreeMoney leads at 500 BTC. Why is timezone timezone difference a problem ?  The length of the block chain is geographically invariant.I actually chose 90,000 only because it was the closest round number I could see. Also, I'm not very keen on buying a share of a company, knowing that the initial founder will own 50% of it.Because this gives him a bit too much power, imo.Say, for instance, that too a small amount is raised, and that the machine cannot be bought.Then we make an assembly and we decide what to do.  Several proposals are submitted :1.  We launch an other raise of capital, increasing the number of shares, thus diluting the capital ;2.  We let the general director (Kiba) negociate a loan with a bank ;3.  We foreclose the company, and distribute the treasorery to stock owners ;4.  We foreclose the company, and give all the treasorery to the general director ;Of course, most stock holders will vote for 1., 2. or 3.But Kiba might very well vote for 4.  He will then have taken all the money from investors, without having broken any rule of capitalism.Sounds so outrageous that I'm not sure I'm right, but I see no reason why it could not happen.PS. Even if you buy 49.9% of the company, you can get screwed like this.There is a funny saying in french that describes that :Hilarous, but difficult to translate.
Ok, fair enough.  I guess there will be at least one person who will put 50 bc. EDIT:  THIS AUCTION IS OVER.  See end of thread.I launch an auction for a 5g pure gold mini bar (see attached photo).You can post your bid on this thread.  Don't PM me :  others must be able to see what has been proposed.This is an experiment, but it is for real :DON'T PUT A BID IF YOU DON'T REALLY INTEND TO BUY THE BAR !The bitcoin paiement will be required before I send the bar.  Therefore thereis no point for you to post a fake bid here.  You would just destroy yourreputation.The auction will end when the 90,000th block will be published (it's funnierthan just using conventionnal time).Postal fees will be included in the price.When the block chain length reaches 90,000,  I will lock this topic and therefore will not accept any more bid. I must not understand something.  You can't tell anyone that you're in jail because you refused to discolse your keys, otherwise your penalty is even longer ?You must be kidding me ! Well, we could do something similar to what is done with filesharing software :  a legal notice that reminds that sharing copyright protected files is a criminal offence in several countries, and that the purpose of those software is not to do that.So, we could say something like :  bitcoin is not claimed to be any form of money, nor currency.  Using it as such is only a matter of individual choice and responsability.I'm just trying to find a solution to the recent EU directive http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1602.msg19013#msg19013 Well, it would make things a little bit more difficult for them. In order to avoid future troubles with governments, I wonder if we should consider banishing a few words from the bitcoin website.Those words would be "money", "currency", and maybe "commodity".Bitcoin could be presented as a software which provides a "electronic unit for barter exchange", or something like that.  Maybe even the world "barter" should be avoided.  Then bitcoin would be a software that provides insurance into the limited amount of a virtual quantity, and into the security of its transfer via internet.Edit.  Or maybe something like :Bitcoin is a P2P network that uses cryptographic concepts in order to allow transfers of floating point values between nodes, while assuring that the overall aggregated amount is limited to 21 millions. "barter tokens" is a good way to express it.  Nice. In addition to that, I think it's amazing that a law can forbid an action not regarding what this action "is", but only regarding what it is "claimed" to be.  It's like punishing "intention", not "acts".  In french that's what we call a "délit d'intention".  I very much think such a thing is unconstitutionnal.What people have in mind is never a crime.  Crime is what people do, not the reason why they do it. Tion mi jus rimarkis !Pri tio mi felicxas, cxar ecx en la franca aux en la germana la vikio ne estas tradukita.Kiun mi devas danki ?  PS.  ah ne, nur parteto estas tradukita, bedauxrinde   So far, I just bought them.But I intend to sell some linux stickers very soon.  They will be very cheap, since I will sell them below my purchase price. I'm afraid such an activity would be illegal.  Therefore, apart from purely IT-oriented businesses, with off-shore servers, it would not be possible. Is your table really a piece of wood ?  I mean, it's made of wood, but there are other stuffs in it :  nails, painting, whatever...  And you're talking about YOUR table, which is a particular table.  Some tables are made with other material than wood.  You can say "my table is a piece of wood", but you can't say "A table is a piece of wood".  This not a definition, not even a characteristic for the general "table" concept.Definitions are always tricky if one wants to question them thorously.  But the good thing is that they are nothing but conventions.  It is therefore pointless to argue about them.As far as I'm concerned, I don't care much whether gold and bitcoins are money, currency or commodity.  This is all relative. Ben c'est juste que ça me parait bien mieux que le cash pour stocker de la valeur, et même mieux que l'or (même si je ne vendrai pas tout mon or, non plus...).Hum, sinon, louer un serveur, ça peut être rentable...  bonne idée. Also, I doubt they've built this machine in order to generate bitcoins !   Salut malouin.pas beaucoup de monde ici pour l'instant.  J'espère que ça va changer. +1F.ck.ng b.st.rds.   I hate them. Even if there were the only one who generated bitcoins, it wouldn't be of much use if they don't spend it.That the point of fixed amount money system :  any corner is only temporary, otherwise it's useless. Well, we had Napoléon Bonaparte, if such a comparaison worths anything. Just want to remind people that I sell silver too.You have to like french coins, though. Ok but what is gold ?  Is it money, a currency, a commodity or what ?  Truly gold is a chemical element.  Nothing more.Well, in the same way, bitcoin is a p2p network that comply to a certain protocol.  If you want to know what is bitcoin, the best way to find out is to read the source code.PS:  this is "applied objectivism", I guess 
It's very common to denounce the "digging ditches" fallacy as an absurd way for keynesianists to try to improve work market by offering useless jobs.I think there is also some kind of useless intellectual work which is used in current bureaucracies and technocracies.I saw once a movie which was quite subversive, and was trying to question the very basic fondations of our societies.  In a scene, several friends were talking about theirs jobs during a dinner.  One of them was criticized for its job of physician, and for the huge amount of money he was "earning".  At some point, he said something like :"During our youth, we studied hard to gain our diplomas.  It's normal that we now get a reward for that."This is a strange conception of economics.  It sounds that for him, a good salary is a right you earn once with some work, and that is perpetually yours after that.  As if intellectual superiority during youth could be a way to obtain a privilegde of being paid every day not for what has been done during this day, but for what was done a long time ago.Knowledge is not a way to acquire the right not to comply to economic rules.  It is supposed to be a way to accomplish oneself, and hopefully to create wealth while doing so.Sometimes it seems to me that intellectual elites think that there is just no way to earn one's life decently in a free market.  Therefore, they think they should organize a way to recognize each other by distinguishing smart young people, in order to give them the right to finance their way of life via taxation and thus by the use of public force.Of course, this is absurd, because all this brain power is not used for what it is, but just as a way to obtain something that can very much be considered as a priviledge.  This is a waste of intellectual resource, but above all, a huge injustice.PS.  Here in France, for instance, 56% of the GDP directly comes from state spending.   Some polls showed that 70% of young people would like to become a state employee.  And of course, but this is just an impression I've got, it seems to me that as in many countries in the world, the professions that are associated to social success are mostly those who are not related to economics reality (not complying to offer and demand, but to state subvention or direct funding) :  physicians, lawers, teachers and such. I missed the name of the 1000nd member.  Too bad. Well, this is all quite true.  But to me it is not clear that Kiba was aware that he was selling 50% of his company, and not 100%.Kiba oviously can't sell his reputation at a huge price as Google did.  The only thing he could sell beyond the price of the machine, is his idea and his motivation to make it real.  And it is not particularly original.   Thus to me, his company worhs very few more than the price of the machine.It is nice anyway to see such a young person (I think he said he's a teen) interested in venture capitalism.  I might indeed be interested.  But he has to come up with a proper initial offering. Well, that was funny anyway.   Just don't take it too seriously   Also, if someone is very interested in an internet project, I doubt such a bad welcome could prevent him from getting more involved. Cool.  I'm going to have some fun writing a bash/gnuplot script in order to print a graph of that.Edit.  I like the format of the datetime Edit bis.  Here is some code :Code:#!/bin/bashcd /tmpf=trades.csvif ! [[ -f "$f" ]]  ||  (( $(stat -c %X "$f") < $(date +%s) - 3600*24 ))then    wget http://www.bitcoinwatch.com/trades.zip    unzip trades.zipfitail -n +2 "$f" |cut -d, -f1 |sort -u |{    declare -a currency    while read c    do        currency+=("$c")        grep "$c" $f |        cut -d, -f 2,3 |        sed -re 's/"//g; s/,/ /g' > "${c//\"/}"    done    [[ -z "$DISPLAY" ]] &&        echo "set terminal png ; set output 'btc-graph.png'"    IFS=,    echo "    set xtics 5e6    set style data lines    plot ${currency[*]}    "} |gnuplot -p &&[[ -z "$DISPLAY" ]] &&fim  'btc-graph.png' This reminds me of a reflexion I had once about objectivism.It started when I was wondering whether there is a real qualitative difference between democracy and dictatorship.  I was also wondering if one can really consider democracy as a "dictatorship of majority towards minority".Then it appeared to me that all those definitions are purely conventionnal.  It's only in maths that things have clear bondaries that allows us to identify them with no doubt.  In real life, there are, as antic materialist philosophers said once, "only atoms and emptiness".There is no point arguing endlessly about how to call things.  Things exist beyond the name we give them.  That's how I understand objectivism. +1And it's not just rethoric.  I used to work in a bank and the director told me once how important it is to stay "near the tap". Ooops.   If true, I apologize.I was just being sarcastic anyway.  Don't want to offend anyone.I don't care if he's gay.  I was just trying to find an explanation for the weirdness of his post. I guess the more this forum gets popular and have an important number of members, the more spambot designers get interested in publishing there. Funny thing about this post is that it could be sent to just about pretty much any kind of internet project's forum.  Just have to copy your message and replace "bitcoin" by the project name.Two hypothesis :1. you are not a human being, but a spambot.  The fact that you mention spambots might be a way for you to get some information about how admins fight against you.  Then your human designer will be able to fool them better.2. you're gay.  Posting a first message and saying "Hi.  Just wanted to introduce myself", sounds like a hyper-social behavior, very characteristic of gay community.  Plus, you announce you live in New-York (as if anybody cares) where those people are not rare, and your signature is a weird "Bruce & Ed", which is difficult not to understand as a way to express that you live with an other man.So, which is it ?  Sometimes I wonder why we should respect laws we don't agree with. +1 In a post, while talking about bitcoin, I wrote "the bitcoin".If bitcoin is a currency, then we might talk about it as we do with other currencies.  Sometimes, we say "the U.S. dollar", or "the Euro", or "the japanese yen" or just "the dollar", "the yen" and so on...Therefore, can we talk about "the bitcoin" ? I suspect Peter Schiff is not geek enough to understand how good is the bitcoin.However, if we could convince him that bitcoin is potentially better than gold, and if we could convince him to advocate for it, this would be a huge support for bitcoins.Tell him some people (like me) have even started to sell their gold for bitcoins  Damned it.  Do you mean that Governments could harm the bitcoin network with this kind of DoS attack ? I don't understand everything but somehow I have the feeling that what ByteCoin says is not completely rubish.Could someone examin all this seriously and make a clear report ?  Ideally it would be Satoshi but I guess he can't be everywhere.PS.  I think there is an intrinsic limit to the number of transactions per second.  I guess it was in order to resist this kind of attack. Buying bitcoins is not that easy.  The exchange markets have some drawbacks (one month waiting for mtgox for instance).  Plus someone might want not to pass through the banking system.  Therefore it is very much possible that someone meets your bid. Mines are.  Notice that you won't necessarly buy my bars.  Someone else could send me a sell order.  If this 'ask' matches your 'bid', I'll make you two contact each other.I put your bid and a link to this message as a reference. that was a first draft.  I edited it. Well, a bid is not a price.  It might be silly to sell a gram of gold for 8 BTC, but who knows ?  It could happen.  A very low bid has at least the merit of existing.  If someone wants to place a bid on the order book, at least he has this as a reference.  It's better than nothing.  You  can place a bid at 10 BTC, if you want Edit.  I actually still have 40 bc to spend.  I've added a bid for 2 grams at 20 bc each. Personnaly I predict the price of gold in bitcoin will be more or less constant in the very long term, but with short term huge volatility.  A bit like the price of gold in silver, for exemple.
Here are mines.  You can give bitcoins to the one you like :Bitcoin is a measure unit for a decentralized electronic commodity, whose amount is limited cryptographically.  15 words.1Ag2MvYKev55EynQGcsXkSohK495m5HAyeBitcoin is worthless, but at least nobody can steal it.  And this is priceless.  14 words.1AD89UiiCsdkAhq1BykBvGKfqQzmhmhvrTAfter the barbareous relic, here comes bitcoin :  the cypherpunk money.  11 words.13H4iob9os2W72zwMrXhhVs9X6cmWmn71yBitcoin is an electronic commodity, suitable for use as a currency.  11 words.1Ap31HrGEdxAYYSB3Hf23dM31CpvyqtoRmBitcoin is to information technology what gold is to economy.  10 words.1HRvEsQKdkw2Nk59fVpH2GyoDvseQu7TRaBitcoin is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency.  6 words.1Gii4FT42y65VLBwCy8kknEn6WxdA6y52F Oops I deleted a response to this thread by mistake.So I was saying that I exist now, and that I've already succeeded in selling a one once silver coin.Plus, two mini gold 1g bars have been bought, and are currently being shipped.  One to France, and an other one to Germany. +1Peter Schiff is one of the funniest austrian economist commentator.  Very pleasant to listen.  I like his analogies for instance. Indeed the H. vs K. rap was pretty good.  When I saw it, I immediately started a french subtitling.  I could do only half of it, though.  Somebody was faster than me an published a nice one.This video is good but very US specific indeed.  Also, it's very talkative and therefore would be hard to subtitle.It would be nice to have a place on this forum or on the bitcoin site where we could gather links to good libertarian oriented clips. Nice.We should work on a translation in other language.Any french female speaker for Alice's voice ?At least it could worth spending some time to subtitle this.  I'll see what I can do.  Any help for this is welcome.  A full transcript in english would be a good start.  I could them time it with a subtitle editor.  Finally,  I can translate it in my own language.Edit.  ahh, why bother ?  would be too much work for too a small benefit. The problem is that we let a bunch of people use force to do business.  We are even stupid enough to pay them for doing so.  We even elect them, and consider them as "great men", or "leaders". I have to agree with theymos.  Personnaly I think sesessionism is the only way to solve this.  If minority can't accept to obey to majority, then there has to be separation, or war. I don't say it's "wrong".  I say that what he's looking for is not investment, but rather "patronage" or "charity".  Or some kind of a mix.PS:Let me correct you :the special deal in this case is a share ''of 50% of'' future profits.That's a big difference. Here is an other game concept.  It can involve several players.We are going to bet on the outcome of a dice, i.e. of the outcome of a random number from 0 to 5.There are several possible bets, basically any combination of the ways you can place you money on the 5 numbers.Thus, a example of a bet can be :0: 01: 1BTC2: 2BTC3: 04: 05: 0In this exemple, the player bets 1 bc on the 1, and 2 bc on the 2.  Such a bet can be noted (0 1 2 0 0 0).Therefore we have a collection of bets  (bet_{i,j}) , where i=0..5 and j=0..N-1,  and N is the number of players.Let's note k the outcome of the dice,  then the player n will receive the following amount :G_n =  \sum_{i,j} bet_{i,j} * bet_{k,n}/\sum_j bet_{k, j}In order to decide the outcome of the dice, each player thinks about a number, and computes a hash of a string beginning with this number.  The right part of the string should be some random characters.  Such a string could be :324  jkncjknsdninusjiujzdujsqoiwqlwdxxfor instance.Each player has to keep this string secret until everybody is ready.   Meanwhile, everybody shows the hash of their string, and the corresponding bet.For instance a player who wants to bet 10 BTC on '4' would say this :(0 0 0 0 10 0)eb36f2f12cc6b586098a10c90493799872f55fcd4fae7b5a9bbc8dc44a2ba06cOnce everyone has placed his bet, everybody reveals his original string.We then calculate the sum of all revealed numbers, modulo 6.All losers should pay the winners in proportion of their bets, in order to comply to the G_n formula.  This means that a player x must pay to a player n the following amount :bet_{i,x} * bet_{k,n}/\sum_j bet_{k, j}A loser who refuses to pay will not be accepted for next games.Ok ?Let's try.  Here is my bet :(0.01 0 0 0 0 0)503d6a1b3c06f8d62f38e5ebc6cd6a658cf109372d3c5e89ac06cc047ea9a0d8If you don't mind, I'll store my original string here, in encrypted form (Idon't want to store it on my disk where I could easily forget about it orremove it).-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)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=pod8-----END PGP MESSAGE----- Jes, estas esperantistoj kiuj uzas la bitcoinan monon !Nu, almenaux estas mi Mi kredas ke ankaux estas la arulo "kaja", sed li ne estas ofte cxi tie.Gxis.

I'm not sure about the first paragraph, but I perfectly agree with the second.PS.  Personnaly I don't know if stable money supply is "economically ideal".  I don't know if anybody knows that.  This should be driven by market forces.  Nobody is more cleaver than the market. As far as I'm concerned, I use a ~/Private encrypted virtual directory (using ecryptfs).  My wallet.dat in ~/.bitcoin is thus a symlink to ~/Private/wallet.dat.I would not feel comfortable adding an other level of symbolic link, so I won't use ~/.local/share for bitcoin.But I guess if someone feels adventurous, he could try that. Ahh indeed !  I feel stupid suddenly Edit.  Hang on :That's not very clear.  How can I check that x and y was fairly generated ?Anyway I give it a try.  I want to see how it works exactly.400 Bad Request.pff...  0.01 bc lost  without even playing  Unless that was the real game edit.Ah ok I could use my browser history to go back to my game.I won this one.edit.Ok I've lost one.  Here is the message I've got :How am I supposed to check that this was fair ?? Here is a game I invented.  It's called "foo or bar ?".  You have 50% chance of winning (it's just like "heads or tail ?" game but "foo or bar ?" is funnier a title).You play for bitcoins.  I'm ok to play for 0.01 BTC.  If you win, I'll pay you 0.01 BTC.  If I win, I expect you to pay me 0.01 BTC.  If I win and you don't pay, I won't play with you anymore.  Fair enough, right ?Here is how it works.  I mentally choose between "foo or bar", and I write on my PC a string such as :foo SOMERUBBISHDATAIWRITEONMYKEYBOARD,flnkjkjngf,lf,kze,dlk,ze,dlk,efle,flThen I compute the sha256sum of this string.I show you this hash, and I ask you "foo or bar ?"If you guess right I pay you, if you're wrong I prove it to you by showing you the inital string.Here it is :43991dbe755b2dbec0b2a5094614c2d7ced35ca0250e3304fbda552eSo,  foo or bar ? Bitcoin is just as much unfair as is any way of hoarding value.   Should new born children consider that life is unfair because all wealth belongs to adults ?  No.Right now if you say that you buy some bitcoins with "real" money or even with gold as I do, some people will think you're just a fool.And yet, if bitcoin was to gain any success in the future, those very same people will insult you and say that it's unfair that you own that many bitcoins.This is just non-sense. This is very true.  Indeed the use of .local is recommanded.  I suggest making a symbolic link :ln -s .local/share/bitcoin  .bitcoin Anyway, talking about the weaknesses of bitcoin, I have a question.Would the bitcoin network resist to an attack consisting of flowding the network with request (I think that's called a denial of service attack) ?I mean, what if a node starts sending huge amount of dummy transactions between two addresses that it owns ??Could it block the whole network ?
I like your post because it's easy to read since with your strict numerotation of themes.1) Low monetary mass. Non issue.  The bitcoin is just a unit of measure.  Each bitcoin is divisable in 10^8 parts.   More than enough.2) Fixed monetary mass.That's not a weakness.  That's the whole point of the thing.3) geekish interfaceDon't care.4) Early/late user unfairnessDon't see any unfairness in that.5) ExchangesGive it time.6) fraudYeah, bitcoin doesn't provide any third party or compensation service.  That's not its goal.  But such service can be provided by someone you trust.  It's the same for all money. Sure.  You can use bitcoind in a bash script, for instance. We should not modify a software protocol just to allow it to fit to particular devices.  For mobile devices, a connection to a distant machine is good enough.   Isn't that what "mobility" is about ?I don't know.  But I guess there is a difference, since the bitcoin client has a -server option.As I said, this has already been addressed in Satoshi's white paper.  The solution is to use Hash trees, and it seems efficient enough. Satoshi already addressed the issue of the size of the block chain in his white paper (http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).  I'm pretty sure it will never be a real problem. Still, I keep thinking that if precision is ever increased to about 32 decimals, we could send message using small change.I think it would be pretty cool.Edit.  For small amounts, one could divide the transfer in two.  The first part being the message, and the second making the necessary complement.Let's say for instance I want to transfer one bitcoin with the message 'bitcoin is cool'.I use a simple 27 characters coding.  'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2 and so on.  The space character is 26.Then the decimal representation of 'bitcoin is cool' is :reduce( lambda a, b: 27*a + b, [11, 14, 14, 2, 26, 18, 8, 26, 13, 8, 14, 2, 19, 8, 1])which is 1262462588570946134764then we make two transfers :  one of 0.1262462588570946134764 BTC, and an other one of 1 - 0.1262462588570946134764 = 0.8737537411429053865236  BTCWouldn't that be cool ?  Alternatively, if I'm ok with paying a small fee for such a data transmission, I can transfer an amount of :1.00000000001262462588570946134764But this is possible only with a 32 decimals precision.For very very small amounts, it won't be possible.  But I guess no one would want to associate a message to such small transfers.Edit.  I suspect there are deep implications to this idea.  I think it could be related to Shannon's theory of information.  Somehow, I think it could be possible to consider the smallest bitcoin unit as a "right to transfer a bit of information trough the bitcoin network".  This could help the whole abstract conceptualization of the network.   I will write more about that once it will get clearer in my head. Basically if you give part of profits to a non-owner, it's kind of a gift.  In capitalism, you can give things to people for no reason.  You can say it's capitalism if you want, but to me it is just as absurd as saying charity is part of capitalism.More precisely, if Kiba insists on keeping 50% on the profits, then I consider that he owns 50% of the company.  Therefore, the shares that he will sell will represent 50% of the company, and nothing more.  That's why if the machine he wants to buy costs 1250$, and if he wants to sell 100 shares of his company, then I will price these shares at :1250 / 2  / 100 = 6.25$Anyone who would pay more would be fooled by Kiba, imo. I think you are very wrong.  Bitcoin is certainly not a way to abolish money.  Rather, it is a ultra-modern form of money.  It is about as communist as gold can be.  And I doubt gold is a communist money.Don't confuse capitalism with banking system.  Basically capitalism is the right of ownership.  Bitcoin is a money that is way more difficult to steal than other forms of money.  It is therefore not socialist.  At all. Maybe we should ask an admin to edit the title of this thread and add a WARNING note. Good.  Looking forward to that. That's an other reason why reputation is so important.  You have to make people believe in you when you tell them something.Of course it will be easier if you abandon the idea of owning 50% of the company, and let investors share say about 90%.  You would receive 10% of the profits, plus a salary.Edit.  By the way,  proving that you own some money is easy with bitcoins.  You just have to use keys which are known in the bitcoin network to worth a certain amount.  Since those keys support signing, it is easy. Not exactly.  Capitalism is the ownership of means of production.  What you are talking about is liberalism.Of course if someone wants to pay labour with a share of profits, he can.  But practical experience shows that it is not interesting.  Profits are the fruits of ownership, not labour.  I know I would not buy a share of a company which distributes a proportion of profit to workers.  Or at least I would diminish my price in accordance. Ok, but investors will be more interested in bringing the second half if you can show them that you already own the first.To put it simply,  your project exists already :  right now you own 100% of the shares.  But those shares worth nothing, until you convince people to buy some.If you convince investors that you own 625$, and tell them that you intend to buy a 1250$ worh machine, then you might convince them to buy 50% of your shares at 12.5$ a share.Your company will then have the necessary amount, and you will have a the right to keep 50% of the profits. I understand.  It's perfectly normal from you to want to make money with your idea, without giving half of it to investors.To do so, you need to raise half of the price of the device.But you can also accept the idea that investors will gain more money than you, at least at the beginning.  Then, with the money you'll earn, you will buy their shares back, until you eventually own more than 50% of the company. That is not how things work.  What you are talking about is a labour.  It requires a salary.  This can be negociated.  A director can perfectly be a simple employee.  Same for any technician.But this is different from the way profits are distributed.This is basic capitalism. Indeed.  But that's not possible if you already get 50% of the profit without owning 50% of the shares.It seems that what you really want to do is to open only half of the capital.  In that case, the amount you want to raise is not 1250$, but 625$.  You will provide the second half of it. This is just not acceptable.  You should receive in porportion to the part of the capital that you own.If your machine costs 1250$, you'll get 50% of the profit if and only if you bring 625$. Mobile phone application won't have to be a full bitcoin client nor server.  It wouldn't make much sense.It would be much simpler for mobile phones to use a service such as mybitcoin, or to connect via ssl to a Personnal Desktop.I don't think the size of the block chain is an issue.  At all.  I don't care if it bothers some users.  Some people will always be unhappy about something.Please don't touch the protocol.  It is fine as it is right now. Gosh I can't believe this happened.  Even a hero member such as noagendamarket got screwed.  A good lesson indeed. I'd like to add that such a service is not new (I think it's called "rapid prototyping"), but this one would be the first one to charge in bitcoins. Wouldn't it be much simpler to be able to run several instances of bitcoin, each of them running on a specific "wallet.dat" file ?I mean, we would just add a --wallet long option to the client/server app.  The name of your account would be the name of your wallet file.
Good.  I'm glad you are willing to do things in the proper way.I very much think your project is possible.  1,225$ is not that much money, anyway  We don't need a lawyer, but a few precautions.First, you should publish your GnuPG key.  Your reputation worths nothing if it is not associated to a secure way to identify yourself.Second, if I send some bitcoins to your address, you have to send me a signed document proving that I actually contributed to your fundraising.Also, you have to publish somewhere about how much exactly has been raised so far.  Such publicaction should be as regular as possible.Moreover, if I buy shares of your microcompany, I expect a bit more than a right to receive a share of your future profits.  There should be the possibility to attend to an assembly and to vote for decisions.  You can't claim "all business decisions" once you're not the only one who brought the capital. You're going a bit fast, imo.What about writing a clear and exhaustive company status document ?If you want to raise say 2,000$, you must sell say 100 shares at 20$ each.  I.e about 200 BTC / share.I'd be ok to buy one share, but you have to formalize all this much better. As discussed on freenode, would you consider raising the necessary capital by selling shares of your future business ?If you do, I'm in. I didn't know.  Well, I've put this bid on my page, using a link to this message as a reference to contact you in case someone is willing to sell 1g of gold for 8 BTC. I didn't know about mailvault.  I don't get it :  what's the point of using GPG if you don't own your private key ?  Well, I guess some people just don't like the idea of installing software on their computer...Anyway, on their "about" page, they mention their distributed offshore servers :  http://www.metropipe.net/This website accepts an impressive number of methods for paiements, including pecunix for instance.   I guess they might accept bitcoins. Hi Madhatter,I see now that we're at almost 0.14$/bc !  That's 40% in a few days.   I don't know if I should be happy about that.   It will obviously be used by bitcoins detractors to say that bitcoin is a buble. I mean, say we want to convince a certain charity to accept bitcoins.We start collecting donations inside our community, for instance using someone's reputation on this forum (we have to chose someone with huge reputation since we need to trust that this guy will actually use the money for the donation).Once we collect a fairly huge amount, we convert it into national currency, make the donation, and add the following remark :  "this money was raised using bitcoins.  Please consider using it."Of course, the tough part is to find someone who will collect bitcoins.  We need someone with a huge reputation.  Maybe Satoshi ?Concerning the choice of the organisation, I suggest I2P or Freenet, for they are imo the most likely to accept using bitcoins. What do you mean ??You don't need anything to use GPG, apart from the GPG software. +1Also, I'd like to point at that bitcoin should adhere to the KISS philosophy.It's common nerd knowledge that many software were great at beginning, but tend to become ugly fat cats as users wanted to add many features to it.  Additionnal features that are not required for the protocol, should be part of a separate project. Just don't do that, seriously.  You'll end up in jail.Trying to fool the police and send drugs by many different ways have been a regular activity for criminels for decades.  Police and gansters have gained much experience in this domain.  I very much doubt you have any real original idea.  And what for ?  Do you really want to send drug that much anyway ?  Can't you think about better things to do as a hobby ? This site is a good idea, but it seems to be tightly watched by Big Brother :Remember that at origin, Paypal was intended to be a free method of exchanging money between individuals.  It's much less ambitious now because of heavy power of financial regulation.All these regulation conditions have a cost.  Somebody has to pay for that.  And it will be you.My opinion is that everything which is web-oriented, should be avoided when it comes to exchanging money. I also wonder if the message has to be taken into account for the hash computation.  Not doing so would allow to delete it later.I very much don't like this idea of a message.  Since it is not necessary to the protocol, I'm not sure if it would be easy to find a place where it really fits.  I'm not a programmer though.  I'd be curious to have Satoshi's thought on this.Edit.  I have a funny idea.  Imagine that numeric precision is increased way beyond 8 decimals, say 128 decimals for instance.What about using those decimals to code your message ?  Somehow you would have a "natural fee" for this service, and we won't have to modify anything from the protocol.Edit #2.  Gosh I LOVE this idea Edit #3.  We don't need 128 decimals.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but with 32 decimals you can code a 17 characters-longed uncompressed message in a 64 characters set.  (32*log(10)/log(64)  = 7.717) What about the increase of the block size, then ?Even if 512o per transaction is small, it might represent a significative amount since all has to be stored in the block chain. I red somewhere that the kind of keys used in the software supports signature, but not encryption.Since it is very easy to create a new bitcoin address for each transaction, a paiement label is not necessary.  Just use the bitcoin address as a reference for your message, and transmit it via email or any other way of communication. That's what I meant (I edited my msg to make it clearer).From the FAQ we can read : << The coin value is 50 bc per block for the first 210,000 blocks, 25 bc for the next 210,000 blocks, then 12.5 bc, 6.25 bc and so on. >>Thus, a forked network could try to generate more than 25 bc after the block number 210,000.  I guess those block will not be accepted, since the original nodes will expect no more than 25 bc. Such a fork of bitcoin could not be compatible with original bitcoin network.In order to create more than 21 Mbc, a forked network would have to keep generating 50 bc/block even after the block number 210,000.  The new transactions in these blocks will immediately be spotted as illegals (anyone can confirm that ?), as the nodes will be expecting 25 new bitcoins instead of 50, thus these blocks will be rejected by the original network.That being said, I confess I kind of feel a little bit anxious about what will append when we reach this 210,000nd block.  It will be an important step in the bitcoin community, imo.

http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/103809/hippie-infestationjust kidding, ok Hippies are annoying, but harmless people. Well, I have been interested in alternative money for some time, so I've read a bit about a few of exemples during the last few years.Only bitcoin gave me a very good impression.    Others were not interesting enough for me to remember them.I could mention digital cash, however.  It has been designed by a very famous programmer, David Chaum, known for his work in cryptography.  It uses an interesting concept called blind signature, but I was never very enthusiastic about it, for it is still related to current banking system.  It's just an improvement of the current system, imo. Indeed.  The thing is, in their society, a person like me would be considered as a criminal, for I would defend what I would consider to be the fruit of my labour.  I wouldn't let those damn hippies take what I've been working for.  Thus, they would have either to fight against me, and to do so they might need an organised force, either to let me live apart with other people who believe in property right. I love bash scripting, so please let me help to try to improve this script a bit.Code:#!/bin/bash# put btc address in a variable, for clarity# and in case we should use it for something elsebtc_address=1AVgSRgQ4dF8Fwi3hfvFZ1uhnWoWGT25sR# store current balance# and check that bitcoind is running in the same timeif balance=$(bitcoind getbalance)then    # always use '[[' instead of '['    # make sure it works with any number of decimals    # use quotes    if [[ "$balance" =~ ^0.0*$ ]]    then echo "no coins generated"    else bitcoind sendtoaddress $btc_address $balance    fielse    error=$?    echo "something went wrong.  Is bitcoind running ?"    return $errorfi When a letter is suspicious, it is searched.  Police is capable of noticing letters sent to the same address during regular time intervals, with a significatif weight.Don't try to send illegal stuffs via mail.  You will certainly get cought. Well, ok then.  I guess I'll just have to be patient. I'm very much looking forward to see bitcoin in the official debian repo.So far, I think it's difficult because of an incompatible version of wxwidget or something.But do we really need any GUI application at all, anyway ?  Isn't the headless client far enough ?Personnaly I use the console very often, and most of time if I want to check my bitcoin account, I just run "watch bitcoind getinfo" in a gnu screen window.Anyway, the following mail from a debian developper let me think I'm not the only one who wonder whether we need X at all for this app.: From: Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>: To: Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>, 578157@bugs.debian.org: Subject: Re: Bug#578157: ITP: bitcoin -- peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital currency: Date: Fri, 22 Oct 2010 16:52:21 +0100: : [Message part 1 (text/plain, inline)]: : On Sat, 17 Apr 2010 14:41:11 +0200, Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk> wrote:: ...: > Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that: > is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or: > trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and: > transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to: > check for double-spending.: : Hi Jonas,: : I have a suggestion while you're waiting for developments in WxWidget: packaging.  How about packaging the command-line bits of bitcoin (as: bitcoin-cli or bitcoin-headless, say)?: : I'd imagine that quite a lot of Debian users would end up running the: cli stuff anyway (since having coin generation ticking away on some: server seems like a fairly likely scenario, and seems likely to be good: for the P2P network): : Then, once the WxWidget stuff becomes available, that can be generated: as another package, possibly depending on the cli one.: : Cheers, Phil.I want to add that a programm that is supposed to run on background (for coin generation), is not very convenient if it must have its own X window.Clearly a daemon-like program should be a command-line programm, shouldn't it ? I am SO looking forward to see an anarcho-socialist answer this question...Edit:  there is obviously an answer in the anarchism FAQ :<<I.5.8 What about crime?For anarchists, "crime" can best be described as anti-social acts, or behaviour which harms someone else or which invades their personal space. Anarchists argue that the root cause for crime is not some perversity of human nature or "original sin," but is due to the type of society by which people are moulded. For example, anarchists point out that by eliminating private property, crime could be reduced by about 90 percent, since about 90 percent of crime is currently motivated by evils stemming from private property such as poverty, homelessness, unemployment, and alienation. Moreover, by adopting anarchist methods of non-authoritarian child rearing and education, most of the remaining crimes could also be eliminated, because they are largely due to the anti-social, perverse, and cruel "secondary drives" that develop because of authoritarian, pleasure-negative child-rearing practices (See section J.6 -- "What methods of child rearing do anarchists advocate?")>>http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5#seci58Personnaly, I'm not convinced. Even if it stays a niche, it will be enough for me.   Many things, not only precious metals, are not accepted as paiement, and still have a lot of trading value.  Luxury items, or collectionnable things (such as stamps, or art).Even if bitcoin doesn't go mainstream, it can still have a real success.Of course it would be nice if bitcoin gains some popular success, but to me it's absolutely not necessary. Well, I don't sell grams for 8 BTC, but for 500 BTC, because there's still the risk bitcoins don't succeed, or that an other block chain gains more popularity.I might consider higher bids, though.  Check out my web page http://grondilu.freeshell.org/bitXmetal.html. I've done that on my prefered linux distribution forum :  aptosid.http://www.aptosid.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=219I even proposed to buy the bitcoins they would collect.All I got was a polite decline.Edit:  well, I've just insisted a bit, though. This is a very naive approach concerning a theoretical price of gold in bitcoins.Let's say there are about 170,000 tons of gold on Earth's surface (both above and below ground).If we just divide this quantity by 21 millions of bitcoins, we get a price of about 8 BTC for one kilogram of gold.Now I know, this amount looks ridiculously small, but somehow this encourages me to sell my gold for bitcoins :-) I very much doubt that a fork would include a fork of the block chain.  I think it would consist of a fork of the software, that would be launched from a brand new block chain. Ok now I understand better.BTW, isn't this kind of standardisation supposed to be the job of IEEE and OSI ? Two other questions :Considering that it's very likely that keynesianism oriented people will try to modify the protocol in the future, how confident are you that there will never be more than 21 MBTC ?Also, do you think the current block chain will be the definitive one ? Personnaly I don't care if no businesses accept bitcoins.  As long as I can buy some on some plateform exchanges, or via mail, I don't care at all.Businesses don't accept bitcoin, nor they accept gold or silver coins.  And still, gold and silver worth much more than national currencies.The fact that no one knows anything about bitcoins doesn't mean anything to me. Unfortunately, there is a consensus in mainstream economists, which states that deflation is bad for economy as it discourage investments.  Bitcoin will certainly have to face critics about this.  Fortunately, those critics are not new.  They were popular amongst people who managed to have governments abandon the gold standard.To me, deflation and inflation are just economics phenomenae.  They are the adaptative result of an change in economics situation.  None of them is more healthy than the other.  Both allow capital and money to adjust to productivity and demand.  During gold standard, there were deflationist periods when there were big increases of wealth in the same time.At some point, some people will ask for a change in the bitcoin protocol, in order to increase the number of bitcoins.  Hopefully, those people will just make a fork of bitcoin, and create their own currency, which would be, in my opinion, just about as crappy as present national currencies.   If I have to receive such coins on my computer, I will immediately sell them with contempt, and buy real bitcoins.And if bitcoins were to be modified in order to allow arbitrary increase of the total amount, I will immediately sell all my bitcoins to buy gold and silver. Well, to me this very forum and its website IS such an organisation.  I don't understand what we might need more. Bitcoin4cash.com displays a rate of 0.105$/BTC.I think it's the record high, isn't it ?BTW, how does bitcoin4cash establish such price ? Google does so many things, that sometimes we could just ignore a few things they do that are quite useful.On of these is Google trends, which might be quite handy to watch bitcoin's popularity on the web :http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoinI hope this curve is gonna rise 
I guess this could be in the wiki but I post it here first.I've recently looked for a free alternative to TrueCrypt.On my Debian system, I've found ecryptfs.  It seems nice because it doesn't require you to encrypt a whole partition.First, install the package :apt-get install ecryptfs-utilsThen, create a ~/Private directory.Setup this directory as your encrypted directory with the command :ecryptfs-setup-private(you may need to load the ecryptfs module with modprobe or something)You will be prompted for your login password and for a optionnal mount password.  Using only your login password is easier since it will save you the typing of an additionnal password.Relog.Move your wallet.dat file in your Private directory, and make a symlink :mv .bitcoin/wallet.dat Privateln -s $HOME/Private/wallet.dat .bitcoinThat's about it.You can unmount your private dir with the ecryptfs-umount-private command.This directory can be used for other sensitive files, such as .fetchmailrc, .ssh/id_dsa, .gnupg and so on. Indeed the possibility to audit the amount already paid is a good idea.  It would be very easy with bitcoins, since all transactions are public. Hum ?  What did I get wrong ?  I thought it would be ok.   I guess I didn't understand what base58 is exactly...  My bad.edit:ok I checked Satoshi's code (in base58.h), and now I know ://// Why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?// - Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and//      could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.// - A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.// - E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.// - Doubleclicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric.// IllSend1000BTCtoWhoEvrMakesDisAddrGood luckMore seriously, I think this app is useless, but very much fun.  I'm looking forward to see a stable version. It is a tool indeed.  But I think it is THE tool anarcap needs in order to become reality. I haven't read all this thread but I'd like to say that keyneysianism makes me sick.   I've seen the part where Krugman promoted a "broken window" concept and I felt like vomiting. Obviously nowadays democracy has indeed become inacceptable, for it has legalized theft, and only a small minority of bureaucrats and technocrats really benefit from it, by stealing people's fruit of labor, in order to maintain their way of life.Anarcap is scary, but we just can't accept the direction social-democracies are taking. Well, I wasn't quite right when I said that whether or not anarcap is evil depends on whether or not humans are evil.  It's rather a matter of whether or not their evil part is stronger than their good part.  The question is :  can farmers organize a private force to protect them, without letting this force get enough power to enslave them ?Honnestly I don't know, but I think we can't blame them for trying. I like the way you express that.  It's quite exactly how I see it. "Challenging, exciting, and fun".  It will also probably be more dangerous, but I don't care.  If danger is the price to pay not to live in the jail they are buiding around us, so be it. Personnaly, I consider bitcoin to be the first serious candidate for an anarcho-capitalistic currency.Now, searching the web for the concept of anarcho-capitalism, I've found this apparently famous quote from Noam Chomsky :<<    Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever    implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few    counterparts in human history. There isn't the slightest possibility that    its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because they would    quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error. The idea of    "free contract" between the potentate and his starving subject is a sick    joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar exploring the    consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but nowhere else.>>Well, somehow I agree that ancap could lead to some ugly things.  I doubt however that it would have no "counterparts in human history".  I think that, to some extend, roman empire can be considered as anarcho-capitalistic, for instance.Anyway, whether or not anarcho-capitalism is evil is a huge subject, but somehow I think it's pretty much the same as wondering whether or not human beings are evil.  Anarcho capitalism gives individuals a huge power, for instance the power of letting people starve heartlessly.  But I also think it could lead to great things.  Anyway, I prefer the anarcho-capitalist perspective, rather than a bureaucratico-socialist world government.The thing is :  I don't really know if humans are evil, but I'm one of them, and I know I'm not.  So I give others the benefit of the doubt. Well, you can buy some stuffs with it.  Go to http://grondilu.freeshell.org/bitXmetal.html for instance.  You can buy gold and silver there  Well, I have.Although it may be legal, I think it would be gross/rude.  Actually I saw once a reportage about a photographer would took picture of people in the subway.  He had to make sure people don't find out he was photographing.  I wouldn't feel comfortable doing this, personnaly.Maybe it's legal, maybe it's not, I don't know.  Google had some trouble in EU with its Google cars, so there is definitely an issue with capturing "public" data.There are things beyond law :  habits, politeness, and well-behavior.  Capturing data in the street, images or sound, is very much controversal, in my opinion. Well, playing a fair game of poker online is a very tough subject indeed.First, I'm not sure mental poker is already reliable.  I've red that right now it works only for two players games.Second, how exactly do you intend to prevent collaboration ?  As I see it, the only way to prevent this, is to make sure none of the players know each other.  This is tricky, and in my opinion it can only be done in a anonymous network, such as Freenet or something.Third, as far as an escrow service is concerned, it is also tricky.  It is not a pronlem specific to poker, though.  I didn't understand well your solution, but I think one can use a principle that would be close to the bitcoin system.  A network of anonymous nodes would offer escrow services, and the choice of the actual node for a game would be chosen in a random way.  The escrow node would have to perform some proof of work in order to gain the priviledge of being the third party.  Hopefully if honnest nodes are numerous enough, the escrow service would work fine.Finally, I think it would be great if it was possible to create some kind of a robot on an anonymous network.  This robot would act like a virus, and would be programmed to organize poker games.  He would chose players, not letting them know each other, and would collect bets as a third party.  I don't know if such a bot would be feasible, though.  Plus, there should be a way to make sure the robot is honnest, for instance by making it open source.  But then, I don't know how could people be sure the instance they are playing with is really the one they think.I think this subject is a little too advanced for me, but I reckon it is a very interessant and important one, as far as information technology is concerned.I have the feeling that a good solution for online fair poker games won't be found during this century... Well, using a cloud filesystem storage would be great for wallet backup (after encryption, of course).But I checked the availibilty of tahoe on my debian system, and "apt-cache seach tahoe" returned nothing.I still have to check out the website of this stuff, though. Well, that might be good enough.Exchange and storage of value are both fondamental usage of money.  None of them is more important than the other.Currently used forms of money are better in exchange than in storage.  Bitcoins are good in both.Now, I guess some people don't like the idea of seeing people saving money.  Nowadays, saving money is considered to be useless, and bad for economy.  People prefer consumption.  I really think this is a biased point of view.Indeed bitcoins might be a good way for people to save money.  But this is a good thing, for it allows value to be available in future, in case it becomes more useful than in the present.  There's nothing wrong with that. The very purpose of bitcoin is not to require any centralized organisation.  I don't see why bitcoin should try to mimic an organisation like Visa, for whom I have very little respect, personnaly.Again, to me it seems just as weird as an organisation dedicated to gold, silver, salt, sugar or any other commodity. I keep failing to understand what your purpose is exactly. There is no such thing as a safe investissment.However, I have very much more confidence into bitcoins than into dollars.Dollar is about to become a terrible currency.  You are the only one who can decide what to do with your money, but if you want my advice, I'll tell you that you'd better spend these 1000$ in pretty much anything but cash. I really don't understand all this mess about currency wars.  I know that the basic idea is that if a nation currency is too strong, it's bad for its industries because it gives them a competitive disadvantage on international markets.But to me this just doesn't make sense.  How can someone complain that something is "too cheap" ?  If someone makes very cheap stuffs, I won't complain :  I'll just buy it.  I'll even stop producing and I will borrow money if I need to.  If a money is really "too" cheap, then it's an arbitrage opportunity and one just has to buy it. I didn't know about Wirtland.  This surely seems like a nice project, especially on these times where nations are trying to force the idea of a world government.With increase communication possibility, the urge for a territorial domain in order to maintain a large human organised society decreases.  Thus, a supra-territorial organisation seems logical.It's not new, though.  Somehow, one can consider organisations such as freemsonery ("franc maçonnerie") to be some kind of supra-national state.Still, it's a good things such projects developp.   The more they are, the better they will be able to counterweight the raise of world government.
I just couldn't wait for your feedback guys, so I've already ordered for about 50EUR of linux and debian stickers and other stuffs.I will sell them for bitcoins asap. As a way for me to acquire A LOT of bitcoins, I'm considering buying some real stuffs in euro, and sell them in bitcoins.So far I'm thinking about geek related stuffs, such as open source promotional T-shirt, mugs, "linux inside" stickers, and so on.Do you have any suggestion ?What kind of stuff would you like to buy with your bitcoins ? Lucky you.I'll try again, with a smaller amount. Bitcoin is nothing more than an electronic commodity.  It's not any political organisation, or at least it should not be.  What you suggest is about as weird as would be the creation of a gold-dedicated political movement.Now, I know there *are* indeed such organisations, such as GATA (Gold AntiTrust Action Committee).  But this organisation exists only because of the manipulation of gold price from central banks.So, I guess a bitcoin organisation would be required only when central banks will start trying to corner the market. If nobody can, we'll have to consider removing the bitcoin2cash link from the "market" page. Well, yes, I guess so.  And I've even been stupid enough not to write a return address.I don't care much.  I've lost much more than 10$ many times in my life. Well, I had already done the comparaison with gold earlier in this thread, so I wanted to change.But I should have sticked with gold.  That's what bitcoin is :  electronic gold.  And it's actually even better, since gold is not very easy to handle in very small quantities.Anyway, here is the comparaison with gold.In the whole world, there are about 150,000 tons of gold.  That's 150 billions of kilograms, and about 5 billions of onces.  All those numbers represents the same quantity. More seriously, should we say again that the actual amount of bitcoins doesn't matter, as long as it is both constant and divisable enough ?It's really just a unit of measure.  In a ton of sand, there are 1000 of kilograms, one billion grams, and still, it's all the same amount of sand. Well, I've been silly enough to lose 10$ this way.  My mistake.I won't do it again.Also I think if some guy had to steal 10$ this way, I guess he needed it more than I do. Yeah indeed.  eBay's fees are outragious. Nothing,,but it might look suspicious if the 9 GPG key are referenced by only one source. An other possibility is to use mybitcoin.com to deal with small amounts, and to store only large amounts on a local wallet.dat file.You would use this file very rarely, and encryt it as soon as you're done with it, never leaving any non-encrypted version on your disk. I think it is an issue, indeed.I wish there was a simple way to store some value and forget about it.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you can be sure that a wallet.dat backup file will keep its value, as long as you don't use its private keys to send some money to someone else.  Because if you do so, the software may have to combine some amounts stored in several private keys, and put the change in a new one.So as I understand it, the only thing you have to do is to store your wallet.dat file somewhere, and remove it from your .bitcoin directory.  The software will then start with a brand new set of private keys, forgetting about the previous ones. I thik we might just make it simple :  a database of evaluations of market participants.  It doesn't have to be decentralised.  Google will do the job.  Here is how I see it.All participants should be identified by a GPG public key.  Once a trade is successful, both participants should sign and publish a message such as :-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1On October, 23th 2010, I made a commercial transaction with a person whose public GPG key was IDXXXXXX.The transaction was done without any problem.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)iEYEARECAAYFAkywLWsACgkQq17371C4DmjLUgCgvBAPXJg/mdv4PemxBRgHZ+iwqnUAoI+bt6Nt7FG+3H/lDe9qEb4wWN0H=rop/-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----I'll do this kind of things on my site (http://grondilu.freeshell.org/bitXmetal.html)Google robots would collect all those informations, so that one could have a fairly large amount of report from any GPG ID key.It wouldn't be perfect, but it would do the job not so bad I think. Yeah I know it might sound silly but why not ?It would be a no-brainer way to acquire bitcoins.  Plus, it would give audience, and thus help promote the bitcoin system. Satoshi doesn't "call for an end" whatsoever.  21 millions IS an asymptotic limit.As I understood, since the number of bitcoins created for each new block will decrease geometrically (50, then 25, then 12.5, etc.), then the total number of bitcoins will be the limit of a geometric serie (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series).  I guess 21 millions is the result of Satoshi's calculation.Can anyone confirm ? Those remarks concerning the "number" of bitcoins are just amazing.Why can't you see the bitcoin as a unit of measure, instead of a single entity ?I mean, there are about 200,000 tons of gold in the world.  That's 200 millions of kilograms.  However, there is not more gold if you count it in kilograms than in tons.If you divide a bitcoin in ten, you don't add 9 bitcoins !  Just as you can't make more bread by spliting a piece of bread in several pieces.  You're not Jesus-Christ   !In other worlds : you can't increase the quantity of some commodity, just by increasing the precision of the tool you use to measure it. Sorry.  I meant "timestamp server", as Satoshi call it in his white paper. I've never used Jabber.  I use IRC.Is it Jabber much better than IRC ? What is your political orientation ?  Would you say that the creation of bitcoin was politicaly oriented ?And by the way, for how long have you been planning to rule the world ? PS:Do you realise how freaking genius was your idea of a decentralized time server ?How does it feel to change History of human kind ? (well, maybe this one is a bit too much   )
You can't now, but you will.Until then you can restart the program with a new, empty wallet. Yes, as long as my desire to get the content overcomes my fear of losing 5$.Of course, it's up to the seller to evaluate this probability and adjust his price.  Sometimes, he just won't find any acceptable price and will give up the idea of making the product.  It's not much different from conventionnal businesses. Of course.  But this first pre-condition is satisfied already :  P2P anonymous network exist.Setting a selling price and sticking to it is a business model in *a lot* of other economic sectors.  I don't see why it wouldn't work for information.I don't know.  The thing is :  they don't have much choice.  It's this or they don't see content at all.  That's the point about ownership :  you're supposed to have some control on access to the thing you own.  Selling is about requesting money for this access.  If you don't want to pay, then you just have to forget about accessing to the thing you wanted.  It's a choice the buyer has to make. Nice.+1 They are theftproof, provided that you do what has to be done to prevent theft.You can prevent people from stealing your gold by putting it in a safe.  But this safe is useless if you don't close it.  If it's wide open, or closed with a poor security code, then it's useless.If you really want to prevent anyone from stealing your bitcoins, you can.  You just encrypt and backup your wallet.dat file, and remove the orginal file.  And that's it.  Sure, you won't be able to use your bitcoins until you restore your wallet, but that's not the point.  It's the same as your gold : you can't use it as long as it is in your safe.  You can't have protection and useability in the same time. Well, this would be Diaspora.But before it is implemented as a software, I'd like to see some theoretical, almost mathematical/game-theory-oriented approach to this, in order to determin whether or not it is possible, and how efficient it would be. As I understood the system, key pairs are used to identify transactions, not bitcoins.There is no such thing as a "coin" in the information system.  Only transactions.  The owner of some value is identified by the knowlegde of the last private key of some transaction in the last block.  The amount is the amount of the transaction. Chill out.  Even if you get screwed, it won't be the end of the world, right ?I think the guy from bitcoin2cash has much more interest in being honnest than in being a thief right from the beginning of his business.Personnaly I'm quite confident that I will get my BTC this week. More precisely, if a government have a law voted that is illegal or unconstitutionnal, at some point it *might* (it's not even sure) receive a disapproval from a higher authority (constitutionnal consil, UNO, human right association, whatever...).  But they get away with it with no real sanction, they can just apologize and vote a almost identical law.The whole thing is a joke. Yeah, ok.  It's not 100% theft proof.  But it is the most difficult thing to steal that I know. Still, enforcement is not required.Some company could be specialized in "certification" of other companies.  They would engage their reputation in claiming that the companies that they certify are trust-full.  There would be no enforcement as a general rule, but only as a particular agreement between the certification company and the copany it certifies.It might look like the current system, but there is an important difference :  no one can forbid a company to try to introduce herself in the market using nothing but her own self-confidence.Also, the certification market would not be a monopoly controlled by force.  It would comply to market rules. I can use an encrypted file system.Or I can encrypt my wallet.dat file when I'm not using the bitcoin software.Or I can have most of my bitcoins encrypted on a distant machine, and use only small change for my local machine.And so on... +1Except maybe for contracts.  A contract is a way to engage your reputation and protect against liars.  In an anarcho-capitalistic point of view, it's perfectly valid as long as it's nothing but a way to write down what you intend to do. OMG.  He just discovered the moon.How much is he paid to say such obvious statements ? Very simple :   the beginning of the file foobar.avi directly available via http.With a CGI script, clients could pay bitcoins to add some additionnal data to the file, until it is complete.  The price would be expressed in BTC/seconds.Sounds so simple that something tells me it will never work. I confess I didn't know that the name wasn't required. +1I'd like to say something about bitcoin2cash.  The postal address has explicit name "bitcash2coin" in it.  I'm not sure it's a good idea.  Ok, right now, nobody knows bitcoins.  But eventually this address should be changed in something more discrete, imo. Very true.   I can't beleive we're having such a conversation about someone who is notoriously on this very same forum ! Ok I get it now.  Thks.
Yeah he's actually the antechrist, coming on earth to bring us the evil numbers.Isn't there a part in the apocalypse, where humans will use numbers as money and will thus be enslaved by the beast ?I'm just kidding, don't worry.  I don't believe in those stuffs. Well, I'm not very good at those stuff, but isn't bitcoin2cash's bid a better deal ?I mean, if I want to buy btc with 1$, with you I get 1./0.0605=16.53 BTC, when bitcoin2cash offers 25 BTC for the same dollar.  What do I get wrong ? I'm not sure I wrote that.  I don't remember.  Maybe something went wrong with your computer when you quoted me.  Please check.Anyway, I can not be suited for something I say I *might do in the future*.  One can not be blame for supposed future actions. On the contrary I very much think it's his real name.However smart you are, it's pretty difficult to immediately realise how smart are the things you make when you make them.  Satoshi used this name "Satoshi Nakamoto", from the very beginning.  I doubt it was an alias.  He wouldn't have picked such a rather boring alias, anyway.  He would have chosen some cultural reference of some sort.  Not a plain common japanese name.I also think he's japanese, even if he probably lives in US. A Satoshi's biography would certainly be a best seller in the bitcoin community.  And it would be a nice experiment for my model of selling information using bitcoins (see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1344.0)He could sell his bio for 100BTC a paragraph, for instance  I've never succeeded in logging into this site.I thought I remembered the passwd correctly but still "wrong password".  Then I click "I forgot my password" and I receive nothing.   ... I also think he did it in order to rule the world, as any nerd secretly plans to. Such an hypothesis is a bit too big for me.  I doubt it complies to Occam's razor.Also, quantum computers would make quantum cryptography easy.So it would kill bitcoins, but would allow the arrival of a quantic cryptocurrency, which would be absolutely unbreakable. This is a perfectly acceptable point of view, apart from one thing :  I doubt the word "abuse" is appropriate.Abuse is the improper usage for bad purpose.  When a gangster is using bitcoins, he's using it in a proper way, for its real purpose.  It's only his motivation which is "bad" or, more precisely, illegal.  When a ganster is getting in a train to move a stolen marchandise from a A point to a B point, we can't talk about any "abuse" of the train.  Otherwise we could say exactly the same thing about pretty much any single thing he uses : from his car to his telephone, not to mention his computer, his shoes, the food he eats or the air is breathing...  This would be ridiculous and would make the world "abuse" lose all its sense, turning it into a synonym for "used for criminal activities".I agree with what you say about people refusing to do business with people who seem fishy.  But this has absolutely nothing to do with the business medium.  It could be bitcoin, fiat money, computers or telephones, Internet...  The list is long.Crime should not be an obstacle to technical progress. Nice metaphore. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truecrypt#Licensing« The TrueCrypt License has not been officially approved by the Open SourceInitiative and is not considered "free" by several major Linux distributions(Arch Linux^[25], Debian^[26], Ubuntu^[27], Fedora^[28], openSUSE^[29],Gentoo^[30]), mainly because of distribution and copyright-liabilityreasons.^[31] » TrueCrypt is not free software.I definitely need to learn the free alternative, which is cryptsetup on GNU/linux, I guess. I don't think so.  No enforcement is necessary as long as you consider that an investor is responsible from his investiment choices.If an investor wants to buy shares of a company, that means he has some trust into this company.  Therefore it's up to him to believe or not in the company's published accounts.Sure, an enforced company would have a better price, since it would be possible for non-much motivated investors to invests in it.But it should be possible for a company to rely entirely on its reputation, and on its reputation only, to have investors trust her. Sure, but it's a centralized system.  So it's easy to make a rating system.The question is :  how would work a rating system in a decentralized network ?Is it even possible ? Should I care about organised crime using bitcoins ?I don't.  Shame on me, I know.On the contrary, the fact that organised crime will spend energy in using bitcoins ensures me that governments won't be able to control the bitcoin network.Crime should be fought for what it is.  A murder is a murder.  A theft is a theft.  But when a criminal is using a car, he's just a person who is driving a car.  Fast cars are important for thieves, for they allow them to escape from police.  Still, I don't think it would be a good idea to forbid the use of fast cars.  It's the same old debate regarding the tool and its use.  A hammer can kill someone, if it is used in this intention.  Still, we don't ban hammers.Therefore, I don't care if organised crime is using bitcoins.  I don't care at all.  There are other ways to fight criminals than tracking their expenses. Thks for this warning.  I'll try to keep it in mind. What I like about cryptocurrencies, whether it is bitcoin or any other yet-to-become major cryptocurrency, is that it is impossible to steal it, unless you use torture.I know very few theftproof things.  Actually I don't know any of them.I can put some gold in a safe, but any thief with appropriate tools can open any safe.  I can hide it somewhere in a desert place, but anyone could just find it and take it.Real estate is so easy to steal if not protected by public force.  Diamonds are small so you can easily hide them, but still, it's not perfect.  I've heard that during WWII, some jews hid some value using very rare philatelic stamps.  It's good, but not very reliable, imo.Cryptocurrencies are theftproof, as long as cryptographic functions can not be broken.  And so far, they can't.  Therefore the only key to access your wallet, is the passphrase you stored in your mind.If I'm right, if cryptocurrencies are really theftproof, then they are priceless. Honnestly it must be difficult to be bigger a fan of bitcoin than me, for I've been waiting for such a currency to appear for years now. I am so selling my gold now.Indeed maybe the winning cryptocurrency won't be bitcoin.   But it's the first one, in what I consider to be a new area in history of economics.2009 will be written in history as the year when cryptocurrencies were invented. In 2000, the smart move was to buy gold.In 2010, is it to buy bitcoins ?Could it be the winning trade of the century ?
Seriously : could anyone replace "Kriptomonunuo" by "Cxifromono" in the esperanto page ?   "Kriptomonunuo" is very ugly for it means "the money unit from the crypt".   In esperanto, "kripto" is the underground cell where we burry dead people.Please ! It may sound presomptuous but I think I have quite an accurate idea of what Satoshi's goal is.I've been thinking about digital money for quite some time now.  At least two years.  First it was because I was curious about the main theoretical problem :  what is the best way to send money through internet ?  Why can't we send money via email ?   Then it was because I was disgusted by the banking oligarchy and the "too big to fail".   While I was imaging the concept, I came to the conclusion that one should use asymetric key pairs to indentify every single monetary unit, and that the knowledge of a private key would equal the ownership of the associated monetary unit.  I couldn't find a way to get out of the centralized server concept, though.  When I red Satoshi's white paper, it kind of freed my mind from this reflexion theme.  Now I don't have to think about it anymore, since Satoshi has found the solution with his very clever decentralized time server idea.  The fact that Satoshi's idea is exactly what I was looking for, makes me think he had the same initial goal :  creating an efficient and rational way to transfer value on internet.Is there any political/activist intent from him ?  I don't know.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm a very liberal person and an enthousiast supporter of free market and individual freedom.  I guess Satoshi is too, but I can't speak for him, obviously. For some reason I don't like this idea.  At all.Against spam I prefer the X-hash idea, which is already used.  It's a proof of work attached to any sent email. I'm not sure that free riders are an issue as long as the seller can make sure he raised the expected amount of money.If you buy a car, and then lend it to a friend, I'm not sure your friend can be considered as a "free rider".  Once your car is bought, you can share it with someone else : it's not the initial seller's business anymore.  Selling divulgation allows alienation, while selling diffusion doesn't.Indeed, it's likely to be less profitable, of course.  But since sellers presently use public force to sell, I can understand that they make more money than if they wouldn't.  A gangster certainly makes less money with no gun. why ?  Is 0.3.12 that bad ? Well, they haven't so far, but their terms of service allow them to do so any time they want.  See above. Ok, I may reconsider my position about LR then (I guess if they start charging monthly I can just close my account).  Won't be soon, though.Good luck with your business. An interesting aspect of information market is that it is, as far as I know, the only market where both transfers are, thanks to bitcoins, irrevocables and decentralized.I mean : when you buy a piece of information, say a 32Ko block, you exchange pure information against bitcoin.  Both transfer doesn't imply the use of a trust party in any way, at least if you don't require compensation.  It's really a pure exchange model, from a technical point of view.Therefore I think implementing a P2P information market software can be an interesting experimentation.If I were to suggest a technique to do so, I would say that a P2P decentralized adjudication and compensation system would be installed, inspired from the bitcoin model.  Each bid and ask for a given hash would be broadcasted globally on the network, and a node would be allowed to perform both adjudication/compensation automatically after some proof of work of increasing difficulty.  The unpredictable location of this node would ensure honnesty of adjudication/compensation.  At least as long as the honnests nodes are majoritary, like in the bitcoin model.Let me give an example.Say Alice is a node in the network, and wants to buy the 32Ko block whose hash is HHH.  She lets every nodes in the network know what she wants (she broadcasts a bid).   Bob has HHH, and in response, he broadcast a ask for this block.  After some time, all nodes will have their own copies of a global orders book stored in their memory.  According to the protocol, nothing happens until a node, say the one that belongs to Claire, performs a certain proof-of-work on this book order.  Then Claire does the adjudication of the book order, and publishes her results, resulting in the possibility of the exchange between Alice and Bob.  Alice then send bitcoins to Claire, and Bob sends the block to Claire.  Claire, then, sends block to Alice, and bitcoins to Bob, thus performing compensation.Anyway, I think the information market problem is a interesting one, from a theoretical point of view.There would be many ways to implement it, imo.  Only one would be perfect, and we should keep looking for it.  For instance, the above proposal would suffer several problems.  One is that nothing is done to prevent dumb nodes to have the whole network waste time.  Indeed, a node might very well *try* to steal some bitcoins by pretending it has pretty much all hashes, although it actually has nothing.  The network would realize the scam and avoid it only at compensation level, thus wasting a lot of resource and time.  It could halt the whole network.  Thus, a trust system should be implemented, in order to avoid nodes that try to publish rubbish.  The economics algorithm of GNUnet would do the job, I guess.An other idea :  in a "do one thing, but do it well" philosophy, adjudication and compensation should be separated.  In our example, this would mean that Claire would only be in charge of adjudication.  She would process the order book and produce a "request for compensation".  Such a request would then be broadcasted in the network, and an other proof-of-work would be required on it before the compensation could be performed by an other node, say Daniel.Both Claire and Daniel, seen respectively as a Adjudicator and a compensator, would be judged in the trust GNUnet model by Alice and Bob for their respectives roles, so that they can be avoided later if they don't do their job properly. Section 11 of their Terms of Service : 11.1. Issuer reserves the right to assess and collect the following fees from Users account the following fees: (i) Monthly Fee; collected by Issuer monthly from Users account; (ii) Transfer Fee, deducted by Issuer in USD from the recipient account of a Transfer, these fees are available in Issuers web page in the Fees page; (iii) Administrative Fees, collected by Issuer for providing support to User when User contacts Issuer and Issuer is not at fault. Maybe I'm wrong but I think very few people here are interested in LR.As far as I'm concerned, when I learned about bitcoins, I immediately tried to find a way to buy some efficiently and to do so at some point I thought LR was a solution.But when I saw their Terms Agreements, I red that there are some monthly fees, so I just forgot about it.  Just no way. done.  I've sent a link to this thread on freenode #gnunet. Indeed.  I'm a poor programmer anyway, so I couldn't be of much help if someone wanted to implement this.  But I guess it wouldn't be very difficult since there is already a bitcoin JSON API.I still think, however, that GNUnet is the only appropriate network.  Because as long as you pay someone to get something, there is the risk he doesn't give it to you.  This implies the need for an economics algorithm in the network, and such an algorithm is already implemented in GNUnet. I'm not sure it would be that easy.  I doubt current P2P protocols distribute files in a tree hash form.  A tree hash form is necessary in order to make sure you don't buy rubbish.Maybe the GNUnet protocol would be compatible. Well, my guess is porn industry will be one of the first to do something like that.Apart from this, I realize that the base-128 designation system is not necessary.Customers first buy the root hash block, then each of hashes it is made of, and so on, until what they get is identified to be in the expected format (avi for instance).Also, seller should estimate the number of potential buyers in order to chose an appropriate block size (and thus the correct number of blocks).   This is necessary to adapt the price of each block. Here are some of my thoughts concerning the problem of selling information at distance.As you know, selling information is a hot topic nowadays.  Since the popular rise of worldwide P2P filesharing networks, major audiovisual entertainment companies have suffered from a dramatic loss of profit.  Thanks to intense lobying towards politics, they're slowly managing to have some laws voted in order to protect the so-called "intellectual property", mainly via internet control and regulation of ISPs.Now, I won't discuss here about intellectual property and why it should or not be protected using public force.  Instead, I'd like to suggest a way to sell information from a purely technical basis, without any need of juridical intervention or coercion.Selling information is tricky.  This is old news.  Several professions have to deal with this problem on a daily basis.  Journalists, for instance, must be very carefull not to divulgate their *scoops* before it is printed and available for sell on main street.  This illustrates the very point about information :  it is yours as long as it is a secret.  As soon as you communicate it to just one person, it is not yours anymore.  To sell information, you must sell divulgation, not diffusion.Therefore, the main idea about selling information is to sell it once, not to try to sell several copies of it.  Of course, this means that you have to sell it to a very high price, at least as high as your production cost, more if you want to make profit.   Selling such an expensive product is almost impossible if you want to sell it to the general public.  A solution is to sell your information by parts.  One byte at a time.Such a decomposition of selling would require an easy an efficient micropaiement solution, for which I think Bitcoin is an excellent candidate.There are several ways to imagine how such a selling could occur.  I'd like to introduce one, which would be based on a hash tree decomposition of the information.Say I want to sell a 1Go file called foobar.avi.First I create a sha-256 tree of this file, with 32Ko sized blocks.  Then, I make sure I have a way to designate each of thes hashes in the tree in a unique way.  The root hash is just a other name for the file "foobar.avi".  It is a hash of a 32Ko file containing 32Ko/256= 128 other hashes.  Each of them also are hashes of 128 other hashes.  Thus, I can easily identify each hash using a big integer in a 128-base notation, for instance :109.77.56Since a 1Go file contains at most 32768 32ko files, then the number will have at most 3 digits (in a 128-base notation, though).So if we add the root hash as a prefix, we have a precise way to designate any hash of the hash tree :faebc3c13a28521ab38d2482bae4e27e7c754f665f03cebdf7917f34864676bf:109.77.56where faeb... is the root hash.Now customers can contact me and ask for a 32Ko block whose hash-256 is referenced as above.  I'll sell it to them, at a price that will be about 32768 less than the total earnings I expect to get from foobar.avi.  Customers can not view foobar.avi with only one block, but at least they can be asured that they bought a part of the hash tree (provided that they already own "upper" blocks).Customers then share their blocks on a P2P network, or any other way, it's not my problem.  But they will only be able to watch foobar.avi once allblocks will be sold, and my money raised. Maybe we could have the main page of bitcoin.com be in chineese instead of english  ? Well, to buy stuff with bitcoins, you first have to own some bitcoins, right ?I don't have any powerful hardware, but I have some cash, so I buy bitcoins until I find something that I'd like to buy with them. I understand what you mean.I guess you're right. Non issue, imo.Those guys are just working for us.  I'll just buy their bitcoins.  It will probably be cheaper than buying expensive hardware and running it 24/24.By selling bitcoins those might think they screw us.  I think they're just wrong. If bitcoin is to gain any popularity in the future, at some point some T-shirts will be designed to help promote the concept.I'm condidering making some of them myself, but it's bit early I think.Anyway,  here are some ideas of what could be written on those T-shirts :Front:This T-shirt was bought for 1000\\\Huge{Bitcoins}Back:www.bitcoin.orgFront:\Huge{Bitcoin}\\\small{the crypto-currency}Front:BitcoinBack:Block number :  90000\\and still counting...Front:After the barbarous relic,\\here comes the cyperpunk money :\Huge{Bitcoin}Back:www.bitcoin.orgFront:10MHsh/sBack:www.bitcoin.org
Well, if that's true this is going to change.I recently wrote an article about bitcoins on a famous french linux website : http://linuxfr.org/2010/09/30/27430.htmlAs you can see, this article brought about 800 clicks on the bitcoin website.If you worry about popularity of bitcoins, Google trends can help :  http://www.google.com/trends?q=bitcoin I'm fine with a split of the channel.The topic for #bitcoin-dev might be something like :"This is the *logged* channel about bitcoin developpement.  For relaxed non-logged chat about bitcoin, join #bicoin-..." Ok, thks.  I'm looking forward to see this pretty much automated, though. Is there a clean, complete HOWTO about this subject (How to backup)  ?AFAIC I just made backup.sh script in my .bitcoin folder :Code:#!/bin/bashgpg -r $USERNAME -e wallet.datsftp $USERNAME@SOME_STORAGE_SERVICE.com <<EOFput wallet.dat.gpgEOFI wonder if I should or not keep a backup history or something (backup.dat.1.gpg, backup.dat.2.gpg, etc.).What do you think ? Well, at least this game is usefull since it reveals the weaknesses, if there are any, of the bitcoin software during intensive small transactions.  Maybe you should report all incidents to the dev-team ? Well I'd be sorry to have to resort to that.  IRC was a nice place where people could chat without Google recording everything.  Now people want to log every single chat room...  pff. You know what ?I don't give a sh.t if Bitcoin can be used for money laundering ! It's not a matter of good behavior, it's a matter of having a place where you can talk without thinking all the time of what would happen if my boss reads what I am writting.   There are a lot of people that I don't want them to know what I like, what I do on casual time, what are my political beliefs, and so on.  I'm not exhibitionnist and therefore I don't want everyone to know everything about me, or even about my pseudonym : I'd like my pseudo to carry some reputation on cyberspace so even for my electronic identity, I want it to have some place where it can be used relatively anonymously.[/quote] Maybe you should pm sirius-m directly.But please first make sure that the translation is correct now, because I guess he won't be happy if we disturb him twice for a translation, especially with this language ! indeed, makes sense. If the early adopters have a lot of bitcoins, I don't see anything wrong with it. An imaginary conversation on an IRC channel :<Alice>Yeah...  I had fun last night.<Bob>So you went to the party, finally ? Have you seen your old friend John ?<Alice>Yeah, omg.  I drunk too much and when I saw him, I couldn't resist and we did bad things.<Bob>Don't tell anything more, Alice.  You know, this chan is archived !<Alice>Really ?  Oh, sh..it ! When you talk with a friend in the street, people around could be listening to your conversation.  So it's a public place.And yet, would you agree if governments woud decide to put mics everywhere in the street, so that all "public" conversations would be recorded and archived ?? Unless he wants to buy Satoshi's bitcoins, I'd say he just didn't understand how bitcoins works and wanted some explanations. Pretty cool, hum ?  :-)But I'll feel much better when someone edit the current page and change the horrible word 'Kriptomonunuo' to 'Cxifromono'. Why does he want to talk to Satoshi ??Didn't he understand that this is a decentralized system, and that no one rules it ?What an arrogant attitude to think that, because he is a banker, he should talk directly to the initiator of the project ! In this kind of transaction, the one who makes the "first step" is obviously the one who has the slowest reputation.  bitcoin2cash has a better reputation since is has a website, even trivial.  So if I'm not happy it would be easy for me to just say "bitcoin2cash is a scam".   Now, if I was Satoshi, I would easily convince bitcoin2cash to send bitcoins first.  Because my reputation would be superior to bitcoin2cash's reputation. It is now. However, I made a few mistake.Here is a slighlty modified version.Also, the esperanto version is incorrect.  Please use this one instead. To put it simply : if you log IRC, you're working for Big Brother. +1
