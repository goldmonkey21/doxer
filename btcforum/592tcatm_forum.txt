There is no guarantee on the order of the data so you'd need to sort it in some cases. Sorting can be done in O(n log n) so it shouldn't be a huge problem. I'll consider pre-sorting on the server in the future but please don't rely on it!The reason for the unsorted output is likely that I've switched to a database backend that can run things in parallel now or maybe it just went unnoticed until now for some other reason. Crossed orderbooks are completely natural on exchanges like bitcoin.de and localbitcoins due to manual order matching done by the users -- not automatically by the exchange! Provider (Hetzner) messed the routing up. I couldn't even reach the server and the support didn't understand the problem ("Ping works fine so your server is up").The site you saw seems to be served from 176.9.79.205 while bitcoincharts.com is 176.9.79.196. Where did you get that 26.05 from? It's the complete history. Complete dumps (updated once a day) are now available from bitcoincharts:http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/This is a beta feature and might change without notice. Hey,I'm looking for CC licensed photos showing people using Bitcoin. Please post URLs (with license and copyright information!) if you have made such photos. I intend to use them on bitcoin.org as background images.Things I have in mind:* Smartphone used for transaction* "bitcoin accepted here" sticker on door (no brand names should be visible)* a pretty map of the world showing transactions* physical coins, bitbills, ...* ... Patch here: https://github.com/tcatm/bitcoin/commit/126fdaef110aca47acf888a2e599167554280fe7Branch multi-wallet: https://github.com/tcatm/bitcoin/tree/multi-walletIt allows to select between multiple wallets within the datadir. e.g. bitcoin -wallet=foo.dat will load $DATADIR/foo.dat (or create it if it doesn't exist). Don't use it to access wallets outside the datadir. Try http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD and click "Load raw data" (below the chart). It'll show you a table with the same data (+weighted price for each interval) as is shown in the chart. The chart viewer at http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/ will now display the raw data used to render the chart in a table below.(I've got tons of emails asking for raw data...) That doesn't look like JSON. {"address": 1000, "address2": 500, "address3": 700} http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/volumepie/ This is fixed in 0.5.0. IIRC the problem is because your router is not closing those TCP connections correctly so as far as bitcoin is concerned those connections are still open. I've set up a transifex project for translating the bitcoin client:https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/bitcoin/resource/tx/ Yes, it's the total number of bitcoins generated; not the number if bitcoins "available". I'm using github's API: https://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/bitcoin/bitcoin/contributors/anon Looks like someone did that and it now includes people who didn't contribute a single line of code to the satoshi client (which the little box is all about). Live at http://188.138.99.158/ (hopefully soon on bitcoin.org). It's updated daily via a cronjob.Source code: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.orgFeel free to make pull requests to improve it. You can even extend it with jekyll plugins. I recently created this chart https://i.imgur.com/sotmB.png (y: seconds, x: blocks)Maybe it's something you could add to your site? It might be useful to detect irregular timestamps. I have this feature in my development branch and I'm going to push the changes to bitcoin.org within the next days.Here's a screenshot. Should I have missed any aliases let me know and I'll add them.https://i.imgur.com/5fTGr.png
Nein, aber da meine Inbox etwas unübersichtlich wurde, habe ich einen workaround geschrieben. Von Bitmarket.eu selber habe ich immer noch nichts gehört. Bitcoincharts does not run a real node and it refuses connection from time to time. It's only collecting statistics and analyzing transactions. Yes: http://bitcoincharts.com/about/markets-api/ (I re-enabled full history download last night) Ich arbeite daran. Der Server muss ja bei normaler Handelsaktivität permanent 1500 Clients mit nahezu realtime Kursen versorgen und haufenweise Charts rendern. Und bitte nicht vergessen, dass bitcoincharts ein Freizeitprojekt von mir ist. Die Verzögerung kommt daher, dass bitmarket.eu meist auf der einen Seite SEPA/Überweisungen verwendet und die eben ein wenig dauern bevor der Verkäufer/Käufer die Transaktion bestätigen kann. 1x XFX 2GB D5 X HD5970 BLACK EDITION2x SAPPHIRE  Radeon HD5970 2048MB GDDR4 RTL PCI-E DUALmir ist gerade aufgefallen, dass ich nur für eine der beiden Sapphire eine Rechnung habe.

Heute ist sie dann endlich angekommen. Also warte einfach noch eine Woche. Das Geld kommt dann schon an  Nope, the bug was not related to JavaScript. Both bugs are fixed now. I have just verified it. Yep, that's why I made every re-broadcast show up. Only first seen was boring and I wouldn't be able to tell whether it's really the first node anyway so a transaction from China could show up somewhere in Australia first. The same applies for blocks. Herzlich willkommen!Du kannst (sofern du mir und BlueMatt vertraust) hier einen Snapshot der Blockkette herunterladen.http://bitcoin.bluematt.me/bitcoin-nightly/blockchain-nightly/bitcoin-blockchain-20110602.tar.gz (etwa 220 MB)Die Datei musst du so entpacken, dass du die bestehende blkindex und blk0001 ersetzt. Dabei muss Bitcoin geschlossen sein. You could save the page locally and change the fadeOut line. Maybe I'll add some control feature tomorrow. Raw transactions next to the map (like on the list of unconfirmed transactions) might be useful, too. I hacked my python client to connect to as many nodes as possible. Currently, it's connected to about 900 nodes. Above that, it seems to take some time to discover new nodes, that are accepting connections. Can you retry? I changed some TCP settings on the server that *might* be the problem. Hrm, can you open the Network tab, refresh the page and check if a line with ws://eu1.bitcoincharts.... appears and that it's status code is 101? I'm also running Chrome 11 on 64-bit Linux. It should work without plugins. Can you rightclick on the page -> "Inspect Element" -> Console and check whether it says "connected"? Try a "send to self" transaction. There should be yellow dots appearing all over the map from nodes that forward that transaction.edit: Sample:   https://i.imgur.com/69Y0T.png
http://eu1.bitcoincharts.com/map/Works only in Chrome (needs websocket).Currently, it also shows forwarded transactions and blocks thus you can see how they spread through the network. I might change that in the future. I made a read-only copy of the wiki: http://eu1.bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin-wiki/wiki/Main_Page.htmlDon't bookmark this link! FYI, I've made all detail charts and tables on bitcoincharts.com auto-updating. Not realtime yet, though. There's also http://bitcoincharts.com andtelnet bitcoincharts.com 27007 (no depth updates yet) v0.3.5:* support for subcent values  It looks like this gadget has a bug which causes it to do multiple requests per second to http://bitcoincharts.com/t/markets.json in some cases.Bitcoincharts has firewall rules which blacklists IPs that cause too many request/s. If you can't access bitcoincharts, email me at info@bitcoincharts.com and mention your IP so I can unblock it. I changed the link to a static image. It's too much work for the tiny VPS to render it on demand. I'm working on a historic market depth chart.Here's one for mtgox:https://i.imgur.com/wcPH7.pngThis is work-in-progress and will change frequently until I figured out how such a chart should look. Any suggestions?  I started work on a patch that adds a CLI:https://github.com/tcatm/bitcoin/tree/cliCode:$ ./bitcoindWelcome to Bitcoin, the digital crypto currency.

Thank you for using Bitcoin!$ You need to specify the symbol you want (e.g. mtgoxUSD in your case):http://bitcoincharts.com/t/trades.csv?symbol=mtgoxUSDAlso, if you want the complete history you need to set a start timestamp:http://bitcoincharts.com/t/trades.csv?symbol=mtgoxUSD&start=0 That's all data that was ever available from mtgox IIRC. If anyone has older trade data I'll be happy to add it to the database  I'm happy to announce that http://bitcoincharts.com now offers historic market data.Code:http://bitcoincharts.com/t/trades.csv?symbol=SYMBOL[&start=UNIXTIME][&end=UNIXTIME]returns CSV:unixtime,price,amountYou can get a list of symbols and the currency traded from http://bitcoincharts.com/t/markets.jsonWithout start or end set it'll return the last few days (this might change!).Examples:Code:Latest mtgoxUSD trades:http://bitcoincharts.com/t/trades.csv?symbol=mtgoxUSDAll bcmPPUSD trades:http://bitcoincharts.com/t/trades.csv?symbol=bcmPPUSD&start=0btcexYAD trades from a range:http://bitcoincharts.com/t/trades.csv?symbol=btcexYAD&start=1303000000&end=1303100000Donations accepted at 1Nqr3MqVyUp6k3o3QPePAdn4Yg4tzgB9kwPlease don't use this for realtime streaming! Use the telnet interface (TCP port 27007) instead.This service is strictly for personal use. Do not assume this data to be 100% accurate or write trading bots that rely on it. Yep, it should temporarily turn off the fans, too...  well, if you want testers, add testnet support. That's what testnet is for. Does it support testnet? Good idea. Maybe the stdio CLI could accept JSON or RPC commands? JSON returns JSON, RPC prettyprints.So a client like Spesmilo could just start bitcoin-cli as a subprocess and communicate via a pipe.At the same time, bitcoin-cli could function as an interactive client to another bitcoin(-cli) running with -server. Some ideas for bitcoind:* rename bitcoind -> bitcoin-cli* add an interactive readline RPC interface forking is disabled* don't start TCP RPC by default if forking is disabledExamples:$ bitcoin-cli> getinfo{...}> stop$$ bitcoin-cli -serverStarting ThreadRPC> stop$$ bitcoin-cli -daemon$ # same behaviour as bitcoind Looks like it has been merged here:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/d12ea887bcf1eab4b029007c4bf5821992c0c6b1 I'm currently developing a interface to access the data (as CSV) from custom intervals. It'll be available soon.
http://bitcoincharts.com has all data  @slush: can you add support for other symbols? Weekly chart added. 2 hours of coding just to get the SQL query right :/ weekly intervals: I'll add that soon, but I need to teach my SQL queries to know about weekstarts (same for months).BTC vs. Gold is still on my todo, though low priority.Another coder might really help, but I can't afford to pay one. I'm still looking for ways to fund development of bitcoincharts so I could spend a few weeks adding all those missing features fulltime. New features:* list raw orderbook entries* weighted prices and trade volume for markets for last 15min .. 1year* summary page for each marketComments? Missing features?  There's a race condition that causes only part of the histogram/data table to be displayed sometimes. It will be fixed soon. 1-min and 5-min intervals added I added weighted prices to both http://bitcoincharts.com and http://bitcoinwatch.comIt's also available as json: http://bitcoincharts.com/t/weighted_prices.json Systray icon behaviour: agreed, sounds logical.Closing window: As long as the main windows represents the bitcoin program (and not just a view of the transaction list) it should actually close when the user clicks the "x". There's already the minimize button to hide the window instead. added download icons to http://bitcoincharts.com/~tcatm/bitcoin.org/ I think it's very important to have a good explanation of what Bitcoin is and how it works on bitcoin.org, translated into many languages.  Bitcoin is still something very new and different and most people don't know much about it. While the wiki is nice for in-depth articles a short but correct overview (say 2..3 subpages: What it is, how to use it and fundamental protocol rules) will be helpful to users just discovering bitcoin. It shouldn't go too much into how it is used today, though. Just explain what you can do with it (i.e. no RPC documentation) and don't focus too much on the "official" client. I didn't know you were using Internet Explorer. The fix only works for Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. Fixed. Video playback is broken on <983px and Firefox 3, though. What screen resolution are you referring to? It works from 995px wide screens up to >1500px. I added a small hack to fix the layout in IE7. I think it's IE8 (win7) which is also available for WinXP. IE works fine here: http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/4906/86163378.png @kiba: My mockup has a dedicated link to the video. I don't think there is enough space to show the video on the front page in a reasonable size. another idea (not finished/WIP): http://bitcoincharts.com/~tcatm/bitcoin.org/  outputs ASCII representations of transactions and blocks as they appear on the network
Hey,here's some code that calculates the total number of bitcoins generated at a certain height:Code:def t(h):    return (sum([21e4*int(50e8/2**k) for k in xrange(int((h+1)/21e4))])+int(50e8/2**(int((h+1)/21e4)))*((h+1)-(int((h+1)/21e4))*21e4))/1e8 telnet bitcoincharts.com 27007outputs JSON objects with fields: symbol, currency, timestamp, price and volumeLatency is approx. 15s. There were some issues that prevented bitcoinwatch from updating today. This has been fixed. ProxyPass should be enough. RPC is only JSON. I think that's already possible. Try setting RPC.url to "bitcoind/" and it should append that to the path. Why not remove the "Logged" link from the template? Great work! I'll add a link to the wiki on the project page. Where do you get that 4000 oau figure from? Is there any bitcoin/gold market I don't know about? http://bitcoinwatch.com has changed owners and is now part of http://bitcoincharts.comNew features:* shows all markets bitcoincharts knows about* show only markets with trades within the last 24h* total economy size in EURO Because of Cross-Site Scripting protection in most browsers you need the python server. I made a patch that removes the miner (not getwork): https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/132 I rewrote the backend for this service. Sometimes it would show transactions as unconfirmed even though they were confirmed. This shouldn't happen anymore now. Reasons I wrote this:* works across network without bitcoind binary* makes testing RPC features easy* could be enhanced to pretty print listtransactions or listaccounts* could support user confirmation on sendfrom ("Are you sure you want to send 1000 BTC to 1Hs53...? (y/N)") I found this (unfinished) code on my harddisk. It's basically a replacement for the built-in RPC client in bitcoind. host/port/user/pass is currently hardcoded.http://pastebin.com/Nqhq1FUs A PS3 does (in theory) about 10..15 Mhash/s. IIRC the SPEs lack a rotate instruction which slows mining down a lot. Have you tried the example QR codes? You can include a message that is displayed to the user (not signed, though) and where he can either send or cancel the transaction.I'd like to start a "bank" that uses js-remote as it's frontend, but I'm very busy lately so it might take some months but some backend code is already working. 173.255.224.227 (bitcoincharts.com) will accept and relay sendmany transactions to miners that'll include them into their blocks within a day (on average). * xlisttransactions http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=611.0* getblock https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=724.0 Some new features:* shows inputs (with links to blockexplorer)* marks unconfirmed inputs (red) That's my hotlink prevention. I found a lot of sites hotlinking the charts and while the engine is very efficient I still didn't like the server load. I'll disable it for now. When I enable it again someday, I'll make sure to include a "download this chart" link.Btw: You can tweak the &width=xxx&height=yyy parametes for the chart if you prefer different sizes for your analysis:Code:http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/chart.png?width=500&height=200&m=mtgoxUSD&t=S&v=1
Full orderbook via websocket is broken (probably due to changing servers) so it falls back to the reduced orderbook available via HTTP Looks good. Maybe we could set up a git repo to work on the redesign? You don't need a poll. Just pick the good features from both mock-ups, after all they are anything but a final design where we have to chose either one.What about swapping Download and "What is Bitcoin" in #1? So the order would be: What is bitcoin?, Download, Quickstart Yep, better increment only the third number even for small bugfixes (and we should really write a roadmap so we can have 0.4 soon instead of 0.3.693). > Assuming just local LAN connections (no internet), if I send BTC to another instance: will the other instance receive it ?yes (assuming they're connected to each other)> Assuming one of the machines finds a block, will that transmission be encapsulated ?yes, the transaction will be included in that block> And if this happens several times for multiple blocks, And when Internet comes back, will the blocks be added to the chain ?only if your chain is longer than the "other" chain. If it's shorter, the transactions will be ripped from your blocks and included in future blocks (as long as the transactions are still valid) Bitcoincharts now has list of all unconfirmed transactions known to my node:http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/ mtgox is changing servers and the DNS hasn't updated yet. I hope this will fix itself within a few hours Enlarge checkbox makes technical indicators larger.Trade volume is reset at midnight UTC. I want to switch to "last 24 hours" but I don't know how to calculate the "previous close" and "open" for that yet. I just finished the redesign of http://bitcoincharts.com.New features:* large table of all markets* more markets (bcmv2 will follow as soon as there are few more trades)* larger charts that autoresize to fit the window* market depth chart* statistics for slush's pool* ticker for #bitcoin-otc* completely incompatible with Internet Explorer* all ads are within containers with class=ad so you can hide them easily with .ad { display: none }Thanks for your donations!

This patch introduces a bug on de_DE locale when sending using the wxGUI. Dialogbox with "Error in amount" Yes, you can host it on Apache, but you need to tell Apache to tunnel the JSON RPC requests to bitcoin. (I don't know how to do that) Just create certificates with openssl:openssl req -new -newkey rsa:1024 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.certand run it with:python SSLserver.py -r http://localhost:8332/then connect to https://$IP:8338/ I've fixed the patch and made a pull request: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/74 Fixed a bug preventing sending in labelsmode in some cases. Fixed. Thanks! v0.3.2:added labelsmode (assumes accounts are labels like the wxGUI does)can create accounts/labels
Donate them to someone making a patch for importing private keys into the wallet.  You don't need to use bitcoin://address. bitcoin:address works fine in firefox and you can use the URI scheme from https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/URI_Scheme (used by js-remote)js-remote always pre-fills fields and offers to send when both amount and address is set. Feel free to try out the demo to see how it works. I've made a small patch to remove the from/message fields from SendDialog as it seems to confuse users. This doesn't update uiproject.fbp as wxformbuilder decided to change the entire structure of the file so it can't be patched easily (file is about 900kb).I don't have a wx build environment so I don't even know if this patch compiles.

Best OC settings vary greatly. For 5970 it is usually around 800 MHz. js-remote ( http://tcatm.github.com/bitcoin-js-remote ) does something very similar. Except it doesn't use bluetooth, but QR codes. Fixed Sirius' picture: poclbm and DiabloMiner only check some of the returned results form GPU hoping that the GPU will not find too many possible solutions. They improved that in recent versions, though. So my miner is a little bit (about 0.015%) faster. It also features a special pool mode because of this, which is much more efficient when using a pool. update: miner now measures effective hashrate by inspecting actual results returned by GPU (instead of counting kernel runs). Returned hashrate is reliable after approx. 30 min runtime That's a good idea. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/ is the integration branch and the patch is included. Maybe us GPU miners should make a hall of fame, too? My miners found a total of 1184 blocks and I guess ArtForz's found even more; not to mention all those CPU miners running a year ago. I added version tags (0.3.20 and 0.3.21 for now) to some issues and will try to keep them up to date so we'll always know what's blocking a release. Added poolmode (-m). Submits all H==0 results instead of only the best one. Here's a copy of my hacked SDK: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10284953/sdk2.1-hacked.tbz2 Does not work with pools. Added poolmode (-m). Works best on 5870/5970 and SDK 2.1. Early development state. Patches welcome 552 Mhash/s on 5970 @ 725 MHzhttps://github.com/tcatm/oclminerThis miner checks *all* solutions and doesn't throw away nonces like poclbm and DiabloMiner do to save bandwidth. There was a problem with updating trade history data from bitcoin-central.net. I fixed it with help from davout. I'm working on a RPC GUI using either pygtk or wx (haven't decided yet). It will be similar to js-remote. Offtopic: For easy to remember and secure passwords https://www.pwdhash.com/ works pretty good. There are browser extensions for most browsers. Do you know a good source I could poll for Gold / USD price and a source for Gold price history?
So it's just both charts overlaid on a relative y-axis? Like the exiting "compare with" option? Can you give an example of such a chart (and maybe a datasource)? @vladimir: Can we run custom miner software on your hardware + rent a small server to run bitcoind that is close in terms of latency (< 1ms) to the miners? 1) SSL would require all clients to upgrade. 2) Random TCP ports could be annoying for users running other services on their computers on certain ports when Bitcoin decides to use them.3) UPnP would really be useful with all those NAT gateways. Maybe we can use the same exponent-style encoding we invented for the URI Scheme for manual user input on the commandline and use raw int64 in JSON? It's too easy to append 9 zeros instead of 8 on a keyboard.RPC results should then return raw int64 values.  Even if you didn't use QR codes you could still use the URI scheme to transfer address, amount and a short message to the client. With Bitcoin we don't need bi-directional communication when transferring such payment requests, so it's useful to have one scheme that can be transmitted via different communication channels. Copy and pasting raw addresses will always work, but I think it's important to add extra information so the user knows what he's going to pay for and doesn't need to enter the amount manually, especially on a phone with only a touchscreen. What about QR codes to transfer addresses? I use them for js-remote and they work great for transferring coins from/to my Android phone. I'm using the URI scheme from the wiki. The miner in bitcoind itself and getwork based miners update the TX regularly. After all, the whole point of mining is to confirm transactions. 4x rule was considered and actually makes overtaking easier. You can create 5 (iirc) blocks per second (implicit limit in AcceptBlock()). Without the 4x rule difficulty would rise to too high after the first 2016 blocks. With the rule, it will rise to 4 and we can still generate the next 2016 blocks in a short time. http://pastebin.com/v98gWWLc (port of ArtForz's code)567 Mhash/s on a 5970 @ 725 MHz First: Please discuss this in another thread. This is only for js-remote! This is a feature that needs support in bitcoin itself. Once there are RPCs I can add such a feature to js-remote. You could use BBE's getreceivedbyaddress: http://blockexplorer.com/q/getreceivedbyaddress/$address Statically linked bitcoind for android is about 4 MB. Testnet can be reset within 2 days by overtaking the blockchain. This will reset all balances. I might actually do that this week. Final difficulty will be ~ 0.5 after reset. v0.3.1: fix transaction list on firefox fake-push and logging support: http://pastebin.com/J4qZRgXT Have you seen my js-remote ( http://tcatm.github.com/bitcoin-js-remote/ )? It supports QR codes. v0.3 released.* faster rendering of transaction list* more responsive on Android* reduced bandwidth usage Fixed (integration branch for now) Added bitcoin: URI support for QR codes (you can even enter raw bitcoin: URIs if you don't have a Android phone!)
You should use getaccountaddress, not getnewaddress. getaccountaddress only creates a new address once you received coins to the previous address. It's probably not only the CommandLineRPC method that causes problems. UTF-8 account names created from js-remote are wrong, too. Another idea: Force SSL by default and don't add CORS (doesn't work well over SSL anyway), then use a proxy like SSLserver.py from js-remote that serves the Javascript UI and proxies RPC calls through another SSL connection. It seems like the RPC interface can't handle account names with non-ASCII characters properly. Copy&paste form listaccount to getaccountaddress will create a new account with yet another name.Can we restrict accountnames to a limited charset (like [a-zA-Z0-9\-_]) or add UTF-8 support? edit: Post moved to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin-scheme Yep, having bitcoin: infront of the adress seems more accessible. Maybe we can work on a "new" URI scheme using ideas from both? Let's move this discussion over to http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2705.0 as it fits better there. Can we first please stick to one URI scheme? I don't want to parse QR codes for three different possible schemes.I prefer x-btc. I'd like to add that feature to js-remote (address + amount). Do we have a simple URI scheme that supports that, yet? Added SSL support to js-remote using a little server script. Added SSL support (using a small SSL webserver). You can run bitcoind on the phone. This even makes your wallet compatible with the desktop version. SSL works in theory. In practice, there's either a bug in browsers or bitcoind that prevents a reliable connection. I hope to resolve that within the next days. My js-remote is fully working on Android and supports local transactions by displaying QR codes on the phone and scanning them with the camera. It's also possible to display QR codes on a computer and send Bitcoins to it from a phone.Does this qualify for the bounty? New feature: Display address as QR code and scan QR codes on Android phones. This makes phone2phone transfer of bitcoins possible without having to enter addresses. Yep. It just adds two headers so browsers don't complain when using JSON-RPC across domains. I've created a JavaScript user interface for bitcoin. It's project page is located at:http://tcatm.github.com/bitcoin-js-remote/bitcoin-js-remote is a user interface for Bitcoin written in JavaScript. It works in most modern browsers as well as on Android and iPhones. If run on an Android phone it can scan QR codes containing addreses to send Bitcoins to! If you don't own an Android device, you can still enter raw bitcoin: URIs in a textbox.For SSL support a small server side script written in Python is required.SSL for secure communicationDisplay QR code with addressScan QR codes (Android only)Supports multiple accountsAndroid and iPhone supportSend and receive BitcoinsList transactions Thanks for the donation(s)!@bitcoinex: I'll add your orderbooks soon.Network graphs are on my todo. Currently busy with another interesting bitcoin project that's close to release. Added trading history and orderbook for https://bitcoin-central.net/ I'm working on it. I'm currently trying to make a copper core + gold surface coin.
There's no limit (except disk space required). I'd prefer separated tables for each currency pair. Sorting different currencies in the same table can be confusing (0.30 LREUR/BTC != 0.30 LRUSD/BTC) and you should expect a few hundred (or thousands) entries once your exchange gets popular. Tabs or two tables side by side should be more readable. Your site https://bitcoin-central.net/ responds with 403 except in browsers (even with other user agents). That's a bit annoying because bitcoincharts' admin backend won't let me add the URL to the database.edit: http://bitcoincharts.com now shows trade data for bitcoin central If it's not extremely expensive (i.e. more than half of the bid), yes. Hey,I'm looking for a new hoster for bitcoincharts.com (It's currently down and I don't know why). Debian VPS would be best. Please contact me via PM. Good idea but I'd need to make the coin bigger for that and build a custom CNC Btw: The coin is up for auction until block 101000 (current bid 40 BTC). Please join #bitcoin-auction to place bids. High resolution picture:http://y72.img-up.net/bitcoin3d6phb.jpgNext I'll try to make one from brass. I like the idea of engraving an bitcoin address. I just made a "real" bitcoin. They'll eventually be made of real metal instead of glass epoxy + copper once I have better tools.http://a59.img-up.net/bitcoin2d08rj.jpg Can we include a small HTTP server (for .html + .js) into bitcoin? JSON-RPC will only work on same domain + port. You received your coins in Block 84586. Sent you a PM. Added two new references (bitcoincharts and smsz) to initial post. Yep, mtgox volume does not appear in bitcoin volume. Though, I  made some trades during the last days and I'm pretty sure there are some dark pools close to the bid/ask prices. I traded and orderbook volume didn't change, I could even trade a lot more than orderbook volume would have allowed. 50 BTC Transactions should always be spread through the bitcoin network. Anything else would make double spending really easy. Remember, the transaction has to be included in the next block so it's vital that all miners know of it as soons as possible. API docs at http://bitcoincharts.com/about/markets-api/ Data from markets overview json formatted. If someone uses on a website or an applet, please add a link to http://bitcoincharts.com !http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/markets.json I'm also a bit confused but that's what the trading history says. Bitcoincharts now shows complete orderbook for mtgox. Do you have a good source of (daily) historic USD/$currency data?
 More datapoints (intervals are 86400 seconds) I don't know either. Someone on IRC asked for such graphs   New version, this time NSFW.http://ubitio.us/file/download/43Feature request: Allow the uploader to download their own files. Nyu got a bitcoin.http://ubitio.us/file/download/40 I added the feature to bitcoincharts.com:http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/lasttrades.json Will return the 15 most recent trades by default. You can also supply a timestamp and a custom limit:http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/lasttrades.json?since=UNIXTIME&limit=LIMITExample: http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/lasttrades.json?since=1290600000&limit=2This is evaluated as WHERE timestamp >= 1290600000 LIMIT 2Hope this makes programming a bit easier. For a quick fix I added quantization to 3 decimal places (4 for PecunixGAU). I'll add such a feature within the next days.I have enough bitcoins, they're better spend elsewhere  New feature: Order book display for bcm and mtgox.@bitcoinex: Where can I found your order book?  Good idea! I'll fix that today. btw: you can click on the small charts on the markets page to get directly to the chart. Can you provide a screenshot (tcatm@gawab.com)? It should be black on white background. I can just do the weighted averaging within the SQL query. This might be okay for charts, but I'm not sure if a "calculated" closing price is a good idea for the overview page. For now I'll make the order fixed to whatever mtgox provided. another update: there are now individual sub-pages for every market that will be filled with further information soon I'm not averaging trades, but I'm aware (and annoyed) of the problem. It's especially annoying for the last traded price when it jumps between 0.25 and 0.28 on every refresh. Not sure what I'll do to fix it, but it's on my todo. Click on "Account History". you could limit all prices to 4..6 decimal places. I made one a while ago, you can find it in this post: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.msg7415#msg7415 nope, it doesn't. only form fields are shown. in firefox it is a bit unstable, too. sometimes no data is displayed.
I could help with the design/layout. added a market overview page That's not possible, as new keys are added to the wallet with each generated block. Use the the RPC interface to send coins to a single wallet. Direct links to charts:http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/All%20USDhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bcm%20LibertyReserveUSDhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bcm%20PayPalUSDhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bcm%20PecunixGAUhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/btcex%20RUBhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgox%20USDGeneral update peformance should be much improved now. Select a "Price Band"  I'll try to find a good way to add such a feature to the new backend. Probably as an addon to the "All USD" chart. Theoretically that could be done. Do you mean dividing all historic BTC/USD trades by the current spot price? What's the use for such a chart? Maybe I can add an input field for a custom scaling factor. Would that work? I'll consider it for the rewrite I'm currently working on. Works fine here. Does it work if you click "Update" and does it say "Nov 08, 2010 - Daily - Volume in Currency" in the chart? How would you draw such a chart? I don't know of any other BTC market that trades BTC for gold other than bcm PecunixGAU. No, the offer won't be repeated. 30 days, i.e. the earliest will end on wednesday. Average Time = difficulty * 2^32 * hour / (3600 * hashrate) Oh I thought it was saying that somewhere in the chart.It's ChartDirector from http://advsofteng.com/ It's based around a charting library with a lot of PERL and python code to glue it to the markets. new features: * show volume in currency rather than BTC* compare two different markets in one chart (not to scale yet...) mtgox and btcex chartdata is updated every minute now btcex RUB added  What timezone is the timestamp?
I've already though about making a special chart with all currencies.Where can I get trade history for rubles? (timestamp, price, volume) I've created a simple charting tool for the markets:http://bitcoincharts.com (Javascript required) More graphs at http://91.194.85.252/cgi-bin/form.pl (data might be incorrect sometimes, still under development) I made a small webpage with interactive graphs for all markets provided by bitcoinwatch:http://91.194.85.252/bitcoincharts/ Thanks!Here's a small python script to split the data into seperate files for each market:Code:import csv trades = csv.reader(open('trades.csv'), delimiter=',', quotechar='"')data = {}for r in trades:  if r[0] == "currency":    continue  if not r[0] in data:    data[r[0]] = []  data[r[0]].append([r[1], r[2], r[3]])for m, d in data.iteritems():  f = open(m + '.dat', 'w')  for e in d:    f.write(" ".join(e) + '\n')  f.close()Edit:trades.csv plotted: I have some old SGI parts, mostly from Octanes and Origins. 2x drive sled and 2x drive covers for 150 BTC incl. shipping within Germany.http://img828.imageshack.us/f/img3133.jpg/I have another 5 drive sleds with harddisk I need to wipe first, some RAM for both Octane and Origin 200, CPUs, Mainboards and PCI NICs (for Origins). ~400 Even if difficulty rises even more I'll at least make sure everyone who invested makes a small profit form it. approx. 9.92 BTC/(Mhash/s) after two weeks. It won't repeat work. It'll create a new block to work on and this block will be different from the last one. It doesn't matter where your client resumes hashing. Chances for finding a block are the same. I was curious and read the source. Your metahash approach isn't using separate block as I first thought and it's actually pretty similar to my idea. Maybe you can get rid of the array and just sum all previous hashes to save memory. That might work better with GPUs with low memory (2^32 tried metahashes are ~17 Gbytes). By calculating low-difficulty hashes for a block it will eventually calculate a target difficulty hash. Why shouldn't it submit it? It'll make it win coins. You could even calculate the clients true hashrate from low-difficulty results. One Mhash/s should generate about 19 to 24 BTC. Everyone who bought two days ago has generated 1.72 BTC / (Mhash/s). Payment via Paypal is now possible.1 Mhash/s for 30 days == $1.30 I can add hardware when needed so there's no hard limit. For orders > 100 Mhash/s it might take a few days to set up the hardware so you'll have to wait more than 30 days for your coins. For paying in USD: I'm in Europe so I'd prefer EUR as Paypal charges conversion fees. Any idea how to set this up? Just a small fragment, might be used on the wiki or website, too.Bitcoin < http://bitcoin.org > ist ein junges, quelloffenes Peer-to-Peer Krypto-Währungssystem. Es ist unter der MIT Lizenz verfügbar. Das Netz ist ohne zentrale Institution in der Lage, sicher zu stellen, dass ein Benutzer nur die Bitcoins versenden kann die er auch tatsächlich besitzt. Transaktionen können Weltweit ohne Verzögerung stattfinden. Nach ungefähr einer Stunde sind Transaktionen bestätigt.Erfunden wurde das System von Satoshi Nakamoto FIXME:fill_in_date und mitlerweile wird es von zahlreichen Unternehmen und Einzelpersonen aktiv verwendet. Man kann Bitcoins sogar gegen den US-Dollar, Euro oder den Rubel eintauschen -- oder sie erwerben. I'd vote for writing the letter in English or at least not a simple translation.
It should still be a win. Either the bitcoin community increases and (hopefully) the value of bitcoins or you get a few free bitcoins. Next round: 1 Mhash/s for 30 days for 15 BTC in any fractional amount (e.g. you can rent 2 khash/s for 0.03 BTC).Email me at tcatm@gawab.com to order. I sent the generated bitcoins. For easier calculation I also sent coins to people who joined a day later. The 30 Mhash/s generated 3.69 blocks during the last seven days. I try to keep it running 24/7 but I can't guarantee that uptime. So far 1 Mhash/s has generated about 4.27 BTC since monday. Performance shouldn't be measured in multiplies of the CryptoPP miner. Maybe you could give hashrate examples for typical CPUs. I've sold some bitcoins to them. Wire transfer arrived just a few days later. This is just an attempt to help people with less hashing power get some bitcoins. If difficulty stays low, I'll actually give bitcoins away for free. I think there are many users with less then 1 BTC and some that have > 1000 BTC. those with only 1 BTC can't afford to pay services with bitcoins and mtgox keeps the bitcoins for 30 days because of paypal. You can buy bitcoins at mtgox.com or get 0.50 free bitcoins at the faucet: freebitcoins.appspot.com Got the mail  You get what your rented Mhash/s would have generated on their own. The interesting part is, that this can be far less than 50 BTC. You could invest 0.50 BTC and get 1.2 BTC after a week, even if one Mhash/s would generate only one block every two months. I'll plan offering service that'll allowing you to buy Mhash/s of my GPU cluster for a limited period. You'll get a part of the generated coins after a week according to the number of Mhash/s you bought. So, if you buy 1 Mhash/s for one week for 3 BTC the cluster will generate about 5,5 BTC for you which you will get after the week. You'd win about 2,5 BTC in this case. If difficulty goes crazy or the cluster doesn't generated a single block (unlikely) in that week, you'll get less or even nothing.You can buy more or even less than 1 Mhash/s. For easier calculation the amount you buy must be in multiplies of 1/6 Mhash/s.1/6 Mhash/s for one week = 0.50 BTCI'll offer a total of 30 Mhash/s. If you're interested please email me at tcatm@gawab.com with the amount of 1/6 Mhash/s-chunks you want and your bitcoin adress for payment. I'll then give you an address to send the bitcoins to. For 2 Mhash/s buy 12 chunks.If this works well, I'll start a service selling up to a few Ghash/s.Update: 0 Mhash/s left $400 will get you 2x M2050 for two days. The free trials are hard to get as they're very popular. I generated 8 blocks with the patch. I just had a chat with them. Basically you can rent them at $1.18/BTC assuming the same performance per Teraflop as ATI cards. That is, if difficulty doesn't increase... It's running. Should find a block within 3 hours. Three GPUs (ATI HD 5870). Can you include the source? Or better the diff for those transactions? I could run it on my 983 Mhash/s box. I'm looking for a web developer to help me write a bitcoin-based service. I'd prefer a clean ruby or python solution, but PHP would be okay if the code is clean and not buggy.I'll do the webdesign myself so a nice template system is needed.Features needed:* interaction with bitcoind over a proxy** sending/receiving payments** maintain list of user accounts* some kind of list of goods* some static pagesI'll be paying 1000 BTC. Contact me for more details. Please remove me from the list. I'll continue forwarding but it's too much hassle for too little gain (i.e. sending someone 0.01 BTC isn't going to make bitcoin grow much). You should benchmark all implementations (using cpu time, not realtime) and choose the fastest and while benchmarking check whether the algorithm actually works.

If someone wants to start one I'd even offer to help writing it. Phenoms, i5 and i7 from what I know. Those are the only CPUs that have a 128 bit SSE2 instruction decoder and benefit at all, every older CPU will be slower. Don't think about it as "only works on AMDs K10" but rather as "tweak the compiler to produce the exact assembly code we want and still be flexible to support other vector engines in the future". We only compile one source file with the 4way code (sha256.cpp) using -march=amdfamk10, not the whole client. That's exactly what we want. But I agree, it's a dirty hack to use -march=amdfam10. In this case it'll produce the most compact and efficient SSE2 code from the source. A cleaner alternative would be inline assembler. I just reviewed the sourcecode as I had a few ideas to optimize it further and I noticed that 4way is partly broken:from main.cpp:Code:                for (int j = 0; j < NPAR; j++)                 {                        if (thash[7][j] == 0)                    {                                                for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(hash)/4; i++)                           ((unsigned int*)&hash)[i] = thash[i][j];                        pblock->nNonce = ByteReverse(tmp.block.nNonce + j);                    }                    }    The code will only process one hash (the last with thash[7] == 0) out of 32 hashes even when there is more than one hash that might be a correct one.Somethine like this should fix it but it won't be safe at higher difficulties. Also, I'm not sure whether the byte order should be reversed or not. Could someone review this?Code:                unsigned int min_hash = ~1;       for (int j = 0; j < NPAR; j++)                 {                        if (thash[7][j] == 0)                    {                            if(thash[6][j] < min_hash) {                          min_hash = thash[6][j];                          for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(hash)/4; i++)                             ((unsigned int*)&hash)[i] = thash[i][j];                          pblock->nNonce = ByteReverse(tmp.block.nNonce + j);                        }                        }                    }   It's jgarzik's, not mine. I only did the design  I've decided to offer a webdesign service in exchange for bitcoins. I'll design or redesign a website with HTML, CSS, Images and Javascript.I'll produce clean and tidy HTML and CSS working in most modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, ...) for almost any template engine. I can also do a little web programming to fit a design to existing backends.If you're interested you can email me at tcatm@gawab.com.References:http://bitcoinwatch.com/http://bitcoincharts.com/http://smsz.net/(edit: added more references) Sounds interesting  1Edvb7z8RARx7F3Y5oi9ZX8tQadq5RfjSD So there are about 2000 people generating coins. (1,5Mhash/s average and a 1Ghash/s cluster)  Difficulty = 0xFFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 / HashTargetFor easier calculation you can divide numerator and denominator by 2^193 (i.e. shift right 193 bits). @satoshi: Oops, I meant -march=amdfam10. Sorry.@everyone confused about improvement on Phenoms: I developed the code on a Phenom (940) and verified it (at least in 64bit mode) and the improvement you see is real. Concerning Hyperthreading: It seems to give a little performance gain, maybe from running load/store instructions in parallel with aritmethic instructions. There's only a tiny bit of plain x86 instructions for glueing the function into the ABI. They take less than ~2% of the total CPU time (measured with gprof). Didn't try it, but CFLAGS are not OS dependent at all so I guess it'll work. I propose to compile sha256.cpp with -O3 -march=amdfamk10 (will work on 32bit and 64bit) as only CPUs supporting this instruction set (AMD Phenom, Intel i5 and newer) benefit from -4way and it'll improve performance by ~9%. Did anyone verify it to produce correct results on 32 bit hosts? -4way: 12518 khash/swithout: 6550 khash/sIt's a little bit slower than my patch (~14000kash/s).edit: I ran the binary on an older AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4200+ with the same effect we see on older intel cpus:-4way: 1120khash/swithout: 2012khash/s That's unlikely. The loop accesses 432 bytes of data. That should fit in most caches. Looks like we're triggering a compiler bug in the tree optimizer. Can you try to compile it -O0? No idea, maybe some alignment problem. Someone was trying to figure it out on IRC. I don't have a SSE2 capable 32bit system. The additional registers in 64bit mode are also useful. I don't know if your PE2650 has a recent enough CPU. You might experience a performance drop of 50% if the CPU is too old.Btw, did anyone with Intel CPU compare performance with Hyperthreading enabled/disabled? The SSE2 loop keeps the arithmetic units and pipelines pretty busy and I can imagine Hyperthreading might decrease performance. 1. Does not work on 32-bit (though that's not a problem with the algorithm).2. Patch is against older SVN. There's a git repo at http://github.com/tcatm/bitcoin-cruncher3. Compiles on every 64bit Linux.It's not intended as a replacement for a standard client but for a dedicated bitcoinminer box. I'm planning a pluggable bitcoinminer someday. But at current difficulty it's easier to work for bitcoins than finding faster ways for mining.
Would be interesting to try it out on older AMD64. There's been a change that would explain it there:http://developer.amd.com/documentation/articles/pages/682007171.aspxMaybe Intel did something similiar without announcing it? You could parse https://mtgox.com/code/getDepth.php Do you still have the wallet.dat that once "contained" the 9000 BTC? I might be able to help you. The hashtarget is wrong. Also, the font is quite hard to read. letter-spacing: 2px might make it more readable. I'm still running an old node without SSE2 @600khash/s. The algorithm works so I don't see why we should make SSE2 a requirement. I don't really know what it changes. I wonder why the define was made in the first place. The code should be able to determine whether it's running on a SSE2 CPU or not. I discovered it while comparing my 4xSSE2 hash function to the original one in 0.3.6 so it really means, that no 64bit build since 0.3.6 was able to generate any coins. Maybe satoshi can tell us why he put the define in the makefile.  Did you compile it yourself? There's a define in makefile.unix. Something like -DCRYPTOPP_DISABLE_SSE2. Remove that. Else the SHA256_Transform will return the initstate. I had the same problem when switchting to 0.3.6. It seems to be like this: everything before Core2 will be slower, everything starting with Core2 is faster. Can anyone test the code on an older AMD64? I know there was a change in the way SSE2 instructions are executed in recent architectures. The merkle tree (containing the transactions, including the 50BTC) is hashed and included in the block. The hash will change (newer timestamps, and other stuff) so even two threads on the same host starting the the same time will work on a completely different block. There a blocks without a solution so sometimes a new block with a different merkle tree hash is tried. The latter is more common now at current difficulty. That's nice to hear. Thanks for the donation and thanks to everyone else who donated! Tilka: That's already the case with the mesh concept. Instead of one "supernode" sending the transaction to every other node you have many nodes sending the transaction to many other nodes which is much faster. The client only connects to some of the other nodes. There's no need for more, because it's a mesh network. More connections would be a waste of ressources as your gateway has to track all of them. Bandwidth would also increase as supernodes would send a lot of unicasts. In a mesh it's more like a broadcast as information is relayed and distributed from node to node.It doesn't affect your hashrate at all. Thanks! That got probably mixed up when I patched the file with an older diff. I fixed the git: http://github.com/tcatm/bitcoin-cruncher Oh, that's a part in the code my patch doesn't touch. You could try to remove line 2741 (CRITICAL_BLOCK(cs_main)). Yes, test is single threaded. Is there any output on stderr? From the coredumps I can tell that there must be some output.The problem seems to be hard to debug, though. Is the khash/s you get worth it anymore at 352 difficulty? I'm only getting a block once a week now. If you want to keep the block chain working, you should use the original client. If you want to gain lots of bitcoins you should use a GPU. Just an idea... you could remove the message that tells the user he already got coins and always pretend to have sent coins when in reality you didn't. Maybe with a nice "If it doesn't work contact me at ..." message. Hopefully they'll just assume it's broken and don't bother trying to get coins from it anymore. That's not a real crash this time. It's an assert that fails in the miner. Most likely assert(hash == pblock->GetHash());. Can you run the test programm (explained in http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=648.msg7096#msg7096)? If it fails, can you change -march=amdfam10 back to -march=native in makefile.unix, rm cryptopp/obj/*.o and recompile everything? What cpu are you running it on? Oh thats easy: Get two nodes on a seperate network and connect them using -connect=other_nodes_ip and a seperate/empty datadir. GDB can also generate coredumps with the command generate-core-file. It might be useful to reconstruct the cause for the segfault. Please note, that the coredump might include your wallet so it's probably a good idea to run bitcoind on a seperate datadir. I also made an SVG version. It's not as shiny as the original logo, though.
