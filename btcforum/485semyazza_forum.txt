signed contract to get your piece of the sale.  Redemption's will be accepted until 09/30/2012.I unfortunately did not have time to maintain the site.  All code that has been worked on up to this point has been transferred to the new owners.  I will let them announce the biddingpond.com future and timeline. 8.75 This is the way we view it as well.  It will be interesting to see how courts rule on the matter. 11:30PM EST time will be the last chance to buy one of the 20,000 biddingpond.com shares on GLBSE as voted by the current shareholders.  At that time shares will not be sold to the public until it is determined that bitcoin prices have relatively stabilized and increased in value.  This is a great time to pick some up cheap with Bitcoin value depreciated! This announcement is for current shareholders.  There is a GLBSE motion that needs to be voted on.This motion is to close further purchases of shares until Bitcoin prices become stable again. At that time shares will be repriced and issued. This does not affect current share holders.Closes   October 25,2011 Yes, they are.  You should take good care of it.  The brand new ones go for over $150 and the used ones for around $60-$80 (USD).Yes, the story behind it is quite amazing.  Especially the lengths that Hasbro went through to suppress it.  It is also a little absurd that they claim they own the suffix -opoly. I did not know that was the case in the EU.  For EU customers that would not be an option.Here in the United States the notary validates your signature and that you were the individual present attesting to the contract that you sign in front of them.  If more than one signature is needed and the buyer and seller are remote, each can sign the contract separately as long as both get their individual signatures notarized.  I have done this for many real-estate and other transactions requiring contracts. TOR is very slow and I can't see it supporting voip at a decent speed.  I am watching this project though and can't wait to see it done! BitcoinCashout.com does this as well for pricing of their prepaid cards. Have you solved the TOR latency problem? To throw .02BTC in this sounds dangerously familiar to Hawala networks which are becoming illegal in many countries after 9/11.  The only difference is you are pre-negotiating the settlement of debt with Bitcoins. Willing to escrow transactions (4% fee) require PGP signed contract (supplied) by buyer and seller and/or physically signed contract.  Will also accept notarized contracts scanned and sent via e-mail.
6BTC BiddingPond.com is proud to announce its advertising program.  We offer the following targeting ability:All Pages - The banner will appear on all pages.Categories - The banner will appear only when the selected categories are visible.Keywords - The banner will only appear in those auctions page where at least one keyword is contained in the item's title or descriptionThe Categories filter will be applied in the browse categories pages and in the items' pages.The Keywords filter will be only applied in the auctions page.Current Prices:All pages: .25BTC/1000 Views or .1BTC/click.Individual Section: .5BTC/1000 Views or .2BTC/click.Keywords: .5BTC/500 Views or .4BTC/ClickWe also offer combination and discount pricing on large orders. https://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=1026 Shares are still available.  Get them while you can! https://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=1025 Update: Over 22% of the level 1 shares have sold. The site was very active until we stopped making feature updates.  This was due to our making sure bitcoincashout.com and other assets were properly transitioned to Bitcoin Solutions LLC.  We believe that customers will come to the site as they see improvements and as the Bitcoin economy grows.  We also plan to advertise and offer seller incentives to get items listed.If full funding is reached 40+ hours a week will be set aside for maintaining the site.  This includes development, customer service and logistical planning for future growth.  If full funding is not reached you can expect approximately 20 hours a week to maintain the site which will increase as the site grows.Currently all fees are suspended until October 31,2011.  After that date BiddingPond.com offers "free listings" followed by  À la carte premium listing options.  These options currently include:Bold ListingsHighlighted ListingsFeatured Auctions (rotated front page advertisement)Picture Upload(Other premium ideas to come)We plan to offer free listings indefinitely if we determine it is sustainable in the long run.  If it is determined it can not be supported we will move to a pay per listing model (negligible $.10/listing) and still retain premium features.  We do not believe in other auction site payment models and our aim is to provide a successful auction site that does not abuse its sellers and buyers.We have an escrow system that will be released this month.  The escrow system will include a 4% fee for transactions.  This escrow system is completely optional following our philosophy of an À la carte model and feeling that buyers and sellers should pick their own risk tolerance.  We would like to also state that the escrow system is not only for our auction product but is general enough to be used for any Bitcoin transaction.Further business income will come from sponsored advertising with ability to sponsor categories, sub categories, and the main page.Future plans after we build a large set of Bitcoin features is to expand into other Digital and real currency options (HD Money, Liberty Reserve, Paypal, etc.).We hope this answers some of your questions.  We would like to go into more detail but revealing everything we are working on would give some competitors ideas we have not yet implemented and cause us to lose the "first to market" advantage. We can agree with everything besides you considering it a steep price.  We are looking for funding to expand the business. Angel investors usually require 25-33% of equity investment in the company with an average investment size of $500,000.  We are offering 20% of the business with an investment size of approximately $69,000(assuming an individual purchases ALL of the shares).  With this low barrier and low financial risk to entry you do not receive a 3-5 year exit plan as with other angel investment opportunities. We offer instead, and what we consider a better solution, twice yearly profit payments.  We would also like to add that in the event of company bankruptcy with a traditional Angel investment you receive nothing in the 3-5 year plan no matter how excellent or poor the company is performing.  Our setup with payments being made after operating expenses actually reduces an individuals risk by offering twice yearly payments during the normal 3-5 year "sit and wait period" and is significantly lower risk than a traditional funding round.We hope you reconsider investing in this great opportunity. The purchase value of shares will go to incorporation of BiddingPond.com in Delaware(shares will be converted to stock ownership if shareholders agree), hosting, new design for the website from 99designs.com, and a year developer salary for full-time development work. It seems like I may have updated it right before you posted.  A matter of seconds. That was embarassing.  The link has been updated.  Thank You.  The new link is:https://glbse.com/asset/fc3de0c1848b26037e8c3252e0f66ca723bcc7f4e2343acbf0fabc2770067b19 Selling GLBSE ticker BID shares.1) 1,000 shares at .25BTC 2) 2,000 shares at .5BTC3) 4,000 shares at .75BTC4) 13,000 shares at 1BTChttps://glbse.com/asset/fc3de0c1848b26037e8c3252e0f66ca723bcc7f4e2343acbf0fabc2770067b19ANSWERED QUESTIONS:The purchase value of shares will go to incorporation of BiddingPond.com in Delaware(shares will be converted to stock ownership if shareholders agree), hosting, new design for the website from 99designs.com, and a year developer salary for full-time development work. As you may know BiddingPond.com is going to be releasing some changes in the coming months.  This month will be the release of the BiddingPond.com Escrow services at escrow.biddingpond.com,which is not just for auctions.  Additionally, to engage the Bitcoin community, to raise funding for full time development, raise capital for incorporation of BiddingPond.com, and to give investors a great opportunity we will be issuing BiddingPond.com Profit Distribution Pool shares.  You may find this asset on GLBSE listed under BID.  There will be 20,000 shares issued total.  The shares will be sold in the following manner:1) 1,000 shares at .25BTC 2) 2,000 shares at .5BTC3) 4,000 shares at .75BTC4) 13,000 shares at 1BTCThe purchase value of shares will go to incorporation of BiddingPond.com in Delaware(shares will be converted to stock ownership if shareholders agree), hosting, new design for the website from 99designs.com, and a year developer salary for full-time development work.Best Regards,BiddingPond.com Teamhttps://glbse.com/asset/fc3de0c1848b26037e8c3252e0f66ca723bcc7f4e2343acbf0fabc2770067b19 Sounds great.  We are usually very happy with MtGox withdrawal times which is why we are concerned. Does anyone know if MtGox is currently having problems with Dwolla transfers?  Still haven't received my transfer from yesterday and they usually have it to us in a couple of hours. What is your PPC pricing? Pictures are available as well as introduction.  A simple escrow system is slated to be completed by the end of the month.  Payment of bitcoins is achieved by placing a payment address in the listing.  We originally had auto notifications of payment as well as collect and foward funds on your behalf but, have removed that until we can write better documentation as it was causing confusion among new users.  Additionally, we have free premium listings available until the end of the month. BiddingPond is down to a team of 2.  One answers most of the support questions and resolves issues(if any) and the other does the programming. The programmer until recently was working on other projects and has continued part time development on  BiddingPond (20 hours/week). We have taken a large usage hit but have seen numbers increase dramatically again(unique views) in the recent weeks.  The mythical escrow service is on its way.  International support is available if someone would like to volunteer to do the translations.  We plan on offering spanish and german in the near future.  We would like you to support your statements.  Documentation not being there, yes you are correct.  Not receiving an answer?  That doesn't happen.  We answer all questions no matter what it may be including non biddingpond Bitcoin related questions.  The only exception to the previous sentence, in which we would not reply, is if you are cursing, being rude, harassing, or any other inappropriate behavior that a reasonable person would find offending. I would be interested as well.  Is this unique impressions?

Understanding that this issue is closed as we are working with the buyer to see what happened.  I would like to clarify your misinformation.  We apologize to others for this long post but, it is necessary to correct the lies.1)"and after I send you three emails, open up a support ticket and send you a PM on the forums almost 3 days go buy..."-- The short answer:All of your contacts were within 48 hours of each other. Additionally you were notified within 10 minutes of opening a ticket that we received your support request.  We additionally answered with a non-automated message within 24 hours of the support request being opened.The long answer:Support ticket was opened on Wed, Sep 7 2011 12:40pm.  Response to support ticket sent on Thu, Sep 8 2011 5:03pm.  E-mail was sent on Tue, Sep 6, 2011 at 2:13 PM.  E-mail was read sometime on Sep 7.  During the day it was realized you had opened a support ticket and information was merged.  You were notified on Wed, Sep 7 2011 12:45pm via e-mail that a ticket was opened.  On Thu, Sep 8, 2011 at 1:10 PM you were notified once again, in case you did not receive the other e-mails, of the support information and how to access the ticketing system.  Forum message was sent on September 07, 2011, 05:10:27 PM.  No record of replying to that as we probably did not due to our previous communication.2) "there was only one auction that sold that day"-- Please do not make up things we did not say:"...the only $100 money pack auction we have closed in the last 72 hours is auction ID#979." is the correct quote.3) When you send the following message is it not appropriate to ask for more information?:-- "Hello I sold an item yesterday, someone bought $100 moneypak for 15.73 bitcoin, the buyer says he paid the auction, which I assume went to biddingpond, how do I go about getting these coins so I can complete the transaction?thank you. "4)  Who is delaying things when we ask for information and you send the following reply?-- "Are you serious right now? You have so many auctions that you can't possibly find it based on the information you already have right?Please don't patronize me , my Userid on your site is coinsforcash I sold a $100 moneypak and the user paid the 15.73 btc to the address you provided him on 09/06 I already sent you the block explorer proof that this was paid . Please forward the coins to my address I listed on my account immediately .Thank you. "5) "The buyer sent his coins to an address that you provided him, with no instructions on what to do next!?"-- This has yet to be determined.  Additionally, if the payment was sent to the auction address you would have received it automatically at your given payment address.  There is no need to inform the buyer of that as it is seamless when they send it to the address in the auction.  This is further explained to the seller multiple times in multiple areas on the site.6)"Now check this out. you say that it is our option to have you forward the coins to us. now why does it not give us any other option on your website?"-- Just tell buyers in the auction description the appropriate address to send to.7)"In fact your site recommends people use Clear Coin for transactions and Clear Coin does not even exist?"-- Thank you for that information we will be correcting the message that we missed."If you dont want customers like me to get pissed off..."-- We do not want customers like you.  We are also positive with an attitude like this selling online that your feedback profile would eventually reflect this.9) "you really need to re-evaluate the way you do things if you want this site to succeed" and "You can bet I wont be using this site anymore"-- Thank you for your input.  Please don't, your account has already been disabled.10) "..dude your attitude is totally screwed up you act like we should be grateful to be customers of your site.."-- We are grateful for every good mannered, honest, fair and patient member of our site.  We do not have customers, we have members of a selling and buying community that we are very grateful to have. We experience DDOS's at least twice a week.  We also noticed most Tor traffic is malicious.  If you would like to know how we handle the Tor blocking we are willing to share that just send us a message. Did you contact us to open a support ticket? We are still here.  We also answered your support questions.  We answered your question in under 48 hours.  We suggest being patient.  When we asked for more information you refused to provide it and stated: "Are you serious right now? You have so many auctions that you can't possibly find it based on the information you already have right?"Along with other uncalled for rudeness.  We responded telling you that we will not stand for uncalled rudeness and that communication would cease if that was the case.  We then still offered to remedy the situation (if there even is one).Additionally, you never sent proof of payment to us.  You sent us proof that payment was sent to an address that wasn't even listed on the auction page!  We have an excellent record.  Additionally, you threatened us via email stating you would take this to the forums AFTER you have already posted in the forums.  We are glad you did.  Please prove that we are dishonest.  We would also like to add there is nothing forcing you to use our auto forwarding service.  Go ahead place an address in your listing and say not to use the one we provide.  We don't mind.We try to answer all support requests within 48 hours.  Sometimes it may take longer than that.  If it does we answer your ticket letting you know it will take longer.  We do this so you don't tarnish our reputation when we provide very good support times.If you have a problem with the way our support is handled talk to us.  If something is wrong, talk to us.  If you think something is wrong WE DO INVESTIGATE.Instead of working with us to solve a supposed problem and waiting for assistance you make a forum post in an area that we hardly check(we thankfully did today).  We have a BiddingPond thread in the marketplace you could have posted (notice we didn't say should).  Instead you contacted us via our ticketing system(that was a good start) but then began to verbally abuse us and not wait a reasonable time for assistance.We have nothing more to say on this issue besides your ticket is still open and you know how to use the system as is evident by your rude responses. Rackspace Cloud.  They don't accept Bitcoin for payment though. JFK.  It also allows you access to Airtrain to connect to the subway system/Jamaica station if you want to do other things in NY besides the conference.But, either are good. Great idea!  We are actually working on a similar feature.  I know a lot of you are tired of hearing the "It's coming soon" but, we are working as hard as possible to make sure the next version is rock solid, concrete, and bug free.  The new version will also be a complete rewrite as we have hit a wall with PHP as far as productivity is concerned and have settled on Python.  The site is usable as/is but, there are usability issues which we need to address.  Most of our current time has been spent making sure the transition of BitcoinCashout.com went smoothly to Bitcoin Solutions LLC.  We have picked up development again.What we are working on right now is:Sellers will decide if they require a deposit before bidding (adjustable between 10-50%).  If the user backs out of the auction the deposit is split 50/50 between the seller and BiddingPond.  BiddingPond's 50% will be further split between site operations and a buyer protection fund.An additional option will be a "secured bid" where the full bid amount is required before it is placed.These options will be seller select-able.As always we thank our faithful users who have stayed loyal to us and continue to use us.  We promise there is a better BiddingPond on the horizon.  Additionally, the lead developer will be at the Bitcoin Conference in NYC and looks forward to meeting everyone . He is one of the shared management at Bitcoin Solutions LLC and will be at their booth. Check our post about this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34225.msg427889#msg427889He lied. I wouldn't pay attention to his security procedures much.  He outright lied about hashing passwords in the database.  Quote from that Thread:We had a password reset issue months ago in which we needed access to our account.  After about a month of lack of communication we finally received access to our account through the original password that was sent to us in plain text from mybitcoin.com .  We "remembered" the password after seeing it again and were shocked that mybitcoin stored passwords in plain text. Would be interested in helping.  Is a git repo setup?  Would you allow the whole project to be under a BSD license or the Unlicense(http://unlicense.org/)? We would be interested in setting this up.  The only problem we have is the ability to charge.  We could offer a basic e-wallet/merchant services for free and then additional charges.  If you would be interested or want to discuss more feel free to contact. BitcoinSolutionsLLC will have people there.  The main developer for biddingpond.com will be there as well. BitcoinSolutionsLLC will have people there.  The main developer for biddingpond.com will be there as well. We would like to announce the addition of $250 cards to our inventory.  You asked, we delivered.  Silver and other cashout methods are on their way!The completion of the move from BiddingPond.com systems has also been completed and BitcoinCashout.com is now running with it's own support team.We have also added a ticketing system to the website for those of you who need to contact support we may be reached at support@bitcoinsolutionsllc.com in regards to BitcoinCashout.comThanks everyone for your continued support and we can't wait to add even more options in the future. Run bitcoind on your server and use JSON-RPC calls from a program to generate a unique address for each transaction.  Store addresses in a database and check for payment using calls to bitcoind to see how many confirmations are on that address.  After the set amount of confirmations release the item you are selling. This would be great.  Could we also get hashes from multiple people to compare to the APK provided.
Our contact information has been updated and may be found at: https://www.bitcoincashout.com/contact.psp . Emphasis is ours. We have been suffering this problem since the 17th of June.  This was a motivating factor of moving away from MyBitcoin to a direct payment method for BitcoinCashout.com. Unfortunately not, as that would also require registration and remove its classification as a stored value card(this is what the industry has determined by their offerings).  What some of our user have had success in doing is adding the card to their Paypal account and withdrawing the funds to their account.  This method makes $1 unavailable on the card due to Paypal authorizing the card(Yes, our cards do pass all AVS checks).We are still investigating ATM capable cards but, they are very pricey and have other issues. We will be offering in the near future, silver coins,checks, and money orders.  Checks, and money orders will be mailed to any address/recipient you ask us and could be used to pay for items that accept snail mail methods of payment. Suggestions noted. We are actually working on a complete rewrite and redesign of the site with integrated escrow and other fun features.  This version will also have a better FAQ and tutorials. We are now back up and running accepting Bitcoin payments directly!  No more third party merchant hassles!  Silver sales have been pushed off until next week.  We will be offering 1oz silver coins as well! All re-loadable cards in the United States need to be registered due to the U.S. Patriot Act.  The Greendot MoneyPak is considered a stored value card and is not re-loadable.  It may be used to reload a prepaid card which is required to have the identifying information.  We sell non re-loadable cards at http://www.bitcoincashout.com and were going to offer re-loadable but, interest in giving personal information to be in compliance with U.S. law decreased demand significantly.  Also, the re-loadable cards you purchase at Walmart may be used unregistered but, as soon as you try to re-load them, you will be required to provide your information.  We are also unaware of any re-loadable card in the U.S. that does not require a SSN and that does not report to the U.S. government. We might have some code to contribute on the MtGox side. We haven't tested it since they upgraded their backend.  If it still works we will contribute it.  Will post the code later this evening(EST time).This is in python but it might help you see how we solved the parsing.  There may be a couple of bugs in this version.  We have a newer version laying around somewhere once we find it.Code:#!/usr/bin/env pythonimport simplejsonimport urllibimport

work on a federated auction API protocol extension to BCSpec. Emphasis is ours.  We felt the same way. The core Bitcoin community is very honest, others, not so honest. Do be careful of scammers.  They can very quickly ruin your Bitcoin experience. As some of you might have noticed due to no inventory being available.  We will be temporarily suspending service as we move to a custom payment system.  Unfortunately use of community available payment processors(Mybitcoin,MtGox) is causing service disruptions and have been deemed unreliable.  This transition should be completed by Monday, June 27,2011.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  With the relaunch in addition to credit cards we will be offering a new product!  Silver Coins!  If you need a card urgently we may be able to assist you by contacting our email at contact@bitcoincashout.com.  Please include the card denomination ($25,$50,$100) and we will respond with a quote. The belief of the community/collective aspect of credit unions was the reason we chose this type of institution to pursue instead of a bank.  The $70k mark is a recommendation of start up costs from NCUA (National Credit Union Administration).  We feel we can get that even lower if we stay with the community/collective approach with volunteers and the CEO being the only paid employee(at start) with everyone being volunteers (including the directors who vote in the management positions).  We are not out to make money on this venture and truly believe it is in the best interest of the Bitcoin community.  By strengthening the community we all benefit.  Bitcoin businesses gain a stable,trustworthy, economic partner, Bitcoin owners gain through increased Bitcoin value, and public adoption increases due to perceived legitimacy of business through government chartering.  There are also many other benefits and to enumerate them all would be very time extensive.  A wiki will be set up in the near future for collaboration.  We would be very interested in this.  Please contact us and we can set up a time. BiddingPond.com suffers multiple attacks daily and has seen at least a tenfold increase in attacks in the recent days.  What we do to make sure it isn't a complete catastrophe in case of a data breach(all data breaches are catastrophes) is the following:1)User passwords are hashed and have individual salts.2)Large quantities of Bitcoin funds are not held on the server.  Funds are kept in an outside wallet split between multiple systems until forwarded by support staff to the proper recipient.3)We are in the process of implementing a system where all e-mails from us will be PGP clear signed. At this time any amount would be considered as interest is being gauged.  We are currently seeing what type of funding options we have that is acceptable legally for operation costs.  We do know that loans and grants would be allowed on the credit unions end for funding but, we will entertain more options if NCUA will allow it.  Also, bitcoins would gladly be accepted.We would also like to add that we see this as a necessary step for the legitimacy of Bitcoins among the general non-tech savvy populace.  As stated earlier this would be a 501(c) company after IRS approval and would be a member run organization.  Being a federally charted financial institution would also allow for some amazing things that would not be possible for an ordinary company.Let us imagine:Credit cards that hold a BTC balance and can be used for multi-currency transactions at a POS.Ability to withdraw funds from an ATM from your savings/checking account in BTC/USD/EUR/etc.Federally insured Deposits.Merchant processing from a trusted audited sourceAbility to get a mortgage/car loan in Bitcoins/other currency.Account auditing from a trusted third party.Other Ideas that I'm sure this great community can think of!Now lets make that a reality! Yes, we will allow publicly accessible records and would also apply for 501(c) status from the IRS.  We are doing this to strengthen the Bitcoin economy and provide convenient digital options.  Our accounts will also be audited as is required by NCUA and other federal laws and have deposit insurance of $250,000. RESERVED FOR MORE INFORMATION Pre-Charter Costs:Post-Charter Costs: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1Hello,BiddingPond is looking for potential investors to open a Bitcoin credit union.  At the beginning stages we will be operating as a Basic Service credit union. A basic service credit union generally offers basic products, such as regular share accounts and small consumer loans.  Regular share accounts include savings, vacation clubs, holiday clubs, etc.  The small consumer loans include personal (signature), new and used automobile, home improvement, educational, and debt consolidation type loans.  We will also be offering other services as we mature to the Bitcoin community and eventually apply to become a full service credit union.Currently the estimated costs to start up according to NCUA (National Credit Union Administration) would be: $127,000 USD.  We would like 150% of that amount to allow for a larger operational buffer.  This credit union would be federally chartered in the United States and follow all applicable rules and regulations.If you are interested in more information as this progresses and would like to join the organization committee please send an e-mail to.bitcoincreditunion@semyazza.comMore information will be posted here as it becomes available.  Online meetings will also be held with potential investors in the near future,Regards,BiddingPond.com Team-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)iJwEAQECAAYFAk3/lmsACgkQlinDwEk8Xn7aQwP8D+siqnc4gZkrHTbqim9O5lun5teOLRu1P8x9NwWj9Fe6B0/wWoEiH+cSziDy7TNFPFW3gzSvR1PS0XJsKu5PEOVAFPshefWVqFzqmRfMjtCJktUqiUMlXXnNYj0u48EkxFWvY5hOvCMLxzkUlBF7YAaecuGwxE+EOMWSK0D7eOc==lC8r-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- Please try the reset feature again.  If it still does not work contact us at contact@biddingpond.com and will will investigate further. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1Due to the large volume of accounts that were compromised on MtGox(We are not affiliated) out of concern for our users all users must reset their passwords to login to their accounts.  Additionally, Bitcoin forwarding addresses for payment have been reset and must be updated.Passwords may be reset at:https://www.biddingpond.com/forgotpasswd.phpWe apologize for the inconvenience this security measure causes.If you have any trouble please feel free to contact us: contact@biddingpond.com.PLEASE NOTE: BiddingPond has a valid security certificate on our site and uses SSL.  If you are accessing our site from a public network please verify the site is issuing the proper certificate.  This is good practice when accessing any site on the internet from a public location.Serial Number: 38:32:25:35:26:F8:45:11:8D:6E:94:84:B2:4A:09:06SHA-256 Fingerprint:02 43 3E 0A 81 63 EC 8B 57 8A 8E EE D2 FC 30 755C 2C 8D CC E8 F2 FB 1B 66 3A 0A A8 0B BE 68 D2SHA-1 Fingerprint:95 27 DD 45 65 5C 21 54 41 F1 A1 EC E4 D2 E8 0972 44 09 65-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)iJwEAQECAAYFAk3/RpoACgkQlinDwEk8Xn7zTQP/URiBKAN+odtclgkyBR/yt0ZCXh6ueIn6+0jBVGbGKcho/MRG/rkDqhV5pwx6+Buz0gIDvrKffHH9hbf7TPosuNyw1yQUGGY6lE/W5jAlTrcWHpEOiOcOSk3Hf1FRzOGkZf2TbzxWCpiLidY9HEnPECzlTR/Y+qjEfNmAEKgQCQ0==5jhd-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

This is correct. We do not feel threatened as we believe in fast, efficient customer support and excellent customer service.  We know the site needs a redesign but, unfortunately, we do not have a dedicated graphic designer in our small team.  What we are concerned with, as is stated eloquently by InternetPseudonym is potential problems and their solutions and to point out unfounded, damaging rumors.This will be our last post in this thread as It is felt by our team we have made adequate statements on our position.  We also welcome you to the community and enjoy competition as is makes our team work harder. Thank you for your input.  We politely ask that you do not quote us on things we have not said.  If you feel like you can contribute more to our success please feel to contact us at contact@biddingpond.comBiddingPond aggressively pursues those who wish to tarnish our pristine reputation.  We have never Demanded(required) anything from the person who has chosen to libel us in a public forum. We have made a request from the individual after their libelous comment to support it.  Malignant comments about how our users feel or our reputation will be answered.  If a user has a suggestion or comment on how we can improve we always welcome constructive criticism and can be reached at contact@biddingpond.com Unfortunately the terms of the transfer are private on our side.  If the new company wishes to state the terms they are more then welcome to do so. Emphasis ours.  Your experience does not make other user's experiences unsatisfied.  We would like proof of "many complaints and users being un-satisfied".  Otherwise, what you are doing is libel.We would also like to see a screenshot of the "out fields"(what is that) "big box for the featured items and having nothing for about 2cm down"(we don't notice this on the configurations we test).The first item is the most important and we don't want quibbling over non-relevant details.  You have made a very bold claim and we would like you to support it with documentation. Sources? That's what was figured as you took the time to set up Tor.  But, we've seen some pretty crazy things ;-). To Buyers:BiddingPond always states to use escrow with untrusted buyers.  We also believe to use escrow with bidders that have less than 50 positive feedback and for non-trivial amounts.  If a seller refuses to use escrow after a customer requests it, they are in fact, refusing your business.BiddingPond is constantly battling DDOS's, Attacks, Scammers, "Other Bad Traffic" on a daily basis and are trying hard to maintain a safer atmosphere on the site.  If our recommendations are followed you will have a safe and secure "Bitcoin Bidding Experience".To Sellers:You are in fact losing business and profit by not accepting an escrow solution on your auctions.  Not accepting escrow makes you look like a scammer, especially with low feedback/limited feedback history.Those of you who would not mind accepting escrow please list it in your auction descriptions!  Watch the value of your auction increase and profit! We refill throughout the day.  A twitter feed is on its way so customer know when stock is just put up.  There will also  be a greater number of cards in the near future. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1BiddingPond.com is happy to announce a transfer of its asset BitcoinCashout.com to Bitcoin Solutions LLC.  We will be overseeing the transfer to Bitcoin Solutions LLC for the next couple of months to make sure it goes smoothly.  We would like to thank all of our customers for the great experience and believe that Bitcoin Solutions LLC will be able to do more and grow BitcoinCashout.com into a great Bitcoin user experience.You can follow the transfer thread and Bitcoin Solutions LLC introduction at: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9665.0 for more information as it becomes availablie.Regards,The BiddingPond.com Team-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)iJwEAQECAAYFAk3buPAACgkQlinDwEk8Xn4wHgP/efvGASGJxUM4Zik/832AGzK5V91cOmbkVJleyr/LwgEYxbnDUW0yFOyYQC56eGDfGrZEMm2z6qrJVKk9khB8NCUNdtIXvwceiHxLrdnJ0NTV+3bowuPbHQ9N/Bz7VK5LNlvBifXxsGOYLKX0+U9oBwOBYFlsAQpuu7H8zUYdPas==+ceF-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1BiddingPond.com is happy to announce a transfer of its asset BitcoinCashout.com to Bitcoin Solutions LLC.  We will be overseeing the transfer to Bitcoin Solutions LLC for the next couple of months to make sure it goes smoothly.  We would like to thank all of our customers for the great experience and believe that Bitcoin Solutions LLC will be able to do more and grow BitcoinCashout.com into a great Bitcoin user experience.Regards,The BiddingPond.com Team-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)iJwEAQECAAYFAk3bt54ACgkQlinDwEk8Xn6UhAP+KOAmQBjF0nEcMFQ6fVz13xssJfMyhI2nefXDuM4pIv6OmwkPPCSZfxdW5+4m9X3ZdZ8lr/2NUUHaCk+Ok8qOE/ADIqLCRmm22skZq5CEnyEVfWLPfeuOl2D6jFgDDbixMjKDRTBYWCIac4R5K8DJrl4lRzJHQbGag8oiNdpskcU==xu5f-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- Hope corydolt is a pseudonym. Fortunately/Unfortunately we place approximately 20 cards on a day and are sold out within minutes.  We have been trying to slowly introduce them throughout the day so others can grab them as well.BitcoinCashout.com No it is not.  But, not doing so may not allow you to use the card at some online merchants that do AVS checks(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Verification_System).  When the cards are registered they pass all AVS checks. Will you be accepting Escrow? We are back in stock. There is currently a bug in MtGox Merchant Services. We have attempted to contact them and still have not received a response. We are sorry for those who it inconveniences. We will be moving away from MtGox Merchant Services in the coming weeks. In the interim if you are getting errors on the checkout page you may do the following:1) Load Bitcoins on MtGox before ordering and send it directly to our MtGox account on the checkout page2) When you finish checkout send us an e-mail with your transaction number and we will respond with a payment address(9am-5pm EST).We Apologize for the inconvenience. In stock... going...going... We recommend using Clearcoin for any non-trivial amount.  BiddingPond takes a non intervention approach to payments.  This, coupled with the non-reversible nature of Bitcoins makes it "Buyer Beware".We recommend the following for safe trading on BiddingPond.1) Always use Clearcoin or other Escrow service for non-trivial amounts.2) If you choose not to use an escrow service:    a) Check the sellers detail page and look at feedback and sign up date.  Do this for the people who have       also left positive feedback for the seller.    b) Only deal with trusted Bitcoin community members    c)  If the offer is too good to be true.  It probably is.We are currently working on a project that will provide escrow services and will be tightly integrated with the site so that sellers and buyers can be more protected.We have also blocked Tor originating traffic to the website.  This coupled with new heuristic searches will ban accounts and other resolutions will make BiddingPond a safer place. No bother at all we enjoy contact with our customers as it makes it more fulfilling knowing we are speaking and having a business relationship with a real person.  Our policy is to answer public inquiries with a public answer otherwise it makes us look unresponsive. This protects our reputation and allows others to see how we handle orders. We usually do not confirm payment receipt unless requested as we feel it is not needed as we use a unique address per transaction. A public forum is not the place to handle inquiries on an individual order. Doing this delays our ability to assist you as it requires us to make multiple responses.  We must answer the forum post, answer your e-mails and answer inquiries related to your forum post.  After we are done doing these items we can then work on your particular issue.  Our business hours are between 9am-5pm 7 days a week.  We sometimes answer outside these hours if we are working early/late but, this can not be guaranteed.  The website states that 24-48 hours are needed for a reply.  We usually answer in under 16 hours.Please contact us at the appropriate address listed on the website, in this thread, and the address that we have responded to your previous e-mails by(contact@bitcoincashout.com).  We also have a contact us form on the website which you could type your inquiries into.  This form also allows for encrypted communication.We will answer the status of your order here. We assume that to be correct since this is where your contact was first noticed.  This will also allow other customers to see how the situation is being handled.Mon, May 16, 2011 at 8:52 PM(Outside Business Hours)You contacted us stating you wanted more information about our products and find *Some site operator* (name not mentioned but you are welcome to disclose) unreliable.  You also requested a quote for shipping to Canada.Wed, May 18, 2011 at 7:54 AMWe responded to your inquiry. Stating shipping would cost $1 to Canada plus an additional $1 if you wanted tracking.Wed, May 18, 2011 at 11:19 AMYou asked us if we could reserve you a card outside of our automated system because we frequently sell out.Wed, May 18, 2011 at 4:25 PMWe responded that we would reserve you a card after we were contacted and payment made.Thu, May 19, 2011 at 10:12 AMWe were asked to reserve a card for Friday evening.  You were concerned about declining Bitcoin prices and asked if there was a way to prevent that fluctuation from affecting your purchasing ability.Thu, May 19, 2011 at 2:07 PMYou stated that you were ready to purchase a card now.Thu, May 19, 2011 at 2:27 PMWe quoted you a price with shipping and Notified you the card will not ship until Monday.Thu, May 19, 2011 at 2:33 PMYou responded with your shipping address and stated payment was sent.  You also asked us to supply card information before the card was mailed.Thu, May 19, 2011 at 9:55 PMYour last e-mail stating "Uhm, it's been like 7hrs... Can I at least get confirmation that fundswere recieved?"Thu, May 20, 2011 at 11:30 AMWe confirm that your funds have been received and will mail the card out Monday as agreed.  We will also email you the card information before shipping as requested.If you are unhappy with the way we are handling the situation please contact us and we will cancel your order and issue a prompt refund.  We also request that you use our automated system in the future.  This will allow you to get your card instantly.
We will increase to $250 cards in the future but are unable to do so at this time due to logistical issues. We have made some site tweaks to speed up loading.  Please let us know if the site runs faster for you. The site is up without a problem.Please contact support with your IP address and username.  Also, be aware that TOR originating traffic is being rejected as well as those accounts that have been linked to scammers and those who have been shills recently and in the past. This is an MtGox problem.  We are waiting for their response with a solution/bug fix.  In the interim you can load funds on your MtGox account and send in payment directly from the account.   If they do not fix the issues by this weekend we will be moving away from MtGox merchant services and providing our own. From 15 to 3...... 3 left.. come and get em... Back in stock.  Mtgox is having trouble generating bitcoin addresses so you will have to checkout with your MtGox balance. BiddingPond has implemented new heuristic searches to find and deny access to the website for those who are shill bidding and actively defrauding users.  If you find yourself denied and unable to access the site please contact us at contact@biddingpond.com with your account information so we may investigate the situation. They should work wherever U.S. cards would normally work according to our bank as long as it is not an OFAC Listed nation (http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx).  Unfortunately we can not confirm this as we are U.S. based.  If we receive reports of working/not working countries we will include this in our FAQ. If you place an amount higher than the current bid the site will bid on your behalf until it reaches your max bid amount.  This is called "Proxy Bidding" and is the standard for online auction sites. From what the banks that we deal with state they should work in all but OFAC Listed nations.  We have no way to confirm this and thus can't guarantee or provide support to those outside the U.S. until we can confirm. Site overhauls have brought our response time to approximately 16 hours instead of the usually 4-6 hours. We consider ourselves a serious merchant.BiddingPond.comBitcoinCashout.com Card stock will not be replenished tonight as we enable our new site design and test for bugs.  We will resume business as normal May 18,2011 @6PM EST with a fully automated system. Due to the ever increasing attacks from the Tor network, we will be blocking all tor originating traffic.  We understand this will inconvenience some users and are working on an alternative way for Tor users to access our site while maintaining site security. Yes You might have a hard time finding someone willing to do that as if you start to mess up on there they would be the ones responsible for inviting you.  You should try contacting the site owner to see if he will add you.*Edit*If it's remembered correctly,and correct if wrong, this was also the initial reason to go an invite only basis.  The initial trusted members could invite others in which they trust; This would make trading safer.  From what the banks that we deal with state they should work in all but OFAC Listed nations.  We have no way to confirm this and thus can't guarantee or provide support to those outside the U.S. until we can confirm. After supplying your e-mail address on the site we have custom code that we wrote that tracks orders,inventory and payments.  We then get notified to dispatch your card and we send the card out to you. Yes, you can just forget about the card information and be done with it.  Unfortunately we run out of stock faster than we would like as the demand for our cards backed by our customer service makes people want them more and keep coming back.  We add cards daily between 6PM-8PM. Yes, this should work.  Keep in mind paypal authorizes $1 on a card when you add it to make sure the card is legitimate.  This will temporarily decrease the card balance until it is cleared.We also plan on supporting Dwolla.  We are working on the details of the best way to handle those transactions.
We are back in stock again. We reload cards every day at around 6PM-8PM EST time.  We will have more again tonight at approximately the same time. Hello Everyone!We are back in stock and ready to go.

We are currently sold out of $50 and $100 cards.  We will have more in Tomorrow (Tuesday, May 10, 2011) at around 6PM EST. We will look into those cards and if there is a sustained demand we will supply them. Registered. Emphasis ours.  This is incorrect.  The move to the site has nothing to do with your inability to leave feedback.  We would also like to point out that we know nothing of this situation between "talkinrock" and "The Cold One".  With that said we would like to add that "talkinrock" has jumped to many conclusions very fast and tried to defame us multiple times and when confronted had no proof of the allegations.Like we previously stated we have no knowledge of the situation. But, we do have negative knowledge of talkinrock's reputation. We would like to thank all of our customers.  There was such a demand we were sold out for a couple of hours.  No worries though!  We are now back in stock.  Get them while they're hot! There's also another alternative. Although we're rather biased   . We would like to if we can find a reliable provider and after we get the USD cards set. Fixed. We had an error that wasn't noticed due to server caching.
You can also try our new service http://www.bitcoincashout.com .  We have some other cool projects planned too when we get some more people. No, these ones are not capable.  Depending what direction we go with the re-loadable cards; They may be capable. Unfortunately with any auction site it is caveat emptor.  We suggest looking at a member's feedback before purchasing any items.  We will be offering an escrow service in the future and allow blocking of buyers with little/negative feedback to avoid non-payment situations. We offer custom card amounts up to $750.  If we repeatedly get requests for a certain tier amount we will add additional cards as standard above $100.  We are also looking into providing an assortment of store gift cards after some time.Re-loadable cards may come sooner then later depending upon numerous factors. We are currently entertaining a few options on how to properly proceed. The cards come from the United States.  We use a variety of provider banks for our prepaid cards depending upon cost. As soon as Bitcoins are sent we hold that price(0 confirmations).  We wait for 10 confirmations before sending card information. Yes,This feature will be supplied for a nominal mailing fee(U.S. $1).  If you would like that please notify us in your e-mail and we can do it.  This will all be automated in the future and most of the code is already done we just want to test it more.We announced early as the current situation regarding coinpal requires another option to cashout to keep the community lively and liquid. We would like to announce a new site BitcoinCashout.com .  This service provides the ability to "cashout" your Bitcoins.  We currently offer prepaid credit cards and plan to expand that in the future. http://www.bitcoincashout.com Hello,We have a service which has not been officially announced which might serve your needs:http://www.bitcoincashout.com/ BiddingPond.com has updated its fee structure to accommodate the increasing value of Bitcoins.  As always listing on BiddingPond.com is absolutely free!Updated Fee Structure:Regular Auction: FREE!Home Page Featured Fee: 0.50 BTCBold Item Fee: 0.10 BTCHighlighted Item Fee: 0.20 BTCReserve Price Fee: 0.25 BTCRelist Fee: 0.10 BTCBuy Now Fee: 0.05 BTC We must have missed your post.  Yes, we have a payment method.  Please contact us for a payment address.

#860376 Emphasis added.  Food for thought:How do we know this is not the exact intent of Bitcoin.  The questions are: Who is the target and who is the creator? Situation has been resolved for both parties.  Waiting on a payment address from hippich.  Contact was successful with mybitcoin.com by making a throw away account and using the internal messaging system. BiddingPond.com now supports SSL sign-on and registration. We can personally recommend slicehost.com and nearlyfreespeech.net . Nearlyfreespeech.net being very good for small blogs and things not requiring much and to be done cheaply.  Slicehost if you need full customization. Stay away from godaddy as much a possible lots of problems.  Namecheap.com as an alternative for domain names and DNS although can't vouch for their hosting.*Edit*Also, if you wish to do anything controversial always make sure your hosting provider is different from your domain registrar.  It's good practice to do even if there is nothing controversial as it provides redundancy, technically and legally(take down notices,etc.) Thank you working on it. Problem was related to the way Adblock plugin blocks ads.  This issue has been fixed.  Thank you "theGECK" for help with troubleshooting this issue. Thank you for supporting the site. BiddingPond.com has removed the "buy now" fee active immediately until April 30th, 2011.  What this means is you can now list items with "Buy Now" only for free!  No auction needed!  Go on list stuff now! Yes,BiddingPond.com also deletes auction data as well. Our retention policy is at least 30 days for complete auction information. This is a good idea and is liked.  We have someone looking to join our development team. If it works out we will include this on the to do sooner than later list. Is anyone else able to replicate usability problems?  Looking at usage data it seems people are having an easier time using the site.  Using multiple OS/Browsers and browsershots.org still unable to replicate a problem.  There is a single user using RockMelt.  Is that you? I'm sorry for the confusion.  If you would like your auction edited please send the text you would like appended. Alternatively, for this auction your Bitcoin address in the payment address field is possible just send the proper address. All data was copied over from the old site. You "should" be able to relist that auction by going to http://www.biddingpond.com/yourauctions_sold.php .  If it is for some reason not there, please provide the auction number and we will get the auction data for you. Is it possible to take a screen shot/explain what is not displaying correctly.  Also, please provide OS,browser version and screen resolution.  You can e-mail us at contact@biddingpond.com or alternatively post here. The Short answer1) There is no need to use us as a third party2) Your method is still valid and works very well3) Protection to the sellers reputation4) Additional optional features in the future will require thisOur Questions1) What do you believe would be a better alternative?*2) Would you prefer an opt-in service in which you either get access to the extra features or not?***We do not like the idea of allowing the seller to enter any address in the payment address field. As there is nothing preventing a scammer to state that they did not provide an address and it is a biddingpond.com generated address(a Bitcoin peculiarity in inability to determine destination). Yes, we do understand that there is nothing preventing a scammer from saying they they never received payment from us. But, that will come down to trust (if you chose to use the optional feature).** This option we believe works well.  But, understand that if we implement this feature those who chose it will not be able to provide some features to their buyers.The Long AnswerThere is no obligation for the seller to require the users to use the payment address listed in the auction.We agree to the working nature of the following transaction process that you are currently using:1) Buyer Wins Auction2) Seller / Buyer make contact3) Payment information provided4) Payment Sent + Shipping information sent5) Payment Receipt confirmed by buyer6) Item shippedThis is also the reason why we would never prohibit any seller from accepting payment in an alternative way.To simplify the transaction process our current system is as follows:1) Buyer wins auction2) Payment Sent3) Seller notified of shipping address4) Item shippedWe also plan on shortening this process one more step by allowing the buyers to include shipping information that is automatically forwarded to the sender after payment is sent(optional). This will further streamline the process and make it easier for less tech savvy individuals to purchase items.We also will be implementing the following optional features which will require us to handle transactions:1) Escrow and Arbitration2) "Trusted Sellers" Program3) Ability to purchase items in USD and send payment in BTC to Seller (for the less tech savvy)4) Other features which we do not wish to reveal at this time to keep us competitiveThere is also a very real and very important benefit that we chose to include last.  By publicly posting a Bitcoin address that is generated by BiddingPond.com and is unique to each auction we can protect both the sites reputation as well as the seller's reputation as others can in fact see if the buyer did send payment. This provided with proper tracking information from the seller can effectively prevent Feedback Extortion.I would just like to reiterate that these features are optional and the old BiddingPond.com is not going anywhere.  BiddingPond.com prefers giving the sellers and buyers a "hands-off" approach with their transactions but, we do understand there are buyers and sellers who wish otherwise and we will cater to those individuals through our additional, completely optional, services.One way our "hands-off" approach can be seen in practice is our failure to require payment of selling fees before we forward payment to the seller.  This allows the seller the choice to pay us, not the requirement to pay us. If you would like please send me an e-mail at contact@biddingpond.com and we can discuss it further. The "Bidding" code was not touched and I have no fear about those types of bugs showing up as it does not depend on other parts of the site code.The "Payment Address" field is a simple way for users to send payment to the seller.  When payment is sent to that address the auction will be marked as paid in the seller control panel and after confirmations are received will be forwarded to the sellers bitcoin payment address.  You may update your payment forwarding address at:http://www.biddingpond.com/edit_data.phpIf you do not provide a payment forwarding address all funds will be held in a "Bitcoin Wallet" until an address is provided which can be viewed at:http://www.biddingpond.com/user_menu.php?Seller's are under no obligation to use this feature and may instruct the buyers to pay however they wish.  This is simply a convenience feature which will mark auctions as paid and simplifies payment issues for the buyer and the seller. The new biddingpond.com is now live! There have been many changes to the site! Although we have tried our best to iron out all the bugs if you do encounter one:Please report all bugs to http://www.biddingpond.com/msgboard.php?board_id=4Some of the most notable changes are as follows:New LayoutAccount Balance and Bitcoin WalletAuto generated payment addresses in auctionsUnique QR code per auctionSocial Network IntegrationAbility to list "Buy it Now" without also requiring an auctionAbility to automatically re-list the item if it does not sell.---------------------------------------------Some things we may need you to do:1) Update your Bitcoin forwarding address so we may forward payments sent to your auction address.You may do this by going to "My Control Panel" at the top of the page when you're logged in and clicking on "Edit your personal profile". At the bottom you will see a location to enter your Bitcoin address. 2)Pay us your back auction fees. Any accounts that reach -25BTC for money owed will be temporarily suspended until payment is received. If you need some time to pay please contact us at contact@biddingpond.com. We will also be auctioning off listing credits all this week to help those with large balances catch up and to celebrate the new site becoming live.---------------------------------------------Unfortunately during the move some items are not working and are currently being worked on. These items are:1) Payments sent to bitcoin auction address will not currently forward to your forwarding address immediately after confirmations. We will manually process these transactions every day at 12pm EST.  (We hope to have this corrected by the end of the day. When it is payments will be forwarded after 5 confirmations)2) Payments received through the auction "Payment Address" will not automatically update the auction as paid(this should be fixed by the end of today). Regarding the situation in this post by Hippich:Mon, Mar 7, 2011 at 2:11 PMBiddingPond was notified of a situation in which a user stated that they (disregarded)/(did not see) the do not use this feature message.Mon, Mar 7, 2011 at 2:39 PMBiddingPond responded to the user notifying them that they would contact mybitcoin.com to see if they received the transaction and could handle the situation.Mon, Mar 7, 2011 at 2:54 PMContacted mybitcoin.com about a couple of account issues we have been having regarding access to mybitcoin.com account as well as this issue.Mon, Mar 7, 2011 at 2:52 PMBiddingPond Was sent information about a bitcoin transaction that does not belong to the biddingpond.com wallet and has no way of confirming if payment was indeed sent.http://blockexplorer.com/address/1FcPBRy8JY5tTbG39hDHkubqTU82kN28cvWith the suggestion that we remove the link completely instead of placing in bold before the submit button not to use the payment feature .Tue, Mar 8 about an hour after suggestionAll non-functioning payment methods removed and a message stating to contact the seller placed on the site.  It should be noted that over 100 auctions have closed since the payment methods were non-functional and this is the only situation that has been reported.  This is also the reason why it was not changed as there have been no issues, complaints, and/or suggestions to change it.Tue, Mar 8, 2011 at 9:06 AMBiddingPond contacted about the status of the situationTue, Mar 8, 2011 at 10:24 PMBiddingPond responds regarding status of the situation.With Regard to mybitcoin.com:No Response from mybitcoin.com . We have been trying to resolve an account related issues with them since:Tue, 22 Feb 2011 18:15:56We used the contact information available on their website. We sent both an encrypted(PGP) and unencrypted message to them.Time had been the biggest constraint for implementation of a stable and secure payment method. We originally were going to use an outside payment processor(Mybitcoin SCI, mtgox, etc.) but trust became an issue.  Specifically, we do not trust anyone to handle payments on behalf of our customers besides us and the customer themselves.Also, a payment procedure that people would like to use, that is better than just listing a payment address in an auction, and is as convenient had to be though of and tested. The BiddingPond development site has solved that problem.  All auctions will have their own bitcoin addresses auto-generated.  If the seller provides a forwarding address, payment will be immediately forwarded to their address after 5 confirmations.  If the seller does not provide an address, Bitcoins will be held in a wallet that can be withdrawn at a later date and/or transfered to another user.We also DO NOT REQUIRE the seller to only accept payment this way as people have varying levels of trust and we also do not wish to interfere with how buyers and sellers wish to pay for their items.  If the seller would like to include different payment instructions in the listing they may do so.  This feature make payment tracking easier though as it will auto mark items as paid after 5 confirmations are received.The biddingpond development site is scheduled to go live on 03/25/2011 notification has been given on the site here:http://biddingpond.com/viewnew.php?id=5Back to Hippich Situation:Even though payment methods were clearly marked do not use and we have no way of confirming that payment was ever even sent to BiddingPond or that this situation is even legitimate(we do believe it is and DO trust Hippich).As an act of good faith, and the fact that we do consider Hippich as a trusted community member, we are willing to reimburse hippich 50% of the lost bitcoins and give him a 300% listing credit on the website.  If and when mybitcoin.com resolves the issue on their end we will send the remaining 50%.As always BiddingPond strives to provide the best customer service possible.  Most questions and concerns are answered within 48 hours of receipt.  If you do have a problem we ask that you contact us at contact@biddingpond.com .  We request that you contact us first before posting in the forums and that you allow us to resolve the situation to your liking.  Not doing this causes us to have to perform double the work to resolve the issue as we then have to make multiple responses and handle additional inquires.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/apprentice2/http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/MTG_Forge I would be interested in one at the new price. SHA-256 Hashes of the paypal e-mail addresses would be able to keep them private.  Also, what bitcoin-otc is doing with the portable account via GPG verification is very useful. If you would like to use BiddindPond let met know. I can set you up with a good template to use on the site which will explain all your requirements in an auction format. This will also allow you to build a reputation due to our feedback system.  If your volume is high enough I can also work out other arrangements with you. Also, BiddingPond is always free to list so you might as well try it out. Yes,Most minor usability bugs have been fixed on the new site. Including this one.  You can leave feedback using the following URL on the current site: http://www.biddingpond.com/buysellnofeedback.php .  Please leave negative feedback for the seller if you are unable to resolve this. Can you please PM me the auction in question and I will try to contact the seller on your behalf(if you would like that). Not to let the cat out of the bag too early. I have a project that I am working on that will be doing this. This should be live shortly just putting some finishing touches on it (Next Week). To throw my .02BTC in this is golden advice. For 40BTC it's not worth it even if it's more than that it usually isn't worth the time, money, and aggravation. Also, some small claims have a dollar amount floor that is required before you can file suit. To throw one more wrench into the equation even if you do prove you have jurisdiction over him in court(by saying he was offering business services in your state) and file suit in your state, Florida does not usually recognize out of state default judgements as a matter of policy which is why those with lots of credit problems usually hide out there and wait. Starting Saturday, March 5, 2011 through Sunday, March 6, 2011.Every Item that is listed on biddingpond will receive a 5BTC listing credit on their Account!Also! for your FIRST item of the weekend you will receive .05BTC to the address of your choice.To be eligible you must list the item between the dates above and e-mail contact@biddingpond.com with the details before March 7, 2011 00:00 EST time. Accounts and bitcoin addresses will be credited within 72hours. Very true. Great business idea too. 80% receivers for bitcoins. You can make most 80% receivers complete with just a drill press and some hand tools. It states you take a 4% fee from all bounties.  Can you explain who retains ownership of the content generated. Do you acquire ownership of the content or do you just require the expert to provide a license to use the answer on the site. This right here(emphasis mine). I will never remove the feature of two way feedback.  In the future I might even implement the ability to even block buyers based upon their positive/negative feedback ratio.  Right now I'm working on a couple of Bitcoin projects as the sole developer. One of them to be released in the next few days. So, time is definitely limited. i don't know what country you hail from but, personally, I have done bank reversals on wire transfers here in the United States. More difficult than a credit card transaction reversal but, still highly possible.  Not to go too off topic but this is one of the reason why I enjoy Bitcoin, YOU control your money not some bureaucratic mess(banks, government etc.) I like competition. Good luck. Corrected for accuracy. E-bay won't agree because it's against their policy of requiring a payment method that is reversible.  The ebay rating system is currently for show for that reason as the buyer will always receive their money back no matter if they practice due diligence or not. I like the site. Is it possible to include a feature to communicate with other members using an internal messaging system. Skype,phone,etc is nice but I don't want to give that information out to just anyone immediately before talking to them online. Moved to biddingpond:http://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=206 I'm interested to see what MtGox has to say about this.  I sent him a message regarding this thread. I have had libelous things written about me on this forum by other new users with low post counts and don't take a user with one post very seriously.Do you have screenshots? E-mails? Message headers? etc. If that became an issue wouldn't you just change your signature? Also, to be able to determine if the person is being honest you could periodically send yourself a random bitcoin amount and see if it gets forwarded to yourself. You could do this manually or programmatically. Sorry. That would place Bitcoins at $1.50 when the current market is at about $.85 . The worst I would consider is 30BTC=30USD.
I'm looking to sell $30 on Full Tilt poker for 34BTC or MtGox USD(Equal Trade). I agree bitcoin.org would be great. Put me down for 100 stickers. I would like to state I had a successful transaction with Dangler. We used clearcoin escrow for a period of 1 year. Item received and funds released.Thanks. Yes, I will. I will sign up tonight. I do not want to edit auctions as that is unfair to the bidders. You can still sell the item to the "winner" if you choose even though they do not meet the reserve price. He's lying or misinformed. BiddingPond has no feature as of yet to pay each other through the site. That feature is on the way though. I will confirm once I receive the item. PM sent. Hello,I'm looking for two people purchase 3 of these for me(order limit):Looking for 1 more of these. Let me know if anyone is interested.

Auctions can not be closed once someone has bid on the item. Yes,E-mail confirmations have been disabled. The new site(coming real soon) will not require a valid e-mail account to register. I have also added a couple of new features. E-mail updates will be turned back on when the new site comes online(auction outbid notices, new listing notices,messaged,etc.).
Auction features are selected before bid purchasing. E-mail is down as per notice on the website. I have a new BiddingPond version in the works with a multitude of minor bug fixes on the way. Also, I have included a couple of extra features that will make bidding, listing and selling easier. I also have added the ability to sell items "Buy it now" with no bidding option. Investigating the situation. It's probably because of the server move. I will update this post when it is corrected. In the meantime please e-mail me your username at contact@biddingpond.com and I will manually activate your account. Biddingpond.com is completing its move to a new web host. Periodic downtime is to be expected throughout the day. If any Auctions are affected they will be extended by the time that the site is down.Biddingpond.com has completed its move to a new web host. No auctions were due to close during the move and everything seems to have gone smoothly. If you experience any errors please e-mail contact@biddingpond.com Not a problem I have to manually edit it. I will do that when I get to a computer sometime tonight.All done. Please contact me via PM or e-mail concerning this. What are you receiving e-mails about? You should not receive 29 e-mails not matter what.  DNS transfer has gone successfully.While our DNS updates propagate throughout the internet you may access the site at:http://biddingpond.nfshost.com/if you have trouble viewing via other methods.  I have also started to integrate captchas into the website before placing a bid to reduce(eliminate?) automated bid sniping. Robert,Why do I feel you are nothing more than a troll trying to cause controversy. Also, you still have not answered my question in a previous thread on what program and heuristic algorithm you used to scan my site. I suggest you answer these questions so the community can actually start to take you seriously. BiddingPond.com will be experiencing downtime on 01/26/2011 @ 8PM EST. We are changing DNS providers to better accommodate new features.While our DNS updates propagate throughout the internet you may access the site at:http://biddingpond.nfshost.com/ if you have trouble viewing via other methods. BiddingPond.com will be experiencing downtime on 01/27/2011 @ 12PM EST. We are changing hosting providers to better accommodate new features. 1)SSH tunnel from your hosting account, run the bitcoin balance command, parse and display. 2)Another way would be to set up a simple http server that supports cgi on the home computer and write a simple script to pull data from the client and display it.3)Simple script that gets information from bitcoin client and then uploads a text file to your hosting server with the updated information. I like the site. Very well laid out. How do you plan to make money? Every new account comes with a 5BTC listing credit due to situations that arise like this. http://www.biddingpond.com/fees.phpCurrent fees are:BiddingPond.com's idea of a good auction site is one with low fees. We believe in a flat rate fee structure unlike other auction sites who will charge you a percentange of your sales. We will always try to maintain our policy of items being free to list with the "extra' feautures being a nominal charge to support the site and keep it online. Our fee table is below:Home Page Featured Fee: 2.00 BTC    Bold Item Fee: 1.00 BTC    Highlighted Item Fee: 1.00 BTC    Reserve Price Fee: 2.00 BTC    Relist Fee: 1.00 BTC    Buy Now Fee: 2.00 BTCI readjust fees after a stabilized general increase of BTC/USD monthly. Fees will probably be lowered at the end of this month. This idea was suggested and will eventually be implemented. Unfortunately I do not have a time table for this feature and someone might beat me to it. That would be correct. From what I have seen on items selling on the site BTC are worth a lot more than what people are paying for them. And what heuristic algorithm did you use to determine this? What program? I will give you 72 hours to respond a PM has been sent. I will not personally tolerate any type of defamation especially libel. Just go to bid on the item and enter the highest amount that you are willing to pay. The website will take care of the rest. I understand my FAQ section is non-existent. I have an update coming to the site soon that will give me some time to work on documentation. There are no other bidders on the American Dream Film. Therefore there is no other proxy bid to outbid you. It concerns me that you chose an public forum to discuss this topic without contacting me first with your concerns. This to me makes it look like scare tactics/fear mongering/troll activity.But in order to protect my name from UNFOUNDED accusations I provide the following:Biddingpond.com like all modern auction sites that I know of allow for a user to place a proxy bid. A user will place a maximum amount that they are willing to pay. When another bidder bids an amount LESS than the other persons bid they will naturally be outbid. The way you can avoid being outbid so fast is to place the MAXIMUM amount that you are willing to bid and the site will place a bid up to the largest amount needed. But, like a said earlier if that amount is less than the other users Maximum bid you will be outbid.The way my site works is EXACTLY the same way that e-bay and other large auction sites work regarding the handling of proxy bids.If you wish to run a bot checker go ahead! I run an honest business! But you should also be willing to post the heuristic algorithm used to determine bot use so it can be publicly determined if that will be sufficient.I would also like to note there have been other auctions for listing credits that have sold for far less than the price of an average listing with extra features. Not to mention items I have placed on the site that have sold below market value in order to spur listing activity. I have posted some of these links below:100BTC Listing Credit on Biddingpond.comhttp://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=19525BTC Listing Credit on Biddingpond.comhttp://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=203Advertise on Biddingpond.comhttp://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=196Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Devicehttp://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=159GPS Blocker (110V-220V) with car charger - FREE SHIPPINGhttp://www.biddingpond.com/item.php?id=89I unfortunately can not name who won these auctions as it would be a violation of their privacy. But if they are willing to come forward they can state the auction that they won.If you have NEVER used any type of online auction site I apologize for your confusion regarding proxy bidding. If you have used a modern large bidding site you most definitely are aware of proxy bidding and are a troll.

It seems like the majority wanted bidder privacy re-enabled. For the time being I have re-enabled it. In the future this will change as BC-Spec support is planned for us to build a trust network and to broadcast sale information.  With that said, I will allow multiple account use as per FreeMoney's suggestion.  This will allow everyone to both have their anonymity(by using a different name) and allow a a trust network to be established.I have not determined a way to properly ensure payment while maintaining anonymity and allowing multiple accounts. Currently I am debating between two methods:1) Suspend accounts after 30 days of a negative balance. The reason you will pay is to keep your positive feedback on the account you currently have(as opposed to opening another account and starting at 0).2) Require a deposit (as suggested by FreeMoney) and once that balance reaches 0 require another deposit or deny further listings.Does anyone have other suggestions?I thank everyone for their input and really do appreciate it. Hello everyone,Development on the site was on a temporary hold. We are back up into development mode and more features and a smoother process are on the way. The site contact address is contact@biddingpond.com . A simple message board has also been placed on the site to post comments/suggestions/bug reports/items being sold/purchased/support. Right now it is the responsibility of the buyer and seller to arrange payment with each other. I have included more payment options for those who add new listings as well as those who wish to edit their listing to add a new ones.  There is a message system that can be accessed within the site to send a message to the buyer to arrange payment.If you are not receiving e-mails including forgotten password requests please check your SPAM folder that also includes people who are not receiving winner notifications and auction close notifications.If you can not reset your password please send an e-mail to contact@biddingpond.com and I will reset it to a random password manually. Multi account use will not be tolerated and will be added to the TOS. If you would like an account merged please contact me and I will merge feedback once I verify they are your accounts. Some of you will be receiving e-mails regarding this if you have multiple accounts from a single IP.You can now view bidder names in the bid history.  A planned feature is bidder screening which will keep people who you do not want bidding on your items from bidding (low feedback,too many negative feedbacks left for others etc.)Regarding account payments:Once you get a balance of -500BTC the account will be put on hold from further listings until payment is received. A manual system for payment is currently sending FULL payment to:127U2BTVQ23td2Fh5dnmdAo6HTXQ3qbNcPand messaging contact@biddingpond.com with the amount you sent(your FULL account balance), your login and the current block number at time of payment. The automated payment system for auctions as well as site balances will be done soon through the website sendical.com.  You will be able to pay each other, account balances, as well as a simple escrow service (verification of delivery). It's an interesting idea. What you're after is a bitcheck?  Once the check is "cashed" it is no longer good? Sorry for the downtime. Was a mix up while trying to change registrars. Everything should be working once the DNS information propagates through the servers. 1RZ8DCJYV4vNB1dQ3LeZM54Bp8jtCQe63 And if he does max it out?  Call the company, you're not responsible for the charges and you will have a new card mailed to you. That is a great suggestion. This will definitely be included when the new site design is finished. Thanks for supporting the site. A new site design is on my todo list.  Right now my main concern is on usability and making life easier and safer(safer than other online auction sites) to buy/sell.  Once that is completed I already have a design that I think will work nicely(to be determined by the users). Thank you for reporting the problem. I had been working with the seller to determine the cause. I notified him of who the real winner was. He also very kindly accommodated both buyers on his own. The reason both people received winning mail notifications was they both bid at "the same time".  This error has been corrected and e-mail notifications will get sent out based upon a more accurate time representation.  I will also be crediting the people who were affected by this with 50BTC credits for their trouble. These credits can be used on biddingpond.com or cashed out.  I am on vacation right now and will have your accounts credited by Wednesday. Yes,I have been playing there too. Things looks like they are coming along nicely. Very good work. Can't wait til it's out of beta and everyone is playing. The site has a safety mechanism that keeps people from having large balances and not paying for items. Currently that limit was lifted from 30BTC(low) to 500BTC(about $90USD).  Private transactions ARE allowed and you do not have to use the payment gateway(which is under construction and should be finished this week). If your account is still blocked and you paid the seller directly without using the payment gateway you should ask the seller of the item to mark your transaction as paid.  If the seller refuses, leave negative feedback and contact me and I will resolve the issue between both the seller and buyer.   This can be done by going to the Control Panel, Click on the selling tab, Click on Winner Details, and manually setting payment to paid.Regarding your comments, you did in fact contact me via Private message waited less than 12 hours and opened another account (just so you know this is not allowed but, I did not explicitly state this and the terms of service will be updated). If you would like your account merged please let me know via PM what account name you wish to keep. All your concerns were addressed within a 12 hour period, a reply to your personal message was dispatched, and this forum was updated with the changed information.  I do not see a problem.  If for some reason you would like situations handled another way please feel free to PM me and I will try to implement your suggestion.  Yes, the site without the payment gateway causes it not to be as automated as one would expect it to be. I do encourage feedback and am working on all suggestions that are given to me.I thank you for your continued use of the site and like I stated earlier the payment gateway should be done this week.  You will notice that the process will be highly stream lined after it is fully implemented. To everyone regarding account payments:Once you get a balance of -500BTC the account will be put on hold from further listings until payment is received.

Live Auctions   26   Closed Auctions   42I'm working on automating the rest of the stats and putting up an info page for those who are interested. I will add that to the TODO list. Just to throw in my .02BTC I love skalansky :-D... His book "The Theory of Poker" covers this scenario perfectly. Also "Gambling for a Living" and "Getting the Best of it". Hello,I am offering Pig Pens on Farmville. They are currently unreleased.  I will log in to your account and add the pig pen to your farm. I will perform this service for 800 bitcoins for the first account and 400 for the second account.After I install the pig pen all you need to do is finish it with construction materials!Farmville implemented this early. I will be selling rare pigs tonight... info to follow... All of the reload-able cards I have seen require you to give personal information before you can use the card. That personal information usually requires a social security number. The "Gift" Cards are the ones you need to get and usually don't require anything(you can only use them for the balance not reload them). Maybe there is some loophole they are using for the "Gift" cards that don't require KYC? Apparently not serious? 16k9if6hVQUdA5XmYHqytrSYubdCDX5iXa Not stressed, just being responsive on where I stand to keep the rampant assumptions from ruining a good reputation.  IMHO reputation of all parties involved is one of the top priorities of any business transaction.
Not to mention pokerstars is notoriously slow for adopting new things. Their affiliate program took forever to offer rake and still do not allow them to offer rakeback. Granted they are the fastest and most stable with IMHO the best cashout procedure. A better option might be the Merge Network(Carbon poker is one of the skins of many) and/or FullTilt for quick adoption. Terms and conditions have been updated for more clarity: Updated terms and conditions have been posted to the biddingpond.com discussion thread.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=574.0;all  I understand the site will grow because I plan to run a legitimate business by running the best customer service that is possible.  T&C are there because not everyone is reasonable and court actions do arise whether they are legitimate or not and this chance increases with an increasing user base.  A good reputation and a visible public agreement to me are the basis of good business transactions.Right now it is the responsibility of the parties to work out payment agreements. Currently being worked on is a payment system for bitcoins (sendical.com) which will include in the future an escrow service for a nominal fee. I believe in very simple escrow solutions and will offer multiple options when that time comes. In the mean time if someone wishes for me to hold funds for transactions and both parties send me an agreement I have no problem handling that manually at the time.  Yes, full permission is given to link to individual auctions for legitimate purposes. I am a fond believer of if the users do the right thing there is nothing to worry about. At no point was the terms of service to hamper legitimate fair use of links and information on the site. The terms of use are there to notify illegitimate users that bandwidth theft(image hot linking) and other nefarious uses are not allowed.  If image hot linking does become a problem and countermeasures are constantly thwarted I will just start charging for image hosting. I believe most users will understand and those who don't, will ask for clarification if they believe they are not practicing fair use. I will also have users who don't care. There are many ways to stop people from hot linking images both legal and technical.The reason I do not state specifically "no image hotlinking!" is there are many other site linkings that are for nefarious purposes that would make an exhaustive list impossible. One example that comes to mind is the attempted database injections (which require unauthorized linking and/or access to the site) all of last week that were thwarted by my good filtering code, coding practices and other counter measures.With that said...I can only promise to be reasonable and do the right thing.I believe reasonable people will do the reasonable thing. I also believe that I do not wish to do business with unreasonable people and the biddingpond.com(and bitcoin) community will want to do the same(profitable and easy transactions the exception, let people be unreasonable then). That is also the reason why I have a two way feedback system unreasonable buyers and sellers will quickly weed themselves out (implementation to filter buyers based on feedback rating is in the works).This is also the reason why I think non reversibility of transactions are appropriate for a bidding site(bitcoins). It eliminates buyer fraud and extortion. The feedback system eliminates other types of fruad and marginalizes them very quickly(both parties can leave feeedback. The intent of that line was to avoid hyper linking directly to images to keep bandwidth costs from getting out of control. I have reworded the terms of service to reflect my intent.

I failed debugging 101 somewhere. The error log did indeed give me useful information.What happened:The bitcoind client when run acts as an RPC client and connects to the already running instance of bitcoind to get its data(I did not know that). Also, the default apache configuration uses / as its home directory not the same directory the bitcoind client uses to store the bitcoin.conf file. When bitcoind was run with a command switch from the CGI it was looking in the home directory of the user it was run from(the webserver) for bitcoin.conf and not from the home directory of the user bitcoind was running as.Fixes:1) Have bitcoind and the webserver run as the same user so they share the same configuration directory2) Create a link between the bitcoin.conf from the home directories of the users(webserver and bitcoind user)3) Create a duplicate configuration file for both users.Thanks for the help everyone! I would like to say thanks! Nice smooth transaction with llama The recommendation is a double line break of \n\n.http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charsetI still can't figure this out :-(... anyone?  It should be really simple. I even tried piping the output to a text file and it will not output correctly when run through CGI. I'm using Apache 2.2 if that helps anyone. Permissions are correct.  Owner and group are the webserver and for testing purposes it is 777.  Execution string seems to be right as it is runs in the terminal fine. Message sent. Hello,I'm having a little trouble parsing and displaying the output from the bitcoind client in the browser from a CGI program written in C.Code:  #include <stdio.h>main(){ /* Always print a content type and a blank line. */ printf("Content-Type: text/html\n\n");  /* HTML Page Start */ puts("<html>"); puts("<head>"); puts("<title>"); puts("</title>"); puts("<body>");  int entry = 1; char line[200]; FILE* output = popen("/var/www/bitcoind.cgi getblockcount", "r"); while ( fgets(line, 199, output) ) { printf("%5d: %s", entry++, line); }   puts("</body>"); puts("</html>");   return 0;}Is producing only the following HTML code through the cgi interface:Code:<html> <head> <title> </title> <body> </body> </html> The command line output when run in a terminal is(which is correct):Code:<html> <head> <title> </title> <body>1: 75029</body> </html>Any ideas?
