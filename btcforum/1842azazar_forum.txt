I think, that Paypal is just a beginning. Anonymity attracts scammers. There are two options:1. Use same values for trust, and trust in honesty(and absence of stupidity in choice of trusted parties).2. Use separate values.I think, that it should be optional to end-user. I simplified it a bit. Trust can also be negative for those, who is not trusted. A trusts D = average(AB*BD,AC*CD) I think, that every person in that network should have it's own small trust list, which is filled manually. And a large trust list, which is loaded from other people, that are present in that small list. This can be done recursively to make a full list.For example:A trusts both B and CB and C trusts DSo A should see that, there two of his trusted parties, that trust DI'm not not familiar to game theory, but I think it should work. This can be implemented as a separate project. It can be a kind of social network, maybe even similar to facebook, but decentralized. Having a trust system is not the only thing it could provide... Вообще это платёжная система, не только "наличность".
