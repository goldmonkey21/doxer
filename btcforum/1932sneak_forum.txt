Google already solved this problem with U2F (FIDO Alliance) tokens.  They're about 15 and the protocol is really well-designed. https://www.bitstamp.net I'll sell you the output of mine.   https://us.etrade.com/e/t/estation/pricing?id=1203013000 Obviously you are being MITM attacked by the government for participating in a subversive p2p network currency.  You should sound the alarm, because if indeed that were the case, this would not be too late anyway.  /sarcasmSSL key changes are routine.  If you trust the PKI, then it's fine.  If you don't trust the PKI, it wasn't fine before anyway. On the first hard drive. Anyone who thinks that doing client side crypto (here's looking at you, StrongCoin developers) adds any safety or security doesn't know how JavaScript works.I direct you to the excellent write-up on matasano.com, explaining clearly why doing crypto on the clientside is a waste of time:http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/It's also worth noting that StrongCoin sources javascript from both Google -and- Twitter, enabling either of those organizations (or anyone who obtains a certificate for either of those organizations, or anyone if SSL is not used) to completely subvert this "secure" clientside crypto. With a crew like that, I'll at least _think_ about going. -sneak What's the point of these? Note: I am not a lawyer.The best part is that producing fake bitbills in and of itself is probably not illegal.  Of course, using them to obtain goods and services is probably fraud, but making a bunch of fake bitbills with no keys inside and selling them to someone as a batch of fake bitbills (for that second party to do with as they please) is not against the law (save whatever copyrighted image is on them, which is a civil matter).The problem with the OP's solution here is one of trust.  It's the same reason why bitbills are doomed to failure.  There's no way for the recipient of a payment to be assured that nobody else has the keys that can be used to transfer the coins.When you generate your own key and the sender makes a public transaction transferring those coins to you, you can be assured that nobody but you can transfer them.  When someone emails you a wallet.dat or hands you a bitbill, there is no assurance that someone else can't one day spend those coins.  If you want them to be permanently safe, you have to transfer the ownership to a new key, and that involves the blockchain.I'm not really clear on why everyone's trying to invent coin transfers that avoid the blockchain.  They all involve some sort of trust scheme, and with smartphones approaching free (along with mobile internet connectivity) shortly we will all be speculating idly. The only reason you'd need an ATM is to provide physical bills - this is why ATMs exist today.  With the advent of extremely cheap smartphones and near-ubiquitous 3G/EDGE connectivity, there is really zero market for such a thing.By the time you'd built them, got the contracts in place, and put them in the market, they'd be obsolete money-sinks. Why are you not taking your keys with you?  Do you not trust AES symmetric encryption? The investor that thinks that cashing out after a 400% increase is "too early", well, isn't.If you want to whine about it, think about the story told to me last weekend - a dude who bought a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins.  Then go try to make traditional investments that yield triple-digit APYs.  Then come back and complain. It's not a windows script.  xxd and bc aren't installed on windows by default - try it on a unix box. Those are pretty crap examples.  Bitcoin already uses bitcoin.org.  Though not unilateral these days, the .com TLD was clearly meant for commercial enterprise, and is overwhelmingly used to that end.I don't think there will be much confusion over it.  I don't hear anyone complaining about the domain squatter that has bitcointalk.com, after all...-jp -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA256If you liked the talk and would like to send a bitcoin donation in support, please use the following address:1GLRQGVoF5U2iuN1RWQxNP1UBGD1vtYEfABest,Jeffrey Paul <sneak@datavibe.net>http://twitter.com/sneakatdatavibehttp://sneak.datavibe.net-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----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jM6q-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- Thanks for all the positive response to the talk, guys!I recorded the talk myself from the soundboard and with a second HD camera.  If we don't end up getting the CCC-streamed one to work right on the video sites I can sync and mux them myself and get a different recording up.Best,Jeffrey Paul <sneak@datavibe.net>http://sneak.datavibe.nethttp://twitter.com/sneakatdatavibe5539 AD00 DE4C 42F3 AFE1  1575 0524 43F4 DF2A 55C2 RBB (Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg) is covering the Chaos Communication Camp, and in it they mention that Bitcoin will be discussed:http://www.rbb-online.de/nachrichten/vermischtes/2011_08/computerclub_zeltcamp.html I'm giving a presentation entitled "Financing The Revolution" at the Chaos Communications Camp 2011 in Berlin, Germany on Friday the 12th of August (2011) at 22:30.http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/I cover existing digital cash systems, Bitcoin, and how and why anonymous decentralized payments systems are essential to the functioning of a free society.Some of you may have already seen this at BSides Berlin (in December 2010, when MtGox was trading at ~$0.20) or at the Technical University Berlin last month.  I've updated the deck to cover all of the latest developments in the world of Bitcoin and I hope to see some of you there.Best,Jeffrey Paul (sneak)sneak@datavibe.net5539 AD00 DE4C 42F3 AFE1  1575 0524 43F4 DF2A 55C2 I have created an app for Mac OS X that displays trades from MtGox in realtime.  It doesn't poll but instead opens a socket (to my realtime messaging server) that is fed with updates as they happen from the MtGox websocket service, so you see trades and prices with sub-second latency.MtGoxWatcher, OS 10.6+, Intel-only (32 and 64 bit)Download and info:  http://sneak.datavibe.net/projects/mtgoxwatcher/Source code is up on GitHub for the hacking (linked to from the project page above).Feature requests and suggestions are welcome!Best,Jeffrey Paul <sneak@datavibe.net> (@sneakatdatavibe)pub   4096R/DF2A55C2 2010-10-21      Key fingerprint = 5539 AD00 DE4C 42F3 AFE1  1575 0524 43F4 DF2A 55C2
