We are selling 'indulgences' just like the Roman Catholic Church used to. Just kidding.Utilizing someone's exchange service would be nice. We are accepting donations to start, and if someone wanted us to link back to their site (links or banners), or promote their exchange we would certainly do that for some BitCoins. We are associated with PNNAC.ORG, a private freedom-based society that may also be interested in the same things. Their contact info is on the site.Let's start some dialogue and see where it takes us. I'll check out the existing exchanges and if they look reasonable I'll contact them.
