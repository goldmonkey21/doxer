The Bitcoin dir wasn't created at all. I tried creating the folder myself, I checked the permission of %APPDATA%, nothing worked.I've tried running as admin too.  That's where %appdata% resolves to (I've tested). Hi! I'm running bitcoin in Linux without any problems, but I've tried installing it on Windows and I can't get it to run.The error is:Code:EXCEPTION: 22DbRunRecoveryExceptionDbEnv::open:DB_RUNRECOVERY:Fatal error, run database recoveryIt happens both on the zip version and the installed. I tried going to %appdata% and there was no bitcoin folder. Tried creating one, nothing, tried copying the wallet.dat file from the Linux version, nothing. I'm running Bitcoin 0.3.0 on Windows 7 (32bit).Thanks for your help!
