Reddit has a pretty active Monero subreddit.https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero I like ZCL for the BTCP fork, and Kyber Network (KNC). Are you doing anything special, or just gmake -f makefile.unix on FreeBSD/amd64?  I'm having trouble getting it to compile on FreeBSD/amd64 8.1, but I'll freely admit thatC++ is lost on me.  I managed (using your patch for the makefile) to compile 0.3.3 previouslyso I think that all the proper bits are installed.I'm just trying to compile bitcoind for a headless FreeBSD box.Thanks.
