I guess I understand their paranoia, but given you can instantly convert the Linden Dollars you bought with paysafecard into Bitcoins on Virwox, do they really think having two steps between them and Silk Road instead of one is going to reduce their legal liability by that much? If they were able to somehow restrict deposits to their account to only cash and not checks, then they're fine. But checks are, of course, cancelable.  Can't personally recommend one, but have you taken a look at Full Towers instead of Mid Towers? I'd assume there'd be more 8 slot options there.

Hi, I haven't been able to try out Bitcoin yet as I have an old PPC Macintosh, so I'm out of luck for now.Reading through the threads, I got the impression that there is no way to have a message field when sending to bitcoin addresses as opposed to IPs? If that is the case, how is everyone managing transactions through their websites that access the API?
