Yeah.... just like when I do that.... which I do every time I sell something on craigslist....I read a short time ago on the IRS website that hobby income is not taxable unless you make a profit at it. Â But that's neither here nor there: I don't think anyone's fooling themselves about how serious the fedgov is about non-dollar denominated transactions... particularly not those who know who Robert Kahre is. Everything I find on barter says that the IRS considers barter income to be taxable, and not reporting it is tax evasion. So, I'm installing this as soon as I get home, but here's the obvious question:If I use bitcoin in the US for transactions where I procure or sell goods or services, how will I stay out of prison?
