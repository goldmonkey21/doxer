Wow this thread still exists? I was here in the good old days of $5 and $10.  So much shenanigans.   No there is a saying "Bull and Bears make money, pigs get slaughtered". Ie the foolish masses. Of course OP is basically a bear. We'll who is buying the 7k wall @300 on bitstamp? I left my last 2 million in my other pants. Ya or its a way to spring the market. If he suddenly pulled the wall we'd go over 300 easily. Who knows. Maybe a whale trader knows no one on Stamp has that kind of one-off buying power and wanted to slow the choo choo train? Because someone has plunked a 7k wall up to $300 on stamp. https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/796/btcfut Futures at 796 @ $300. Stamp with a 7k wall at 300....... Yeah the move is huge relative to the volume.  Breakout??? ;P lol @ trading bitcoin. OUt of the total blue........... Imagine instead of being a troll-bear you bought bitcoins in 2011 when you joined this site.  You will need an API to attract anyone seriously interested in seeding your markets. As a whole, the site looks great to me. If you can get some liquidity US players will come, they miss Matchbook. Same pattern as last weekend. SOmeone dropped a few megas on 796 out of the blue and we steamed from $220 -> $260. CHinese futures markets getting frothy. This seems like a classic front run of Monday morning "good news". Even btce @ parity with Stamp, panic buy mode activated. The USD futures markets in China are steaming.
$300!!! Canadian. Why you say that? I actually think we are right at the edge of the downtrend. Yes we can go lower of course. The next few days will be critical. You just empty the accounts first. BTW anyone with bitcoin addresses before last May (I believe) have access to a number of Altcoin called CLAMS. Basically the devs "sent" 4.5 clams to every btc address (ltc too?) with a balance before May 2014. They are trading @ like 1Euro so you might as well go get your free money even if you scoff at altcoins. Yup. Good spot for a short-squeeze. Just go on IRC and listen to the devs talking, they will let you know if something is wrong. PUSH Try www.vpngate.net and connect to a server from Japan. Worked for me on my desktop. I have this too. It works when I use Firefox, but not chrome, my main browser. Sudden rise in volume on okcoin futures. Dunno, the arb between Stamp and Bitfinex would have me concerned with the former. A somewhat concerning pattern imo. Large volume hammer candles start an uptrend capped by a inverted hammer to signal downside. Trollboxes everywhere on fire. LTC TO THE MOON.   The less popular anus-wallet. I know seems too good to be true. If I thought that then I would have said that. But I didn't. Who needs an exit strategy?  That's what margin calls are for. I disagree. 1k was a false bubble courtesy of that clown Mark Karpeles and the WIllybot. The actual true ATH is probably $250......  
Lots of bitcoin channels on freenode.   Welp time to put on some music. The hacker would be a fool to move coins on an exchange with KYC requirements. Lets look for a huge arb between BTC and the rest of the pack. Ya I know lets see if the 1 hour bounces. Love the technical look of things. Someone buying along the exponential moving average like clockwork. During the downslide it was the opposite.edit of course it breaks as soon as I post. How much does the price have to move before you make money going short or long with leverage? 4%? He could find some  third world country and make a deal with the county's overlords to create a province of anarchist neckbeards dedicated to freedom. Am I seeing a huge influx of new accounts dedicated to trolling fud or is this just more of the same from this site? Bitstamp re-acquiring their stolen coins from bitfinex? Look at what you can buy in Vancouver for 950k.  It's straight madness of the crowd. People don't realize that renting a house or renting money to "own" their house is the same thing but the former is almost always cheaper. There is of course always the option of holding one's nose and moving to Detroit. This is an old story. A few get rich the rest get screwed. Hard to actually consider the current cabal of exchanges as representative of an efficient market; VC capital has gone to start-ups, not the purchase of coins for example. Perhaps the current price decline was manufactured by large farms for the very purpose of lowering difficulty and extending their hardware life-cycle? Yup.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-12-30/rigging-triangle-exposed-jpmorgan-british-petroleum-bank-england-cartel-full-frontal There is no suggestion to me that this will be the case. We are still following the down -> retrace 50% up -> down pattern. I have a theory a large miner or miners have been selling to crush the price in order to squeeze out lesser heeled miners to the purpose of lowering the difficulty and thereby extending the life-cycle of their current hardware. Furthermore, this would be a brilliant way to increase ROI to mind-boggling numbers if their goal was to rebuy their coins at much lower prices. THe btc market cap vs the entire alt market cap is like an ocean to a puddle. BTC-E is basically the Switzerland of bitcoin exchanges. No one really knows who owns it and users are not required to post KYC details. Ie it attracts drug dealers and hackers. Because of this, sellers are willing to take a worse price for this privacy which the buyers are aware of, thus the price is always lower than other, more legitimate offerings. If you draw a fancy line down from the very top of the 1k candle.....
And so grows the ignore list. Over what timeframe? I have doubts it will ever ramp up as quickly as we have seen in the past. Moreover, I now consider the last bubble to 1k merely a function of the MtGox willybot fiasco.In a sudden price rise there will be many looking to sell. Miners who are under a huge squeeze to make ROI might jump at the chance to lock in profits. Many of those caught out in the hype who bought high will be looking to get out (and be fooled twice). Exchange volume is now more distributed. Bitstamp, OK/Huiboi, and Bitfinex are all as large as MtGox was back in the crazy early days, so volatility won't be as high.This said, bitcoin can go bananas on certain news events. It would have to be huge news of course, Apple, Google, Amazon, the collapse of a currency, adoption as reserve by a sovereign nation; (the poorest countries in the world have nothing to lose by allocating a fraction of their reserves to bitcoin imo).  But that is stupid. That's like saying burning a $100 bill isn't profitable. Mining is risk taking with a possible outcome of profit or loss. Gambling always ends in a loss over the long term.  So you hope he lapses into a coma? Not very nice   Much wow. Banging into uptrend off the bottom from start of OCT.  Agree. $340 is now bedrock. If we go lower, the machines will be upon Zion and all will be lost. Collusion is difficult because there comes a point where one or more colluders can break his bond and do the opposite and screw everyone else. This is how the pump an dump scams run with alt coins. Where the hell did adam go?? Relax, we'll need to break $355 before we can confirm that the sky is falling. $320 was the bottom of the candle body on the 3 day charts with 160k volume.  It was basically a Maginot line. If it had broken below we were doomed. My TA based on this and other lines, tea-leafs, moon-cycles, chants etc proved pretty instructive. There were traders aplenty at all price points above $1. THere were serious shenanigans going on when the price was $3-$15. I remember when it broke $5 the manipulator (aka the trader with the most money) probably got slaughtered. Wow incredible to think you would run such a site and be so careless. And to run it from the US too is just comical. Eventually the drug-cartel/gangs will set-up shop and amateur hour will be over. Selling wholesale product at street level prices with limited risk = no brainer. I hear in Argentina, Argentines think the peso SUCKS. Thread title gave me a good laugh. Of course you are right but the lizard brain won't listen. Do you think a degenerate gambler has never heard that the house has them in the long run? The history of the American railroads is one of endless cons and swindles, but the railroads were built. At the end of the day, capital is going to flow into bitcoin from people who will never see a return, so I guess what I am telling you is to not worry and let fools be fooled. Someone answered it already but to expand this to the sci-fi edge of possibility, there has been talk of non-human intelligence programs being able to remain alive by performing a task to exchange for bitcoin. Like an autonomous taxi that performs a service for bitcoins then buys gas and maintenance in order to continue it's hard-coded "purpose".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4PAMFPo5Yhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Agents On another time scale you could ask the very opposite question. Ask depth is abysmal.
They have been calling for a Canadian housing collapse for a long long time. I drive around Vancouver all day and I can assure you there is no slow down on construction. As long as rich Chinese are concerned about the safety of their wealth within China they are going to look to Canada, AUS, California housing as a safe haven. They are even buying up farm land in Saskatchewan because it gives a decent return and keeps their $$$ away from possible confiscation.  The only downside is it gives large holders a safe way to hedge and take profits. Any large business that accepts bitcoin will enjoy using coin to short and immediately capture the value of the coins they accepted as payment. This solution is much better than using a processor because it would be cheaper. The upsides are pretty obvious, one being it will attract speculators who are going to have a boner trading the volatility.  The next few days will be critical for bitcoin. Everything is based on risk/reward. If someone gave you 3-1 on a coinflip you would accept it instantly, but you could easily lose. Moreover, if they demanded you wager your entire net worth, the math would direct you to decline the offer. The TA seems to be back on track after our prolonged slide. I feel pretty bullish. If I traded I might go speculatively long here. We broke through the top of the trend channel on OCT 12 and after the pop and re-trace failed to touch the channel bottom. Now we sit in the same spot as OCT 11 and we have some spikes though the resistance level on low volume. Simply put, bitcoin works. I've been looking at VPN, seedbox and usenet providers lately and many of them take bitcoin like it isn't some esoteric oddity. Always a safe play to buy into 2nd most unaffordable market in the world.  As most alts can only be traded back to crypto they are sort of a collective pool of BTC. It will attract speculators like crazy.  Alts have diluted capital flow into BTC. Perhaps just fool's money, but imagine if all the cash that went into DOGE et al. went into BTC. Looks like we are gonna roll over again.   Yes the volume was massive but I see no rally. I actually see sort of a stalemate between bulls and bears, so maybe some more months of tedious sideways (in)action.   Wait, you are bullish, wat? The buying pressure is what made me suspicious. Usually a wall like that spooks the whole market and the price runs lower but this was different. I had a hard time believing that kind of money was sitting on the sidelines, but I hope you are right because yes, then those were cheap coins. This "The Bear WHale is dead" meme is unsettling. This could easily be an epic bull-trap. What's interesting is days destroyed is basically at zero. All the coins being moved to exchanges to be sold are probably very new. The theory Chinese miners are selling to get their money offshore denominated in USD is pretty interesting. I will keep coming back to BurtW's post on mining breakeven costs based around energy, which projects a mid October price of $233. If miner's are selling there comes a price point where buying is more cost effective than mining. I could see a bottom around $250.  Now here's an interesting bit of speculation regarding our price slide.http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/19/bitbeat-more-pain-for-bitcoin-prices-are-chinese-miners-to-blame/ This is true, but the concern I have is the powers that be do not want decentralised systems. That said, if google et al release their own coins backed by their stock value bitcoin would very quickly be useful as a trading proxy, and serve as a commodity "safe haven" when stocks were tanking.   Is it time for another bulltrap? Could it be LTC is an indicator?  WHat's the price point where buying coins is better than mining? We must be into that area for most miners now, the industrial sized crews still running a profit? The hashrate is in a BUBBLE, and so much of the mining environment reeks of endless scams. 
The argument that bitcoin is grossly overvalued is not outrageous. LTC continues to evade my understanding. If that $465 wall gets taken then,    Well you dont pay tax on bullion bought in Canada.  Sell mining bonds to idiots. Such a bizarre market for the last few months. No I am ignorant and a moron. 1) Place asks and bids at btce +/- $500.2) Wait3) Profit Hope so....The "big buy" (4k btc) was squashed. Sellers abound. I could see us go sideways or creep low into the new year.   I posted this before but I think it deserves a re-post. Check mining spec forum for full thread.Basically it implies bitcoin can be considered over-valued but if difficulty continues to ramp we should hit 1k by January.  For early adopters, bitcoin was most definitely that. Creating a mining farm in a middle eastern country as a foreigner who doesn't speak the language and where the temperature is consistently over 100F would probably be 10 times harder than starting one in Washington State or Texas where kw/h costs are around 5 cents. Market not spooked by this wall at all. This is pretty weird considering how nervous people have been. In an unrelated aside, days destroyed is at a absolute minimum: old coin owners are happy to hodl.  She wants to pop, I can feeeeeeeeeel it. C'mon $2m market order one time!! Newegg.ca giving 30% discount on bitcoin orders over $500.  Events that are foreseeable by all, of which everyone will draw the same conclusion, can probably only be acted upon in a contrarian manner. But I too have noticed that the bitfinex orderbook has changed since the last downswing. The orderbook both ways is much smoother with a wider spread. It's at least food for thought. We can see $450 easily. 
If bitcoin becomes part of the global financial system then there would be incentive to support the network even at break-even or even a small loss. Gold must be stored and guarded, fiat must be moved around by armoured truck and guards etc. no different. Good post on reddit attempting to guestimate where the rotting longs on bitfinex will see a margin call.http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2dag4l/bfx_margin_call_watchand_calculations/ Just don't bring out the Wat lady....whatever you do. They have realized the Fed is a blight on the heart of 'Merica but can't undermine the Fed/Goldman/MS troika without spilling the apple-cart. Gotta go stealth-mode. Three cheers for the 3-letter agencies!! If this is true then the next bubble will be incredible. Ya. Old coins raced to sell off into +800. Basically it helps me be optimistic we aren't in for a huge dump.  THey are making deals with bitcoin payment processors or retailers like Dell, imo. editThe first large spike should be shifted a bit to the left to match up with the 1st huge selloff. Just use paper. bitaddress.org  Whenever you see a discount for using bitcoin it means someone is willing to pay more than spot for coins. This is a very good way to acquire coins off exchange. While there is some slippage in the short term, in the longer term, the market remains untouched, ie one's buying does not move the market higher. This is how the smart guys are acquiring coins right now. They are making deals with online retailers and willing to pay a slight premium over the very exchange price they are stomping with shorts. COME ON $600  I would temper your optimism by suggesting bitcoin may not be around in 15 years let alone 5. That said if it is around in 15 years you are most definitely retired.  I am going to panic sell at $400. NSA stooge. They own insane amounts of US Treasury Bills. The gold is an insurance policy against a US default. "Solving the world's problems discussing them on an Internet forum possible or not?"  But hoarding gold or silver is commonplace, so is bitcoin more like a commodity or a fiat currency?  News most certainly affected this market in the past.
Cavirtex with crazy spikes. I would pay less for tainted coins. The early acceptor merchants are quite foolish to not be holding until the ETF materializes. There is limited risk that the price of bitcoin will be less than the price at the launch of the ETF, and they could easily hedge right away by going short. As it is now they are selling coins to the very people stomping the price on Bitfinex and Bitstamp. When most of the market expects a bubble then it really is no surprise when the opposite occurs. (Or at least a sideways meandering). Yes I had this very thought. THe leverage longs are simply being milked as the price stagnates. Come on bitcoin let's bounce. A+ We are still in an uptrend imo. Y'all have been spoiled by $200 day price increases.  Because it allows people to enter into huge positions the current exchanges are unable to satisfy. In other words, the COIN etf should become the defacto pricing mechanism and all the exchanges will follow it. Most likely there will be a run up on the exchanges a week or two before the ETF launches, then a nice huge pop, followed by a massive selloff.  The worst was the retrace from the then incredible ATH of $32, all the way in slow agony to $2.  $560 We're still on the uptrend imo. Seems absurd (ie suspicious) they have not borrowed a few million then lent it out for swaps for the greatest carry trade of all time.  Above $800 is really the unknown.  Slow steady grind to 1k? Just look for high volume candles and draw lines. It may be possible bitcoin was essentially over-valued for a long time and the adoption by online players was already baked into the price. Good news now has to be of the Google, Ebay, Paypal, Amazon type variety to make an impact. Interesting post from Mining Spec forum. That god damn chart.
Agree, just price everything in USD. Can't unsee Wank Bear. ;( Why not just use bitfinex? There are futures contracts at icbit.se, and plus500 and avatrade can offer you usd based exposure.  Need ElectrisMucus.....Incomprehensible. Trading bitcoins in from her cam-show? I was thinking that eventually bitcoin holders may have to actually mine at a small loss in order to protect their coins. This would then mean bitcoin would be a depreciating asset? Once we see a leveling of the hash rate my hope is mining will return to the beginnings when individuals could run machines at home and collectively "donate" hashes for the collective. As long as enough people did this it would be effective. lol took you long enough.  Time for a dip? Difficulty beginning to bubble.   LOL Bitfinex isn't running a scam to con you out of your 6btc.  Jorge will save them. There is no doubt Jorge is just a very good troller. http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/27vq6b/why_the_large_difference_between_bitstamp_and/ci533wg Relax they are back down to 32%.  $600!! I've seen this 4k next bubble prediction from a couple of different sources. TTM       
But is the market efficient? When I thought about this it seems stupid to destroy a large drug shipment. THey should really sell it back to the cartels for a discount over production costs. This way intercepting drugs would be profitable. The weekend before the US Congress was to converse (in a positive way it turned out) on Bitcoin there was a big rally.   Selling them is a no-brainer. The US government destroying $16m of a saleable asset would be pretty outrageous to a lot of people. <tinfoilhat>The drugs go to the CIA and they get the money back quietly.</tinfoilhat> How can the auction not go for a premium over the exchanges? Buying even the minimum 3k btc block costs an 8% premium on bitstamp. I cannot see any reason why the auction would EVER sell for less than the current price, and why in the name of god would anyone buy coins from the USMS then sell them on bitstamp? headasplode.jpg They are a btc mining company not an ETF. https://www.google.ca/finance?q=dcc+asx&ei=ET2eU4joFIesiALW14HIDw Aussie Bitcoin mining company going live on Australian stock exchange.https://www.google.ca/finance?q=dcc+asx&ei=ET2eU4joFIesiALW14HIDw Lol the bitcoin market is so irrational. Gold/Silver investing really should be thought of as retaining value, rather than say, owning a speculative stock in the hope of making gains. $1 in pre-1964 coins is worth $13.5 today. $1 in pre-1964 fiat paper is still worth $1.  There may be selling pressure at $700-$1000 by those hoping to get out and break-even. These people will be suckers twice. Gold has higher premiums the smaller the size of the bullion due to fabrication costs. Ie it's easier to make 1 10z gold bar than 10 1oz coins.  I disagree. The bottom line is based on high volume bearish candles for good reason. Blitz doing his worst to moderate. Defend and encourage blatant trolls, delete the meme-spam. $625 imo.editActually we haven't even broken out of the rally trend yet.  OUCHhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/27avwr/someone_just_sold_bitcoin_at_085_btc_ouch/ Sideways in the range for a few days? All trading is about figuring out what the big players are doing, or trying to do, and exploiting them. Since they deal in large positions they are hamstrung by liquidity issues and their actions move the markets; this allows the smart smaller players to extract value from them. It's like being a sucker-fish on a whale or shark.  Next bubble at 4k then. I'll take it. HAIL SATAN
There was a big wall at $650, pretty sure it got ate. LOL....Warning - while you were reading 821 new replies have been posted. You may wish to review your postWow a 10k red candle that holds above $625.....it's go time. Dat $650 wall.   So much of the altcoin community is about making the founder's rich. After that it is the hopeful masses who missed the bitcoin train and are playing the roulette table of crypto currency. The fundamental importance of any crypto is hash-rate strength. Bitcoin is absolute magnitudes ahead of all the alts. The bitcoin network is 100 times more powerful than 500 of the world's super computers combined.No alt comes close. What's interesting is the downtrend (although already broken) would have converged on June 5th. Someone might have front run the rally and bought early. Bitcoin is required for those side chains..... On the longer time frame we broke the down trend early and sitting above a resistance level. Imo the rocket is on the launch pad. That FB app might actually work well. People owe each other money all the time so now you can badger them over FB and ask for bitcoins. $560 is support level imo. We busted the long term down trend at $480 and smashed though $560 pretty readily. There has been some resistance to $600, testing twice, but the market is at odds so we are going sideways. Next resistance point $625 so if we stay above $560 and consolidate we should see another move up.   Is that Huobi spike real? Yeah when we spiked to 1k I was more nervous than when it was going down.   Nothing else goes into bull mode like bitcoin does. CHOO CHOO. lol......so a good exit strategy is to quell a rally ready to run? Using the exchanges as the actual pricing mechanism is probably insufficient. Lage buyers were probably going OTC and shorting like hell at bitfinex. Ie keep the exchange price low, while buying from private sellers. There has been tons of good news actually, it was just being capped by the China BS. Someone trying to put a brake on the cho cho train. lol what's the name for a candle like that?
Yeah he could actually provide liquidity if a large player managed to corner the market, (like an unhappy government). Hope he has his true identity locked down tight, the world powers would probably be quick to rob him of his coins if bitcoin takes off. Well the guy who made it has made a fortune buying btc with it, so he basically pre-mined a centralised alt-coin and is running to the bank. Same difference. They had a planned economy and imposed strict societal reform. Exactly. Very easy to draw lines on a chart that seem to work until they don't. If you can get the majority of market players to believe in a TA setup then you do the opposite. imo It would just be a pre-mine. Each coin would be worth say, 1oz of gold stored in a vault and audited by a third party every x number of months. It's not an insane idea. There are ETFs that at basically the same thing such as http://www.centralfund.com/. My fear is google just does a pre-mine and backs a coin with a certain number of their shares. The GOOGLE COIN.....the coin that doesn't fluctuate madly and is instantly accepted everywhere. This is why the money has been going into start-ups as VC funding. Bitcoinica was awesome. I am surprised and disappointed no one has made a replica for one of the alt coins. Stupid leverage with a soft orderbook on the underlying market = madness. No it isn't. It means people who run Mastercard are afraid of bitcoin and are confirming it's utility by attacking it. This is the 3 day chart. I think the big money is concerned with much longer time-frames than the "day trader" reading his tea leaves 15m charts with great skill. The battle ground has been well defined by massive volume on the two big down spikes and then the test of 430 with the spike down to skin some bears. If we can stay above this $520 range and reject a re-trace we can be in business to start planning Apollo 14.  The US dollar was originally backed by physical assets. Then once people were psychologically conditioned to use  paper as currency, they left the gold/silver standard and just went on printing. This will one day be understood to be the biggest scam in the history of the world.  The simple explanation is the market had adjusted to the possibility of China locking out bitcoin well before the 15th. When there is public information about some big event in the future it will always be priced in well before the date. Anyone who decides to trade such news on the day of is an absolute fish and should stop trading. I went away for the weekend once and left my browser open. Of course the price rode my alarm settings all weekend and my neighbours were PISSED. hahaha   A ton of bids flew off buy side.... Dammmmmmmmm  Seems like a dump waiting to happen. I could see a spike below $400 but hopefully it would only be a bear trap to fleece panic sellers. Well before the SEC there were lots of things big traders were doing that eventually became illegal, but maybe your point still stands.
I meant making a bet such as "will price of Gold hit 1300 before 1200". DO these sort of derivatives exist in the financial world? Seems like good gambling. This doesn't make any sense. One should make decisions based on the current market, not "I am going to chase losses with leverage if I am wrong".  Ya seems possible. Who knows. In other news bitstamp volume non existent. They're baaaaaacccccckkkk. Big operator is obviously playing both sides of bitfinex orderbook. I confess to have failed to read beyond a few sentences but I think the premise may be correct. The price is so relatively high that to move the market a lot someone needs to be able to deposit very large sums into bitstamp. This comes with logistical and counterparty risks and someone with that much money probably would avoid that avenue all together. This is why the big money has gone elsewhere into startups and venture funds and not into the exchanges which have proven time and time again to be untrustworthy. In other words: HODL. And if I had never drank any beer I'd be retired by now. Weirdness. Scary walls appeared when we were up to $480 then ask side liquidity vanishes after a dump down to $450. Beginning to think the whole run up to 1k was due to gox shenanigans. To be more precise, last few weeks bitfinex sell side was larger in scale than buy side, this is no longer the case.From 3 days ago:  Yeah I have thought of this before. However I once compared the hash-rate between bitcoin and the rest of the alts combined (in terms of btc generation) and it was incredible how much more powerful the bitcoin network was. In other words, the bitcoin network is very secure and merging alts with it would weaken it. Fake sell walls on bitfinex looking less scary. We can always spike down to 430ish, but she looks good. The world will see many weaker currencies fail before the USD does. China and Russia seem to be getting friendly and are flirting with dropping their US T-Bills and/or dealing for oil in a currency other than the USD. To me it is the worst way to describe bitcoin because the meaning of "virtual", especially in the context of the internet implies a "non-reality" or simulation of something real.  I had a thought more miners today might be compelled to convert their coins to fiat in order to cover their substantial outlay, than say when mining was a few GPUs in a basement and one could "run the risk" of mining and holding. Since the stakes are now much higher financially, miner's will be less inclined to do this especially if they are on borrowed money, since lenders take fiat and interest waits for no man. Much of the last wave of ASIC buying was during the euphoric rise from $600 to $1000+ and as margins become more and more thin taking what one can get to avoid the consequences of a further price draw down might be the smartest thing to do. Further price-action south turns many ASICs into Commodore 64s.Thoughts? Something brewing? Has bitfinex decoupled from bitstamp and become more of its own exchange now?
 Success of crypto = no more credit? Or do you mean crypto loans will eventually be extended? The higher the price the more distributed ownership will become. Never seen much of an arb between stamp and finex before. Haven't been chart watching lately has this been common? So you are taking a $2 arb? Is there darkpool orders on bitfinex or stamp or would someone do this with a bot? Ya trader's using leverage to hold the price down. Some serious walls on bitfinex.edit images not loading.https://i.imgur.com/c4KLWhA.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/Fz5Z8BJ.png Credit cards aren't going anywhere. People live on credit. Great posts MatTheCat. How the hell does binary save space?  Sadly no. Greed is a person problem. Bitcoin attempts to create a trustless currency that cannot tempt the issuer into behaving in a manner to further their own interests. However, mining power coming into the hands of a few centralised pools is a concern. People think a 51%+ ownership of the hash-rate means the coin value would collapse, but this is only true if the operator wanted to counterfeit coins. The more-likely alternative is that they want more coins and more transaction fees. As long as they can be trusted not to subvert the network running a pool with a majority ownership of the hash-rate, the network would still be useable. Of course once one entity is granted trust, they inevitably ceed to their own greed.  How can we be close to pessimistic? Bitcoin was $100 a year ago. True despair-pessimism is a long WAY DOWN.              Dat 500k candle. God. Mega Wall Alert Actually I think the current dynamic is actually one of coins moving from the hands of very early adopters to overstock and tigerdirect for example, who then sell for fiat.  Canada does not as of now tax gambling winnings in any form, even if that revenue is generated by a professional gambler, ie a winning poker player or sports-bettor. If it is BitcoinSteve I'm going all in.

Double bottom on massive volume. https://i.imgur.com/bsG1s1U.png So this is what $750 million dollar code looks like. I've allowed myself the thought to cross my mind. He doesn't invest in technology. The guy is OLD and the last person in the world to talk down fiat considering his ridiculous mountain of paper. JUst 300% wow that sucks....   This rally will have some legs imo. 800k bitcoins need to be replaced..... fyp September? https://icbit.se/WebTrade/Trading.aspx?s=BUH4 This would be *insane*,the blunder of blunders.   Going to have to buy 700k btc on bitstamp: to the moon.
Now hopefully people understand the hodlers position of not sending their coins to third-parties. hahah oh god this made me laugh. THIS:  Protip: google search the url. I just want to see someone snap off the whole 10k. Now THAT is a wall.  Current systems are not decentralised. This is the value of the bitcoin protocol.  It would, but ETFs are not supposed to be the tail that wags the dog. The underlying asset should have solid exchange foundation and higher liquidity than the ETF itself. For this reason I highly doubt the ETF will be approved. Might have a better legal recourse if trying to sue someone for fiat than btc. I wont be surprised if the gox trading engine of fail allows negative numbers. Because they have turned the corner and become scammers.  WHy is gox even open for trading is the other question. The exchange where you can trade worthless IOUs for fun and no-profit.   Someone explained it to me rather simply. There were 3k bitcoins on the orderbooks IN TOTAL. For whatever reason an order went through for 3k coins and BOOOOOM down to $100 for a split second. Why someone bombs the orderbook like that is another question, but it probably was some sort of leverage unwind that created a domino effect. Why is gox even trading??? The exchange you can only deposit to, I mean it's laughable but unfortunately a fact. No we can always take it a step further. Below $500 I would be shocked and worried. Sub $450...  This is so very possible its not funny. I also had a nightmare where google releases a pre-mined coin backed by a million GOOG shares. I mean it would murder bitcoin over night. Easily? How? lol same site: http://seekingalpha.com/article/1986861-trade-wpcs-international-for-news-driven-swings-but-invest-for-bitcoin-revenue?source=email_rt_article_readmore The Alts serve almost as a backup to bitcoin. LTC/PPC et al are basically alternatives incase bitcoin has issues with mining centralization, SHA-256, becomes politically corrupted.  Crypto Currency in any of its forms will now forever be a means for collective value creation outside of political and corporate influences. Truly the invention of the Century.
Until I can use my coins for something I want, I will hold them. People can't buy bitcoins everywhere easily. Therefore the idea "The Public" is anyway involved in bitcoin in any sense is ridiculous. So when those coins sell for more than exchange value will the exchange prices go down? Just getting my digs in.  That's the sound of the Bears, slowly going back to their cages and closing the door. Found a gox/stamp spread difference chart on trading view. https://www.tradingview.com/e/buAkE9D7/# Their currency is collapsing. So now is a great time to go because your dollah billz be worth a lot. Look at what a good currency the peso is. Losing value like ship going to the bottom against the Almighty QE-INfinity US debt slave dollar. I expected Chinese to get into there since it is HK based. I think it just buys on moving averages. What is the btc-ars exchange anyways? Localbitcoins is implying the prices are actually pretty high. IF bitcoin is going to be used as a payment option by retailers then the price will become managed by the payment processors. The processors will be forced to trade the market and manage large positions because selling  entire lots in one shot would obviously be counter productive. In fact if you have a huge amount of bitcoin and fiat on the exchanges then "manipulating" the price would be a profitable venture. Interesting. There will be a lot of them lol.... ATMs seem foolishly expensive in light of ZipZap.  Someone notify the plunge protection team!! I was thinking in some what of an irony of an open-pit style bitcoin/fiat trading arena common during the pre computerized age. Sort of like a high limit satoshi square where guys are screaming orders around. Run it out of a country where the first world oligarchy can't set the "rules". This is true and the big difference. However a world without trust is impossible. When you get on a plane and fly somewhere you trust everyone from the pilot to the air traffic controllers not to kill you. If tulving or kitco or apmex released a ripple silver product backed by physically stored silver, I would have no problem trusting them. The issue with fiat money and financial markets is those whom you extend trust have an incentive to be disingenuous.  LOL flight from alts to MEME-COINS (ie doge) is hilarious. PPC is in a death spiral. No one is mining any asteroids any time soon.  
At a loss of 15%? Many no thanks. The cool thing bitcoin has going for it is there is no premium for fractional bitcoins. A gram of gold costs you a terrible premium of like 20% over spot value. I see a market in ripple (or colored bitcoins) to digitize gold and other assets. Did they look like this? Weird someone keeps flashing buy orders on btce then taking them away.  This is a passive way to trade the market in general. Just put buy and sells 20% or so above and below the market price and order some cigars. You could also scale orders, increasing the sizes of your orders the further you move from spot. A simple bot can automate this easily. This is a feature in many respects. WAT? Seriously. BTCE isnt shady?? No one even knows the people who RUN IT. Gox has proven to be a total joke, and the Chinese exchanges are running on technical loopholes in defiance of their government with zero trade fees. As for Slovenia the banking industry is shaky. SO GTFO euro scum. I will be selling my block eruptor to the Smithsonian for $1m in 2020. Ya but I think it will rally when they go for more than spot. 25M order elsewhere would incur incredible slippage so the price should reflect that. What I dont understand is how the SEC will approve this when the underlying market is a shady Chinese exchange, a shady Russian exchange, a shady Japanese exchange, and Bitstamp (less shady but still in Slovenia). I posted a while back that the price may have already risen to its speculative maximum. Ie the price already had all this "good news" priced into it in anticipation. Now we must work through a period of proving that assumption. Yeah I have become interested in ripple. I mean I'd rank ripple ahead of all the alt-coins in terms of utility. Community issued money is getting a revival apparently. Ripple seems like an electronic and extremely cheap way for communities to issue and use their own currency and develop closed loop economies. But why have we not seen any cool developments with Ripple?   look at btce eur/usd market. Its like 200 pips lower than the fx markets.  Well something is brewing in China. Volume has gone back up again at Huobi. OKCoin LTC/CNY suddenly ramps.  I think I got trolled by btce trollbox. lol news out of china, going north. What price point would be break-even for you? You should sell me some GHs for 0.001btc and then laugh at how dumb I am then. Obviously cex.io is ridiculous. However you make assumptions in the second part as if  the parties involved can see the future. A miner selling GH to a real market would be hedging his outlay against a horrible rise in difficulty. He sacrifices potential profit to guarantee a return he can live with. There are other ways to hedge  with futures and options, but the market is illiquid and reliant on 3rd parties. If a buyer lived somewhere where electricity rates were ludacris, buying GH would be his only option to mine. Maybe he lacks the technical skills to operate a miner. Or he cannot acquire and build a miner in a time-frame quick enough to satisfy his predictions of coming difficulty increases. There are lots of incentives for buyers and sellers of GH to arrive at a fair price for both. 
https://www.coinpayments.net/ Yes I have been thinking of this too. We are still at the early cycles of bitcoin expansion contraction. In any dynamic where money is ridiculously easy to obtain, participants will multiply: thus the massive jumps in difficulty. I expected a "miner squeeze" when ASIC emerged but I was very wrong. Perhaps such a contraction needed a further run-up and will emerge in the near future. lol ripple. Agree in principle with op. Bitcoin can go way down. 1k has been rejected a number of times now. Loaded mention that there are two groups painting ta signals. Probably means they will clear 4 cfds a day. So they will deal 8 hour contracts. With Overstock taking bitcoin I was thinking that Amazon would be smart to buy Bitpay as a means to get into the payment processing business and try and give Ebay-PayPal a black eye. The HUGE problem that comes up is China's "ban" or at least very negative stance to bitcoin, prevents overstock or any online giant from using bitcoins to pay their suppliers, who of course will be largely Chinese.  I mean in dire circumstances DOS attacking a pool to defend the network might be the last resort.  Could a situation arise where bitcoin holders might have to mine at as loss just to defend their bitcoins? Is this ever a possible outcome or would they just all panic sell? At this point bitcoin would be a depreciating asset. editTo continue to talk to myself, if people panic sold at such a juncture, the price would collapse and difficulty would follow....hmmmm Could a true GHs exchange be developed? Cex.io owns the whole sell side. (lol). A true exchange would have miners able to actually sell into the exchange. Obviously they would have to be held to a contract and would only have funds freed when they had delivered their promise. Yeah the link I posted is to some cnn user created content, not a real CNN piece. Total pump and dump.  It's going to be a theme for the foreseeable future.   Bizarre story of a penny stock gold company switching to bitcoin mining and to develop an exchange; claim to have 550k bitcoins already!!  http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1074434?ref=feeds/latestPump and Dump?   http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-11/overstocks-first-day-bitcoin-130000-sales-840-transactions-ceo-stunned Their margin is 2%. CEO said btc was attractive because it's frictional cost is lower than credit card.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-12-28/overstock-ceo-bitcoins-gold-austrian-economics-and-zombies uhhh ohhhh This Mars One thing looks like a scam. No WAY a private, crowd/reality tv show funded, company puts anyone on Mars ever. Lol someone should make QEcoin. No coin cap. Inflates at 80 billion coins a month. We need to break out from 960 which we are testing for the 3rd time. ...or fine art....or Copper Penny hoards. Bitcoin I thought was a given.   You had me excited but 900CAD is 826 in 'Merica
Wont this cause everyone to rush to hard assets like gold and real estate? I am sure there is more margin to be sacrificed at the production/re-seller end of things. If there is greater demand, the cost to produce will drop and so forth.  Sadly though, consolidation of the hash-rate into the hands of larger and larger companies seems inevitable. This has changed my view of  LTC which is more resistant to such conglomeration. Bitcoin was more enjoyable when a bunch of nerds were risking fires in their basement cranking out hashes with GPUS.     Even if we grant you these grievances, Bitcoin is better than any currency issued by any government in Latin America. Smart. Easy to deposit hard to withdrawl equals more rake. Since bitcoin price is largely speculative might we have reached the upper limit of pricing until real usage confirms said speculation? Wall street interest was forseen and now we have to go sideways or down for confirmation of actual utility.  Well I am glad they are selling. NO WAY these go to an exchange when we have Second Market and Fortress acquiring coins. Bitcoin is probably the most psychological asset out there, it's all perception based at the moment.  The alts all in step with Bitcoin on the way down.  Good article ripping this stock:http://seekingalpha.com/article/1929901-Irrational-Bitcoin-Buzz-At-WPCS-International-Why-Its-A-Sell So you think Btc-e has a 0.1% chance of going down and you need insurance for this? lol. Want some insurance for walking across the street tomorrow? You can go ghetto rich and buy a Ferrari from 1991.http://vancouver.en.craigslist.ca/van/ctd/4269042289.html Zimbabwe dollars come to mind. Or us silver certificates but they are still legal tender, but different at least than fed notes. In canada our homegrown Walmart Canadian Tire rebates you at the till with Canadian Tire Money and are serialized. Easily. Volume on this rally is pretty weak. The historical perspective is exponential growth. But why isn't bitfinex just cornering this lending market and borrowing much USD a they can and lending out at these incredible rates? They disappear until there is a correction. Then they reprice the new "low" and then disappear for a while.... lol I made that ages ago just as a joke. $6 arb between bitfinex and stamp. Not huge but I have never seen it differ by more than a dollar or two. Shorts getting squeezed.    100k ltc buy smacked down. PPC and NMC on the move.
http://bitcoin-analytics.com/under depth. The problem is they have a marketplace where they own almost the entire sell side.  An exchange is a meeting place where buyers come to be matched up with sellers, not where a seller dumps their wares for more than they are worth. There is no price discovery here. They sell ONLY because it is more profitable than mining, which they are doing anyways. Haha good point. Someone has to 51% one of these coins one day.   Someone just put in a BTC buy order up to 1500 that's all. 2011 edition. CHOO CHOO I have been paying attention to LTC/BTC. I have heard some pro-LTC comments from non-retards on this board so am watching it carefully. Who lead the little rally yesterday?? Was it LTC? The LTC chart was much more bullish than the BTC chart at the time.   Still can't believe that idiot didn't have his coins spread out or even in a brain wallet. The best outcome for the coins is they are sold at auction. I really doubt these coins would be sent to gox and then sold off in a huge A-Bomb. The US government may be inept at many things but they would be smart enough to get a good price for their coins. The worst outcome would be they become property of the NSA/CIA/FBI/FED. This is my new Holder's Manifesto, going to pull it out any time some muppet starts going on about how buying and holding is foolish versus trading.  A lots of recent bitcoiners are fully aware of the early adopters and how they have made fortunes relative to their initial investment. The key here is those early investors put down small sums which were basically fliers on the potential of a nice return. More recent investors are not in this same position. They should be limiting their investment to the same dollar figure they would have been willing to commit if they had come across bitcoin in 2010-2011, NOT "If I had bought 1000 bitcoins in 2010 I'd be rich, time to buy 1000 bitcoins to make up for that missed opportunity." Going from $1 to $800 is WAY different than $800 to $6400. If traders are not exploiting defects in the trading system itself (which is actually a "feature" on the NYSE where elite participants have better access than everyone else) then there really is no argument. A manipulator that can influence the market because he has more coins or fiat than other's is not reason to cry foul. It is also a misnomer to think a large trader negatively affects the smaller; the smaller must set his mind to figuring out what the big trader is doing and to front run him. The big trader is handicapped by his size and will move slower, unravel trades over longer time frames, thus he is the shark that suffers the irritation of a thousand sucker-fish. Of course he accepts this as long as he can get his fill.This said, faking volume is perhaps fairly nefarious, stopping this however is almost impossible as long as the multiple accounts are under different names and different IP addresses. The exchange would have a very hard time proving this beyond being able to provide "circumstantial evidence" of suspicious trades. Good LTC chart here: https://www.tradingview.com/e/Y43ETJHk/ U mad? LTC/BTC on the move. No one has mentioned overstock's stock, jumped at bitcoin news:https://www.google.ca/finance?cid=672821 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0cliffs:Guy gets drunk and posts on bitcointalk mis-typing "holding" and a new meme is born. hahahhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=387930.msg4196914#msg4196914 This seems to be the most important part of the article. China price has caught up with Stamp. Last time these two came together they diverged to the downside. My hope is BTCChina is back in the driver's seat and we see a huge rally from China to Choo Choo past the gox price.
Lol this is all hindsight.  Volume sucks.  Everything happening now is noise. If you actually look at the bids on gox, most of the 40m on the orderbooks are bids below $5....... I'm a moron.Actually they lead the rally and the arb spread between BTCChina and other's narrowed quickly. Getting scammed out of 60 coins.....  Ohhhhhhhh can't sleep. Discovered CNY exchange huobi.com did 61k volume last 24 hours. Very volume. http://btckan.com/price#type_exchange_cnyhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1tinga/why_huobi_has_higher_volume_than_btcchina_and/ $20 pop on 31 btc volume. LOL. What was Pirateat40 paying?? Great Scot! Did you go to 2015 in the DeLorean?? Paying for their 51% ASIC mega farm. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, is a good quasi fictional book about Jessie Livermore who won and lost fortunes in the 20s and 30s before any SEC prohibited various manipulation tricks we currently see with bitcoin trading. Coins stacking up on ask side. Boo anemic volume.   Ya help me out with reading between the lines. So much wisdom!!!http://hypron.net/bitcoinwisdom.html So to speculate to what purpose one moves a ton of old coins.Option 1: Moved to exchange. Uh oh spagettios.Option 2: Sold to private investor/second market.Option 3: Wallet house cleaning.Option 4: Buy a yacht/island. There is always the possibility of the existence of private mining enterprises not geared towards the consumer market. If you wanted to invest heavily into bitcoin (like multiple millions) buying coins is impossible without slippage. So assuming you had the technical ability you could just make yourself some serious hardware and mine like hell. 
Well looks like we are going to see if that wall @ 600 is real........  http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1tfcad/there_were_an_awful_lot_of_bitcoin_days_destroyed/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxR0TDNxm1g goxtool says $37,629,928. To manipulate last price. You will see it try to make the price seem lower or higher depending on the desires of it's owner.  Ya hodler here but I think risking 2% of bankroll on a trade is considered prudent. I suspect most bitcoin traders are risking their entire BRs at a time.http://www.forex-savvy.com/money-management/    Squeezing out long positions on bitfinex?? NOOB ALERT!! Gox orderbook looks like someone dropped an A-Bomb into the middle of it. Worked last time. This guy is either a total noob or is trying to clown the market. And it's gone.edit And it's back dizzam..calling bull whales, there's a ton of bitcoin for sale with no slippage.

More and more traders with experience should come flocking soon enough.  Gonna keep an eye on Bitfinex, they are run out of Hong Kong which enjoys a certain level of freedom from that of mainland China. lol http://capitaloption.com/Proceed with caution but you can "get a 'free' bitcoin".edit -- looks like they are based out of Cyprus. 
 I swear I just saw a 2 satoshi buy order float past on btcwisdom. Actually I think I recall him announcing market moves in the past... This time it will be different?   There are hedge funds that are smaller that would probably take the risk. Especially if they were new and needed a nice +25% earnings print for advertising purposes. It is of course, hard to "hedge" bitcoins with any scale. I suspect this will be the first option investment banks will be offering, along with general insurance against a total collapse of the network. You must be rich having been a bear since $2. It's been wrong every time thus far. The short squeeeeeeezzee. Can still go back down once the juice has been extracted. This is why leverage is so dangerous. Big players can manipulate the underlying asset. Honeybadger!!!!!!!!!!! Dat sell side wall coming in to quell this little rally. Maybe the answer to this is coming soon........BTC China told CoinDesk it is expecting to reinstate deposits in RMB soon. Bobby Lee said he is now working with another third party payment company to try and reinstate RMB pricing, and is hoping to make an announcement on the Weibo account in the next few hours.This will now be the firms third payment provider relationship inside a week. Lee brushed off worries that the new relationship could also be placed in jeopardy by PBOCs most recent move.If this keeps happening, ten times later, will I keep going? I dont know. I cant predict the future. But for now were going to try one more time, to see, he said.http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-falls-btc-china-exchange-shuts-fiat-deposits/ If they have friends or family offshore then it's easy. Of course now that BTCCHina is dealing the lowest price they would be losing $$. Place a bid at 580 which is just above the most recent low. We will probably bounce off that if we go that far south. Tons of people must have been burned bad buying mining rigs. Ya here's a mind boggling explanation of how they were doing this with copper.......http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-05-23/bronze-swan-arrives-end-copper-financing-chinas-lehman-event http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z9Jwp2x86o Won't there be some Chinese trying to buy bitcoin to move them off-shore or as a store of value? Burn the Troll. Realistically we want governments to oppose bitcoin believe it or not. Then we can have a nice contest over which is better, fiat or bitcoin. Silkroad 2.0.
I think we need to go below $800 for that.  It's true but it won't be true forever. That's the issue. Human's can't continue on their unquenchable consumption of resources forever. And going to Mars isn't the answer for "more".http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9JkagAeRo I'm looking at this picture and all I can think is "why the F would we want to go there?" Obvious joke not obvious? Mastermind criminals can get anything done from anywhere. You a gringo ex-pat or native of the country? I have been contemplating an eventual escape somewhere cheaper....Thailand, Argentina being front-runners.   http://coinsight.org/#reddit Hmmm spread looking pretty wide atm. Spread as in the difference between exchanges?? Remember a few days ago when all the exchanges were in step with each other? That was a buy signal. As gox gets further from the pack the opportunity to perform profitable arbitrage emerges thus opening us up to a re-convergence of prices. Gox prices are high because its hard to withdrawal, and btce 's are low because its hard to deposit and hard to trust. I wonder if they ever considering mining.  lol ya'll need to relax Man btc-e is the place to trade btc..... China rolling over... http://live.bitcoinindex.es/ How I stopped worrying and loved the swongs, new movie coming out I hear. Even at 50% retrace?  They crashed harder than btc but also went up faster on the rebound.  Not sure how relevant 2011 data is anymore, might have to adjust it by volume in usd. So why are the exchanges suddenly in step with each other?
Amazingly it took 11 posts before someone nailed it. So says the btc-e troll box.   Ya but quarks are a pre-mine scam.  Lots of these exist. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Spring_dollar The spring is coiled. How would "meddling" in the market make the market "unfree"...... Check out:  https://icbit.se/WebTrade/Trading.aspx?s=BUH4That's the march contract, highest volume contract on the site. The spread between Gox Price and March contract has been of interest to me. Currently trading "only" $120 over current gox price, when it had been trading as high as $2000, when gox was ~$1200, ie an $800 difference.Icbit.se FAQ: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=164255.0 Futures have collapsed, dealing only +120 above spot when it had been dealt like +800 at the top. This is a job for Satoshi, everyone else would be under funded. JP Morgan tried a similar thing during the crash of 1929 and got his ass handed to him. lol is this correct, that's like 20% vig.  Everyone would starve to death..... The bottom is when everyone is in total despair and everyone has written off bitcoin as nothing more than a billion dollar experiment gone sour. So $4 by tomorrow? The good news is the 2 month chart is dominated by massive sell candles and we are above $800. But who knows how low this sinks. The media is good at turning a story around....Going below $800 could trigger further downside.   Wow someone has profited 1700 btc this month on icbit.sehttps://icbit.se/WebTrade/Top.aspx Be very careful leveraging in either direction. Market can swing both ways massively.  Smarter and smarter groups with big money is emerging and hunting for n00b stops will become common. Is it possible to get a wire from say stamp or gox, sent to a third party in my name to a country I do not reside in? I am more interested in the Chinese New Year. Jan 29th. Yes, this is the fallacy I was refering to. Litecoin going to continue to inflate versus btc. Already 2x more coins, and will grow at a nice steady clip. Also: http://ltc.block-explorer.com/address/LTpYZG19YmfvY2bBDYtCKpunVRw7nVgRHW
It's this chart, it's been free money since I first saw it when bitcoin was $3.  Man the scam coins being pumped are truly annoying. Why would someone think we need 10 versions of bitcoin? Noobs are playing a game they chose to play. Most of them aren't even aware they are playing a game. All market based trading is a zero-sum game. Someone has to lose when someone else wins. Either accept it or go play some Co-Ed Volleyball where they don't keep score. So media phase was last week, so we are now at the top, so thus, we can then conclude sub 100 by next week.   Interestingly, Alderney grants sports-betting licenses to off-shore books. Pinnaclesports.com, the market leader, has a license from them. Trust me, 99 times out of 100 I would agree with you. Speaking of alts, someone bought 1m PPC today. http://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/btce/ppcbtc Just because there is a huge sell side order doesnt imply downside. It could be viewed as a good price for a whale. This is based on prior market moves. I believe we have switched gears forever. Fiat was created in good conscience, then once everyone is psychologically conditioned to trust it's value they removed the hard assets backing it and are free to print themselves unlimited money. Creators of alt coins all have the vested interest of pre mining themselves money then hoping it becomes adopted.  I have seen this criticism leveled at PPC. This is ridiculous to me, but that's me.  Idiot's who blow 15m whatever,  I could easily retire on 1m in the west and far less in Thailand or India.    This is very possible.  We could be at the same stage as the first bubble. Can you buy 100m in btc? Not easily. Is it probable one person wishes to do so? 100% yes. Actually it stabilizes the price of bitcoin. Imagine only btc....we would be at mars by now with epic bubbles. I have heard some intelligent comments that defend ltc.  If the alts can be integrated with btc somehow, they can serve a purpose. Ltc has yet to bubble crash the way btc has, if ltc sees a large correction the RACE to btc will be massive creating an unbelievable bull run. Be VERY careful with ltc. Got stopped out in the bitcoinica days. I think for about 18 btc. That was the end of my trading adventure. Ya my mom has been telling me since I told her about bitcoin at about 100. Obviously she doesn't get it along with almost everybody.  I will admit I have had small inklings to cash out a 5th of my holdings which would give me 3600% roi on my initial investment..... Well LTC is $34 and BTC is $1050....Silver is $20 an oz and Gold $1200....So it basically is. Chodpapa put the ratio at 1/(e^4) or 0.018, perhaps he was wrong, or perhaps a huge correction is imminent. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=259385.msg2789856#msg2789856. Litecoin has no shorting mechanism at all, and binfinex doesn't count. I wish i had gotten into LTC having forseen the psychological narrative of "buying the cheaper one", but I was too chicken.  "The mining situation" meaning, or was this intentionally cryptic? LTC seems like a cheap copy where the creator has been able to benefit immeasurably off the back of genius. That said, I agree with your sentiment. Any opinion on weighting LTC to BTC holdings? 
Must be rigged, like every NFL game someone lost money wagering on. Just got home from work and phone went through the laundry so no updates until now, JFC. The Irrational Exuberance Index is at an ATH. Some pretty huge futures volume (for icbit.se @ $10 a contract). March contracts are trading $500 over gox spot and when I looked last week it was just over double. The issue is getting fiat and then investing it for some return when bitcoin as an investment is just magnitudes better than even producing cocaine. I could buy gold, but golds utility is almost zero. Going to be a lot of people home from work destined to become millionaires trading their bitcoins. Pulls me back to my online poker days when the holiday donkfest was nothing less than a goldmine.  fyp People mis-understand OP. He wants to buy insurance against a bitcoin collapse. So he pays a premium upfront to win a huge USD payout if it collapses. lol a 40 btc buy moved the price $25, plus500 gonna get rapededitlooks like they have gone to a daily cdf...good move Well the ETF will allow shorting unlike that available with any other platform. btce requires $10 effective balance to chat in trollbox now haha. Priced out so many trolls. Ya seems almost like someone had filled the order book on the buy side then dropped bids and sold. That was a big drop for such low volume. Me too.Then again if they had asked me at $5 I would have said the same thing and been totally wrong. Because you have 50million dollars and its hard to get that down at MtGox. Get into the alt-coin game for lols. That's even better than a double rainbow. BTCChina with massive sell walls.... Market is weird for the last few days. Obviously there s a lot of good speculative news which bears might be waiting on to sell into the new money. For some bizarre reason gox had about 10m come into the order books to put it to 35m, all the while their volume now down to 1/3rd market share. I think buyers have parked bids deep into order books and gonna wait for bears to come down out of their caves to get it. When you switch between USD/BTC you don't see the % of increase or decrease change.
I think its the east indian kid on bicoinity.  Prob old news to this thread but supertroopersmotherofgod.jpghttps://blockchain.info/tx/1c12443203a48f42cdf7b1acee5b4b1c1fedc144cb909a3bf5edbffafb0cd204 Tempted to sell a 5th of my holdings to become the PPCOIN MANIPULATOR!! Yes I am surprised by the price action. When I woke up and checked the charts I didn't really believe this rebound was real. Look at the volume on the way down vs on the way up. Increased on the way down and is decreasing on the way up. The last 5 volume buy bars are pretty even, so it looks like there might be a large whale slowly accumulating, which might prove to be costly when he stops. It's from the icbit.se site.  icbit.se leaderboard. Dayyyumm. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=183430.0 Buy the rumour sell the news. The senate thing was a classic example. Yes most of this board is the noise of arguing for some reason; but so much of every forum is dominated by such things. Gox needs some credit having improved their trade engine greatly.  This is how to do it kids. hahahahha Count that mofo a GREEN CANDLE!! Lol shorts just got paid big Wow you need to re-charge your brain. Evil speculators are the only reason you made your post, because without them bitcoin would still be IRRELEVANT and nerds would still be buying pizzas for 10,000btc. I agree with you that bitcoin is more important than getting rich, and this process of eclipsing the USD by an utter magnitude is proof positive that the philosophical position is the correct one. If bitcoin can't survive this terrible run-up then it's DOOMED anyways.  They are just running arbs with their family or friends. Well I have no words.   LOL Coin shortage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Time to take a run at gold parity. Feel bad for goldbugs who have been waiting for THE MOON their whole lives only to see it happen in a digital gold. LOL. omg this is gold. Wow crazy. btc-e troll box on fire. I laugh every time I load that site. If you live close to the border there are many companies state side that will accept packages on your behalf and you can just go pick it up and pay them $5. Gox goxxingeditand its back. No, this will have much longer legs. The half-witted public is about to get involved. Sell wall has shown up. Ya this could get stupid. Bitcoin-Mania is on the launch pad. Nothing like this has ever happened in the history of the world. Well this is ridiculous. "Price" no longer relevant to buyers. When ATMs are more common you will be able to put USD into the machine then PAY someone elsewhere in bitcoin without even having to deal with the technical issues of bitcoin itself. The depositor option will be on the machine itself, maybe as a send to option, or just an email address linked to a BTC address. This will remove the learning curve for the average user who simply needs to send some USD across borders and doesn't understand or give two winks about bitcoin. editMoreover lets say you send someone some money overseas from such a machine to their address. Then you privately tell them the password over email or text message. So then they can go to any of these machines, put in the password, and withdraw fiat. The underlying process is completed with bitcoin but neither party is really aware of it. The Gold Bitcoin parity meme will be the obvious discussion. Advantage bitcoin. Hide yo kids hide yo wife hide yo bitcoins cause the Chinese buying every one. 27m USD on orderbook brah. Bots on gox are raging. Agree, my mom has been telling me to sell since $100. Good point ty. Bitcoin Days Destroyed not as high as previous ATH at $266. Less coins coming out of cold storage to sell into this rally?? https://blockchain.info/charts/bitcoin-days-destroyed?timespan=1year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=7&show_header=true&scale=0&address= Has it not occurred to anyone that if you wanted to buy a ton of bitcoins without steaming the price you could open an exchange with zero fees to attract bitcoins into your bids?? The great LTC to BTC rotation.    
Why take a  5% arb when bitcoin goes up 5% a day anyways?? This is Wall Thread 2.0 as well. The original was locked at 1200 pages. A smart guy would get into the luxury goods business or start a supercar dealership and accept bitcoin. At this rate there is going to be a LOT of rich nerds out there. $25 million on Gox on orderbook vs 12k BTC. ATH and ATL respectively. If Gox USD issues are as real as people say, the PANIC buying to move out BTC at considerable loss could be epic. Looks like this is buying in anticipation of the Senate hearing which big players are betting will be bullish. Ya I thought this too. I watched their spread vs the orderbook a few times and it appeared to me they weren't even watching the depth, so you really could wait for a thin buy or sell side on gox and go short or long respectively.  You could also wait for large spreads between gox and bitstamp and go short gox price with plus500 and long bifinex or avatrade and basically  play the percentages of an eventual convergence. This times 100. Go get a loan vs your silver and buy bitcoins.Pawnup.com If bitcoin suffered a technical failure then litecoin would most likely suffer it in an identical manner.   Why think when you have a graph? Vancouver seems to be a bitcoin hot-bed, ATM, bitcoiniacs brokerage etc, so by proxy Canadian market is very aware of bitcoin and could just be overly bullish. Early on the Canadian market lagged because the only bitcoiners there were miners using cheap electricity and were net sellers. Don't you get crushed by their high fees? Volume is king IMO. In a bull market large sell-offs will have mild effect and vice-versa. Look at the 2 month chart. There were 3 huge sell-offs that trumped the green candles by considerable degree and the market went higher. Indicators are basically "of the past", and bitcoin is infantile, so market forces can change quickly, reducing them to nothing but tea-leaves in the wind. That said, if enough people make decisions based on these indicators, and they do, it creates a self-fulfilling "reality", until it doesn't.  Maybe the ATM is seeing some weekend buyers. Warren is basically a Luddite.   You could just as easily theorize that people will sell bitcoins to raise fiat funds to buy presents. All markets are almost impossible to trade in short time-frames, bitcoin perhaps the worst. Ya I meant something ridiculous like bitcoinica was. It was more gambling than trading. The BTC-E trollbox suggests the average litecoin traders would welcome 10x leverage. Many wealthy Chinese are also nervous about their government's policy.  Bitcoin is a wonderful way of hiding your assets from a government.  Someone needs to get a bitcoinica clone going for litecoin.
Does it?? Because I posted about a convergence on Nov 7th ITT and guess what, BOOOOOM. Case in  point back in May I had run out of fiat due to my job and an injury that kept me from work for a while. Needed about $1000. I could have sold 10 coins but I decided to borrow from the bank. It's cost me about $6 a month and those 10 coins are now worth $4000+.  Will be interesting to see if the etf becomes the price leader as it will be the quickest and easiest way to move usd into bitcoin exposure. Not bad. I wrote about this before but bitcoin is not on a linear scale. Obviously the price can move in a linear fashion, but that is mere short term error. If you think about bitcoin's exposure to the rest of the world it will be on an exponential scale for at least the discernible future. The current psychology of the bitcoin trading market is primed to believe in massive corrections, so we are now going to have a head-less chicken style conversation about "calling the top". But previous price action and current price action may not have much relation because the underlying market forces can grow at incredible scale, and render past data simply noise. Imagine the market forces to be water flowing through a pipe. In entrenched markets like say the Gold Market, the variables are well understood, the market participants more or less constant, and the price rises and falls with increases or decreases in pressure. But if bitcoin, being in its infancy, finds its pressure rising to test the strength of the pipe, will just replace the pipe with a bigger one. And this replacement, this increase, need not be bound by linear rules, the pipe can increase 10x over night.  Ya you are a noob, after a while you learn bitcoin is a yo-yo and worrying about the price all the time is torture.  Just-dice.com has more btc in investment than gox has on the orderbooks........ At what point do the gox fiat holders freak out at the diminishing bitcoin orderbook and just panic buy to get out? Time to put some gas on this fire. bitcoinity has a sound alarm under preferences. Just don't forget to close the browser window or when you go away for the weekend because your neighbours will hear it the whole time and freak on you when you get back............   AM I seeing things? Gox and Stamp nearly equal in price. Beware the bear trap!!! This market just switched gears, just as it did at $5 and $20 and so forth. Forget the previous price action, it's all irrelevant. Smarter and smarter money is moving into bitcoin and much of it will have trading experience behind it, don't lose your bitcoins chasing waterfalls. The 4h chart on bitcoinwisdom is just unreal. No one ever predicts sideways.  In any case this seems ridiculously bullish.  But they have by far the most liquidity. If we are getting into the second wave of interest by the public, then I really could see a LTC rally happen. Bitcoin's price is "too high", but there is this litecoin, "which is the same as bitcoin but like silver to gold and will be worth 1/4th of bitcoin because there will be 4x of them and they are only 2.5 USD and if you bought bitcoins at $2.5 you would be rich now".  Whoa since when did Virtex run almost in line with Gox? They were constantly the lowest price around. Or maybe that is the answer, EVIL arbitrageurs got their money into Virtex.editAlso didn't realize Cad had lost some value to usd. Virtex btc effectively = to btc-e price. Litecoin is in rally mode. Just now touching the last high made a few weeks ago with very high volume. Usually litcoin up = bitcoin down and vice-versa.edit: btc-e troll box is always amusing. The only threat is a weakness in the crypto or some hard-fork/double spend. Everything else is a detail in the long term. The market has been moved by $5 to $10 million dollar purchases and these bucket shops have no where near that kind of liquidity.  This isn't like the hilarious bitcoinica days.
How so? And losing isn't a valid reason.  1broker.com takes btc leverage 5:1 while plus500 and avatrade both deal leveraged bitcoin CDFs in fiat. Bitcoin anti-correlated to US Dollar Index.   As for the ATM, seems silly. Just run a currency exchange kiosk and sell BTC. These machines look expensive as hell and things break. There is a reason this guy's ignore button glows brightly............ Why not? Why have a 3d party auditor, when everyone can do it for you collectively?  Back in 2007 a girl at my work shows me the Apple Itouch. I am floored at this thing, the browser touch screen was just amazing. 1st thought was that the app store would be a printing press and that buying Apple stock a total no brainier. BUT NAH I look at the price and see $180 and think I can't own enough stocks @ $180. Todays price: $519 I'll stick with mad beats and poker flips.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1ZHh9gER4 But it makes no sense that if you ran bitfinex you down't go to the bank and borrow HAND OVER FIST at whatever joke QE interest rates are being offered by central crony banks, and then lend it out at insanely profitable rates to BTC shorters. Ya I have two copies of my paper btc wallets hidden in different places. One is very hidden the other is in my fridge with instructions to anyone who cleans it out upon my sudden demise. But I think I am going to buy a letter/number punch and get my keys down onto metal. Bears are embarrassed. But I am sure if we go down to 175 Blitz and ElectricMucus will make 400 posts about how smart they are. Someone needs to racist ban me because I loled. Dat wall. Time to take a shot at 200 imo.  Apparently the CNY market is leading the charge.http://thegenesisblock.com/bitcoin-climbs-highest-price-since-april-led-cny-movement/ The difficulty has gone mental. Most people have been priced out of mining. Mining is really something for someone with deep pockets, and even then they are taking a large risk not just buying coins.  Reminds me of the good old days. There are bears...they only post when bitcoin goes down. Whales be hunting for stops, market could see massive oscillations in both directions.
Debt ceiling reaction up or down is 100% psychological. There are no actual market forces here, unlike say with FX, equities, commodities. Of course, if people believe in it, it's basically true, to a point, as the bottom can fall-out much faster when something is moving on perception alone. love how CNYBTC hanging around "lucky" 888. lol...then why did gold lose value to USD over this same period?  Time to turn on bitlisten to see if we can pick up some patten of huge transfers. Neither are you. END. OF. STORY.  I have been watching the litecoin/bitcoin relationship for a while. I am pretty sure there is a big player who rotates out of litecoin when bitcoin goes up, and vice-versa. He may be playing a type of gamble hoping that if Gox takes LTC there could be a huge rally for him to sell into, so he wants to be in LTC but not at the risk of losing out on btc. The BTC-E litecoin market is very weak so big sell-offs really move the market and it's price action can be easily dominated by a single party. This up/down dynamic is actually a new development, early on ltc followed the btc price moves pretty much in step. Litecoin prospects looks grim indeed. The SR selloff saw a 350K ltc dump to 0.14 and we are just now breeching that low @ .138...... My fear is eventually crime syndicates with resources and know how that eclipses that of the hopelessly amateur DPR, will eventually set up shop on TOR and make SR look like a corner store beside Wal-mart. Planning for a sub 1% possibility is a waste of time and money. People have been calling for the end of the world forever. Inverse H&S means short term down, long term up?? The SR sell-off was pretty insane imo. The market showed its hand there and the bull is on the loose. Of course there is no answer. This market is definitely PRIMED for a huge bear trap if we see another run up however. I recall reading large investment institutions have investigated bitcoin and due to its low market cap cannot take it into consideration until it hits about $400. So if we ran up to that point most here would expect a mass sell-off but you must consider the possibility of new entrants with HUGE capital entering the market-space as it goes higher.... I think the mass psychological sentiment is that no one wants the US to fail. The problem is they have become so arrogant to assume the natural laws of economics don't apply to them, that they just might. We are either on the verge of a total power grab by world states, or the whole thing fails and people will have to discover they can run the world without the need for a "God-like" government. I suspect the former is more likely than the later due to that implied by the first sentence. People build up an image of how their lives will play out be with various goals in mind, a massive change in world dynamics threatens those goals, so they will do whatever they can to protect it, even if it means foolishly capitulating to various "demands" in the name of "security". Ie waiving their rights until it becomes too late. As for bitcoin, who knows. Because every effect must have a cause visible to you? The market moved because people bought coins.... This becomes more a myth as time goes on as we have seen $20million in volume last month. So either millionares are just parking USD @ gox for fun or they CAN get money out. See if the stock market goes to hell tomorrow like many are suggesting, and people see a rally in bitcoin, then they will conclude "bitcoin new reserve currency/ safe haven" or some such leap of logic and BUY BUY BUY.   Total impatient buying ==== moonshot. lol @ litecoin........  Just got home from work. Wowowowowow SR gone, bitcoin crashing. The only logic in selling is that everyone else is.   Yes arbitrage is definitely being performed. Checkout accumulation/distribution on Gox and BT.http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg10ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zi1gEMVzi2gAccDistzi3gRSIzvhttp://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg10ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zi1gEMVzi2gAccDistzi3gRSIzv
According to http://btckan.com/price btc100.org a chinese exchange has done 111706.36 in 24hrs.... which is hard to believe.... I didnt get a payout on the 25th for some reason. I can see it in the JSON confirmed_rewards link. Maybe old news around here but someone might be trying to front-run this.  I made a google doc that parses btckan.com and displays the CNY volume vs BTC.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjlcmguMaCvJdEdhcHItNEdVNFloQVQ3aTlCUjhpMkE&usp=sharing If people can't handle losing investments then they should not invest. If the whale had lost your attitude would be irrevocably otherwise.The site makes no surprises here. They offer high limits with 1% edge, this isn't like booking a Keno game. The issue is the whale has played a low number of high limit bets and run hot. Does anyone know his ROI? Or # of bets that he placed? No you are quite right. What is amazing is the low cost to start a high limit btc site vs that of building and running massive VIP casinos. "Of course, theres plenty of ultra high-limit baccarat to be found too. In Macaus many VIP rooms, theres baccarat, baccarat, and more baccarat. Many of them feature only baccarat tables, and even when other games are offered, theyre almost an afterthought. Alot of these rooms have limits of more than 1 million HKD per hand ($128k usd) and youll often be able to pop in, have a look around and see just why Macau is the worlds highest earning gambling destination.[1]"http://www.intensegambling.com/casinos/macau/best-baccarat/ Mo money mo problems. I was wondering then why JD has failed to achieve 1% hold having now taken 133m bets totalling 1.1m bitcoins. What odds does he play? I would expect a country adopting bitcoin as their economic backstop, would also be compelled to get into the mining game in a big way. Iceland has geothermal energy supply but their cost of kw/h is worse than the US, but not bad. Kuwait has the lowest electricity rates in the world by far at 1c a kw/hr. Someone should really start an exchange on the cayman islands actually..... Sigh I just logged out of my account and looks like my lastpass didn't save my credentials so I tried all the usual stuff but I am locked out having JUST sent a deposit. https://blockchain.info/tx/de3378ccb3bd26adc3808fe6b0d770a2fbaaf8a5fd2f4c71e5a6cb4c12d1f649Can you please PM me? But it's utility is diminished because it's heavy and must be guarded all the time. Think about a million dollars of gold vs a million dollars of bitcoin, the later is magnitudes easier to keep secure and spend. Bitcoin has the convenience of cash with the security of gold, insomuch as there is no third party risk of a Central Bank. This really highlights the power of bitcoin because a single guy (or two and a gal??) was able to raise a $7 million dollar bankroll almost immediately and offer high limits with low rake for the nominal cost of creating a website.  It pays winners. Is no one trading or is gox down? I see orderbook changes but no trades for 10mins.oh snap, trade goes through as soon as I posted Yes I was just thinking this. Market shows resistance to +$145 but bid/sum is climbing to the point where if we go into a rally the top could come off. He's a troll. Ya they helped me out too. Thanks I'll put you guys in my sig.
You get my PMs? oh noes I sent money to www.bitcoinsports.eu/bet/c0118 from another sportsbook account, can anything be done???https://blockchain.info/tx/5cea0c3d52e9b7108060a8b03e75e0f93da4dbdeb1362358e7c1f47c917491b3 2nd time someone has asked me that, but no, it's the shield for Mossad (Israel's CIA). However, first girl I ever kissed was Jewish though, so that counts for something. Gox Bitstamp spread at $11....but btc-e close with stamp which is unusual. A+ That's why I laugh at the bears. Bitcoin as concept is only becoming more and more mature, the technology is incredible and the pace at which it has matured so quickly with ASIC is incredible. If bitcoin goes 20 years it will have impacts on POWER technology. If you are a green trader, nothing could be more foolish than trading this market. If you believe in bitcoin then buy and hold and just let things run its course. Your boiler is more efficient as a heater than some GPUs. Ya but the sequence started at a low, you don't go "Pong-Ping" ldo. Apparently not as easy as one would want...the spread has narrowed suggesting however some have figured it out. I think it might involve actually having a JPY bank account. You can come to Vancouver and try to punch me if you want BRAH Waiting on a grade for Saints ML bet?Same id as my bt id. Hahahaha we aren't even into institutional investor phase yet you half-wits. Ya unusual. Even cavirtex is mirroring stamp. Usual they are the lowest of the low. Mother of god this is just awesome. Ya they get 100 points for subtly if faking. His point is good because it's an easy ponzi to run. I would trust dooglus however because he has been on these boards a long time and does not fit the profile of scammer. Actually not doing this like I wanted to at $15 was. No Volume:Seems like more than $20 million dollars of volume to me.... If you think someone with this kind of money is going to play manipulation games on a bitcoin exchange with banking issues, then your tinfoil hat is too tight. They can sell for BTC.
Then why, if you run those numbers as you have, and then change the drop down from "win prob" to "edge" does it show an edge of 1.54% and not 1%?  Obviously the topic is inflamitory, but the bears do seem to fail to explain in any logical scenario why bitcoin will go down. Bitcoin's network has improved security by magnitudes in the last year. A technical disaster seems further and further from possibility. While legal issues threaten the fiat to btc exchange, due to the nature of bitcoin's architecture, all attempts to thwart usage by interested parties will be circumvented.  Even if it is relegated to the currency of the ever-growing, and now-more-nessecary-than-ever, deep-web, it will have its place, and when the reward continues to dwindle, the rare shall become ever so rare. I used a kelly criterion calculator here http://www.sbrforum.com/betting-tools/kelly-calculator/If you want to play with it you can change the odds setting to decimal and it should be fine. So at 2.0 (ie 50%) you would put edge at 1% and then your total bankroll and it will tell you your max risk. I am not a math guy, but you can wikipedia kelly criterion for the greek letter explanation that you can probably understand better than I.Here's an example of having 60% win odds with 1% edge.edit detailed explanationhttp://forum.sbrforum.com/handicapper-think-tank/29009-expected-value-vs-expected-growth-kelly-criterion-part-i.html ZERO.   Poker is hard imo. If you get beyond anything but small you have to deal with collusion issues, bots, ratholers, and short stackers. Go provably fair baccarat highest limits possible. Very popular game with the highest limit gamblers in Asia and getting a foothold into Las Vegas. Maccau, China's Vegas, makes 2/3rds of its ENTIRE revenue from the VIPs who play this game, which is astonishing because it's a 1% house edge.  What interested me was we ran through the previous last high of $135 without any resistance. Look at the bottom after the huge bubble. Bulls went to war at $50 pumping $100 million(?) into bitcoin. Then again we came to retest that number at about $60ish and we rebounded. If there ever has been a solid foundation for bitcoin it's been set. Even if it were to try and break lower those with massive investment could easily manipulate the market higher to defend/escape their position. On a 50/50 chance with 1% edge it is correct, but if you have 60/40 in you favor then 1.5 % is actually optimal with 0.5% for 40/60. But 1% is probably a good average max bet size, I assume most bets center around 50/50. Well put.  Ya that's a surprise unless tricking the geo-check is all that is required and the streaming is done over the plain NSA ruled internet. Isn't losing 40% of your roll with max bet adjustments anything but totally unlikely? But I understand your position and congratulate you on limiting your investors' exposure to a very conservative 1%.  I meant more from the creator's perspective, in business terms. Cool site and idea regarding the investing. Why not borrow coins and pay an interest rate over letting users assume risk as you have it now? What is the effective implied interest rate as it stands now? Is one's investment compounded? So if the site wins and an investors account grows is this added to the investment account or is it held in a separate "dividend" account?  Well we have approached the 0.0183 LTC/BTC as predicted by chodpapa the oracle.  Lots of order book dancing going on... Maybe a botnet owner has decided to donate his rooted machines. But the banks will sell you that ILLUSION, usually in the form of a home valuation that "always goes up". Let's hope not.http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/28/slovenia-banks-idUSL6N0GR2B220130828 Ahh bitstamp that perfect arena for bitcoin trading backed by the rock solid Slovenian banking industry. $6000 arb between gox and virtex.........
Of course America's gold might be imaginary, as could half of Germany's which is "safe" in that same America.  Nobody actually knows the answer to your question. Not sure. It's obvious someone is buying big so there is no reason to sell now.   Familiar yes? It's gold vs US debt "ceiling". 4 million dollar buy is artificial. right. Probably good gox news that's not public yet.... Wow pretty surprised O'Leary was pro-bitcoin. Now I hate him just 1 satoshi less. Now that's what I call a green candle. +1   I think that would be cool and not very hard to do. Speaking of btc-e troll boxes. It must be jumping, some big sells in the litecoin market with interesting resistance. You send coins to the address and can look them up on blockchain.info. Use something like bitaddress.org/blockhcain.info to create a paper wallet. No, it's the market. I agree. Market is primed to pop. Ask wall at $125 just holding it down. Price can easily move if that is pulled and we get upward push if only to squeeze shorts and snatch some profit. Is the first one difficulty? Paper, but I was looking at getting some metal and a letter punch actually.... Because credit cards allow RECURRING subscription charges!!! Ya the GST is inclusive of their fees, but I did not know the CAD had slid so much vs USD either. 
Ya I meant $125 on gox. Quite the pop on no volume. It wouldn't need to be. You would get refunds based on your machine's earnings. Pretty good idea. Here' your new XBOX, if you leave it plugged in all the time we'll mail you a cheque every month. Pretty sure Canadian miners are selling hard on cavirtex.com. Consistently the largest arb between gox. Too bad the moderator of this sub forum is also a troll. Sell walls at $115 on bitstamp and $125 probably same guy. Has mine not shipped yet?  As for laws I doubt there is anything the Canadian goverment is doing to stem bitcoin. Canada is agnostic towards sportsbetting, which has it's own problem of "moving assets", whereas the land of the free down south is definitely otherwise. A pro poker player/sportbettor in Canada pays ZERO tax!!! Hopefully Soros will make a $1 billion bet on bitcoin sometime soon. Someone try to play tricky with the order book on that last up swing?  Cool site. Could you consider adding depth to the bid/ask wall? If you right click hold the chart and go left, a large space appears. How about just drawing in deeper bid ask walls the further you go? Maybe the "facts" as you know them, are wrong.............. I wish I knew. I was trying to research information on penny stock price action myself but not surprisingly the mass of information is how to get rich over night and for the most part useless noise. Litecoin looks more and more doomed.  I think volume and is effects or lack thereof, is king, and that is about it. That's an assumption. It is possible big market makers can get money on and off gox. Are JPY banking issues a problem in country? Because if not, a big player would just move money to Japan, perhaps start a small company there, and continue to buy and sell as usual. Why is plus500 still dealing their CDFs at gox prices if they could not hedge on/off without getting $ stuck there? Never underestimate the resources of people with millions of dollars. That said, I think the order book ratio is skewed too high, as huge bids at $10 are rather irrelevant. dat ratio  $50 arb? 
Not ever action has a triple meaning. Ya two megas came onto the order book.  Interesting. Panama, that is offshore sports-betting land, ie a place well acquainted with "sneaky" banking. Send it to plus500.com and turn that 2k into 10 and ride that leveraged wave to massive riches.  So if I invest 1BTC there is zero chance I could lose it???!?!?!  For a casino operator you have a poor understanding of chance. Chartbuddy should make some animated gifs. Always amused by canadianbitcoins.com's graphs. Can someone tell me what the yellow line is? Here we see huge volume bottom and top. Might trade around in this range? If the USA goes negative bitcoins then it gives countries like China/Russia a reason to promote it. The vacuum will fill. Bitcoin is as solid if not moreso than bittorrent, there is nothing that can be done to quash it. You can buy cocaine for $2000 in Colombia and sell it for 20k in America. Guess why.   I am confused too why virtex is like this. I think a lot of Canadian miners use the site so there is a lot of sell pressure?? But I mean take a trip over the border and sell to some guy on local bitcoins. I see a large Seattle buyer paying $103. Yes. Seems like it. Bid Ask Sum near $170 now. Been very confused by the market lately. I wish this Gox withdrawl mess could be cleared up, or Etoro suddenly allows bitcoin trading.  $16 arb between Virtex and Gox   If this is true there will be a job for a travelling bitcoin salesman who goes between places buying low and selling high. Does anyone know when this gox/bitstamp et al. arb started? Miner's as a whole will need to develop products that utilize the blockchain in the satoshidice manner.  There is a very staggered million dollar buy at $92-$90 that appears to belong to a single buyer. The second reward halving is going to be interesting.  You have to actually poke holes in OPs logic, not re-state and mis-apply an old concept.
In other news, litecoin on a slide.  I sent payment and emailed. Coouldn't ASICminer have done so?  Hmmm reddit comments suggest its an old piece.http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/01/avalon-ventures-raises-a-new-200-million-fund-and-gets-a-new-website.html Well get ready. Rumours of Avalon getting access to 20nm chip making process.http://bitcoinexaminer.org/avalon-might-be-getting-a-200-million-investment-and-20nm-technology-to-become-the-leader-of-the-mining-market/ Fyi you can just search that url into google and you get access. Cliff notes: Investing $200 million into Avalon giving them access to 20 nanometer chips. Get those difficulty over bets in. A few people own a lot of the coins. The process of the last year has been testing their hands to part with a % of those holdings. If you held 50k bitcoins then selling enough to retire is pretty much a no brainer.   Some chart software I wasn't aware of.http://www.ledset.com/cortex7/download/index.htmeditmeh get crashes when i try to draw a trend line, tradingview works better Well I got it going on my laptop, not sure why my desktop doesn't like it. I got cygwin going and everything seems ok but when I type in "python goxtool.py" from the goxtool folder to launch the program there is a pause then nothing happens and I am returned to the prompt. Here is a dump of "python -v goxtool.py".

Ok I'll take 1. More if possible. The profit has not hurt because it created ASIC which secures the network. Of course we are going to see a massive contraction in ROI and a lot of disappointed people who aren't getting huge returns or even recover their initial investment.  Lol don't flatter yourself troll, you aren't on my ignore list. The greatest risk is trusting "some guy" with your coins in exchange for "a share" backed by a company that doesn't really exist within the legal system. Thinking that the "public" has gotten into bitcoin in any manner is laughable. The public is into bitcoin when you can buy Casascius coins on the shopping network. Money is cheap bro, just borrow fiat from the banks.  50% of German gold is actually in imaginary vaults safe and sound in America.
Ripple killer?  This is way better than any alt-coin that is for sure. Short term down-side risk?? He made millions the 1 time he was right and lost only 10cents the other hundred times.  localbitcoins seems to follow gox for pricing, that's a way to pull off the bitstamp arb. Hey chodpada can you recommend any books to read on the subject of markets etc. More layman than not and math isn't my language. US bans cocaine, price plummets...O WAIT. I always thought a random sized block reward would be interesting, but I don't see any point in it. Can you give me the url for this? Also cavirtex with 10k up to $92 with gox at $100. He definitely seems to post only when it's going down that's for sure.   hmmmmmmm thanks I just rebooted and now my batch file no longer gets my usb miner going. All that changed was a reboot so I am confused.   Yes is that dictum should really be reserved as advice given to people about to go to the casino. Bitcoin is a massive risk, but it's already the investment of a lifetime for a lot of people. I would contend being owed btc by gox is different than usd. The btc is held in cold and hot storage whereas the usd is held by a bank that does not hold 100% of deposits.  Nice analysis.  I too had noticed a disconnect lately. BFL jokes aside, I am surprised we have not seen a massive ASIC scam. ?? No there are lots of guys grinding sports. Making a lot of money of course is hard. Guys making a 50k-200k a year are more common than you think.
The issue that I cannot overcome is it would require blocks to be formed at an incredible rate.... Perhaps a more feasible project would be a sports betting exchange since games start and end over longer periods than dealt hands of poker. 10 minute blocks would be fine for a sports betting application of the same concept.  You are correct. Perhaps one could be created with a distributed p2p network just like bitcoin. The network would be a massive distributed database of the poker hands and the miners would compete to order the network. Their reward would become an effective "rake" just like bitcoin's transaction fee. This would force rake to the lowest level possible and undoubtedly be lower than anything offered by private enterprise. Of course this would incorporate bitcoin as the game's currency. There are guys who beat sports. It is not a life of walking around in a big suit with a bunch of cash and betting games on a hunch. It's a life of doing computer programs and heavy statistics. Try looking at "Weighing the Odds in Sports Betting", "Conquering Risk: Attacking Vegas and Wall Street" for some information. You will be surprised to learn that a sharp who can beat spreads at 55% is very good (ie they lose almost as much as they win). And more so, with such an edge they should only every risk a maximum of $550 with a bankroll of $10,000. Why do people with shares in SD suddenly feel compelled to turn them into fiat? Sabermetrics has proven to be successful,  jury is still out on technical analysis.   Most of the time I am neutral because I don't delude myself into thinking I can predict this market. I go short term bull or bear maybe once a month, but I am long bull. He has a bear avatar, it's his identity.  I thought we were going sub 50?  I meant the rise from $10-$20 and beyond. Powder keg is primed. This is a replay of 10-20. Technical Analysis. People think they can look at charts and draw lines and triangles on them with Fibonacci bands and which is only using past price action to predict the future. It's a self-reinforcing/confirming voodoo imo.  Give me control of a nations money supply, and I care not who makes its laws -- Amschel RothchildSadly we are approaching a situation where "nation" can be replaced with "world". I read somewhere the wall st firms have investigated bitcoin and their entry price point is 400. Reminds me of this..... It would be cool to see a third line as an average of the two. This might be my new favourite site actually.  ^LOL Are we goxxing? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGaB6WDJ5k Good to see Gox lag not an issue so far.
Or just a function of coins being bought. UP UP AND AWAY!!!!!!! Nice write up in the OP. Some straight up and true info on sportbetting.  There is still a persistent belief in another hype-bubble....Might have to wait a LONG time before this train begins to leave the station again. Interesting. Because while I don't believe in TA, (epecially for bitcoin lolretard), people do. I have always seen TA as a voodoo that people think is real only so smart guys who can move markets can paint a picture for them. When you say it played out at $160, people are now primed to think it will play out again, and that's when you pull the rug..... but obviously just a thought, downside risk seems all too very real. If I was a smart operator with a ton of money I might be thinking of priming a litecoin bubble by smashing the Gox Bitcoin price low, then when gox takes on ltc, fire up a rally and sell into the fever of litecoin being better than bitcoin. Litecoin will be very attractive to people late to the game. As long as they perceive litecoin to be as robust as bitcoin, 100 litecoins sounds better than 3.5 bitcoins. lol here comes the trillion dollar bank note bubble One's trading style needs to suit their abilities. I for one am in your camp. A person with 10k B probably bought them for $10,000. Someone needs to create a mining pool that basically has miners compete for tickets then when they mine a block they randomly pull a ticket and reward the winner. So in effect a small GPU miner would be spending their electricity to buy a lottery ticket.  Bulls who have been around a while have always been rewarded with patience. Most people on this board are coin flippers. So they are right half the time. So once and a while they are right a few times in a row and think they are geniuses.  Ya. See If you bought a 20k miner with coins at $100 do you not rebuy those same coins at $50? Hopefully we can one day read Memoirs of the Bitcoin Manipulator.  I see no upside here. Bidwalls since 100 have constantly been hollow. We need a dead cat bounce before we can even think of a bottom. He means asians buy hard metal and westerners paper etf gold. What has shocked me is my, until recently, utter faith in fiat money. We are born into a world where there are pre-defined facts we take to be axioms. Money issued by our government is one of those facts, but which is also TOTALLY HOLLOW. The more I think about fiat money the more utterly ridiculous it is. Of course it's primary value stems from the fact 99.99999999999% of the population believes in it. I would define ultimate power to be getting a population to believe that pieces of paper that represent its future labour with diminishing returns is the ultimate store of value. PS anyone with large holdings of coins should be doing this at a smaller scale. Forming a business whose assets are 100% bitcoins then piecing out shares to investors and imposing a frictional cost to buying and selling. Are we really going to revisit $50 bitcoins? This is weird to me. ASIC was a revolution in the security of the network and the speculators reacted appropriately. $50 is where the price simply began to ramp up after the massive battle over $20. Sub $50 coins? I don't buy it.
Interesting to see inflation adjusted gold converging to actual price. This is the key. A good business return is 5% roi, the S&P, ie big business pushes 10. No where in the world outside of the cocaine business do we have returns that are comparable to what the early miners were able to achieve.  Imagine entities that wished to move large value assets over borders without declaration or taxation. They convert it to bitcoin from A then sell it in B. If the local bitcoin market place becomes robust enough, this could be performed at a cloud type level.  That makes sense because that is where the weakest fiat is issued. https://exante.eu/press/news/314/ The moderately competent will always just buy their own coins. Unlike gold, bitcoin incurs no premium charge nor cost of storage or delivery so unless you are a knuckle dragger the only function this etf might serve would be to go short. When the underlying asset can be manipulated it's going to be difficult for SEC to approve this. To the purpose of? Seems like the fake bids we saw all day have gone away. Someone can just set up a secret dark exchange on tor if being anonymous is so important. The biggest exchange being regulated by FINCEN is not a step backwards in the experiment that is bitcoin. We did see quite the swings on the 25th. Just an interesting thought that if you can set up huge moves two ways you can trigger leveraged short/long positions to have a reflexive effect. The market's manipulators (bad called: market's creators) are compriming the price. They are pressurizing it into one special deposit, the pressured triangle, but it's almost full. When the deposit will be full, the manipulators will open the fawcet and then the price will leave it with a high pressure.This moment of full deposit is very near: today (it seems that not will be), tomorrow, or better , the saturday (without less people keeping guard of it, is more easy to move the price)I have publish one chart with my opinion of the future resolution of the pressured deposit. You can see it below. I suggest it.Another possibilty is "the aspersion effect" , one very big bussines for the manipulators, but very dangerous for the begginers. The price goes down and up or up and down very fast.Is not suggested to be in the market in those moments of opening fawcets. But is possible to follow the manipulators in a short time of periods (5m,15m) and feet the trend line very near. Be carefull and quick.Sorry for my english.Thoughts on this? Bitcoin has a use. It's the question of how wide that usage will become. Another entry into the tor drug market place has launched. Unfortunately the black grey market might be the only driving force for the future, but new technology has always been bootstrapped by the forces of Vice. The political fiat printers can obfuscate the exchange of coins into their currency, but unless they are willing to risk revealing the grand lie we live in a free society, they are handcuffed, bitcoin is just a hash that is rare, it's a piece of text, one can claim it's defended by Freedom of Speech, so maybe one day we will see a ruling by the Supreme Court, but that's a long way off. Pawn Star guy says otherwise.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-06-28/even-pawn-star-knows-governments-can-screw-currency So someone wants to unload huge coinage and is propping up buy side to pick off anything offered above his fake walls? Since gox has usd delays he can bleed it out slowly over two weeks. I've been scratching my head at this market for days now and can only come up with this. Sort of like anticipating the 1st big drop when on a roller coaster; that slow creep towards the inevitable PLUNGE.... Anyone familiar? Didnt read through whole thread.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=197175.0 Well we had a 40k green candle and the price didn't budge, so we are going to need some serious firepower. Apparently gold price at below recovery costs.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-06-26/gold-drops-below-its-average-cash-cost Ripple?
 Ya no doubt about this.  Are there any good resources to investigate this?  In utopias they do. To modify the mantra of Steve Balmer: "Delivery! delivery! delivery!" Promises of GHs being delivered to the network have proven in the past to be utterly unreliable. You cannot quote KNCs promise to deliver as a fact before it happens. Assigning some sort of probability to their hash-rate to the network would be prudent.  I have been very anti litecoin thinking there is really only space for one crypto currency and litecoin would die due to redundancy. I am less convinced if this now because litecoin could be used in tandem with bitcoin to complement it. If micro transactions are bloating the chain they could be pushed to litecoin and the bitcoin chain could be freed for heavy lifting. Any good android market watcher apps? Moody working fine for me. 1. Get a bot that runs your bids and asks 5% below and above "spot"2. Profit.  FoRex trading is very popular amongst Japanese housewives collectively referred to as Mrs Watanabe. As a long bull I am feeling very bearish. These Mt Gox issues are bad in my mind. People are happy Gox is losing market share but for me it's more like the lynchpin of the bitcoin ecosystem is failing due to political forces. If the bitcoin processors are dependent on gox then we are close to the point where retailers give up. Neither do I when you consider no other exchange has any USD liquidity that can absorb a 5000 coin sell off.  See ya later bitstamp. So can't you just sell coins in euro and withdraw, even a US person could do this.  If you sold coins at bitstamp at 100 then why not buy them back at 95? lol bitstamp going to love being MtGox's USD withdraw service. Virtex about $5 lower than gox too. This affect Canada at all? Good thing I didn't back the truck up. I guess the trade is short paper bullion buy hard bullion.
Time to get into the goxusd to cash business. Where do you trade these? And is this graph from there? Its interesting. Coins are fleeing gox but the asks are holding huge at 115-120. If they drop or get bought we could see a big rally. And you are the troll type who has been singing doom and gloom since we broke $20.  Ignore mode, activate. Because ASIC pre-orders are not going to give an ROI so buying is the only option.   If difficulty is very high, then acquiring a bitcoin by mining is expensive.   So we are quickly reaching the point where even making a sizeable investment in bitcoin would involve purchasing coins or running a service. http://www.businessinsider.com/the-richard-wyckoff-stock-trading-method-2013-2?op=1Interesting read. So if you had an infinite amount of money I guess you could land a man on Neptune? A bunch of money doesn't solve something that is inherently impossible. A more logical theory would be that the NSA regrets releasing such strong crypto to the masses. All this was released before the terrorists were trying to take away our freedom and the US decided it had to take away our freedoms to protect those freedoms. So all the governments of the whole world, plus the army of crypto-scientists who have yet to crack SHA-256, are on the whole, either less technically adept than the NSA, OR are in on it too.  Can't believe XRP are selling for what they are. reserved The smart guy will be the one who makes his own alt-coin that can be mined by Ps3/PS4.  Dude this is what I was going to say! ASICminer sells them in batches of a minimum of 300 units. I take it error rate % is determined by HW/A * 100 (cgminer)? Also mine is holding at 330MHs. Anyone getting better? No fans, plugged into my desktop.
https://www.havelockinvestments.com/order.php?symbol=SDICEBut they are a Popscu's pass through. Can't trust the bitcoin world imo. Yes I don't think one should buy bullion as an "investment" but as a store of "value" that has nothing to do with any government on this planet. One's labour of life being represented by a bill issued by a large body of con-men can set one instantly ILL. Place a portion of your life's labours into the hands of nature, be free of the ruling rabble. ORLY? Because I think a USB Eruptor cost ~2btc when the price was at $115 and costs ~2btc now at $100. I am trying the wrap my head around how this would affect the market place. So much money is being rammed down the mining pipeline it just screams screw-job. I mean if the price tanks there will be an absolute ton of people with 20k computers that can make $40 a day. I laugh but that's pretty brutal. However assuming they paid in BTC they can just  buy the cost of the rig back in btc and go from there. The whole relationship between miner and price discovery mechanism is hard to figure out for this tired old brain but I keep thinking of a snake eating its own tail.  ...and you paid for your miner with now expensive coins, do you buy back those bitcoins with fiat, to effectively pay less for your miner? Bitcoins have more upside AND downside. Silver doesn't one day disappear because something breaks at the atomic level of the universe. Isn't it still running above expected value?? Can't get heads or tails of this market. If you are trading this you are either crazy or a member of the illuminati.  Don't like how the green volume candles aren't even popping the market anymore. Well that seals it, the terrorists have won. Bids terrified of a $400k ask wall...for shame. What kind of odds do you get on such a bet? Well tradeview is your best bet but their gox data does not go back very far. However the chat box has been bugging the mods to change that. I am puzzled too. Is he trying to stop out people on margins? Is it the actions of a mining company who is just getting whatever they can get. Is it an attempt to screw with the VWAP, which guys like Tangible Cryptography used to set their sell price each day? Are there huge volumes transactions taking place between parties that are below public radar? Imagine two identical gold mines, mined by two different companies, both offer stock. Mine Co A has a bunch of labourers with pick-axes and donkeys to pull mine carts, Mine Co B has a drill, dynamite, rail engines, and rock crushers. Obviously Mine Co B's stock will be worth more because they will be more efficient.   Hahaha ohhhh such gold. Its a question of whether someone is actually coming to market because they actually need to convert the coins to fiat, or want to push the price down. Seems like well-heeled amateur hour either way. https://www.tradingview.com/v/z2JuTqHU/ Keep being wrong bears. Interesting.... Wtf buying into massive spreads with thin liquidity. $5 swingsssssss
Game over. 3 year old crypto-currency selling for 93 times that of the dollar issued by the worlds largest economy. Run for the hills. http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=8WEtxJ4-sh4 We really need to set an alarm on this bad boy. Ya agreed. While this hurts my equity it is amazing to watch bitcoin now vs that of a year ago. I just watched 50k btc selloff worth 5 million dollars. Been around this board when we watched it go to 30 then grind to $2 then crawl to $20 then RAMP to the moon. A $100 bitcoin is truly amazing in its own right. Everything about this night is bullish long term. COUNTER-PUNCH! Gox not lagging....  What an EPIC dump. Thar she blows. In somewhat of a confusing loop, the only real force on the bitcoin market-place, outside of evil speculation and drug addicted nerds, is the dynamic between mining and the price. A LOT of money is being pumped into buying mining rigs. With Avalon selling bulk chips and ASICMiner unloading tons of Block Eruptors and blade rigs, bitcoins are moving into the hands of a few, who, either need to convert those coins to fiat to pay their suppliers, or their suppliers need to do so (you can't buy carrots with bitcoins). Anyways, this could REALLY hammer the price in the next few months now that I think about it. There must be a point where miner suppliers holding coins as investment, are forced to sell to not lose money, I wonder what that is? Panic waterfall??Past this influx of coins coming to market to be made fiat, comes the generation of new coins by these new miners themselves. They slowly regain their outlay until they breach an ROI breakeven. Weirdly, as the price depresses this timeline becomes longer but the difficulty gets higher. On the flip side, if you paid for your miner at $120 a coin and you see  the price dropping you should be buying coins to replace that which you paid for your miner to lower it's cost to you.All in all, at the present moment, the mining-price dynamic probably has the greatest impact on the exchange rate in terms of money flow, and I welcome comments on this confusing subject. What speeds are you guys holding? Mine is at 330.5Mh/s. Been going a since Wednesday. About 3.5HW errors an hour. Anyone have a pool where mining on it is basically -ev but the payouts for even low MH miners can be high?? Not sure how pools work really but if my imagination is correct miners of a pool can work to create a "share". What if the closer your last share was to the pool solving a block, the higher your "jackpot" payout? You could reward miners like they do with a poker tournament. Perhaps this wouldnt be -ev unless you were CPU/GPU mining vs a massive diff, but I do think there are people willing to spend electricity to have a chance at winning a lottery. Exactly.... Moreover the ask side is offering terrible liquidity. Very jagged walls like that imply ownership by a single person. Fake or real is not really the issue imo; it means buy support can suddenly disappear at the whim of a single market participant. So I ve hooked up my block eruptor usb miner to this pool when does this pool send no reg rewards out and what is the minimum? Here's the commandline for mine running on 50btc. bitaddress is my address and password duh... COM11 is where the miner is connected to my computer. Check out http://rdmsnippets.com/tag/install-block-erupter-on-windows-7/ for more details.Code:cgminer-nogpu.exe -o pool.50btc.com:8332 -u bitaddress -p password --icarus-options 115200:1:1 --icarus-timing 3.0=100 -S //./COM11 America has assets. Namely California. If you are bullish bitcoin, long-term these USB could be profitable. If you buy 1 for 2btc then just replace those by buying 2 coins from gox then you have paid $250 for the USB. If coins go up crazy to $500, then, even if you only mine half a coin you have broken even. If bitcoin is around in 10 years...even fractions of a coin will have been worth mining. So for those confident in bitcoin, buying one of these things is not crazy. I bought coins at $3 and $9. I took 2 of my coins and bought one of these to help will the network and give mining a try.   Got mine today. Canada, west coast. No brokerage charges levied by Fedex. Clocking in at 333.5MH/s. I used 50btc pool, any reason not to? Humans are conditioned to think there is a greater force pulling at the wires making everything happen. "God" is the original manipulator. It IS monday after all AND people just got paid for the EoM; the money into the order book looks like the cumulative action of many small timers.
Is it possible the bitcoin economy (ie actual demand) is what is pushing the price up after these massive dumps? You mean the block reward halving from 50 to 25?? Yet to be price in you say? Waaat? Just meant nothing is more noob than wiring 1 mega to mtgox then putting up a bid wall like that. I guess he could of just plunked it into the ask wall.....now that would of been cool. LOL. A million comes into the order book and a million dollar wall goes up. Noob alert?  I am feeling bearish because fiat is running from Gox. "Regulation" scares are not helpful. However, every time a ton of hash has hit the network we have seen a good jump in price. Who knows. But setting trends from the start of bitcoin life is ridiculous. You can't draw conclusions from a sub million dollar bitcoin market and extrapolate it to the present at a billion plus; that's like comparing starbucks in 1985 to now.... Trends in the bitcoin market are generally specious because market fundamentals can change on a dime. Please use USPS to Canada. SRsly, Fedex/UPS charge brokerage fees USPS does not. Did you ship the Canadian ones yet? Cause please do not use UPS to Canada.  And HSBC laundered $8billion for Mexican drug cartels and no surprise they are still open and no one goes to jail. If you check out blockchained.com you can see both fiat and btc are leaving the site. I was thinking he could have shipped them at a discount but locked them to his own mining pool. HAHA A+ TSUNAMI ALERT. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb5fGLNId5Q HURRY.    What I dont understand is why people get entrenched into a bull or bear position. The point is to be one the other or neutral and change opinion as deemed nessecary, not be be stubborn and rah rah on as if defending an ideology. Amazing how robust the price is to the down side. I highly doubt a 20k panic buy into the asks would 'only' move the market by 10%. Thanks guys. #helpdesk I didnt realize I had to sign my address in the email. How do I do that? I only use blockchain.info.
For sure. All breakthrough discoveries are of inspiration not cold logic.  This. The market can absorb HUGE volume sells and pops on 10k buys. Hibernation? Money does not buy drugs, people do. Obviously this is not good value, and should not be viewed as a means to mine for profit, but to help decentralise the network. If you hold bitcoins and have gained in equity thanks to the upward price movements, trading a small part of your gains to help support the network and defend your overall investment is worth considering. I'll take 1. Canada. Now I have $1300 for sale.   It gives you an identity of those behind the massive sell off, quells concern it's the illuminati or that there is yet to be revealed "bad news". Agree wholly. Short term gox taking on litecoin has to be bullish but litecoin is less robust than btc for many reasons. The only long term hope I could see for ltc champions is it becomes merged somehow with the btc network.  Interesting theory. If one had such large coin holdings to sell they could very much profit greatly as well dumping into market with shorts or just well positioned bids.  If you find a money tree and provide a map to its location to everyone, guess what happens?  Those mega red candles on the recent graph are massive and I am cautiously optimistic that if the market can absorb such huge volumes without causing a massive slide then we won't see a repeat of bubble 1.0. The big money came in from 50-100. So maybe lower we must go, as orderbook weight is shifting to the sell side.  Incredible volumes. I remember when 10kUSD would move this market. Now we see a 2.5million sell off and we creep lower.  Whatever the exchange rate is running at.  The price ramp began with ASIC shipping. ASIC brought the network out of the garage. Network security and strength is the key fundamental. Think in fiat banking terms, if banking infrastructure could not be secured with crypto would you trust it? Plus ASIC owners had a free shot at cheap coins so those that did not have one had to buy. I have just over $1200 on betdsi.eu, a US friendly sportsbook. Looking to trade for bitcoins. I can do an account to account transfer there. http://www.sportsbookreview.com/sportsbooks/betdsi/ Ahhhh those were the days!! 
Full. Of. Dudes. bettor: Anyone going to links posted here today should donate there coins to the Salvation Army first. Incredible volume during that sell off from the all time high. Compare that with the run-up and it is night and day. Not sure what to make of it. Market is loaded with noobs and fish traders. If and when we see another epic rally the "top calling" narrative will be good comedy as market participants are primed to expect the rug to be yanked out at some point.  They have many, you have to select which league you want. I am sure you can find a bot which will let you interface the api and issue commands like /buy 100 etc. The nature of the network adds to volatility. If the price rises, difficulty follows and the network becomes more secure which adds value. The downside is similar, when the price drops the marginal miners are forced to leave the the network, and the network becomes less secure, reducing value. It's sort of like a teeter-totter where the buy/sell forces are on one side or the other, never in the middle. Mr George Soros refers to this in markets as reflexivity. These are not fundamentals.  Seems like lag issue has been sorted out.... http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-04-18/what-exactly-did-obama-say-wall-streets-ceos-last-thursday Then we would be living in a society where free speech is deemed illegal. We'll see. I seem to recall $15-$20 was bearish. Mtgox trading engine lag: 117.17s CaVirtex and btce in mid-90s.... Any chance you could add a calculator that displayed in usd the value of one's holdings? What carrier is this from?  If this is true..................... MOTHER OF GOD. The Internet needs a currency. Bitcoin is the best solution. Definitely an odd blog posting full of childish vitriol. Stayed away from SDICE because of this guy's weird un-professional style.
Moreover bitcoin is so new it really is like investing in Microsoft before they even had a listing on an exchange.... Bought mine as a novelty and one for the gf because it was an easy way for her to "have" a coin. The good thing about billion dollar p2p open source currencies is that smart people will be attracted to solve problems. As capital is invested into coins themselves, coin holders will be FANATICAL about ensuring the network is secure and efficient.  This is unreal.  I was thinking this very thought earlier tonight. Conclusion: buy all the coins you can with your already verified account with fiat loans and sell to anyone willing to pay at 5% mark up and repeat. This makes no sense. It does not matter at ALL if the new people are here for the long run or not. Chasing fiat dreams? Who cares. It doesn't affect the network, it doesn't change bitcoin for good OR bad. If only pie eyed idealists cared about bitcoin, it would be worth less than a dollar. One could think that in normal situations, HOWEVER, this ain't normal son. The price and adoption is going parabolic together. Each time a real company says "we are going to adopt/use bitcoin", the price is "reset", the then current price stands as the new "ground zero" and we go up from there. You cannot price bitcoin like any other traded asset because it is being traded in its infancy, which is an utterly unique situation. Couple all of this with the possibility of a mega player like Amazon or Google endorsing bitcoin and the price goes vertical for a month.  Sort of feeling bad for the bears.   Could be someone buying their own asks to cool the market, induce others to sell to him a bit lower. This sort of thing would be illegal I am sure in equity markets, but there is nothing to stop someone from doing this in the wild west of MtGox. Keep a copy in the freezer. But ya safety deposit box not a bad idea. Bitcoin in this early stage is like pricing Apple stock when they are still nerding hard in the GARAGE. Bull tip: classic market strategies are meaningless in the current bitcoin market. Something dead obvious since  $15. This would drive the price to incredible heights and while they would be able to acquire a lot of coins, a seller would probably never give up all their coins. Currently there are 21x8 satoshis and it can be increased by modifying the protocol. I do wonder if a large group could aquire a large % and manipulate the price however, especially once shorting is easily performed. In a way yes, but that is governed by a central issuer.  I was wondering if  you could create some sort of trading card game where the cards are mined and then people take them and use them in a virtual play ground.  Well I am all ears. Always wondered about things like this. Rumors really. But central bankers have said as much the last few days then "retract" their statements. Check out zerohedge.com for salacious news and gossip. Id love to see the various currencies graphed together all priced to usd (or silver or gold).  Lol europe is a shambles. Talk of deposit haircuts through the EU. Cant hurt this bull parade. It reads  like a guy running a scam.
Hard to hold a large chunk of coin as early adopter and not cash out a large percentage and basically be retired. Ha there is something wrong with the Chrome Bitcoin Price ticker I have, I loaded my browser and it's displaying 47.8.  Do not use Skrill or Paypal. If you dont't want to use MtGox then you should do it locally at a bank or somewhere public. Everyone should read this book. What I want is suggestions for other books of common ilk. You obviously missed the memo: bitcoin only goes up. I think the manipulator was crushed at 15 or 18 around there. I am on my phone but look for the HUGE sell that failed to move the market, and which was trigger for this epic bull run. There is no doubt this market was pump and dumped for a long time, but I don't think any one person is holding the reigns at the moment. We can imagine a number of scenarios. Most of what I have read paints the Satoshi as a boogeyman out for profit. This is possible, and realistically if you can design an open source p2p crypto currency then, hats off to you, by default you are a prime adopter. Should those who started to mine on day 2 be painted with a similar brush? Maybe the 2nd guy who started to mine has such a plan, and which would be more likely. I had been wondering what % of the total coins one would need to be the bitcoin 'central bank'; obviously such a position would need to be large, for no one can provide liquidity out of thin air, ie print, I am thinking more about the Hunt Bros attempting to corner the silver market. Perhaps our evil Satoshi is holding reserves to prevent an external force from attempting such a scuttling maneouver, perhaps when the captains of the world's banks fear the worst? LOL $71.5 and we are still in beta!!! http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-20/spain-bitcoin-run-has-started Nope that's why trying to predict this market is close to impossible. Thread fork! I was wondering if a large position holder had been spooked by the fork.  Actually you would think one would go to himself "my chart says bitcoin might collapse to zero, does that make any sense AT ALL?". Then he might have a moment where he realizes his charts are useless.  Y'all are spoiled. We went sideways for 6 months at start of 2012. If you flip your bear coin enough times you will eventually call it right. Seems like a lot of good news to top a massive rally only to languish sub 50. Makes more sense for one giant engine, to power all the cars, than each car power itself.  Don't blame you. I really thought there was going to be a big sell-off and a recovery somewhere in the 30s.  I was waiting for someone to put gox instantly into 2nd place. Short MtGox!! My suggestion would be to stop trying to be a serious trading platform, but basically admit to being a bucket shop and target your service to gamblers. ie http://financials.williamhill.com/ Man this is huge news.

Bad in technical sense, very bad in psychological sense. Cheap coins for those willing to STILL BELIEVE.  OpenCL 1.0 is related to GPU mining which is related to bitcoins. Planets of course having nothing to do with bitcoins, but that was never my suggestion.Avalon was confirmed to be real: the price goes parabolic. OpenCL 1.0 is released giving average joe the ability to mine with his GPUs, a large buy comes in days after. I guess I could fire up paint.exe and draw you a picture but I'll leave it to your interplanetary imagination for now. This will be a very fun market to watch because there will be so many amateur market participants. This has to be one of the most accessible markets to the public outside of sports gambling. OPenCL 1.0 was released Oct 1 2010 and within 2 weeks someone decided to buy 500k bitcoins.  People USING it to BUY things and accept is as their WAGE is FAITH in the EURO. Wow this place is just full of knuckle dragging retards. From what I learned from googling the ipoker network is to be avoided. ie lots of liquidity for a large buyer. One has to wonder however if there are any bullets in the gun, being the weekend and all.... Negative. CHOO-CHOO In context, the sell off/correction/crash, whatever you want to call it, was minor. The rally was MASSIVE, %250 run up in 2 months, one can just think in terms of momentum to look higher.  Better not go outside today, might get run over.  I am saying bitcoin is a step towards having a monetary system that is transparent and publicly owned and operated, and this undermines the current power structure. The ECB report implicitly stated that bitcoin could be a threat to faith in the Euro. Yes, the nay sayers frame it in a worst case scenario where bitcoin suddenly goes to zero.   Dead wrong. Yes, but more precisely it means: do you presently hold bitcoins which have been purchased on credit.
Fiat money IS a crime. We are born into a world and we accept things when they seem to work. But when you start to look at it and think in critical terms you realize how much faith you must put into the hands of the issuers; and 2008 proved that that is an unwarranted offering. But the trick is to change the world without having to tear everything down and start all over again (which just leads back to the same old). We must slowly take away the power of the governments by becoming independent, untaxable, and indifferent. The internet, and p2p especially, gives the people the ability to collectively work from the ground up. Our government's in the west were founded 300 years ago and we think they are effective in the modern day? We rush to replace anything else ineffective by the power of technology but the houses of our governments are the SAME, filled with the privileged classes that assume they are there to serve the public because they know what's best for us, and then take our money when their friends screw up in the markets and cut them a carte blanche backed by the work debt of the masses.   MOST of the time, nay almost ALL the time, such an idea is pure stupidity; but bitcoin really is something never seen before.  Check out my poll: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150690.0   I made an identical post at about $20.  duhhhhhh70k coins did come in to the sell side.

Sounds like everyday of my life since 1992. This is ridiculously awesome.
If the BFL ASIC fail to materialize I think it is a negative event for the security of the network, and thus the price might suffer. Conversely if they DO ship.... http://mpex.co/ Irrational exuberance of the bears..... Wait until the general public is informed about the "internet money that only goes up".... but but but what about TRIANGLES!!??!   There was probably hardly any liquidity left on the exchange either. Ya hard to understand this. It IS in alpha stage so..... My interest in it revolves around the (possible?) potential to electrify silver or gold bullion. The problem I can't get over is it requires a very high % of population to use it to be really viable, and if a bunch of nerds are confused..... and condoms.... If you want something as profitable as holding bitcoins, try importing cocaine to the US. In other news, Pokerstars is rigged because my Aces lost to runner runner flush.

They have been around a long time. I remember them from way back when VOIP came into vogue. I don't think so. However if the data is available from gox then it is obviously within reach. Counter productive to what exactly?  So about $77 to every 1 btc on the order books.... ?? The price distinctly soared as soon as Avalon was proven to be real.   Agree.

Do as I say: send all your bitcoins to 1NTZ5hoTXQfdX4d4bMQbFY7FWn1DKjYtPp Getting margined out on bitcoinica was my lesson. I had the general trend correct but the trixy market makers ran a squeeze on me and my ilk, and took of with my coins. Biologically the sex-drive has bootstrapped everything. Obvious troll-FUD post is obvious. Agree. Charts rely on a past that is relevant to the present. I have sincere doubts the price mechanism of bitcoin 6 months ago is the same as it is today. I think the fundamentals changed with the Avalon release.  Ya but the RSI!! The Chargrin-Weezledorf Oscillator!! The Knees and Toes Pattern!!!  They use a wallet like blockchain.info. Most end users will never deal with a wallet on their computer, nor should they. To put in perspective Playboy has a market cap of 258mill and Buffalo Wild Wings 358.  Incredible to say the least. Silver as money is as old as civilization. naaaaaaaaa The weakest trader in this market is a bear. He thinks about ALL TIME HIGHS and how bitcoin is prone to LARGE CRASHES. Perhaps he already had his pockets picked at 15-20, who knows. The price action from the steam up after 15 has been different that the rise from 2-15. There is almost NO profit taking. We go up a leg, the fish sell at the plateau and the price continues to rise. The pump and dump has ended.
0.1337 bot buys high and sells low?!?  editHe redeemed himself as I posted this. That was nothing. The trap at 35 will be blooooddyyyyy. BEAR MEAT ON SALE.  Under times of Goxxing I have always found the IRC chan #bitcoin-watch on freenode to be the last to die.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast. It fell to 2 because gox was hacked. The hacking was very serious because "fake coins" were sold on the exchange. There was no way to know how many of these fake coins were sold for fiat. So the value of the price ON GOX was untrustable. Of course this was NOT a weakness of the bitcoin network itself, but because gox was the market pricing mech the price HAD to be reset.   Would not be surprised to see a run at the so called "all time high" followed by a solid dump designed to trap bears. Heheh well said.   https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/3001380335907184649 days to recoupe outlay.TOR has been surviving for longer than SR, and not going anywhere. So if SR itself gets busted, someone replaces it. I fully expect cartels to wake up and amazon.com the SR eventually.Perhaps. The US has waaayy bigger problems right now than bitcoin. The bitcoin network itself is a p2p network that moves crypto-hashes. It breaks no laws in itself, unlike perhaps that possible with bittorrent, which accounts for 30%-40% of Internet traffic. And maybe China lands on the moon by 2050.....  BURN THE MANIPULATOR!! Ya bitcoin is definitely weak in the sense it needs the internet, but I guess if the internet crashes we are all hooped anyways.

 2 months back I was sooooo close to have to cash out I borrowed from my bank instead. Thank god.  Been waiting for a bitcoinica gamble-a-thon style " 'trading' platform" for a while now. The ability to short this market does put the breaks on.  Maybe the weekend dip will let us get in cheap at $25? lol the .01 bot has an enemy 20 times bigger! Hehe I had a vision about some cyberpunk movie where the matrix-like crew ran around stealing power from big industrial plants in the effort to mine a fraction of a btc. I would buy some silver as insurance. Otherwise I will start my journey around the globe as an eccentric vagabond. He's reversed yet again. Painting the tape low. When you are a bookie, it is not a competitive mistake to have lines that are sharp. Did the 0.01 bot switch direction today?    except one might be willing to pay for such behavior as I have described. Thought this before. Nothing to stop people from multi-accounting mtgox and creating fake volume. It could be an attempt to prevent a price rise while engaging in a very large transaction off exchange. I recall this sort of shenanigans with the pirate.... It spooks buyers because it implies a huge iceberg is out their lurking waiting to be struck.  I would NEVER leave 40k bitcoins on mtgox or anywhere other than a paper wallet that lived in my safe. Good idea. Baccarat is a favorite of the coveted "asian whale", you'll just need to raise limits to 30kusd a hand....     So now that ASIC is proven to be real, will their be a steady increase in ASIC efficiency with new products, or will ASIC be eclipsed by a newer, faster 4 letter chip in a year or two?
This is just being a nit. Its relative to how much money you have, and your life situation. If you have 10k to your name and you are 20 years old, putting all your money into bitcoin is not some wreckless idea, it's taking a shot at retiring before 40 (like a pirate) or losing 10k and spending a few years working to recover it. MY question is "should I borrow 10k from my bank at 5% a year and put it all into bitcoin?" Yes, very much so. As a history major who studied the Industrial Revolution with great interest and amazement, I believe the Internet, global communications, and p2p, will prove to have an impact on a scale magnitudes greater. The faltering of the economic and political power structures IS A SHIFT of reality we have yet to comprehend. There was a 3millionUSD red volume bar at 17 and the price broke UP. Comparing the bitcoin market of today and the market of a year ago is pointless. The price is not set by the past, and moreover, even if one wished to draw a "trend", the fundamentals are way different. The network has survived examination by a cadre of nerds and hackers. A gambling site profited 400,000USD in 1 month with AN OVERHEAD OF $1200, a drug bazzar operates openly on the darknet. ETC ETC ETC. It's about limits and payout %. That's how you improve the product. A 500max bet is pretty big but its small in the world of degen whales.Here's someone droping 900k on Barcelona last year on Betfair.And here are current superbowl odds at pinnacle with max bet at 140k with rebets allowed after line move. An actual useful poll would have a time frame and options for +/- percentage change over that period.  Use the blockchain somehow. On blockchain.info each block had a total send expressed in USD. The cents column can give you a number between 00 and 99. This would be kind of a cool game, if you made it a matching game, where coins on one side paid out to the other side, you would have instances were there would be imbalances and people would race each other to take the +ev bet....of course if too much came in to take advantage of this then it would happen all over again. Check out bid/ask depth divergence. 2 years and worth 2/3rds an oz of silver.....   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGaB6WDJ5k TIMMMMMBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRR blockbet.net Bitcoin is intrinsically more risky than USD in terms of holding value into the near and long term future. http://bitcoinx.com/charts/ And only table scraps for the hungry bulls... Ya the -108 juice on NBA is very good. Can I recommend/request Moneyline NHL? Ie OT included. This is the standard bet type for North American gamblers. I noticed you don't have real time lines. If you needed a feed just sign up at pinnacle sports and request an API key in the settings. You can query their API once every 5 seconds for an XML odds set.Other suggestions would be a way to do multiple single bets all at once. You might even consider a login/deposit akin to that done by bitcoinvideopoker.com. Also option to make odds display in -110 style. Good luck. Is there any means to measure coins being sent to and from MtGox? I take it their address pool is not public? Could they be traced by ip?? I mean the dump at 15 last time was in the order of 500000btc....but that is directly in-line with what pirate stole. He even stated so on IRC that it was him (FWIW). The sell side is much weaker now imo. If you want to manipulate this market at the moment, bull-mode is easier to instigate than bear....
Might be different this time. The dumper/manipulator/whale may have blown his load with this 15k sell off that did nothing to move the market. They are LAWS, grounded in the LEGAL system. Obviously we can find holes in the logic of drug laws, but the basic premise that "drugs are bad m'kay", can be supported by real evidence. So I am still wondering on what grounds (ie what premise) could you make a p2p crypto-system illegal. Cryptography IS freedom of speech. What is massively important with trading is money management. If you are buying and selling your entire "bankroll" in and out, eventually you are going to get burnt. This is inevitable.  On what logical grounds could bitcoin ever be made "illegal".   boom Interesting. Mt Gox was "term of the day" on Investopedia on Jan 12....https://twitter.com/InvestopediaTrm/status/290071778410237952 Have to think there are a lot of USD wires pending trying to chase this rally.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my6bfA14vMQhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReQsRgQXgQY http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=buy%20bitcoins%2C%20sell%20bitcoins&cmpt=q  I wish I could trust MPEX.... He can also do this off exchange. As MTGOX is the defacto "price", if someone can successfully manipulate it, he can make cheap deals off exchange without the need to risk upsetting the price on mtgox itself. I have a suspicion this is what was happening for the last month or so.... Look out below!! Pinnacle isnt even hanging NCAA totals except for big TV games. lol stock move 10% up in 4 seconds.... Cool. Could you do one for last 6 months? Can you get Asian Handicap odds for soccer matches? Is there anything to infer from the stepped nature of the walls? The ask side is much more edgy, whereas the buy side shows a more graded smoothness.  Very cool. Hope it goes well. I was thinking an exchange. in this format would be interesting. Good luck and dont get buried.... I've been contemplating the theory a manipulator has been suppressing the price the best they can so as to get coins off exchange on the cheap; then they will drop resistance and sell into the rally on the way up.
My hoarding has quadrupled my investment so far, so it's working out for me.  Comparing the Zimbabwe Dollar with the USD is apples and watermelons. Moreover the US dollar index has risen and fallen 2% in a year. It's not some avalanche of depreciation. Where art thou? I think these are very rare nowadays. I noticed there are other games on the site besides JOB9/6 like Deuces Wild Tens or Better etc. From what I can discern the JOB9/6 is still the best payout. AMIRITE? Interesting. Hopefully we see the RF go well past 5000 for some serious attention to the site. I see there is a progressive for the RF now for 5 coin bets. At 4888 payout for the RF the game becomes 100% payout. Wow very nice site. I took you for a little bit after hitting quads. Need investors?   I have seen mention of a progressive but where is this displayed? What are your long term goals for max limit? I ordered a magazine from the uk for my girlfriend and part of the deal was this gift voucher of 60GBP discount off 95.88GBP purchase of wine from nakedwines.com. Since I am from Canada I can't use it so anyone in the UK wanting this please put up an offer. Actually, "most of us" said reward halving was already priced in. I always thought the point of an IPO would be to increase the size of their bankroll. Essentially borrowing btc and paying interest at a rate just below that of expected earnings. Whales love to gamble big in low edge games. The asian market for high limits low edge is very real. Baccarat (1 % house edge "coin flip" game) is commonly dealt in Macau for 100k a hand.  Good thought. I've noticed a 10k bullet doesn't move the market any more. There is a game poker players play called "flipping". Basically they agree to go "all in" pre-flop regardless of their hand. So long term this is a 0ev game minus rake, but the problem is you have to trust all parties and eventually someone comes and ruins the game by waiting for a good hand. So maybe try to make a game like that? This way you don't have to worry about collusion and bots. edithere's a youtube clip of phil ivey and ziigmund flipping for 200k pots.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1ZHh9gER4 SR is nothing.

Ten days of selling really. http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg10ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zxzi2gAccDistzv lol @ all caps, at work. There are some huge gamblers out there. I was watching betfair volume once and saw a million dollar bet go through on a soccer match. (He lost). SatoshiDice can really only be improved upon by offering higher limits and lowering house edge, which they might be able to do if they got into the coin mixing business for example. Anything stop someone from selling and buying between multiple accounts to try and create fake volume? In days of old such a sell off would have triggered a waterfall. Big players are sellers. There is no way to short this market, (not really anyways, not like back in the bicoinica days), so they employ pump and dump. Market was pretty thin. MtGox was not really ready for a huge move like that. The high of $31 is really a false price. If you look at the all time data chart and ignore the huge move and just draw in your own line from  $0.xx to $2 you get pretty normal looking growth. 
Ya it kissed 13.30 then rebounded. Pretty good resistance. Wasn't there some theory about big buys near the end of "daily close"? Interesting blog entry from a guy trying to buy some stock and being gamed by bots. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2012-12-11/guest-post-five-minute-example-hft-shenanigans Heard a theory most of the users are miners looking to cash out, putting negative pressure on the price. Bid/Ask continues to diverge.  The walls at 14.00 and 15.00 really could be fake. Never seen much talk about bitcoin's little brother. For me the only way Litecoin goes anywhere is if it can be used to compliment bitcoin in some manner. So there would be a need for a transaction that was somehow a litecoin/bitcoin mix imo. The thought that litecoin is silver to bitcoin gold is incorrect. Silver and gold are two different elements and each has their specific uses; silver of course being very much an industrial metal. There is no such distinction between litecoin and bitcoin. Both are crypto-"currencies", with slightly different rules, and bitcoin has 99% of the marketshare. It has confirmed to me that humans don't need governments any more. The internet allows the collaboration of private individuals across all segments of society, geography, nationality, who can successfully work together to solve massive and complex problems. Linux is the huge example where private individuals developed massively robust software in a collective manner. A human is a human, the internet is a "nation" of humans. Open Source, Wikipedia, bitcoin, these are the beginnings.  If you are dumb enough to buy a dream, there will be someone to sell you one.  They have geo-thermal energy source too. But ya pie in the sky for sure. Interesting about Iceland, they have considered adopting the Canadian Dollar as their currency, but maybe they should look at bitcoin?  http://www.businessinsider.com/iceland-canadian-dollar-heidar-gudjonsson-2012-5 Can someone please book some time on the Shopping Network and sell Cassicus coins? kthx. I have imagined p2p gambling and I think one day people will be able to gamble at near 0% loss. Imagine a poker app that uses the network to move funds from the pot to the winning players address/stack. The bitcoin network is a means to transfer value electronically. It should be thought of as backbone to anything you want to lay on top of it which involves the transfer of value. I came up with a sportsbook that works this way. I made up a mockup a while back as a concept. The irony here is in Canada we get double taxed on alcohol, gas etc..... Is there a connection between the Finnish flag on the site and the confirmation by their Central Bank that bitcoins are "legal"? $31 is really just a fake price imo. It was up there for a split second on an exchange that would crash at a moments notice and that was subsequently hacked a few days after this "all time high". The real high imo, is about $20, and even then that was short lived. The actual price point where we had any side-ways action was about $14.... Lol that's like saying you can't buy a futures contract on Gold in the commodities market.   Great thread on hash-rate forecasting.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=125171.0 Looks like most of us are voting with hope in their veins.  For the gamblers:http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=181  Silly silly profit takers. Enjoy your fiat. Muahahahahaha
The amazing thing about this quote is out of the mouths of most people it's a dead-serious statement. Now that is a trading strategy. Or trading against it when the time is right.... And Flattr "considering bitcoin integration".https://twitter.com/gaiapunk/status/275964934360268800 Thanks for the replies. I can't really decide on a bull/bear position. I feel there are contradictory signals. Bid Ask ratio is diverging to the Bid side for the highest spread ever.Yet price has broken from following hash-rate. GPU miners would return. Distribution of hashes is more important than total hash-rate imo. Hard to imagine a network at 25Thash operating at minimal block reward generating 3600 coins a day in transaction fees. (The current situation at 25BTC reward.) I think a bitcoin network that could be supported by lay-persons at their homes might be more secure than large entities controlling large segments of the hash-rate privately.  Does this drop of Accumulation/Distribution coupled with a lack of downswing mean anything to anyone? This is actually a good point. There is a huge Iranian community in North America and bitcoin would serve as a very good remittance option if the traditional methods were being disrupted or unstable. Iranian-American bitcoin consultant Farzhad Hashemi recently traveled to Tehran and talked up bitcoin to his friends.lol Been wondering this the last few days. Look at the hashrate vs linear market price. The price has obviously stalled and broken from the dashed line it seemed to be naturally following.Bitcoin is a self-regulating system. It could be that the mining power that is coming online and about to come on line, is too much of a increase. The outcome being a price/hash-rate drop. The market players are always trying to squeeze out money where they can. Be it in bitcoin or in hashing power. Way back when ASIC was first reported I thought that the capital outlay was a nice chunk of money just sitting looking pretty to the wise-guys. If the market could be played to drop, stressed ASIC owners might be spooked into selling their hardware, and the smart money would be waiting to buy up the hashing power, because trading to profits on an exchange, or getting hashing power for cheap is the same thing in the end. BFL just did. http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/13vi6u/bfl_asic_update_chips_flawed_delays/ Ya look at the bid ask graph. When the bid ask spread narrowed and crossed back in July we had a big run-up in price. Someone needs to make a furnace-miner. 20,000 BTU and 75GH/s!! bitcoincharts.com click on "load raw data" Interestingly sounds like the silver drop was a glitch on kitco's part.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=85687.msg1359722#msg1359722https://www.kitcomm.com/showthread.php?s=3815d15b62ab15a50e63e41d8a7d5ded&t=111547 Interesting that's for sure. Return of the double star fish!!  Energy costs are only increasing. Obviously as oil becomes more expensive, oil companies are willing to consider more expensive means to acquire oil, case in point: canadian tar sand bitumen extraction, BUT, in general, I think energy costs are going to only increase. Gold of course is mined out of rock and that takes an incredible amount of energy. "Safe investment" is also relative. I think if you are seeking to save your equity, cash is probably the worst. Land or hard metals are better. But if you get your cash to WORK, ie through business, then you can probably get a better return. Fiat money is paper backed by a promise supported by an industry defended by an army. Warren Buffet billionaire wunderkind has always debauched gold and rightly so, it sits there; for him he needs something can can be hooked to a plow and cash is more liquid. It depends on you. China, the largest holder of US T-Bills in the world has recently imported around 500 tons of gold for 2012. The entire gold holdings of the EU amounts to that amount. Obviously China is not bullish USD. You should let people bet on this. 
I think only 7200 are minted a day. 144*50. If it is true that Silk Road does 2 million a month (a theory with many holes) that is 66kusd a day. After block halving only 3600 which at current price levels is about 40kusd a day. Obviously dealers will sell to make USD but it seems like net buying > net selling for the near short term since they are working on nice margins they probably will sell just enough to buy more product. And this is just the SR. CAvirtex slow to adjust.Editwell I guess the high fees bring it pretty much in line. Found a rig on ebay. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Bitcoin-mining-server-2400-mhash-s-8x-Sapphire-ATI-Radeon-5830-Video-Cards-/121019863443  We could really see a mega-rally into the halving. KimDotCom is not stupid. Well I hope he was buried by Pirate. I could see a streamlining of this process where each table at the club has qr codes for each girl. If paypal was smart they would just allow people to use bitcoin as well. How about you vend bitcoin addresses as you say for a set $ amount ie a $20 card. User retrieves card and holds card's QR code up to vending machine's scanner. $20 worth of btc then sent to the address.editOh ya. Awesome job OP.   Duhhh how could I have forgotten that!!    They are truly a success story so far. Based on volume and their fees they are doing about 6k month. Not sure how much it costs to run a site like that but I hope they are doing ok. With the API coming they should see more volume and spreads should tighten as bot arbing between Gox becomes a possibility. Bear: People selling coins to pay for christmas.People have less disposable cash to buy bitcoins.ASIC miners sell to recoup $$$ locked up for months/on credit.Bull:People buy drugs for new years.Wordpress hype wave.Bitcoin is going to be the internet's "money".Opinions? If it takes 10% of paypal tx then it would take at least the same from western union ccbill etc. I am suprised we are seeing mainstream adoption in wordpress before gambling/porn processing. lol Ya block halving + wordpress news and price rise could give us some serious panic buying. When you had your "great run" that defied the odds, you weren't complaining then. My advice is to stop gambling. Calvin Ayre, the creator of BoDog and license owner, has blogged about bitcoin. I always wondered about this.
I made a sim in excel giving a coinflipper a 1% edge. Only ran it about 6000 flips but it really highlights how much variance you can run into with such a low edge. Always thought bitgold would have been better. "Coin" suggests "currency", but then again "gold" suggests "physical".  Sierracharts bridge: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6019.0 Heh we must have similar google tracking profiles I get those all the time, along with "Meet real asian women". Part of me remembers the long slow grind from bubble highs to $2 and I fear we are in some sort of endless downswing. That said, as adam has pointed out there is really no reason to be negative bitcoin right now and I agree. The ECB report was basically amazing. While there is limited traction at the moment in terms of new services accepting bitcoin I don't see the downside as being real. Then again, bitcoins are trading at $10.?? per USD. Ten times the fiat issued by the largest and most powerful country the world has ever seen. Either bitcoins are WAY over priced ,or we have something here that is more revolutionary than the invention of the PRINTING PRESS. (Oh the irony). lolhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=7mLSOmIvOEY I have been looking at it. I do think we may see some serious move either up or down and I lean bull. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117982.0How about this? I really think this is the best way to operate a wallet. There is nothing I want to buy with bitcoins that I can't buy with fiat. So why would I choose bitcoins over fiat when the former has a potential upside of a tin can under a lit stick of dynamite? Is the guy who spent 10,000BTC on a pizza thrilled he contributed to the "cause" or would he rather have ~$100,000 from an nominal investment of a few dollars? It is interesting no private entity went the ASIC route themselves. It's incredible. The fact it works is amazing in it self, and then you pile on the depth of design and we approach pure brilliance.   I think the future will see a pay per PLAY model where the cost is fractional. Imagine if a musician was credited a fraction of a cent for every view of their music video on Youtube.  The world is going to cut out the middle man eventually, it will just take time because they are essentially the power structure.  lol......Conclusion, do not use btc-e http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/ Mad at myself because I saw this coming but didn't make a move. You think the price is going to drop to 2-3 before December??? That would be something. If you want to actually have a chance to catch people you don't let them know you have their docs. But good luck.
Gone are the days a 10k buy or sell even moves the price.   If a government could tax it's people to further itself OVER the interests of the population it taxes and serves, it would undoubtedly attempt to do so. There is no better business than taxing people.  Use blockchain.info's rpc service? http://blockchain.info/api/json_rpc_api 25 cents a kwh?? So why don't you have any bitcoins from your 5 GPUs? I think the risk he means regards the inherent possibility of bitcoin actually failing ie protocol exploit/network failure. Of course with each day passing that becomes less and less of a possibility. The big hashers will be wanting to sell once ASIC comes online to recover outlay costs I would think. It's going to be interesting. Imagine you laid out 30k+ for a BFL rig only to have the difficulty go vertical, the block reward halve, and the price go down. If you could manipulate the market it would be crafty/evil to dump at the halving. A lot of people would buy because "omg less coins are being made" and miners would be pressed to get what they could. So how does this work if you had shares? At one time this forum could influence the price but I don't think it can any longer. Premise: The market place with the lowest liquidity is most efficient. lol......Seriously people. What ISNT a scam?? Do you mean profit? Running an exchange like this is NOT cheap. Satoshidice is the gold mine.  I came across this today. Kilowatt Cards: a store-of-value and a medium-of-exchangeKilowatt Cards are gift cards that pay for 10 kilowatt-hours of electricity (including taxes and fees) to benefit any consumer electricity account when redeemed though this web site. The electric utility does not accept Kilowatt Cards - we do - and then send cash payment to the company at the rate it normally charges retail customers for electricity.Because these gift cards may be redeemed by anyone to pay for electricity, they can also be used to barter for other things, anything, worldwide. Kilowatt Cards are issued by a non-profit corporation founded to demonstrate the idea that financial liabilites denoted in kilowatt-hours constitue a new asset class having stable value, and to provide fixed-value paper to those who want it.http://www.kilowattcards.com/template/index.cfmNow I am imagining an alternative crypto-currency that allows people in low kwh areas to effectively sell their kwh through mining a coin and selling them to someone where their costs are high who then can redeem it for their electricity payment.  Make any sense?? At current prices they are at about $10 million USD in volume. I have a low end GPU from ATI in my desktop machine. Suddenly I was having problems playing quakelive with crashes as soon as I started to play. I ignored this because I assumed it was something to do with the game and gave up caring. A few months go by and I start to get stuttering with video playback on things like Netflix then VLC. So I start to investigate my GPU and find out my GPU was running at over 100C on idle! I opened the case up and cleared dust and it runs now at 50C. I am amazed it didn't brick the GPU because it was running hot for MONTHS. I believe that is a flight plan reserved for silver.  The main reason is Virtex lacks an API so automated arbs are not feasible.  It depends on what you mean by "function". For humans it serves a spiritual need. This of course can be abused by power structures to further their interests. 
well I thought it was funny. Yes I meant per diff change of 2016 blocks. I am under the impression the difficulty can only ever increase by a maximum of 4x. If asic comes online and diff tops out bitcoins will be cheap because diff will be static but ghash will be monsterous. Am I off base here? This is based on my general assumptions. The next 6 months are going to be interesting in the world of bitcoins thats for sure.  Nice try at starting a rally. This is called a "stake" and very common thing in the poker world. Visit chipmeup.com for example. OP needs to actually be able to prove he can actually win at poker however. I think it is very possible.  Put it all on Mtgox and write a bot that creates massive bid walls when price moves up and sell walls when moving down. Selling and buying accordingly if market takes the bait. CAD is very much a commodity currency like AUS. It has not been "pegged" to the USD since 1970. http://www.bitbills.com/ Thats it. Was using ? instead of & thanks. I meant its 2012 and irc still exists. or bitpay owners represent/are wealthy investors who want to aquire bitcoins without moving the market. I think we will retest 14,15....from there we will see. I have always been amazed by the resiliency of IRC. Can anyone tell me how to make a call to this?? https://blockchain.info/tobtchttps://blockchain.info/api/exchange_rates_api http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=378 injailby40GL with all your efforts guys. Looks like Trendon is a total noob. I could see a rally into halving event.   Could you put up pics of these cigars? Or ring gauge length for each? Buy 1 million in cocaine and sell it at cost on SR.
It could easily have been pirate cashing out and taking a wire before "closing" his trust.  I got a few in my sig   Most on GLBSE are already that status imo. No offence to you. every site is rigged.  http://bit.ly/rJslMw I believe you can figure this out using blockchain.info for now. http://blockchain.info/rawtx/$tx_hash Its just blanket wifi/cell coverage everywhere is soon to be standard. Paying people fractional bitcoins to seed bittorrents would be more interesting to me.... Trade 100 coins first as practice.   I agree that betsofbitcoin is annoying with their odds. Plus the 10% rake is too high. They also need to be able to book bets that end upon an event occurring. If you make a bet about the blockchain halving you have to close the contract to betting a month before the estimated event in case ASIC miners get going and move everything up with the increased hash rate. I laughed and I laughed. Fair enough. But my concerns with the statement stand. The betsofbitco.in statment is sneakily/badly worded."1 Bitcoin will be worth more than $12 on August 27th, 2012Daily "High" value of 1 Bitcoin reported by MtGox will be above $12 on August 27th."So 12+ can be reached for the daily high and it can close below 12 for a win. Futhermore the "Daily High" is to be calculated by MtGox which uses UTC, whereas the betsofbitcoin statement utilizes EST. This is unfair because it creates a "day" that is longer than 24 hours.http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=586 He mad a bad mistake telling everyone he was closing down before he was ready to. He tipped his hand and he's getting squeezed by other market makers. OR the whole thing is a scam. www.piratetracker.info   What;s weird to me is why tell everyone you are closing before you are actually ready to do so.... Prevents price from rising. Someone with a lot of coins might be waiting on a wire........... Those of you in panic mode need to realize you are opening yourself up to being squeezed by the pirate. Nice post. Hopefully there are some uses for bitcoins that are not publicly known, otherwise I have to agree with the call towards a down trend. A lot of them have amazon.com wishlists?? You could just buy them amazon giftcodes with http://btcbuy.info/GiftCards.cshtml. Try chrome extension imgur. You can drag and drop your images from desktop into imgur window to upload, and then you can grab url with a single click.
Put it up on betsofbitco.in No Https you have to be out of your mind. BOOM. Agree. I had been hoping SD were going to open up to investors but this IPO is a tragedy. The point of it should be to raise capital to re-invest into SD in the form of raising betting limits. As people clone the site and create alternate sites the only way to remain #1 is to take action from the highrollers. This requires a massive bankroll which investors could help provide. It appears to be owned by one person who is averaging his sell price. That sell wall looks very "stepped". Why not use investor capital to allow satoshidice to take larger bets? Also, I am surprised you guys don't run a coin mixing service.  Typically when the DOJ/Internet Police seize a website it is usually just the domain and not the servers. This is why bookies like 5dimes.com continue to operate at their .eu address. So there is no correlation between higher network volume transfers and the price of coins?  The price jump in June mirrors the increase in tx volume. I'd rather own satoshidice.... Already built into the price. I'd fade any rally at the block halving. bump for the newbies Time to watch a different kind of fail in the NFL preseason  Doing it over the weekend would be optimal for such an operation as it would keep big buyers from wiring cash to the exchanges. There was a huge buy at ~13.25 and a equally huge sell at 15.0. THAT is pirates profit. Its not like he wakes up one day and goes "oh noes I have to close the trust account" it would involve a PLAN of sorts. notsureifserious.jpghope not. Damnnnnnn this thing is a printing press. FORGET MINING. I want to be but the blockchain has decided to go on vacation preventing me from moving my coins fast enough. I am slightly spooked that we had 7 blocks minted in 1 hour and 4 minutes with 6 of those 7 mined by non-pool static IP addresses.....<tinfoilhat is tinfoil>  http://pastebin.com/PthgrzDS
hahaha I am stealing this for my sig at what kind of volume? Why in gods name do people borrow coins at rates in a stratosphere beyond that offered by even borderline criminal fiat lenders? Ie why not borrow at 19% A YEAR off credit card, deposit at an exchange, buy bitcoins, lose it martingaling satoshidice?  I take it the dashed line on the graph is proportional to bet volume?  Interested. I have been waiting for a gaming company to invest in. I have some cool ideas for games too.Slightly wary about your sportsbetting? ability to turn "small sums into large". I am aware of sports betting arbitrage, middling etc, value betting, but not aware of how you turn small sums into large unless you can bet correlated stuff somewhere.....Anyways consider me 1st in line providing you get IDed somehow by Pattrick or similar. True. We may yet see some more upside in the form of "get rich quick" type buying however.  This buying seems to be constant and not reckless, it does not look to be driven by "irrational exuberance". You get girls to post sexy "jail-bait" pictures and guys send them tips. The girls can have a wishlist of stuff they want (say amazon.com) and as they accrue bitcoins they can redeem them for their stuff from the site operator. This way you don't have to teach teenage girls dumb enough to post pictures of themselves on the net how to deal with bitcoins, just male nerds.  I believe the Y axis is quotes...ie ask/bid offers in millions. I don't think the HFT bots actually do massive volumes of actually executed trades, they "quote stuff" and try to bluff other people into making offers that are a mistake and then buying and sell those offers really quickly.http://www.nanex.net/aqck/2804.HTML I used to be fairly cynical towards greenpeace etc. But really, these guys were doing their thing in the 1960s and everyone thought that they were just crazy hippies, now they rake in revenues of nearly 200million. It's impressive.  I was thinking of this today, but then I asked myself, "How do I profit by offering a GLBSE contract that mirrors the gold price?". Is there a technical indicator that "describes" ask/bid market depth over time? Too good. A+ That was my impression. True, but I do think we reserve jerk status for the Enrons and Madoffs of the world (I will hold off pre-emptively judging the pirate).  True. Bitcoin is a traders wet dream. Sheep playing the market and no SEC. Gambling with small edges is soul crushing. Why would they when they are essentially in cahoots with the pirate and making good money? 
So pirate has borrowed enough coins to give him the weight to manipulate the market and thus profit enough from his up an down game to pay off his lenders and make profit? The entire world changes. A total change in societal power structures. Bitcoin would be useful still, but it's cost of production would plummet to the cost of the rigs and time required to run them. Thus, the network difficulty would go vertical. And wind power is not free because you have to build turbines. Perhaps I am misunderstanding this concept. I am thinking in terms of a unlimited power source available to all.  Speaking of which an a little OT, there was a screw up in algo trading yesterday by a trading firm on the NYSE that performed the Adam buy high sell low strategy for 30 minutes before anyone noticed and essentially gave away 440million and chopped their own sock from $10 to $2. http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-01/knight-algo-nightmare-dents-market-as-trader-sounds-alarm Wow big arbitrage op. <tinfoilhat>Pirate has a bitcoin exploit that will devalue the coins to zero, never to return.</tinfoilhat> That's true, but irrelevant to my comments. If MtGox is processing coins for fiat to SR ringleaders/big volume dealers, then guess who is going to want to know where the wires are going.  Spooky. If pirate is related to SR he better be good at becoming invisible because if bitcointalk can figure this out then the DEA and their sister agencies can as well. Furthermore if a link between mtgox and SR becomes provable then the DOJ ban hammer could be coming eventually. That was a crazy week. Ohhh the good old day. I managed to sell at 26 and buy a 16 like a boss. Good call. Because of the potential upside I am willing to horde my coins at the risk of losing the negligible amount of fiat I have invested in it. Moreover, I will never sell my coins for fiat. I will only ever use my coins to buy items. Due to the limited items available to me, I can only horde. Greed is what made life what it is. Without greed the cavemen really don't get out of the caves. Maybe they die off. I always remembered these lines from the movie Apocalypto where an old man is telling a story "I saw a hole in the Man, deep like a hunger he will never fill. It is what makes him sad and what makes him want. He will go on taking and taking, until one day the World will say, 'I am no more and I have nothing left to give.'"  The real rocket would be an institutional buyer. Not 10,000 people buying a bitcoin because they saw it on the TV. And being totally unable to figure it out. Imagine the theories. It would be worse than the speculation forum. Yes I think the function breaks because I input the house odds of -6399900 (lay 6399900 to win 1) and it is much too large. I believe the rest are correct. Here is a kelly calculator http://www.sbrforum.com/betting-tools/kelly-calculator/ if anyone wants to play with it.  Too much risk is only relative to bankroll, but yes, they have it backwards. For less than 64000 I only get 234.368976, for a bankroll of 12K. It is the lessthan 1 which is the amazing one. Apparently the max bet should be 480!! Of course 480 * 64000 is massively beyond 12k, so perhaps either this is a rounding problem OR it is correct and incorporating risk of ruin, which is so minuscule the risk of being in debt forever is obliterated by the more likely fortune.  I did some calculations for max bet size based on the Kelly Criterion and it seems they should be taking larger wagers for the higher % house wins. With a bankroll of 12K  satoshidice should accept for the 50% bet, a max bet of 258btc. By the same token, for the 12% bet they should take a max bet of 281btc, not 120. Either they are taking bet sizes WAY to big for their bankroll, or they are not maximizing earnings by accepting higher limits for their other wagers. To calculate this I used an excel function set I used for sportsbetting that I downloaded from here: http://forum.sbrforum.com/handicapper-think-tank/29621-simple-vba-sports-betting-functions-template-excel.html#post256487The function is SBKELLY(win%,usodds ie -110, kelly size where 1 is max and 0.5 is half). In order for the function to work I had to convert some things from the satoshi website. Basically I was required to invert the players odds and frame it as a bet for the house at odds that paid out greater than the losses. In advantage gambling one seeks to maximize earnings while minimizing the risk of ruin so the Kelly Criterion is implemented. But this is as far as my understanding of it goes as I am merely a monkey with a spreadsheet. Code:Name,Bet Address,Win Odds,Price Multiplier,House Percent,Expected Return,Min Bet,Max Bet,House Wins %,Player wins %,Effective House %,Effective House Odds,Kelly Criterion % of Bankroll,Max Bet,Bankrolllessthan 1,1dice1e6pdhLzzWQq7yMidf6j8eAg7pkY ,0.001500%,64000,1.84%,98.16%,0.001,0.05,99.998500%,0.000015625,0.999984375,-6399900,0.04,479.9999999,12000lessthan 2,1dice1Qf4Br5EYjj9rnHWqgMVYnQWehYG ,0.003100%,31981.573,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,0.1,99.996900%,3.1268E-05,0.999968732,-3198057.3,0.008571237,102.854844,12000lessthan 4,1dice2pxmRZrtqBVzixvWnxsMa7wN2GCK ,0.006100%,15990.789,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,0.2001,99.993900%,6.2536E-05,0.999937464,-1598978.9,0.024561871,294.742452,12000lessthan 8,1dice2vQoUkQwDMbfDACM1xz6svEXdhYb ,0.012200%,7995.397,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,0.4002,99.987800%,0.000125072,0.999874928,-799439.7,0.024561566,294.738792,12000lessthan 16,1dice2WmRTLf1dEk4HH3Xs8LDuXzaHEQU ,0.024400%,3997.701,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,0.8006,99.975600%,0.000250144,0.999749856,-399670.1,0.024560956,294.731472,12000lessthan 32,1dice2xkjAAiphomEJA5NoowpuJ18HT1s ,0.048800%,1998.853,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,1.6017,99.951200%,0.000500287,0.999499713,-199785.3,0.024559736,294.716832,12000lessthan 64,1dice2zdoxQHpGRNaAWiqbK82FQhr4fb5 ,0.097700%,999.429,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,3.205,99.902300%,0.001000571,0.998999429,-99842.9,0.023557867,282.694404,12000lessthan 128,1dice37EemX64oHssTreXEFT3DXtZxVXK ,0.195300%,499.717,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,3.6902,99.804700%,0.002001133,0.997998867,-49871.7,0.024052699,288.632388,12000lessthan 256,1dice3jkpTvevsohA4Np1yP4uKzG1SRLv ,0.390600%,249.861,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,7.3951,99.609400%,0.004002225,0.995997775,-24886.1,0.024042934,288.515208,12000lessthan 512,1dice4J1mFEvVuFqD14HzdViHFGi9h4Pp ,0.781300%,124.933,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,14.8497,99.218700%,0.00800429,0.99199571,-12393.3,0.023898471,286.781652,12000lessthan 1000,1dice5wwEZT2u6ESAdUGG6MHgCpbQqZiy ,1.525900%,63.968,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,29.227,98.474100%,0.015632816,0.984367184,-6296.8,0.023912288,286.947456,12000lessthan 1500,1dice61SNWEKWdA8LN6G44ewsiQfuCvge ,2.288800%,42.647,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,44.1897,97.711200%,0.023448308,0.976551692,-4164.7,0.023895464,286.745568,12000lessthan 2000,1dice6DPtUMBpWgv8i4pG8HMjXv9qDJWN ,3.051800%,31.987,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,59.3926,96.948200%,0.0312627,0.9687373,-3098.7,0.023820734,285.848808,12000lessthan 3000,1dice6gJgPDYz8PLQyJb8cgPBnmWqCSuF ,4.577600%,21.326,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,57.4951,95.422400%,0.046891119,0.953108881,-2032.6,0.023781024,285.372288,12000lessthan 4000,1dice6GV5Rz2iaifPvX7RMjfhaNPC8SXH ,6.103500%,15.996,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,77.9318,93.896500%,0.062515629,0.937484371,-1499.6,0.02368414,284.20968,12000lessthan 6000,1dice6wBxymYi3t94heUAG6MpG5eceLG1 ,9.155300%,10.666,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,120.909,90.844700%,0.09375586,0.90624414,-966.6,0.023495702,281.948424,12000lessthan 8000,1dice6YgEVBf88erBFra9BHf6ZMoyvG88 ,12.207000%,8,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,120.9568,87.793000%,0.125,0.875,-700,0.02344,281.28,12000lessthan 12000,1dice7EYzJag7SxkdKXLr8Jn14WUb3Cf1 ,18.310500%,5.335,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,152.1241,81.689500%,0.187441425,0.812558575,-433.5,0.023134825,277.6179,12000lessthan 16000,1dice7fUkz5h4z2wPc1wLMPWgB5mDwKDx ,24.414100%,4.003,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,219.6353,75.585900%,0.249812641,0.750187359,-300.3,0.022703577,272.442924,12000lessthan 24000,1dice7W2AicHosf5EL3GFDUVga7TgtPFn ,36.621100%,2.67,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,63.378900%,0.374531835,0.625468165,-167,0.02221663,266.59956,12000lessthan 32000,1dice8EMZmqKvrGE4Qc9bUFf9PX3xaYDp ,48.828100%,2.004,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,51.171900%,0.499001996,0.500998004,-100.4,0.021484876,257.818512,12000lessthan 32768,1dice97ECuByXAvqXpaYzSaQuPVvrtmz6 ,50.000000%,1.957,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,50.000000%,0.510986203,0.489013797,104.4932079,0.0215,258,12000lessthan 48000,1dice9wcMu5hLF4g81u8nioL5mmSHTApw ,73.242200%,1.338,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,26.757800%,0.747384155,0.252615845,295.8579882,0.020019364,240.232368,12000lessthan 52000,1dicec9k7KpmQaA8Uc8aCCxfWnwEWzpXE ,79.345700%,1.235,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,20.654300%,0.809716599,0.190283401,425.5319149,0.020080605,240.96726,12000lessthan 56000,1dicegEArYHgbwQZhvr5G9Ah2s7SFuW1y ,85.449200%,1.147,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,14.550800%,0.871839582,0.128160418,680.2721088,0.019897676,238.772112,12000lessthan 60000,1diceDCd27Cc22HV3qPNZKwGnZ8QwhLTc ,91.552700%,1.071,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,8.447300%,0.933706816,0.066293184,1408.450704,0.019470583,233.646996,12000lessthan 64000,1dice9wVtrKZTBbAZqz1XiTmboYyvpD3t ,97.656300%,1.004,1.90%,98.10%,0.001,250,2.343700%,0.996015936,0.003984064,25000,0.019530748,234.368976,12000 I have decided to run a monthly streak for the cash bitcoin contest. For those unfamiliar with the game, more information can be determined by quickly googling. However, in brief, ESPN.com offers players a chance to win a large cash prize if any player is able to record a 27 in a row win streak selecting sports related propositions. ESPN allows users to create public and private pools where groups of players can compete amongst each other. I have created a group called Streak_for_the_BTC, http://streak.espn.go.com/en/group?groupID=204252. Players will compete over 1 month to record the highest streak. The highest streak record that is 10 wins in a row or more wins the jackpot. If no player wins in the month, the jackpot is carried over to the next month and so forth. As per ESPN's rules all streaks are reset to zero after each month. Cost of entry to the contest will be 0.5 BTC. I reserve the right to play in the contest and win the jackpot.FAQOMG I AM GOING TO WIN!!! WHERE AND HOW DO I SIGN UP!?!?1. PM me the bitcoin address you will be sending your entry fee from.2. Make an ESPN account with the same bitcoin address you will be using to deposit with.  3. Join the group: http://streak.espn.go.com/en/group?groupID=204252 password: btcbtcbtc4. Send your 0.5 entry fee to 1SFTCtvuLWNfUojRfqFJBtwj46oY43tXQ from that address. This way all accounts can be publicly verified to have paid their entrance fee. Anyone who joins without an address as username or who doesn't pay, will have their picks ignored.Wait a minute!! Are you a scammer?No, I have been on this board a while now and do not fit the profile of a scammer. However, you will of course have to trust me, just as you have to trust satoshidice and other swashbucklers. I have a vested interest in gaining trust in the community as I have other games I wish to develop over time. What's in it for you then?I, being experienced in sports betting, believe I hold a decent chance of winning the pool itself.Can I make more than one account?Since this is unpreventable, yes. Each account requires an entrance fee of course.Can I join at any time?Yes.What if there is a tie?In case of a dead heat tie players will split the pot. What if I have a 10 streak half way though the month and then lose a prop, do I still win the jackpot?As long as no other player makes a streak longer than 10 for the remainder of the month you would win. Perhaps the pirate is a group of people. Then when the ponzi collapses everyone is looking for a non-existent pirate. Of course I could be wrong. 10x leverage was too much for the market imo.  Forex is a 4 trillion a day volume. BTC is a bit smaller. Gox would crash.
My account was -80USD so I never used it again, luckily. Why they offered such large leverage is a mystery to me. There is rumour that this community is a very small part of the actual bitcoin economy.  I was thinking of a youtube/music/porn site where users install an extension linked to a bitcoin wallet. As long as their wallet is > 0 then they have access to the site. Imagine youtube where you pay a fractional amount to view the video and the content owner gets paid. Plus no infuriating ads. I want to create a bot that sends out changes to an XML file. There is a good API to work with and this is not some spam bot. I would like this to run off a standard VPS.  PM for info. Can pay in BTC or other if you wish.  This is what I looks like to me. When it hits 9 there is a COMEX style smackdown but underlying pressure is there to bring it back up again. I see bitcoin really capable of hurting paypal. There are A LOT of people who absolutely hate the service but are tied into it because it's pretty much the de facto option for auction sites. So then EBAY, (who own paypal), might take a hit, who else, Western Union?? Thoughts? I wish to have an account. Pm. Thx. whoa, swinging for the fences.  <pirateat40> well guys, i think i've scared off the sellers.

Pretty much yes.   May I suggest a robust security policy. ^^^ Heh no kidding. Someone doesn't want the price to move. editmanipulated to sit on/near 6.66 too.  +1000 That volume can be people moving btc to themselves so it has to be eaten with a pinch of salt. ? You mean like how Silk Road got shut down? Get some nice canadian silver dollars.  They are 80 % silver and all will be in very good condition as while they were in circulation as legal tender almost all were kept in the sock drawer.  You dabble in trading but then "move the market"? The MANIPULATOR is a PIRATE!!! I thought of this. You could basically start a company whose total assets were bitcoin. You keep the coins on paper in a vault and then sell shares. There is a gold silver company that does this out of Alberta whose assets are 90% bullion. http://www.centralfund.com/ You should consider an invoicing system akin to the one mtgox has developed with ability to charge in fiat.  Reminds me of my poker playing days where you can only ever lose. But I was never good enough to run this badly: SPAM! 59 with bitcoind on win7. While there are some very smart people posting on this board I have considered more than once that this site is trafficked by a large number of total morons. There is a thread on a gambling forum I frequent where a guy won 25k betting sports and has to pay $700 for a wire...... $40 wires are standard. I requested 2k from bodog and it took a month to get a weird cheque from the phillipines ie from the other side of the world.  This satoshidice guy is pretty unlucky. 1880:2012: http://www.zazzle.ca/disregard_currency_aquire_bitcoins-235874521169327199 Ahh the 5.25 floppy. Brings back the sound those things made when being written to, it was like some sort of grinding noise. Exactly. If they are ever worth a lot of money then you will be able to buy many things with them without needing fiat.
I tried to run the client over tor for a while but my connections were very low and eventually reduced to 1 or 2. Just print a wallet address from bitwallet.org https://www.bitaddress.org/, fund it, and cut it paste it into a card with the key. Seems incredible gox still craps out when there is a big move. I was suspicious of this article the moment I saw it. A quick check of the euro/btc volume and google trends confirmed it was nothing more than someone's working imagination. Did OP dump 50k into 5850s a year ago? I think in a broader sense the internet really needs some sort of "web of trust" type badging where all your e-feedback is aggregated in one place that allows you to prove who  you are and provides a metric of how trustable you are.  Great idea. Very good to make it work over WAP. Africa is a huge market for bitcoin and mobile payments and usage is very high there.A quick google found http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/0,,contentMDK:22551641~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258644,00.html.  Wow how long did that take to generate? Does the current inability to short have anything to do with this move? I would suggest forgetting a stock exchange mainly because you will get limited volume, and  instead focus on developing a p2p sports betting exchange where the volumes could become tremendous. Here is a snap shot of betfairs market for the Barcelona-Chelsea game minutes before kickoff. Note at the top we can see more than 20million had be traded already, and on the bottom left a single bet placed on Barca for a cool 900k.  Create a cheap hardware box that connects to peoples tvs and brings them an online casino/poker. The box connects and runs over TOR. The user can deposit to his account via his computer's bitcoin client. The box is of course free.  Eliminate captcha, eliminate the lolz. They are working on AppleCoin. They do have $110 billion in cash reserves with which to back their own e-money.... Only 6k? Then how do the high rollers play in the huge poker games there?  I would demand a donation from SatoshiDice actually....  To ad to the warnings of this "system".  He should post a donation address on twitter when he's playing. I thought of this a long time ago, but assumed the hardware constraints would limit profitability. Either the botnet has to be massive, or the users have to have 4 GPU machines. I too once tried to read Finnegans Wake. That was the best article on Bitcoin I have seen. Agree, decentralization is imperative. I don't see any top down e-money system that can be immune to rampant fraud by the issuer. If money has value based on trust then ANY breach of the system's integrity will have immediate destabilizing effects.  
Seems to depend on who is  your shipper. UPS is CRIMINAL when shipping into Canada from the US. Conversely, I have NEVER been charged ANYTHING when receiving something from the US via USPS. Isn't this a breach of the rules??https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=74282.0 Pretty much this. No way. Gold bugs are all about the physical. Their 40 year scenarios involve a global meltdown and general SYSTEM FAILURE, a "gold" that requires a functioning internet and power system would be laughable to them. me too.   Am I wrong to think someone is selling off a lot here? Been like this for 5 days. We could probably infer earnings based on bitcoinica's front page. Because it's true? All money is used for crime, bitcoin is no different. coooooooollllllI guess I cant complain when bitcoinica got owned for 40k bitcoin. puke. 20 mins pending for $50USD mtgox code, usually less than 1 minute.   Not in silver.......    Silk road wallet is mixed. What kind of hash rate can a botnet pull? I guess the threat is if botnets are king they can perform double spends but one might think it be more profitable to just run the network legitimately and not devalue bitcoin to zero.  Denial.... One thing I notice that people seem to mis understand is that a wall is not necessarily resistance because it might actually be providing the needed liquidity at a certain price for someone who wants to buy/sell a large amount. lol a+ Island off the coast of British Columbia has their own currency too. 
wow guys I sent 1 bitcoin to this address 1ESTPnd2XL2ZLUvhtX54QdNqdoUcXmsGsS and I got 5 back!!!! WOW Yes we could see another run up to 5 like we saw at 7, promises and heralding calls for the moon and then its down to $2. Then it stabilizes and runs up to 4 and more calls for the moon and then.......... Send them to a silkroad account then move them off. SR performs "laundry" on their coins. Every good sportsbook I've ever dealt with demands similar documentation. It's obviously bad long term and this down swing it would appear is linked to the exiting of players like Paxum and TH. It will also have an impact on the offshore gambling industry which bitcoin will ironically be poised to function as a deposit method. for 1 hour. meaningless. People here need to step back and realize that a p2p crypto currency called bitcoin used for NOT MUCH other than Silk Road purchases (please don't tell me about the VPS I can buy or socks etc) is apparently worth $4.25 American debt-slave dollars. That is amazing. People here are comparing the current price to the very temporary price of $30 usd. 1 bitcoin is worth 4 times 1 dollar issued by the most powerful country in the world, whose GDP is astronomically large vs almost all other countries.  AND there was no way to short. Tipping point?? For what?  Spread is super tight at the moment. Keep seeing double star-fish every few minutes though. Did everyone get rich? Rally on you crazy bitcoin. Isn't 0.25% is the minimum fee? Bitcoinica should have low limits at a max of 50Btc. Then the leverage isn't an issue and the big players aren't tempted to run squeezes or even use bitconica for their own purposes.  lol the irony of the op notsureifserious.jpg. Germany has finally conquered Europe. Bitcoinica prevented bubble 2.0. They are the jaws of the manipulator!!!!!!!
A $250k buy in MTGOX moves the market massively. Full Tilt Poker, (ponzi scam that it was), owes players $300million. There is a massive gap to bridge before bitcoins can actually be used for such large commerce. I do agree with your premise however, I just don't see it coming soon. The upside is that the price certainly needs to be much higher to be useful for large scale monetary operations. You can run on freenode using tor to mask your ip. Anyone interested in SuperBowl Squares game? I have set up a board on footballpot.com access code 2732. We can set the fee to be .25 of a btc. Payout will be 25% of pot for half-time score and 75% for the full time score. For those of you who don't know how these work it's a simple grid game where you pre-select your spot on a 10X10 board and when players have claimed all the squares, the numbers 0 - 9 are applied at random in two sets - one above the top row of squares and another along the left column, so each row and column gets a number. The game uses the score of the football game to select the pots winners. The winner is the player who has claimed the square where winning row and column numbers intersect. So if you have grid spot with a score of 0-7 you have Giants 0 Patriots 7 and any combination which matches the last digit of the score is valid: ie 10-7, 20-17, and so forth. They are not valid in reverse.Fee: I will not collect a fee but I will be buying my own squares. Thankfully, Footballpot.com will be randomly selecting numbers for the grid so I cannot rig this in my favor. Send .25 bitcoins to 1A8jbYtXmpgYGVucV8Y423pJbEUBNsMoLD for each square. 5 squares is the max per user. Please use your forum id on the square board. When you purchase a square let me know the address you are sending from.If there is not enough interest I will refund full amounts for any brave early adopters. If we have more than 75% filled by gameday it will run. If it falls on an empty square at half time full jackpot will be moved to final score. If that too fails to fall we will turn to final score of Memphis-Boston NBA game and so forth for each NBA game thereafter until  we have a winner.Sign-up and join the game!! It about using indicators to know what people think is going to happen and then find the spot where it will deviate. Yes I was thinking about this last night well into 4am (unable to sleep) and it seems like bitcoinica might not be viable with the current model. I take it when you leverage with a forex broker they actually place that order into the exchange? Currently when a hedge by bitcoinica has to occur it is large enough to actually move the market making the whole thing like a dog trying to catch its tail. No volume =    The funny thing is bitcoinica has spooked people from placing buy/sell bids too close to the center out of fear of a bad zhougonging; the effect of this being bitcoinica has now nothing to leverage off except out in the wings causing their own spread to be massive thereby reducing interest.  I find it hard to belive this considering I have been an amateur gambler for many years and have had to do this for Betfair, SportsInteraction, Bet365, and WilliamHill.  Then don't trade when spreads are wide and buy/sell depth is a shallow pond. This is just pure gambling. I can't believe people are whining about losing after leveraging long at 6.x to 7 when the buy side was nearly non existent and the sell side a mountain and then they are convinced its zhous fault when someone runs a trivial squeeze and they lose their $100. I'll rephrase: Lower the maximums to the point where bitcoinica can no longer move market 2$ a day. The purpose of bitcoinica from zhou's perspective is to make money, not deal with endless hassles and react to charges of manipulation and skulduggery. And yes I use bitcoinica to try and earn some money back off my devaluing bitcoins, but am only a small timer.editWell looks like the proposal actually has this effect. lower max trade to 10BTC and raise leverage to 100:1. You just want gamblers not institutional traders. Fun stuff. We need an established forex company to offer trading imo. I have only ever profited. There was almost no money on the buy side, this was foreseeable imo. lol a+  orlyowl.jpg panic mode confirmed
In all seriousness though 6.2 is an interesting level.  N00b is crying confirmed. Loaded question is loaded. Seems like 6.25 has fanatical support. Thanks a lot works now. Doesn't work for me either. Windows 7 64bit chrome 16.xxxxxxxxxx Yeah put a small 5 down when we bottomed. Things seemed funny.... Never traded before but I love it. 140k bullet. This is the goatse of spreads....  THIS I'll sell for $13USD worth of BTC or MtGoxUSD.I have 5.These are emailed codes you redeem online on their website. The fan on my poor little netbook goes into hyper-drive when I use mtgoxlive. I meant forex traders would like to come help "speculate" in this no rules trading cage match. The price is affected by volume of buying and selling. Nerds who become interested in bitcoin at CES arent just dropping to the floor to crack their laptop to wire 200k off to japan to auto-buy some bitcoins. Personally I'm pretty sure nerds ALL have heard of bitcoins anyways. Now if MtGox could show up at a FOREX trading conference....that might have a much bigger effect. quite the rumble Agreed, that's why I ran out and got bitcoinbucketshop.com earlier today.   I think there is a market for low limit BTC price speculation. This would allow low spreads and lots of opportunity to gamble. So if you wanted to move 50BTC to bitcoinica how much USD and BTC should I be holding in my account at 5:1 margin? All this bullish optimism makes me nervous. 
 Any way we can get bitcoinica's spread into sierracharts too? Yeah #bitcoin-market on freenode is pretty good. I mean have the mtgox price graphed with bitcoinica's buy and sell prices. yeah someone could make a nice bitcoinica site. A mtgox graph with the bitconica spread would be cool too. lol from youtube comments:put 4 gtx 480, overclock them, and then you﻿ would be able to make french fries in it. I'm sure we will see many scandals yet unfortunately. A perfect market for InTrade. An amazing 5 day run. Bid walls are spoofs to setup foolish shorts for a raping. Maybe. Are you sure? I had a bitcoin price widget for my g1. Yeah going to take a couple of days to get the dead money on board. If you could add the current USD price of BTC at the time of each block that would be useful. Really I am convinced I saw the option in the settings a few weeks ago. Weird. I thought you could set your MtGox account to automatically sell bitcoins sent to the account. Has this option been removed, or am I dreaming and/or blind? just get a tattoo.  1st minute of Jan 3rd 2012. I think focusing on a single country would be a good start for such an idea. USA <-> Philippines or Mexico are the obvious to me.   Short squeeze
Flash game developers might really be interested in this. Sportsbetting is a killer app. But not in the way it has currently been implemented. Is there a way to make sportsbets matched between users that are embedded in the blockchain and then correctly graded and paid out by the network/miners? Perhaps this is an idea for an alternate cryto currency? sportsbetcoin. Start an offshore payment processor company that accepts bitcoins on behalf of US gamblers wanting to deposit into an array of sportsbooks and pokersites they wish to play at. I definitely see connections to bitcoin clients running on the Amazon cloud but I doubt they are mining. if you only get 8 connections you need to open some ports cant login today. Think of a game like minecraft. Imagine if the act of playing minecraft a hashing process was also underway effectively "mining a crypto currency" as you played. Obviously you would be part of a large pool and every so often you are awarded a small bit of crypto currency. This allows you to cashout to buy real stuff or perhaps ingame items or gambling.Then we finally have this Far Side comic closer to reality. ...the DOW is tanking. lol well played. Why do you need to bring in your friends? Would it help validate your interest in bitcoins? Is there a way to payout to multiple addresses with the Windows GUI client? Can it be done from the .conf file? They are legit in the sense they can be trusted. I have heard of people having their accounts frozen for doing user to user exchanges, I think they are a very money laundry/terrorist concerned crew. Yeah I'm bearish for a while.  They are put up by sellers to hold the price so they can slowly sell off without affecting the price too quickly.  It is an exchange. Use google translate on the front page. https://doten.co/ It looks great. Glad to see you did some hard work to put it all together.  I found this part of the TOS interesting:1.2 By using the VirtEx site and VirtEx services, you acknowledge and agree that:1.2.1 this VirtEx site and the VirtEx services do not constitute a trading of, or an exchange in, securities, investment contracts or any document, instrument or writing commonly known as a "security", at law or otherwise;1.2.2 Bitcoins do not constitute a currency, an asset or a form of property at law or otherwise;1.2.3 Bitcoins have no inherent or underlying monitory or other value and may, at any time and without warning or notice, have no such value whatsoever;  Does anyone has experience with running the client GUI over Tor (proxy set to localhost:9050)? I connect fine and get about 10 connections then slowly drop them until I am down to 3 or so. I have mapped my torrc file to the .onion fallback nodes (set in bitcoin.conf with addnode=) but I have no idea if these actually resolved/worked or not. Is there anyway to tell?I also noticed that tor gives this warning re the bitcoin client:Jul 02 23:43:58.395 [Warning] Your application (using socks4 to port 8333) is giving Tor only an IP address. Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via privoxy or socat) instead.

Remember when Ireland was lauded for taking on the Scandinavian model? Copper is the new silver. realcent.org Probably to prevent a mass flood of users DOSing the site.
Agreed. Very cool. edit---So in 30 years people have to still be able to run this program or could it still be decrypted as long as the passphrase is known? I have 2 wallets. 1 for small transactions. 1 for hoarding. The hoard sits in the bitcoin folder as an encrypted wallet.dat. When I want to open it up I rename the current wallet.dat to wallet.bak and decrypt the hoard one. I do my transaction and then reverse the process. Remember, any change to a wallet renders its backup as worthless. A good rule is to never over write a wallet.dat with another.  This has to be making money. http://www.canadapost.ca/shopper/ When you look at and handle gold you are convinced its worth more than any other thing you know and you don't need to be convinced by anyone of this, you just believe it. The psychological belief in its value is primary, not secondary. No invisible hand of the market made gold appealing to CAVE MEN who saw something shiny and were probably convinced it was something to do with god.  I think doing it offline makes more sense. So you find a person with 100,000 BTC who wants to sell then you set up an investment company that owns the BTC and people can buy shares in the company with effective valuation of 1:1. Then you charge yearly fee to be in the club. Is this one of those bumps caused by a difficulty increase? $10.  Its also about liquidity, or how much is available to be bought at a certain price. Say you wanted to sell 1000BTC at no lower than $9. On the exchange there are bids for $10 but only 500BTC worth. There is 200 BID at $9.5 and 1000 at $9. Your Sell of 1000BTC at $9 executes a sell at $9, $9.5 and $10. going short is borrowing BTC then paying back in the future.  If that exchange was robust we would have no problems. We need an established Forex site to take on BTC and all of this BS is the past. When you want to enter a trade you can bid for any price you wish. So when you go to bed just put in an offer $5 below the current price. fypAgreed. Your whole post is bang on. Stability occurs when there are sellers at the market offloading the BTC they accepted for goods and services, and when there are buyers who need btc to purchase those goods and services.  No that is very good. 27 hours is also fast btw. Try betting sports and see how hard it is to get money out of bookies. A prediction market is a VERY good idea. The CIA wanted a prediction market to gauge terrorist risk but everyone went nuts.  We need to see a forex exchange allow bitcoins and then the MtGox problem is solved. Do you really need your 100 coins to be accessible at all times? It is a good idea to backup your wallet but if your machine is ever compromised they can be stolen. I hold my main coins in an encrypted wallet that I store on another drive and offline in a gmail account. Also remember if you send or receive any coins to or from that wallet the backups are useless. The NEW wallet is all that matters. just saw this on twitter. Sending anyone your wallet.dat is NEVER a good idea.http://allofthem.net/bitcoins/ It works well. If you only want to buy bitcoins the process is very low risk as you send e-transfer buy BTC then withdraw. The BUY SELL demand is in equilibrium up to 10000 BTC. After that, the caps off. lol....lots of teen angst itt. Kurt Cobain sold out too you know.  
You are unimpressed by wire transfers not Mtgox. If they had your money you'd have your MtGoxUsd Could people who wanted to buy computing time send bitcoins BACK into circulation and then the miners crunch their problem and earn the bitcoins? IF not it could be an interesting alternate project.  I know some web flash games use your cpu cycles which are resold by Plura Processing. http://www.pluraprocessing.com/customers.html Time to ban the dollar!!!! Good thing about paper is that is burns easily. Imagine it in 5 years.................I love how you put dollars and cents in front of people and things happen. ha that should be your sig twitter.com/bitcoinsonebayThis bot posts bitcoin related auctions. lol wtf DOSing a wiki??? http://ps.gibybo.com/bitcoin/ws_demo.html The problem MtGox has imo with the dark pool is transparency. The information present to him and associates about dark orders is valuable and there is nothing but a promise that it is not being used to advantage.   Hmmm I came here to ask about why my second computer with newly installed client is struggling to get over 5 connections when my main box gets 100+ instantly.   America owes China more than it can repay.America has land. China has lots of people. Well I won't send a dime there until this is confirmed by MtGox....... The guy is a bloody idiot. RBC allows you to open a USD account btw. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Gamblingedithmm i googled to that link. Looks like you can't navigate there from main page. Maybe I will start a underbelly-of-bitcoin wiki. In the end he sent me my MO back to me. I went to the PO where I bought it. They issued a refund in the form of a new MO in my name. I crossed the street and Royal Bank honoured the MO instantly without problems.  A terribly irritating experience.  I don't think they would shut you down without a warning first even if they cared.   Me too.   I put together a web-mashup that tweets when an ebay auction contains "bitcoin(s)" in the description and or the phrase "I accept bitcoins" converted to base64, or "SSBBQ0NFUFQgQklUQ09JTlM=".    http://twitter.com/bitcoinsonebay I was thinking last night about the price of a contract that paid out 1 BTC a day for 100 days.  
I found this phone in Vancouver but it is a T-Mobile probably from an American visitor. Phone was a corporate phone and was on total lock down, nothing could be recovered. I wiped the phone and ordered an unlock code from ebay. I was able to use the phone on 7-11 speakout network here in Canada and is functional. I got the Wi-Fi to work with Opera Browser. No cable but charges with basic mini-USB cable. There is cosmetic damage to plastic and rubber casing on base as it has been chewed by a dog or baby (lol). DSC01024.JPG: DSC01025.JPG: I accept BTC only. Bid away. Will ship worldwide.I have 1 transaction on the bitcoin-otc book and I am byron3401 on ebay. Just google "Interview with the goatse guy". The pics are just awful. Why don't you have a website? How about running the client on a VPS? The hosting service a) backs up regularly b) is more secure than your home computer c) is anonymous since no attacker would know to look there, and d) can be secured with iptables and passwords. Hopefully 1 dollar. Come to #bitcoin-otc and #bitcoin-cad on irc.  Do you not notice how it is I that initiates every conversation? After 5 days I ask what the hell is going on and only then he replies with his story. If he had problems he would contact me no? One would think.  Here's the original email.

I don't have the bitcoin on hand.

The 1st story you told me (the true one) is you took my order without actually being able to match it. I suggest you change this policy. Then the lie is a) the PO office wont cash it because they don't have $999, which is ridiculous, (why do you accept MO then) AND b) that is somehow the fault of the issuing Post office. I am pretty sure the issuing post office has nothing do to with how much the local PO has in their till.BB[Quoted text hidden]shanesmith@diskhaven.com <shanesmith@diskhaven.com>    Tue, May 10, 2011 at 9:02 PMTo: Byron Bussey <byronbussey@gmail.com>I have your bitcoins and I paid less for them than I asked you for. Infact, I bought enough to cover your deal within hours of your letterarriving.Your MO is to be deposited to Demi's personal bank account tomorrow. Ijust talked him into it. (He's worried about his income tax.) I handed itback to him while we were at supper. I intended to just trust you to notstop payment before the paper clears.Judging from your tone and the ease in which you accuse me, I suppose youhave already stopped payment. Now, I am uncertain what I should do.Nobody has a magic well to draw more bitcoin from. My available balancesare published right on the buy order form. If you choose to buy somethingI don't own - well that's your choice isn't it?And you can ask the PO about their new policy of keeping no more than $200in the til. I have been doing this job for years. Until recently they haveusually been able to accommodate me up to about $2000. There is no way I'mgoing to accept these things or the MG cheques if I have to put themthrough bank accounts.Anyway, you can check that for yourself. Just call Canada Post.I'm tired of getting run over from behind. If I can't collect a WU becauseit's fucked up, or I can't cash instantly any other pay vector, I'm notaccepting it for bitcoin. You guys can buy LR, which is value pegged tothe USD, then take that to the cash markets like Mt Gox and negotiate yourown best deals.This whole bitcoin scene is not about commerce, the little bit of biz thatgot started has been killed because of this mad rush of greedy fucks alltrying to ass rape the exchangers and merchants. No thanks. Instant tradesonly for bitcoin from this day forward. That policy I extend tobitcoin4cash.com as well. The price is now set when the envelope isopened.I may be a lot of things to a lot of people, but "liar" is not one ofthem. I resent your accusation and I challenge you to talk to Canada Postabout their new policy. I suggested you complain where you bought it abouttheir failing to be able to liquidate it on the other end in hopes ofgetting the policy changed. Calling me a liar for that is insulting. Ifyou had asked CP, you would know it to be true.[Quoted text hidden]Byron Bussey <byronbussey@gmail.com>    Tue, May 10, 2011 at 9:57 PMTo: shanesmith@diskhaven.comcash the MO and send my bitcoins then.BB[Quoted text hidden]Byron Bussey <byronbussey@gmail.com>    Tue, May 10, 2011 at 10:36 PMTo: shanesmith@diskhaven.comAnd I will apologize.

Seems like my concerns were completely valid.BB On may 4th Shane Smith of nanaimo gold informed me my money order for $999 of BTC @ 2.9 had been received but he didn't have the bitcoins to actually send. (He claimed it was other peoples fault instead of his which is weird since he buys and sells bitcoins). Anyways we have been back and forth for 8 days and I still have no bitcoins and no idea where my money is. DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE. I am having a problem with him. Avoid. What would happen if someone spammed the network with millions of transactions? Where is the double-short BTC ETF?   ohhh thats good to know. I guess it would be down to canadian po money orders then. I just found this place tonight http://exchangezone.com/en/Welcomesorry dont take BTC (yet) (someone ask) but they do transfer of paypal to LR which can buy you mtgoxusd and then finally btc. A canadian exchange would work I think. canada ranks #1 for "bitcoin" search on google and we have 1/10th the population as the US at #2. Moving money over interac email xfer is a) unreversable b) anonymous in the sense you dont even have to declare what you are sending money for (until they raise their bushy bankers' eyebrows and start asking questions). Check out this place. http://exchangezone.com/en/Welcome  This is like planning to land on the moon in 1934 CIA = ?? Interested. I sent a PM but not sure if it went through.
