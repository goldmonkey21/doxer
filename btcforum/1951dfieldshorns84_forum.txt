The product that we plan to bring to the market is equally advantageous for both clients and companies. For clients, to receive access to the desired goods and services, and for companies, to attract new clients. However, only holders of our tokens will be able to take advantage of the capabilities of the platform. In addition to the extensive features of the platform, they will also be eligible for various types of incentives. We are sure that KYC.LEGAL will offer the market a timely product that is in high demand https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2017/11/08/kyc-legal-project-rolls-blockchain-solution-user-identification/ How does your project incorporate the blockchain technology? Why does this need to be decentralised? Maybe the same idea would probably be more efficient if it were centralised? ICOBox and KYC.LEGAL Join Forces to Streamline KYC Compliancehttps://btcmanager.com/icobox-kyc-legal-join-forces-streamline-kyc-compliance/ Thanks for your support The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility  token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange. Thanks for your support Our product allows the identity of users to be established and documented, so that going forward they can register for any services that require such verification by providing only that information which is required for each individual service. Our solution will help them to quickly and easily become verified users. We have created a product that makes it much easier to comply with client identification requirements. The product is made up of two parts: document verification through a mobile application, and verification of identity and documents with the help of a KYC.LEGAL agent. The entire process should take no more than 45 minutes, which is an all-time record on this market. We have a finished, functional application, which can already be downloaded and installed on both iOS and Android The product consists of two parts. The first part is independent self-verification. This is for those cases when the relevant service only requires users to independently put in their information, without any additional authentication, at the users' personal responsibility. The second part is when one of our agents goes to a convenient place of the user's choosing and confirms the information entered. Going forward, the KYC.legal checks this information against numerous databases, and the user receives the maximum level of verification and identification.The initial information entered can be anything, even false information. However, when the order is processed we check the cardholder and the party who is paying the money. The card is issued by a bank, which performs some sort of check on its end. Potential agents also undergo a fairly in-depth verification process: utilities bills issued in their name and to their address, passport or other identification document, details of bank accounts that have been in existence for at least 45 days (this ensures another level of reliability, we do not want fly-by-night agents). We check those who will then check our clients.A document identification system will be used to check the documents submitted during user verification, and we also perform an AML check and use various other internal and external services that allow us to verify the provided documents.During the second stage of document verification, we use agents who must confirm that the person exists and that the documents indeed belong to him or her.It is similar to the example of receiving a credit card from a bank. The bank sends a courier who checks the recipient and his or her documents.We have working product - mobile appsFor iOS - https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id1299671637For Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.global.id.client Our solution is focused exclusively on client identity verification. Our slogan is "Quick and easy". Making it quick and easy to receive KYC. Using our platform, user verification, from the installation of the application and registration in the system to the arrival of an agent, takes less than 30 minutes. This solution will be applicable to all kinds of different areas of business - exchanges, cryptoexchanges, brokerage offices, banks, funds, online loans, etc. The next level will include, for example, services such as online orders of prescription medicines, or proof of a user's age for, say, the purchase of alcohol or tobacco. In a word, any services that require identity verification. In our model we took into account the international experience in this issue and made a unique application that will allow to convey verification of data almost all over the world! Even if there are any restrictions to it, it can be done this way in the majority of the civilized countries! It is the same with getting your insurance or a credit card online, when you need to prove that the client is real and alive. With the help of blockchain technology we can also take law aspects into consideration. We will announce information about Bounty campaign in new post and share the link here. Stay tuned.

Peter said it right: everybody will be using blockchain soon not even understanding how it runs! and we have to be flexible not to fall off the cart! to keep up with the progress! yeah, Ive also read it, it is interesting, and you know what Im contemplating on right now? How true it is, that in a couple of years blockchain will be a part of our lives, though today very few people know what it is everything is changing so fast From their whitepaper: Fulfillment center operators are owners or lessees of existing warehousing facilities and/or delivery fleet. They provide the space where workers take products delivered by manufacturers and assemble orders. https://ins.world/INS-ICO-Whitepaper.pdf There will be no ​token ​creation, ​minting ​or ​mining ​after ​the ​end ​of ​the ​ICO ​period.that's what they say in their wp i'm still doubtful! what about the ability to pick and choose yourself? sniff? touch? feel?  imho grocery market is rather conservative to be revolutionary changed If the minimum target is not reached, all collected contributions will be returned. Tell us in more details, about research and development. when the ico finishes, will we get our bounty bonus tokens automatically? Ok, I see, thnks why do you need tokens why not use bitcoin which already exsists ? https://blog.ins.world/ins-ico-referral-program-5-a64353c6ae64  -Once a person enters our site via your referral link and creates an account, he becomes your referral and receives a 1% bonus for all his purchases.-Youre eligible to receive 5% of every token purchase made by your referral.-Payment is made in INS tokens. Tokens will be distributed after the end of the ICO.-You can keep track of your referrals and see how many tokens you get from their purchases. my friend said, that all ICOs are scams! How can you comment this? what kinds of rewards are there? so when buy direct from sent BTC? it all sounds interesting! more details on the logistic part of blockchain uses, please and what about transactions? is it about eliminating fees of some middle-men? well, yeah, sounds logical, if the system is transparent there shouldnt be any arguements You ecosystem is going to be decentralized, it is going to eliminate the man-in-the-middle, thats great. Finally, smns going to do it! but who is going to make up arguments in you system?  Thanks for your help, thanks a lot!) And can I buy tokens after Ico?
