I really appreciate the work you are doing on BiddingPond, but I think that the design should be a more major consideration. The way that it looks makes me think more than twice about using the site. Even revamping the logo would make the site look more approachable. I know that you are doing a lot of things at the moment, but you might want to work on making a more neat website design for the future. Me too. I'm new to Bitcoin and I would love to hear what people think in a meeting format. Wow. Awesome. I was just about to see if anybody had made this and then this popped up in my face. Once I get me some Bitcoins I'll see about tipping you.
