URL - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretationThe many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction and denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual "world" (or "universe"). In layman's terms, the hypothesis states there is a very largeperhaps infinite[2]number of universes, and everything that could possibly have happened in our past, but did not, has occurred in the past of some other universe or universes. The theory is also referred to as MWI, the relative state formulation, the Everett interpretation, the theory of the universal wavefunction, many-universes interpretation, multiverse theory or just many-worlds.     --given in 1957.

It was just the basic introduction about bitcoin. I distributed paper wallets and demonstrated use of address and private key, through mycelium. One person was interested about low transaction fee remittances from abroad. I explained him the current bitcoin exchange options.

Crypto-GovernanceBitcoin could be used for bringing transparency to current hierarchical fund distribution for public welfare schemes.Each officer/office will have a official public bitcoin address.Movement of all funds can be traced publicly.This would plug all the loopholes, which are used to steal public money.Legal documents and official communications can be signed by their public signatures. Govt. would just need to keep track of officer's public signature, instead of going through the current process of certification by cca.gov.in . If any misuse of private key happens, then officer will hold full liability, and immediate penal action can be taken.  Govt. can open a public tender for submission of open source crypto-coins, if a new coin is needed according to the terms of govt.As mining would generate coins on the terms of govt., it can be declared as alternative currency. In time, fiat rupee would be phased out, removing the heavy burden of controlling and tracking of money from govt.'s shoulders. A Cryptocoin Regulatory Authority have to be established to authorize and implement popular public demands in crypto currency's source code. Cryptocoin Act may also be needed to be passed to legitimize its usage for public servicesPlease feel free to give feedback and suggestions of what you think about crypto-governance.

Surprisingly BTC/USD remained cool, in the current turmoil of LTC/USD. I have thought on similar lines,this just needs code implementation.First posted at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=112222Order opening,closing and modificationA block-chain is maintained which keeps all valid open orders.A node requesting to open an order sends order quote to the network.The network verifies the order by periodically querying the corresponding blockchain and check that order is sent by the node is less than itsbalance or not.In this way fake orders could be weeded out.A node can modify or cancel the order by querying the network with message signed with its private keys.Orders open could be accessed by all nodes.Any node interested could send request for accepting an order.After similar verification about buyer's balance the order status is changed to accepted.Money Allocation to intermediate nodesOnce order is accepted,the network divides the money to the other nodes such that,the money send to any node is less than the trade amount,that node wants to execute.This trade assignment is sent to both trading parties.They are required to send money to assigned intermediate nodes.These transactions are verified by the network.Intermediate transactionAfter all intermediate transactions are over,the network sends the address of buyer and seller to the nodes which received money from seller and buyer receptively. Until they successfully execute their routing assignment,their trade money is not released from their intermediates.The intermediate node is the random third party node assigned by the network,which handles the trust problem.This assignment is random by the p2p network.There will be a very little chance that some one assigns his own trading router, if the number of nodes participating in it is sufficiently large.Once the transaction from the buyer/sellers to intermediate nodes is verified,the network assigns the intermediate nodes, the address of the party (at opposite end of trade) to transfer the money to that end.Until the intermediate nodes transfer the money,their own trade is locked.At all levels,all the transaction related to an order are securely stored in blockchain,using method similar to bitcoin (SHA-1 or other hash function),to avoid tampering to an open order.Assumptions1. To start the trading, first two nodes should be assumed that they conducted their routing operation. Advantages1.Buyer and seller don't know each other until trade is successfully conducted.2.Using a block-chain,all trading activities can be recorded securely so that trade is not tampered until its over.  Possible Drawbacks1.Tackling of the closed loop deadlock problem.2.Random trade route assignment function has to be thoroughly tested,before implementation. 15 people have till now voted in a poll predicting price range on 26 Jan 2014.

It seems like market has woken up on 6th day from that prediction.If market closes above 774 level today, than that will reverse the downtrend continuing since 16 december 2013 (market was at 792 level).If market surges past the today's resistance band of 774 to 778, then will have chance to reach to 960 level within next 6 days from now.

You have compeltely understood, and your comment is a precise summary of our recent discussion. Thanks for comparing your analysis with mine, and deriving insightful conclusions.There is a chance to cross that RSI support,even after the third bounce (as indicated in your graph)Market would trade between 623 to 778 band till January 9,2014 (if any extreme news doesn't come in this period),although there is chance of break of this upper-band in next 4 days . It can break 705 level bollinger band,due to recent negative volume.My prediction is more or less the same (resistance at 623 level). Markets could easily drop to 634 to 645 in next 48 hours from now. Bitcoin is not illegal in India,but fiat money laundering (through the point, where conversion of bitcoin to rupees takes place) is certainly illegal if established norms are not followed.

Market is continuously sustaining its positive volume, since yesterday.It could reach 695 level in next 24 hours, if resistance band of 615 to 625, is crossed, for at-least 8 hours. The level of 581 to 534 is crucial for BTCUSD market.If market remains below 534 level for 3-4 days then, it would take at-least  more than 20 days to recover to current price level.Short term buy signalIf in next 2 hours from now, 593 to 602 level is crossed,then market could reach 618 level, within next 6 hours from now. As said earlier,if the price stays below 645 - 660 level for next 4 days (till Christmas) from now,then major fall to 215 to 240 level is very likely.

Last two days saw huge movement in the markets. But as given earlier, the bearish movement could not break the support band of 553 to 447, for a long time. For only 1.5 hours, it was below 447 level  (went to 420 level), but quickly bounced back above 447.The bounce back shows great confidence in bitcoin.If the price remains above 645 level,then market can reach to 750-760 level, in next 52 hours. I've registered an account on Nextcoin.org using spndr7 I think I answered this in today's predictions.World govt. are trying to control a thing which was  never created to be controled.

After 10th October 2013 (when the markets were at 124 ),for the first time the uptrend has reversed.If the market breaks 553-447 support band, within next 3 days from now, then it could fall to 212 USD/BTC level. (previously 180 to 293 was roughly estimated by me at start of this thread) Market volume is becoming bearish.If market breaks 750-760 support in next 4-5 hours,then will next support will be only at 553 level. uKSbWXGvtuW3Xv6PJAEng1wFWwabKM33x7Thanks   Corrected my post. If that does n't happen, then market may regain stability, and could also achieve 950-960 level again. But its probability is very low. Downward movement may continue till 553 level, if market keeps falling for next 6 days.If it happens then bounce like previous crash would be difficult and will take more time.All done manually on my experience,thinking to code automatic signal generation  soon. When it is open sourced on January 3, 2014. Then things will be clear 
Market is seeing decline in positive volume.Current stability may end anytime now.Downward movement may commence in next 2-3 days.

How much data storage is provided in 1 Namecoin ? How would a peer to peer system know average cost per GB of a consumer level storage device ?For this to happen,the proof of existence of data had to be periodically checked, in a secure decentralized way. Otherwise the node can verify the block of data for once, and later delete it, and falsely claim existence of the data which it does not have. Instead of rewarding transferable units for solving each block,a fixed data space may be rewarded.This data record would be replicated at all nodes.There would be similar limit to data space,just like limit in number of coins.Data size reward per block would decrease over time.Tokens of authority of any data size can be transferred between peers, similar to transfer of coins.Permanence of data increases with increase in number of peers.This could be very useful for whistle-blowers to buy/mine some tokens and then release anonymously, any document which would be securely stored at thousands of nodes.

If bitcoin was mined in India and it can be proved, it means its domestic.Even if govt. wants to act tough, after significant increase in volume,how will govt. dismantle sites and exchanges on tor and i2p like atlantis and silk road ? Here I have mentioned domestic transaction. Is there a way we can reclaim our language back (writing as it is spelt) instead of following British orthodoxy ? For exampleRam ->RamaKrishan ->Krishana Question asked yesterday in Information Security paper of of Computer Engineering."cryptosystem"  reminded me quickly of bitcoin,and I mentioned it,hoping that examiners are familiar with bitcoins    Bitcoin is a digital commodity.Selling or buying a commodity on peer to peer level is legal,as long as the seller is paying tax for it (if he includes that amount in his income).Registry of a transaction is only needed when the commodity is regulated by govt., like arms,vehicles,immovable property,stocks,bonds etc.If I want to sell a LED TV to my friend.It will be totally legal,if I pay tax, for the money I got.If my friend smuggles LED TV to other country, he would be held responsible for smuggling not me.Assumption: Commodity is created in India and trading is done within India.So, no question of money laundering and illegality.So,If someone proves that certain amount of bitcoin was mined in India, and trade it on above conditions, within India, for rupees,it would be perfectly legal,until the govt. makes it mandatory to register domestic bitcoin transactions.

Digvijay Singh Admits appointing him was greatest mistake of UPA govt. Variable output of the sponge function of SHA-3 function could be used dynamically for SHA-3 coin. Order opening,closing and modificationA block-chain is maintained which keeps all valid open orders.A node requesting to open an order sends order quote to the network.The network verifies the order by periodically querying the corresponding blockchain and check that order is sent by the node is less than itsbalance or not.In this way fake orders could be weeded out.A node can modify or cancel the order by querying the network with message signed with its private keys.Orders open could be accessed by all nodes.Any node interested could send request for accepting an order.After similar verification about buyer's balance the order status is changed to accepted.Money Allocation to intermediate nodesOnce order is accepted,the network divides the money to the other nodes such that,the money send to any node is less than the trade amount,that node wants to execute.This trade assignment is sent to both trading parties.They are required to send money to assigned intermediate nodes.These transactions are verified by the network.Intermediate transactionAfter all intermediate transactions are over,the network sends the address of buyer and seller to the nodes which received money from seller and buyer receptively. Until they successfully execute their routing assignment,their trade money is not released from their intermediates.The intermediate node is the random third party node assigned by the network,which handles the trust problem.This assignment is random by the p2p network.There will be a very little chance that some one assigns his own trading router, if the number of nodes participating in it is sufficiently large.Once the transaction from the buyer/sellers to intermediate nodes is verified,the network assigns the intermediate nodes, the address of the party (at opposite end of trade) to transfer the money to that end.Until the intermediate nodes transfer the money,their own trade is locked.At all levels,all the transaction related to an order are securely stored in blockchain,using method similar to bitcoin (SHA-1 or other hash function),to avoid tampering to an open order.Assumptions1. To start the trading, first two nodes should be assumed that they conducted their routing operation. Advantages1.Buyer and seller don't know each other until trade is successfully conducted.2.Using a block-chain,all trading activities can be recorded securely so that trade is not tampered until its over.  Possible Drawbacks1.Tackling of the closed loop deadlock problem.2.Random trade route assignment function has to be thoroughly tested,before implementation. 8XSpDv1wd6WBPKYhRUKAkUDW8DB6QBRcP3Thanks 1.LTC2.NMC3.PPC MBY77DiRrB7b3Q2WZGVwotVFgLdjMDpESjThanks XRP,BTB does n't end with 'coin'.

Freedom is most important in p2p opensource cryptocurrency,even if it make the its market value (w.r.t fiat currency) swing like a sine wave. Hinduism is a term used to collectively identify cults,customs and beliefs from Kerela in south India to Tibet in the north.These cults and beliefs got intermixed and now share some common link.The term Hindu was used by foreigners (w.r.t India),to identify and name people living,east of the river Indus (Sindhu in Hindi).In time due to distortion in language the word became 'hindu'.So, its a mix of old traditions and faiths throughout the Indian subcontinent (as far Angkor Vat in Cambodia,the largest religious monument in the world) and also the mother of two atheistic religions, Buddhism and Jainism.  It was not early adopters,it was early experimenters or volunteers who were driven by its curiosity rather than greed and contributed to this p2p cryptographic technology. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulationHas anyone tried it ?What are your thoughts on it ?DIY resourcehttp://www.diytdcs.com/Readymade kithttp://www.biocurrentkit.com/ http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2094#WhatIsLargest RSA number factoredRef: http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=3723       http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2093 How can people thinks that they would suddenly vanish after such huge scam. http://www.dailypioneer.com/sunday-edition/sunday-pioneer/nation/tmc-govt-in-dock-chit-fund-scam-burns-bengal.html But govt. control monetary policies by sometimes manipulating forex price of their currencies as they have full control of minting money and its initial distribution.

But it bothers others,some the creator may dump the premine and the market collapses.This happened with many alt coins earlier,like TBX.From my point of view for the third position the contenders are PPC and TRC. http://www.firstpost.com/tech/bitcoins-big-crash-why-you-must-know-about-this-digital-currency-694772.htmlAdvocates describe Bitcoin as the foundation stone of a Utopian economy: no borders, no change fees, no closing hours, and no one to tell you what you can and cant do with your money. Just days ago the total value of bitcoins in circulation hit $2 billion, up from a tiny fraction of that just last year. But late Wednesday, Bitcoin crashed, shedding more than 60 percent of its value in the space of a few hours before recouping some of its losses. Critics say the roller coaster currency movements are just another sign that Bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst. Bitcoin bubble may have burst, but virtual money will rule What about take profit ? Why do you selectively chose the negative point ? It would be better if take profit/stop loss field is also present while making an order.I think this will stabilize the market as people wont panic.If it can't be implemented. What's the main reason ? This image is epic.The world needs sustainability more and more   Governments could try manipulate and control generation and price of bitcoin,that seems a bit farsighted as of now,but it would be interesting when this happens. Governments/UN would be forming IETF like organisation to control and manage their own crypto currencies besides other global crypto currencies.

New alt coins come and disappear after the initial interest and hope.But many people milk this small window of opportunity by collecting/mining and trading off before all the activity associated with it halts.Can someone give strategy for taking out the maximum before a new coin dies out ? Predicting when the death of alt coin correctly is also important.So,the other question is how to decide sense the end is near ?

Glattfelder: Who controls the world ? PPqggg14sW5U8d7171A6SrWPz1AqTE9CRG what may be the reason for this huge surge ? Lesser amount also accepted.PM me if interested. We need to say no to this culture of ignorance.Instead of exploiting the natural resources of poor countries,the world needs to promote sustainable economies, that make the natives self sufficient.Industrialization had legitimized a very wrong concept for rapid growth,that,people can be divided into owners and workers, and this organisation of labour is the best.This model of development will only create greed,jealousy and more violence as already the world saw from the beginning of industrial revolution till now.My suggestions are decentralization of manufacturing and services.High economic and technological growth rate cannot justify inequality,violence and a atmosphere of fear as the natural forces of "survival of the fittest" kicks into everyone.I haven't done anything yet except promoting some awareness.What is the answer to the biggest question of humanity: Should we accept natural selection and keep exploiting as much as we can, or trust our moral sense (which natural selection have given to us) and try restoring equity among people ? Hating rich is the biggest road block in becoming rich and leading a prosperous life.This theory has been in wide circulation recently.The rich world seems so ignorant about the parallel world of people who were less fortunate in opportunities,and those who do not have ancestral fortunes.This parallel world is ignored in such a blatant manner that,it seems that this side of world don't even exists.It may seem very practical to be selfish, in this seemingly selfish world,but this practicality is making us,in a way 'passively sadistic' .We are unable to feel the pain of people,who are suffering right beneath and beside us.  The culture of ignorance teaches us to heartlessly engage in our work and pursuit to become wealthier,ignoring our disadvantaged brothers and sisters.This angst is not for redistribution of wealth,but its for the creating equal opportunities for the less privileged.Innovations should always be encouraged,this doesn't stop us for creating opportunities for everyone to be innovator.Keeping people deprived of opportunities may seem very harmless to the imperialist thinking,but deep within,its enough to cause turmoil and pierce through the impenetrable cloak of ignorance of the unjust richness.The unfortunate thing happening now is promotion of this unjust ignorance as a quick ladder to become rich. Today's volume comparison on BTC-e NVC/BTC - 299 BTCLTC/BTC - 223 BTCPeople still have faith in litecoin and its not dying. NVC is over valued.  Regarding cheapnessCurrent price LTC/BTC = 0.00219                                =0.00219 * 30.5 = 0.066795 LTC/USD                               =(which little less than 0.0669 LTC/USD,its current price)So,its not cheap on absolute terms in USD,its due to the surge of bitcoin in last 20 days,it seems cheap with respect to bitcoin. For some indicators like stochastic volume is not required for calculation.Nice work,but if the trial charting would have been web based it would be great. I looking for stochastic,elliot wave,on balance volume and ichimoku indicators   got 50k XRP.I think 'Opencoin' has given 50K XRP to everyone, who registered before 19th Feb.Must be too huge pre-mine. The trading of alt-currencies are happening mostly without any indicators.But it seems that some pattern is repeated.Currently,I think most of the people trade on past record and market stability.No technical indicators are publicly available unless someone,collects data from various APIs and do bit of programming on it. I some think some people here are already using and predictions of some standard indicators would be quite accurate ? rUusFTWNUDYqKnAg4tiZLTAyRdUMaVFVUG 1CwzSDyNFNc7FjMNp7v5N22ySxRYcitGqn

Read this topic - P2P Cryptocoin Exchange (P2PX) Generally a centralized trusted third party is needed for money exchange,between anonymous users just like escrow.com.I am putting forward an idea to decentralize the trust in the network. The intermediate node is the random third party node assigned by the network,which handles the trust problem.Once the transaction from the buyer/sellers to intermediate nodes is verified,the network assigns the intermediate nodes, the address of the party (at opposite end of trade) to transfer the money to that end.Until the intermediate nodes transfer the money,their own trade is locked.At all levels,all the transaction related to an order are securely stored in blockchain,using method similar to bitcoin,to avoid tampering to an open order. Yes, you are correct.The two instances of the crypto-coins you are buying and selling,plus the order chain.  Order opening,closing and modificationA block-chain is maintained which keeps all valid open orders.A node requesting to open an order sends order quote to the network.The network verifies the order by periodically querying the corresponding blockchain and check that order is sent by the node is less than itsbalance or not.In this way fake orders could be weeded out.A node can modify or cancel the order by querying the network with message signed with its private keys.Orders open could be accessed by all nodes.Any node interested could send request for accepting an order.After similar verification about buyer's balance the order status is changed to accepted.Money Allocation to intermediate nodesOnce order is accepted,the network divides the money to the other nodes such that,the money send to any node is less than the trade amount,that node wants to execute.This trade assignment is sent to both trading parties.They are required to send money to assigned intermediate nodes.These transactions are verified by the network.Intermediate transactionAfter all intermediate transactions are over,the network sends the address of buyer and seller to the nodes which received money from seller and buyer receptively. Until they successfully execute their routing assignment,their trade money is not released from their intermediates.Assumptions1. To start the trading, first two nodes should be assumed that they conducted their routing operation. Advantages1.Buyer and seller don't know each other until trade is successfully conducted.2.Using a block-chain,all trading activities can be recorded securely so that trade is not tampered until its over.   Order opening,closing and modificationA block-chain is maintained which keeps all valid open orders.A node requesting to open an order sends order quote to the network.The network verifies the order by periodically querying the corresponding blockchain and check that order is sent by the node is less than itsbalance or not.In this way fake orders could be weeded out.A node can modify or cancel the order by querying the network with message signed with its private keys.Orders open could be accessed by all nodes.Any node interested could send request for accepting an order.After similar verification about buyer's balance the order status is changed to accepted.Money Allocation to intermediate nodesOnce order is accepted,the network divides the money to the other nodes such that,the money send to any node is less than the trade amount,that node wants to execute.This trade assignment is sent to both trading parties.They are required to send money to assigned intermediate nodes.These transactions are verified by the network.Intermediate transactionAfter all intermediate transactions are over,the network sends the address of buyer and seller to the nodes which received money from seller and buyer receptively.

Just add tor hosting with it, then it becomes truly p2p.It solves the problem of having to trust a middle broken between the advertiser and the visitor of the ad,the payments are direct.There is no money paid to an advertising platform. Ya you got me .If IP addresses are attached to verification data sent by the visitor then node changing wont help,but as in bitcoin anyone could have many node ids and can use proxies these are problems with every P2P network but even with this drawback  you till have to concentrate on the ad page.Captcha will randomly change after specified time by the client by uploading to the server hosting the captcha-image. The ad-page will have a captcha code embedded to it.While starting the ad,the advertiser will manually input the text value of the captcha code in the hash client.The client will concatenate the "verification text code" with the link url and calculate with hash with any hash function.This hash will be kept securely in the client and will be used to verify with the hash send by a visitor for claiming the ad money.The visitor will only know the url of the ad.He have to view the ad in-order to get the ""verification text code"" placed in the captcha image on the ad-page.The visitors client will calculate the hash similarly and send it to the advertiser.The advertiser maintains a check list to ensure one node click only once for a ad.In this way fake clicks can be dealt effectively.After all the verification, at the last payment is made by the bitcoin client. Please take time to read.Its morning here still no feedback Did I posted under wrong subsection,it should be moved to dev subsection ? The diagram image width is too large to fit in so may horizontally scroll if image appears cropped from the right.This could bring bitcoin in circulation among advertisers who want to target bitcoin users.Drop in your comments regarding its feasibility. At the Advertiser endFor each new ad created, the advertiser will have hash value of the link url and a verification code of the verification captcha image on the ad page.This will later be used for visitor verification.The link,bitcoin address of the advertiser,worth of the ad,number of clicks remaining for the ad and the price per click will be floated in the ad network.At each nodeAll the ads floating in the network will be collected by every node.A list will be maintained showing the information of the price,ad link,and bitcoin address of the advertiser of all ads.If the ad is clicked,the verification code is manually inserted by the user of the node and its hash is caculated with the link ad url.This hash is sent to the advertiser for verification.Verification at the advertiser's EndThe hash sent by the visitor will be matched with the initially stored hash value of the ad-campaign.For ensuring a single hit by a node,the advertiser will maintain a list of advertisers, who successfully clicked in the ad-campaign.BTC transation will only be initiated, if visitor is not found in the 'Already visited List'.Thus unique hits will be ensured by the members of the ad network and all payment would be peer to peer and fully automated between the advertiser and the visitors.On completion of Ad-campaignAfter the number of licks required by the advertiser is fullfilled,then a termination request will be generated by the advertiser and one by one from each node 'the completed link ad data' will be deleted.This can only be initiated by the advertiser.

I think by now people above would have got reply what other p2p currencies exists. It was june 2010,I was very excited by idea of decentralised p2p currency,I gave it a try and run the client on mining mode on my 1.66 Ghz CPU laptop.Just in one or two days I got earned 50 BTC.At that time in just few days I made 450 BTC but did not knew that in one year 1 BTC will be 30 $.I spent all at so cheap rates I dont even remember now. Its too costly for sending small amounts that why started this thread here. I dont have BTC.  At least one more individual is needed to play against you. 12000 GG and 1000 IXC's are sale for INR . Interested them pm me. Direct exchange between INR to all crypto-currencies and major e-currencies like Liberty reserve,Alert Pay etc through NEFT to Indian Bank Accounts.Too much deduction occur and its very hard to buy and sell crypto-currencies with INR.All Indians present in this forum who want to sell there BTC and Alt currencies are welcome. I will be hosting warzone 2.3.9 version game and the winner would get 500 IXC.It would be a 4 player game and I will be one the players to judge the game as spectator mode is not present now.Response is awaited. Registration process should be simplified.At the registration page no where it is written that, ¨Password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one digit, one lower case character, one upper case character and one special character.¨If the user makes a mistake in following the undisclosed terms,he is again required to enter all data with captcha code which is already validated.Just now I left all fields blank, the same message was repeated - ¨Password... ¨. Registration form validation needs some improvements.Please don´t take this as criticism. This is what I need,unfortunately there is no such service currently available. May be when bitcoins becomes popular in India then it may happen. I bought bitcoins with INR (Indian national rupee) the rate at tradehill and bitcoin-central is around 480 INR/BTC. (about two weeks ago now 250 INR/BTC)The current market rates : 1 USD =49 INR  1 BTC =3 USDAccordingly BTC should be priced as   1 BTC = 3 X 49 = 147 INR (around 150 INR).There is huge gap .My 985 INR at tradehill were exchanged for just got me just 9.32 LR USD.After cutting all charges it should have been around 16 LR USD.  Sold out at 0.00016 BTC/IXC . Cause I have only some bitcents and will use it for inter currency trading and btc-e.com do not accept IXC now.Litecoin, FBX,TBX and GG can be used instead . Price can be negotiable . Of all cryptocurrencies SC 2 have been undoubtedly the most user friendly inbuilt miner for any newbies to p2p currency world.  Thanks mining started . Now total active workers 45 and 666 kH/s (half evil   ) !!
what is the port to be used for mining ? Direct trading between exchangersThe different wallets can be combined to a single trading interface to facilitate direct p2p trading between the both parties.For conducting trading, certain amount of the currency to be traded will be locked in a pending order.The trade conducted could be tracked easily as it becomes the part of the permanent respective block chains.The price at which the exchange took place.It would be associated with two transactions in two blocks of the currencies exchanged.A mechanism is needed to transmit the "price of exchange between the peers" to every node running this trading software in a similar way like p2p transaction becomes a part of the common block-chain which cannot be changed.I think this is needed to make it secure.P2P inter-currency trading can become a reality. I am thinking to code my strategy on MQL 4 see if it works on real-time. One thing I forgot to mention.Using Zulu-trade, you can invest your money in the best performing user of this website or the one who matches your safety criteria. I read this whole forum.I found 2 things very strongly put here :1)People are skeptical .2) 1000 $ is required.@Maria and people :I have also developed a trading method which is currently being run manually.The profit is not as large as Maria's but the draw-down is less.You can check my record on my thread15.44 % profit in 1 month . Details You can check out my daily trading records at  http://tivr.inI am not hiding my strategy fully but here is a brief summary :My strategy is centered on inflection point in the forex-chart, which is supported by positive signals in charts of higher periodicity.I use a combination of 4 indicators DMI,Stochastic Fast oscillator, Parabolic Sar and Elliot wave . The positive thing is that there have been no exceptions to the prediction of my strategy (given the market condition is fairly stable).My strategy is not influenced by any other strategies,I made my own strategy based on charts of netdania.I have an answer to widely asked question in this thread -> "Why don't maria discloses here algorithm or strategy ?"Even if it is assumed that a strategy is highly efficient,when large number of people use the same technique.The answer is clear, its effectiveness will decrease and this decrease will be proportional to the percentage of people using the same idea in the whole forex market.  And lastly, forex is risky, one spike can make you nil unless you create only limit positions, with a defined stop-loss .   Eagerly waiting .

Variable does not mean endless.If the maximum limit is made linear function of number (without any proportionality constant) of nodes then if there are 2 nodes in the network than maximum coin generation cannot be more than 2 coins until more nodes join the network.This will add scalability to the network in the sense of limit to coin generation. 1) Changing the process of mining coins    In the current model of bitcoin block is solved which is a mathematical puzzle.Instead of using cpu power (with some luck) as the unit of     creation,transfer delay between the nodes is made the basis for minting of coin.       It may be done by trying to solve some network topology problem by all nodes on basis of chance and its relative position in the network.2) Making the maximum limit of coins variable    Making the maximum coin generation at any time as the function of number of nodes at that time. Take a look at what the newly started site btcsurf has to offer.100 times of that quoted by me. Deal #1 [CLOSED]Was the minimum price 0.05 $ too much.I calculated its actual market cost. The need arises cause its hard to trust and get acquainted to anything new.Furthermore for a layman concept of a cryptocurrency  is an odd one to grasp initially. Intermediate support platform for converting BTC Donations1) This would help websites to accept BTC donations without   hassles of going through conversion of BTC to popular    payment methods like PayPal or moneybooker.2) The donation accepting site displays the BTC address to which    donations are to be sent.         This address is provided by the Intermediate   Platform,which will forward the converted money at the    current market value back to the donation accepting website. I did n't get you.What is "content farm" ? Its for those who want to buy and sell bitcoins in miniscule amounts. Deal #1I am opening auction for 1000 btcsurf credits or page hits (web traffic) starting from 0.05 BTC.The bidding closes at 0330 hrs GMT 20-May-2011 . Its about exchanging credits generated by auto-surf programs for directing web traffic to particular web-page for bitcoins and vice-versa.Web traffic could be purchased or sold for bitcoins .If a person wants to purchase web traffic for his web-page then he must supply the web-address of that page to the person who is giving him traffic. I liked the sarcastic optimism in the last line of the article. I think credits can be sold also in case a person A wants 1000 hits from different users. Person B can sell can make reference to person A's webpage and sell his credits as 1000 hits. 
I just figured out the answer for your first question  - "Where does that money come from ?" .0.8 credit is generated for viewing or hitting one page but 1.0 credit is required for getting a single hit to any user's page.The difference 1.0-0.8=0.2 credit goes the admin.I think this the potential difference which drives it.If someone puts  money externally into it to increase probability of showing his/her ads,then it also becomes part of the credit-exchange system of btcsurf . It should be of good brand and should be able to write data to memory card. I have a question regarding credit policy.1000 credits = 1 BTC or 1 USD ?? I think there s a problem when starting the auto-surf mode.It initiates with "Bitcoin randomizer pre-launch" page and then crashes. I created my account.If want to join just now, do me a favor .Join as my down-line using this referral link http://btcsurf.com/?ref=5 Seems Impressive. I just read some parts of the article at slashdot . I think people having become over-cautious to anonymous and untraceable nature of bitcoin.Every good thing in the world can be used to the worst.A part from the article --"The article talks about the untraceable, un-hackable nature of BitCoin. They can't be locked down like PayPal, and the article predicts that governments will start banning them in the next 18 months."If any of the govt. bans bitcoin,that itself will propel bitcoin's popularity to the masses and it will upon them to think whether it is good or bad .Another set of comment the articles arising from ignorance --Cornwallis (1188489) writes: "BitCoin should be banned because we want our currency to be as safe and stable as the U.S. dollar."jandrese (485) writes:" I could only read that article with the late night salesguy's "These collector coins can only go up in value!" voice, but the content of the article was all about how it's clearly a scam and the author is obviously in on it."Is there a author ?I think we need to clear misconceptions .  Sorry I spent all my bitcoins   Is jamendo.com  already contracted for accepting bitcoins ? I am thinking to do the same. A group of people can raise funds(on equal basis) for getting a common popular file compressed.The collected funds will be paid to the compressor and the compressed file will be later shared by all fund raisers. I used that for getting a file video file compressed . I think with MeGUI you can customize many things . Payment of 0.99 BTC sent to 1LEH9eyoPjuHtzmFX5SKzhbg8kcrnpyhBr.Thanks for compressing and uploading.Now you can stop seeding if you don't want to.This time the quality of video was really worth 0.99 BTC, for saving my 1 GB bandwidth and downloading time.

I think its less than current market rate ? Anyone interested ? Transaction through Liberty Reserve. kgo ...You are new to bitcoin.Last year during May,difficulty was very less,I mined 450 BTC within 15 days using official bitcoin client and at 1 Mhash/s.At that time bitcoins were not as worthy as they are now so  wasted them by converting to liberty reserve at very very less rate.I have seen it rise from nothing to a dollar within a year.When I say to my friends that the thing which was running in my computer would have earned me 20000 INR(Indian National Rupee) if I have not wasted, then but they don't believe.But it's amazing !! Using GPU ATI Radeon HD 5570 for bitcoin mining will be profitable ? Thanks for the info. Engery efficiency can be assumed at 0.018 Mhash/ Joule . What is the minimum Mhash/sec threshold to generate profit from mining.My electricity cost is 0.1 $/unit  (kWh) .  My GPU ATI Radeon Xpress is clocked at 399 MHz .Can you suggest which GPU is best for mining ? I have amd turion 1.6 GHz dual core cpu with ATI Radeon 1150 Xpress.Is there no point in mining bitcoins for me .Currently I am getting 1.4 Mhash/s.Could this increase ?
I have 1.25 Mhash/s hashing capacity,how much btc should be generating using btcmine in an hour (avg) ? There are obstacles, like if I wanted to trade bitcoin against any major currencies using the most popular forex trading platform, like MT4/MT5,i will never be able to do so,as acceptance of bitcoin is unlikely in near future by any govt. authorities. Besides this it would also lead to inter-currency decentralized trading platform as stated in topic decentralising currency exchange. Trading bitcoins with real world currencies is some what cuber-some due currency interconversion and surcharges imposed.Besides this forex regulatory exchange boards around the world would never accept bitcoin as it can not be regulated.Therefore to facilitate trading  without any major limitations we need another p2p currency just like bitcoin.It may be totally different in implementation or functions, but must be purely p2p.If another p2p currency comes up it would be nice to see inter-currency trading between them . There are currently 3 services in public domain or more ? I have recently joined btcmine, but was wondering out of all these pooled mining services which is the best one ?btcmine,deepbit or mining.bitcoin.cz ? Experiences from my pastIts important to look good for being goodIf you look shabby and dirty you are not in the grace of God.I was taught this in class 1,but my mind refused to accept it, simply cause a person can be good even if he/she doesn't wear good clothes or have a good outlook.Once again in class 9 th,I was confronted by a similar question that, who is there who do not want to look good ?.I don't know how some of my friends pointed me out,that,I was the one,who did n't want to look good. I denied it. But actually wanted to say that, looking or dressing smartly is not he criteria at least for me .That thing in class 1 remained with me forever.Gradually I realized that looking good was the everything  self-confidence,social-esteem,status and every other thing related with personality.Looking good  is far more important than being good,at least this what the world perceives .But still my mind refuses it cause I may be  stubborn. Ya right bitcoin is here to stay .Very good perception future of this techie world. Easeus Partition Manager is the best option if do not want getting into the mess of booting rescue distributions and committing some serious damage to your disk due to lack of knowledge.I have used parted magic/gparted/ and Easeus partition manager.I would suggest Easeus Partition Manager cause its works seamlessly and its free also.

My college seminar report on Distributed file processing @mpkomara Everything can not be justified in terms of economic benefit. @ john : Why don't you object when developed countries like England or France win soccer World Cup.There also whole country does not move their fingers or feet in contributing to their team's victory but they celebrate and take pride.Is their a prejudice ?Here in India thousands compete to get in the national cricket team.Every kid knows how to play cricket.Its said that cricket is a religion in India which surpasses all other religions of our country. We everyone in the team.We want this cup desperately.We have waited years to see this day.Why shouldn't we proud ?   India won the Cricket world cup after  28 years.Its a time of celebration in our home country.I have never seen people so jubilant.It might be unnoticed for the world but 1 out of 6 people in world witnessed this event (Indian subcontinent population-> 1.5 billion people) Nice to hear someone from india Selling CPU cycles on individual basis was initiated by 'cpushare.com' website but don't know what happened to it .Selling CPU time/cycles on contract basis in exchange for bitcoin will boost its economic activities. SpotCloud is more structured and corporate entity,the bitcoin model should be peer 2 peer on small  contract basis .
For example if someone wants conversion of p2p TV series ZENITH (published on vo.do on bittorrent network)from HD 720p to (x264 392 kbps using highest settings of compression) .x264 video encoding specifications  like umh range=64,subpel estimation=9, etc.Original File 720p 1.18 GBmagnetlinkmagnet link to fileContract open initially for few bitcoins .The output of the CPU work may be uploaded to the job assigner directly or released in public (via torrent or other p2p network) as per requirement. This work may be general compressing or encoding of data which takes huge time .The coding requirements would be made by the job assigner and on completion of the job before specified time and with all conditions met,payment could be released to the job doer. Some times people need CPU work done but they don't have time  or expertise to undertake it.So, if they can get their CPU work done in a market situation like bidding the contract to get in done at the lowest price just like freelance contracts. This open market may be beneficial for both the CPU work contributor and the job assigner .

The marketing boom which started in 1960's in US and Europe spread to India and and other developing nations.This starteda urge for profit as fast as possible.The result is a well known fact--Focus was shifted from content and efficiency to outlook , presentation, and glamor.This led to our current problemWhat has become important is glitz,covering,'pseudo-etiquette','pseudo-manners' and 'pseudo-behaviors'.Underneath the mind of a well groomed corporate leader there exists a human being which is being enslaved by the blind following of the cruel capitalism.This tendency has created a rift between the corporate sector and the real nation .Magnitude of the rift in thought and belief can be seen from the fact that still more than 20 million people in the country are still below poverty line,and countless graduates,post-graduates,and doctorates are jobless not because they were not suitable for job but due to our lineage towards smooth ,sober,'urban style of seeing and judging talent and intelligence' .The is one more aspect to what we see and and perceive things around us.I just want to ask a simple questionwhen you see a 4 year innocent child begging on the streets or any of the other public places...what do you feel about them---most probably you may think that--what a pity, how cruel their parents are,if they can't feed and nurture them, they shouldn't have brought them in this world to beg.But by doing this ,we try to make ourselves understand that in no ways we are responsible for their misery.One more question,what if some of themthe above said deprived ones are prodigy,will their talent will ever be recognized by our generous and well mannered corporate world. The answer is no in a certainty .The outcome of this rejection will make them take the wrong path in life and become criminals(turning their unrecognized talents to wrong direction) .Showcase of corporate charityMany organizations in the corporate world have their charity funds and sister organizations claiming that they are for the benefit of the masses.But the reality is very different,these people who try to gain sympathy from the society and government are the least bothered about the underprivileged.This showcase is for increasing market penetration by creating false a atmosphere of generosity and humanity.It is said that what a man does in his leisure shows his character and intelligence.What would you expect this Etiquette World to do in their leisure read page-3 columns of the newspapers,attend parties,discotheques,nigh-touts,visit malls-multiplexes and read English elite literature(esp. those of foreign authors)...after such selfish activities they complain of bad government,politics,corrupt administration,failure of system and collapse of law and order.It is a fact that they are the first one to shy away from their democratic responsibility of voting.They don't give a damn about anything until they are directly affected .How can charity and nationalism can be expected from them.If they do,its mostly for publicityand fooling the nation and some where they are fooled themselves.Assassination of science by the discriminatorsIt is no wonder that after the World War II,innovations that would have changed the fate of the world never happened.It may seem disgusting to link the etiquette and demands of the corporate world with the failure of science and originality,but I am sorry its undeniable.Just citing few examples--all the major development in the world happened before the world war II invention of electricity,radio transmission,aircraft,combustion engine and we should not forget that all the modern amenities that we use have their genesis in this era..besides this all major theories like Theory of relativity,Max Planck Theory,Theory of uncertainty,Atomic model that changed the course of the world were developed during this phase.After 1945 there started a trend of modification and up gradation of existing things and ideas.People stopped question the previous data and knowledge and closed the chances of greater endeavors.This is the direct consequence of the pseudo-etiquette imposed by the corporate world and its requirement of being as perfect as a machine.Due the market demand and job insecurities people started to undermine their inborn talents and interests and molded themselves in corporate leaders(who are in no way leaders they only lead to amass wealth and to create an impeccable wall which separates them from the less privileged).This was the final nail in the coffin of science.Lets hope that science will rise again from its ashes and talent will be recognized and respected again.

More over I want to also sell small amounts of BTC  for Libertyreserve . does coinpal accepts Liberty reserve ? Sites like bitcoinmarket and mtgox has increased the minimum amount to be traded to 10 $ .Where could I trade for smaller amounts with guaranteed third party ? Its indeed a great idea .If some how constant evolution of the system from simple to complex objects (just like in natural evolution) then results could be ground breaking .The co-creator of Kademlia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia),the basis of  DHT (modern p2p file sharing alogorithm) has initiated--Tonika  System for distributed social routing(from official page http://5ttt.org/A (digital) social network, which (by design) restricts direct communication to pairs of users who are friends, possesses many of the security properties (privacy, anonymity, deniability, resilience to denial-of-service attacks, etc.) that human sociaties implement organically in daily life. This is the only known decentralized network design that allows open membership while being robust against a long list of distributed network attacks. We call a digital system with such design an organic network and the security that it attains for its users  organic security. Organic networks are extremely desirable in the current Internet climate, however they are hard to realize because they lack long-distance calling. Tonika resolves just this issue.Long-distance callingAt its core, Tonika is a routing algorithm for organic networks that implements long-distance calling: establishing indirect communication between non-friend users. Tonika is robust (low-latency, high-throuhgput connectivity is achieved in the presence of significant link failures), incentive-friendly (nodes work on behalf of others as much as other work for them), efficient (the effective global throughput is close to optimal for the network's bandwidth and topology constraints) and real-time concurrent (all of the above are achieved in a low-latency, real-time manner in the presence of millions of communicating parties).Some application areasInternet (bandwidth) neutrality. Freedom, no-censoring and no-bias of speech on the Internet. Scalable open Internet access in all countries. User ownership of data and history in social applications. Cooperative cloud computing without administration. Etc.Open sourceTonika is an open source project on Google Code and a chunk of theory on arXiv.State of affairsTonika is, in fact, already functional with a good list of features. It is engineer-friendly but not user-friendly just yet. I am inviting organizations, who think Tonika may be of use to them, to contact me for potential collaboration. At the same time, I am inviting enthusiastic hackers (with C/C++ knowledge) to join the team and help me make the final steps to turning Tonika into an end-user app.About the authorPetar Maymounkov, author of Tonika, is previously known as the co-creator of the Kademlia DHT (distributed hash table).

I thought of this peer to peer mesh network over bluetooth .It will be feasible in a scenario such as a class room or a any crowded public place, 30-40 people sitting in close proximity within the range of bluetooth(~10 m).Like shared usage of other devices software and hardware services.The main problem is that of routing algorithms as the units are changing position constantly one may join the mesh or leave the mesh at any time. This potential is yet to harnessed .    you are correct PTC is more effective in real traffic sense .
Even if each computer contributes 100MHz of clock processing then in a typical p2p swarm of a  popular file there more than 1000 peers contributing more than 100 Ghz of of cumulative operating power .The delay may be in piece transmission both raw and processed . I being a member of third world country, India, feel that the term "3rd world" is in a sense derogatory to the national pride .Being called underdeveloped is acceptable .May be I am too nationalistic .The two victors of WW2 divided their allies into 2 groups,those who did not participated in WW2 were kept in the 3rd world .But I am very sure that if WW3 ever took place,then India will participate and the first,second world countries like Australia,Canada,Norway,Sweden, etc wont participate and even after that they wont be called a fourth world countries . like share ratio there can be introduced a new concept of "process ratio",rate of supplying processed data with respect to the rate of input of unprocessed data.Together share ratio and process ratio will help in identifying  trusted peers just like in torrent network . One of the evident application in case of audio/video processing it would be such that,after the p2p processing,2 files will be available for the new clients joing the p2p network .The will have choice between quality and file size of the media file .  We propose distributed processing using bittorrent protocol.In this method we will divide the file to be processed into pieces and process each piece separately and distribute the processed pieces in the network till all the pieces are gathered .In this way bittorrent protocol may greatly help on distributed computing .Possible Applications ---1.File compression2.Media compression  (Audio/video)3.Analysis of Raw data once i had it .But i have been never able repeat it .I was guessing can the chances be increased ?

It is only little bit slower than paq8pf (at least on my machine) while providing better compression ratio. Special data (wav, bmp, jpeg) are compressed with original model (with same speed and ratio as paq8px)Download linkhttp://spndr7.fileave.com/fp8_v1.zip http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html--official linkZPAQ is a proposed standard format for highly compressed data that allows new compression algorithms to be developed without breaking compatibility with older programs. It is not patented. Software is open source (GPL v3) except for the libzpaq API, which is public domain.    * libzpaq 2.02 - Contains the ZPAQ library API, ZPAQ specification, reference decoder, the zpaq archiver, zpipe file compressor, and zpsfx self extracting archive stub. To install: create a folder c:\zpaq and unzip all the files there. See enclosed readme.txt for further instructions. Last updated Nov. 13, 2010.The ZPAQ specification and reference decoder define a format for highly compressed data. It is designed so that when better compression algorithms are developed, archives compressed with older verions can still be decompressed with the newer version and vice versa. This is achieved by storing the decompression algorithm in the archive header. Algorithms are based on the PAQ context mixing model with optional postprocessing.libzpaq is an application programming interface in C++ for reading and writing ZPAQ compressed data to or from files or objects in memory. This part of the software is public domain.Download latest versionhttp://mattmahoney.net/dc/libzpaq202.zip It helps in avoiding censorship . Visit http://yacy.net/Technology.htmlYaCy harvests web pages with a web crawler. Documents are then parsed, indexed and the search index is stored locally. If your peer is part a peer network, then your local search index is also merged into the shared index for that network. If a search is started then the local index contributes together with a global search index from peers in the YaCy search network.Peer-to-Peer NetworkingYaCy peers continuously exchange index fragments using a Distributed Hash Table. Index data can therefore reach the local peer even before a user query is submitted, but of course it is still loaded from the remote peer network too when needed.
