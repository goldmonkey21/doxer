Can somebody please help me. I need to get my bitcoins, it had already said I received a transaction of 60.10 btc but after trying my wallet.dat in ubuntu and on windows xp its saying that the 60.1btc transaction is 0/unconfirmed. Does this mean I'm never getting my bitcoins? If so, this will really turn me off of bitcoins, if you can lose your money like that its not worth putting trust in. But I'm a big supporter of bitcoins and I hope I will be able to get my bitcoins back.EDIT: I forgot to try and rescan, should I try that again? It seemed to work last time, but then when I tried my wallet on another computer it started saying it was still 0/unconfirmedI ran debug and this what it says:CTransaction(hash=7ce4777f56, ver=1, vin.size=4, vout.size=1,nLockTime=0)  CTxIn(COutPoint(26fee4493b, 1),scriptSig=3045022100e77d09ff11d111)  CTxIn(COutPoint(bc91897b3c, 0),scriptSig=30460221008eb0a4729865aa)  CTxIn(COutPoint(bd4f6e582b, 0),scriptSig=3044022021b4b4741a2f7658)  CTxIn(COutPoint(08d4b9609e, 1),scriptSig=3045022100806bf4e48a9899)  CTxOut(nValue=60.10000000, scriptPubKey=OP_DUP OP_HASH160bbc005077614) On a related note... The 60btc transfer went through. Then I had problems with windows. So I ran a copy of Ubuntu off a USB drive and used my wallet file on the linux version of bitcoin. It said that the 60btc hadn't been transferred! Weird. I will try loading the wallet into another windows computer. So I've been wondering if there will be a version of bitcoin available for Chromium and Google Chrome OS. I've been trying out Chromium and unfortunately java does not work on the newer releases yet (though I've heard it should support it when a final stable release comes later this year). I wonder if the linux version could be made to work for it. Here is what the debug said:CTransaction(hash=2dd49b23d9, ver=1, vin.size=1, vout.size=2, nLockTime=0)   CTxIn(COutPoint(582aa5010e, 0), scriptSig=304402205909c6c767e6c709)   CTxOut(nValue=3.80000000, scriptPubKey=OP_DUP OP_HASH160 34eb3874ccb3)   CTxOut(nValue=0.05000000, scriptPubKey=OP_DUP OP_HASH160 10cfe3c1d805) Thanks! Rescan got my 60btc transferred. The .05 btc is still 0/unconfirmed though. Tried it last night. I shut down bitcoin and then moved all but wallet.dat to another folder. I started bitcoin back up and it connected and I left it run for an hour, no changes. This morning when I turned my computer on bitcoin says: Error loading blkindex.datSo... I guess I will copy my wallet and try and reinstall bitcoin. Any suggestions?EDIT: I reinstalled bitcoin and moved my wallet over and its still giving me the blkindex.dat error, what should I do? Restoring the blkindex.dat from last night just made it give a different error (NSt8ios_base7failureE CAutoFile::read : end of file bitcoin.exe in CMyApp::OnUnhandledException()) and it won't load. After restoring all of the files and not just wallet.dat and blkindex.dat it loaded again. Hopefully it will work now but its still at 0/unconfirmed for the .05 btc transaction but my 60 btc transaction still hasn't shown up yet. Still having the same problems. It says 114059 blocks So I got a new netbook and I wanted to transfer some things to my new bitcoin account. I got .05 btc from the bitcoin faucet, and it detected and stayed at 0/unconfirmed since that day, its 2 days later and its still at 0/unconfirmed. But worse than that is that I transfered 60 btc from my other account to my new account, it says that it sent but it hasn't even detected it on my new account. Did I lose my 60btc? I have wanted to suggest an update feature as well. It seems every time I update to the newest version a new one comes out a week later. It would be nice to see the ability to be notified when new versions of bitcoin are available, and if possible, to also download or update bitcoin from the application. But mostly I would just like the program to be able to tell me when a new version is available. Could you please post the NCAA bowl games if possible. I was kind of disappointed that when I started using BitcoinSportsBook they stopped taking bets on NCAA football games. Anyone have any ideas for raising money for wikileaks? Some governments have frozens Julian Assange's bank accounts, paypal, and credit cards. I think Bitcoin would be a great way for them to get donations. Anyone think its a good idea? I would like to start accepting donations for wikileaks but I don't know who to contact at wikileaks about getting them to accept bitcoin donations. Oops, looks like I wasn't running the latest version. Thanks. Ok well I've read the FAQ and understand that with the average modern PC it could take about 3 weeks to generate 50BC (at least that is how I understood what I read). I have a decent PC, nothing great. Anyways I've been running bitcoin since July 12. Within 1 day I generated 50BC. Now ever since then it hasn't generated any BC for me. It appears to be working fine, the usual X number of khash/s, says its Generating, 8 connections, 79933 blocks and counting, and 6 transactions. I can send and receive BC with no problems. So my question is, why have I not generated any BC since July 13? Am I just being impatient or what? Did the rate of BC generation change? Am I doing something wrong? I didn't really change any computer habits, so whats the deal?Sorry if this is a stupid question. Yeah I am going to add a payment options page to make it a little more clear. Currently the instructions on Bitcoin payments are listed on each individual product with the other types of payment information. I am going to try and come up with a way to make a shopping cart or Order Form for Bitcoin users, and I also want to try and offer discounts to those who pay in Bitcoins instead of US dollars.I plan to offer more types of seeds, of all kinds, but particularly interested in medicinal and ethnobotanical plants, but will also offer some more common plants like echinacea, cacti, and perhaps carnivorous plants. I also am planning to start offering dried extracts and tinctures soon. Will be adding some new products in the next few days.I'm really excited about Bitcoin and I really hope it becomes more widely accepted. I've been trying to spread the word and get more people to start using Bitcoin. I accept bitcoins, for a list of my products go here: http://qextracts.ecrater.com/ for Bitcoin pricing and to place an order click on the product and then click Ask Seller A Question. Currently I sell seeds but plan to offer more seeds and herbs and extracts.
