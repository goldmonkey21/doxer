If you want help from me about events that didn't happen, there's clearly a need to get the information straight.You seem to constantly shift your goal posts. You either have no real clue what you are looking for (or at least fail to express that clearly) or you are trying portray yourself as a victim in hope someone will refund your coins (scammer tactic).I personally want to beleive you just don't know what you are doing and I want to help you with that by clarifying some things.You don't even remember your old username or anything that would lead me to be able to identfy a transaction as sent to you. Give me precise information and I might dig up my old wallets and look them through.Information I was able to gather so far:Taken from here:You used a Linux live environment. When the timeframe (Summer 2010) is correct, your wallet had to be an old version Bitcoin Core (former Bitcoin QT). Electrum and Armory were the first alternative wallets I remember, and both of them did not show up before 2012.You tried mounting the filesystem of the hard drive in question, but did not post the error message.You did not post your results of "sudo fdisk -l" on the drive in question.You claimed you were able to find wallet file signatures by searching for hex values of wallet types that such an old Bitcoin QT client just could not have used, but did not explain how you were doing this.You claimed you entered a 12 word seed to generate the wallet, but again, back then this BIP wasn't even proposed, let alone implemented (Bitcoin QT did not have hierarchical deterministic wallets back then). You did not mention whether you still have that seed somewhere.You said "the drive doesn't have a partition that is bootable. It looks to me like a antivirus program might have gotten a hold of it and encrypted it" which is just all around bullshit (source). You don't need to boot it. Usually there's no AV involved in Linux systems and even when they don't mess up your bootloader or whatever. It's hard to comprehend how this sentence can even come from a Bitcoin user, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt, since you might just not be that tech savvy.Taken from here:You are asking for the encryption type of Bitcoin QT 0.2.0 wallets. Bitcoin QT didn't have encryption until 0.4.0, though. That doesn't prevent you from claiming you know the passphrase.You're claiming that it did have encryption of a single private key, but not the whole wallet, which just was never implemented anywhere. One could still give you the benefit of the doubt that you are just not technically educated enough to know the details of wallet encryption.Regarding this:If you actually need older versions of Bitcoin QT to experiment, you can find the source code of them here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases?after=v0.2.9Regarding this:Now you're saying your wallet didn't have the keypool feature implemented yet, which was implemented way before the seed feature you were talking about using before.If it wasn't a hierarchical deterministic wallet (= seed), you either had the private keys of your "lost" coins in them or not, there's no way to generate new keys in a deterministic way, that's why your phrase "The wallet that I used was before they done the 100 keys, that's why I would like to make more in case change is sent to them" doesn't make sense to me. maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.You then want to acquire copies of blockchain files here and here which doesn't help your problem at all. Either the network agrees that a transaction has happened and it is included in the blockchain (and therefore observable via a wallet or blockchain explorer) or it agrees that it didn't happen (e.g. orphaned block and tx never re-included in block (which is highly unlikely)) and in this case you just plain and simple never received the coins and your whole effort to regain them is futile.Now to the thread we are currently in:Ignoring that the workflow you described is false (you don't enter TX IDs and you don't need to hit receive to receive coins, just to generate an invoice), if someone sent Bitcoins to an address that corresponds to a private key which is contained in that wallet, opening this wallet will give you access to the coins, no matter if your client has been online or offline. If you can't see that transaction on a fully synced client or via an block explorer for the Bitcoin network, you are not able to use these coins as they do not exist. This is what the others have been trying to tell you.Here you are claiming you haven't found your wallet yet. If this is true, all the statements regarding the decryption via pywallet have to be false. Please make up your mind.A few questions for you:What is your mother language? I feel like it isn't English and maybe some information is lost by translation. If it is German we might be able to remove translation errors from the conversation. If not, maybe someone else is able to talk to you in your native tonge.Someone already brought up the X-Y-problem. Could you please clarify what you are actually trying to achieve in one or two sentences? I've read your whole post history and you are constantly switching between the things you want from the community.Have you found your wallet.dat file?What is it you remember about the "password"? Was it actually a seed (12 word phrase) or an unlock key for an ecrypted wallet?Please stop posting confilcting information and try to form explicit sentences that arent subject to (mis-)interpretation.EDIT: Be aware, after some further PM correspondence, it's seeming more and more likely Oldnewbie is trying to scam someone. I'm not 100% sure yet, but the things he claimed did never happen (and cannot have happened, encryption and wallet seeds were not around during that time). Yep, that's me.I did not.Since I didn't set a up a raffle or anything like it, you did not sent me money, at least not for a raffle ticket.I did some over-the-counter trades back then, so if we actually traded (not that raffle ticket nonsense) this might actually be possible.I certainly didn't.The only incident of this happining was the BitDNS/NameCoin Bounty, where I pledged to donate 1000 BTC initially, but actually ended up donating only 292 BTC (which back then was roughly around 6000 EUR). It wasn't a very nice thing to do back then, but I apologized and from the few guys that actually pulled through with their pledge, I was one of the biggest donators. Vinced actually promised to share around 30% of the donations with the rest of the BitDNS team, but last I checked they were still in his addresses.This whole thing is actually something I wanted to talk about for a long time, but it seems off-topic, so I will probably not do this here.Link to the BitDNS bounty thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2072.0I know I can't prove this, but this account still has the same ownership as when it was registered in 2009. And I do not remember calling anyone on Skype for such a thing (especially because my English skills back then weren't exactly in a great shape).I'm still not sure what it is that you are trying to achieve, but either you are some kind of scammer, or one of our memories is failing us. I'm a friendly person, so I assume the latter.If there's still anything I can help you with please let me know. I did not talk to you on the phone for several hours, and this I know for a fact. You've been accusing me of maybe not being the real SmokeTooMuch in PMs, but I think you are just confusing me with someone else. Okay, now I am here.I do not remember setting anything up for you or helping you with anything. When did that supposedly happen?Also, I am still unsure of what exactly you are trying to achieve. You do not have a wallet, an address, a transaction ID or anything else that is narrowing down what you are trying to find. Is this correct? Ungefährer Zeitrahmen? Gibt's ein Bonus-Programm so wie es gyft, egifter und giftoff anbieten?   Interessanter reddit post hierzu: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3f9il8/bitcoindev_a_summary_of_block_size_hardfork/ und http://bitcoinsberlin.com 'nuff said Just replying to say that OP's method is actually a bit more complex than this. I'm not sure if what lu-Media writes here is actually sufficient, I haven't tried it. Na, ich hoffe doch, dass ich diesen Eindruck während des Interviews nicht erweckt habe.A -> B != B -> A Ich glaube nicht, dass das auf jeden so wirkt. Ich würde sogar behaupten, dass du mit dieser Wahrnehmung ziemlich alleine stehst.Die Filesharing-Netzwerke stellen nunmal den Ursprung aller P2P-Netze dar und jeder, der damals schon 'Geek' war, hat sich damit beschäftigt und diese Netze auch genutzt.Man denke nur einmal an BitTorrent und die ganzen Linux-Distributionen, die auch heute noch darüber verteilt werden.Mir gelingt es ehrlich gesagt nicht nachzuvollziehen, warum das Interesse an Filesharing den Eindruck eines 'Kiddies' erwecken sollte. Mycelium Local Trader geht zum Glück noch.Hier 'ne Map: Link Danke für dein Verständnis für die langen Antwortzeiten. US-only I'm pretty sure I still have it.I guess I'm going to check my old wallets for this game (not really for the reward, just for curiosity) and while I'm at it I will look for the aforementioned IP-based transactions.EDIT #1:yep, thanks for that EDIT #2:I just checked all topics with an ID <34 and none of them contains such information. So it appears that, in fact, this was the first public transfer-by-IP-address transaction, at least on this forum. I haven't checked the old mailing list or forum on sourceforge, so I can't guarantee for it, though. when is this contenst going to end?EDIT:sry, TL;DR https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/46e101bfc027339afc82825472e7e9bb36d8a5fbaa9dd6fbc45b5dd7ffd67fe9/analysis/1396646034/freshly triggered by Avira Free AV
Hi,mein Avira hat eben während dem Laden der blockchain einen Virenbefall gemeldet:Konkret geht es um die Datei .../chainstate/237995.sst (AppData\Roaming unter Windows).Der Zugriff wurde sofort gesperrt, sodass Bitcoin-Qt abgestürzt ist, und die Datei vermutlich nicht vollständig geladen wurde. Ich habe sie trotzdem mal bei VirusTotal geuppt:https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/46e101bfc027339afc82825472e7e9bb36d8a5fbaa9dd6fbc45b5dd7ffd67fe9/analysis/1396646034/Hat jmd Schadcode in der blockchain hinterlegt um bei Usern AV-Meldungen zu triggern?EDIT:Danke an fronti von #bitcoin-de für die Info:-> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=554738.0 Well, we had our Alpacas, so let them have their Doges.We tried the same, but haven't been as successful, because back then, nobody knew what crypto-currencies were.Flaming isn't helping the crypto-currencies-community. Stop pretending this is a war between different crypto-currencies. We all want this thing to be successful. Thoughts? Clearly the bitcointalk nanashi___ isn't the real one, but has anyone tried to contact the real nanashi___? Could he prove possession of Mt. Gox user data?P.S.: I don't even know whether these chat logs are real or not. Look at the account history of goblins_. According to his posts he already had contact with the hacker. Last time it was clearly fake and this time it is again.I will pm you about this. Well, if you have the data, why don't you make one entry of the database public? I volunteer.I allow you to publicise a copy of my verification documents here in this thread, just black out all the personal details like name, address and so on.If you won't, you clearly aren't in possession of that database. His English was really bad, that's right, but he said he had contact to the russian hackers. Maybe one of them has written the text for him. We can't say that for sure. But it is another hint for all of that being just a scam attempt. new info:Interesting how this is the opposite of what he said before.Afaik nobody has proven to be in possession of such data yet (please correct me if I'm wrong).I'm starting to think this is all a scam. Then prove you are in fact in possession of the database. Sure, someone who joined late 2013 invested ~65.000 USD worth of bitcoins to buy that. Oh, and would you look at that, that very same person claiming to have bought the file for the incredible price of 100 BTC also has a very trustworthy trust rating of "-4: -1 / +0(0)".Well, Mr. I-will-resell-it-and-will-definitely-not-scam-you, why don't you prove that the database is in your possesion OR that the sell offer from nanashi___ was infact a legit one, because until now I haven't heard anyone who can confirm that. I don't see the point of a checksum of a file, published by a cybercriminal, that has proven to contain malware.But in general, I agree with you. Just a quick addendum: You also have to be able to trust the source of the checksums, which in reality is harder than it sounds.http://noncombatant.org/2014/03/03/downloading-software-safely-is-nearly-impossible/EDIT:Here's the link to the decompiled code of the TibanneBackOffice.exe done by a kind redditor:https://3d3.ca/ijKOh.vbs#eV7i3HIliI93y+UR Ever heard of 0-day exploits? I don't have to prove anything here. All I'm saying is, that there is a risk you should not be willing to take if you don't know exactly what you are doing.Files handed to you by cybercriminals can not be trusted. Garantierst du mir das auch? xDEs geht hier gar nichtmal unbedingt um identity-theft, sondern darum, dass du morgen/in einer Woche/nächstes Jahr nach hause kommst und dir jmd die Bude leergeräumt hat, weil er wusste wie viel Bitcoisn du hast und wo du wohnst. Oder noch schlimmer, du wirst mit einer Waffe bedroht, weil jmd genau weiss, wie du aussiehst.Du hast einfach keine Vorstellung davon, was Menschen mit krimineller Energie (und/oder enormer Verzweiflung) im Stande sind zu tun. Wer garantiert das? Hätte ich etwas mit diesen Daten vor, wären sie mir den Preis von ~65.000 $ vllt wert.Man muss sich nur mal vorstellen, was man mit dem Wissen über jemandes Kontostand und seiner Adresse/seinem Aussehen alles anfangen kann. Plain and simple: If your service can get hacked, it is your fault. Period. Nobody's accusing him of being a criminal because of that, but if you can't keep your users data safe, you deserve their resentment. Assuming you can be 100% sure that the software you are using to open these files (or to unzip them) is absolutely secure and there are no exploits for them known to mankind. Which you can't. Okay, hier scheint ein kleines Missverständnis vorzuherrschen. Die Kommentare, die du zitierst, beziehen sich meines Erachtens nach auf die geleakte Mt. Gox Datenbank, aka MtGox2014Leak.zip.Die Nutzerdaten, die nun scheinbar zum Verkauf angeboten wurden, beinhalten jedoch die personenbezogenen Daten inkl. der zur Verifizierung eingereichten Dokumente (Bankkonten, Führerschein, Pass, Perso).Zu letzterem gibt es afaik noch keine Bestätigung. The TibanneBackOffice.exe executable is wallet stealing malware and here is decompiled proofWelche denn? Ich weiss nur von einem, der nachgefragt hat und dessen Daten waren angeblich nicht in der Datenbank enthalten. The TibanneBackOffice.exe executable is wallet stealing malware and here is decompiled proof http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/200v89/magicaltux_wish_they_would_move_faster/EDIT:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=509001.0Seems to be backdated, but I'm not sure.
The TibanneBackOffice.exe executable is wallet stealing malware and here is decompiled proof Those are just assumptions of yours. We don't know if the database contains any unverified account. Distributed all over the world doesn't mean useless, you can easily repack national databases and sell those to other interested parties. And even if "most people" are poor, there was a multi million dollar trading volume on gox, so there are at least some valueable targets. Don't let yourself get fooled, it's not him. That's actually the only valueable data. Not givig that away for free doesn't necessarily make them good guys. if anyone is actually purchasing the database you should think about handing it over to law enforcement.and btw, just a quick reminder that for all we know goblins_ could trick us into thinking he has part of the database so he can scam others trying to buy it from him. (just sayin')EDIT:Since he used a mail account at freemail.hu that actually sounds reasonable. I don't want to encourage people to buy the databse, that's why I don't feel comfortable posting it. But it isn't too hard to find if you followed the posts about the gox leak. according to my source (which does not have to be correct), this is his public key: too bad you've just registered and therefore can't be trusted. Considering there a several bitcoin millionaires (fiat), I guess it is worth ~65.000 USD to identify some of them. Well, someone could try contacting him via an email including a tracking pixel of some sort, but I doubt that would bring up any useful information (proxy, vpn, not loading pictures).He was using an email from freemail.hu, so maybe someone could try to contact them and close his mail account or maybe hand over the ip records to law enforcement, but then again, I don't think this will have any real effect.The truth is he will probably get away without punishment and maybe even with a lot of BTC... I won't post the link to the source or his email address, but apparently nanashi___ is selling the Mt. Gox user database:I hate those blackhats ~.~EDIT 11.03.2014:EDIT 19.03.2014: Quelle: http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Einkuenfte-aus-Bitcoin-Mining-koennen-steuerpflichtig-sein-1981629.html Kurzer Beitrag vom SWRhttp://www.swr.de/landesschau-rp/gut-zu-wissen/bitcoin-geld-internet-zahlungsmittel/-/id=233210/did=12551306/nid=233210/m763js/index.html Grundsätzlich wäre es schön, wenn wir Informationen zu spezifischen Szenarien zusammenstellen können.Da wären zum Beispiel:Szenario 1: Privatperson kauft Bitcoins und verkauft sie dann wieder.-> privates Veräußerungsgeschäft: Einkommensteuer auf GewinnFreigrenze für private Veräußerungsgeschäfte von 600 Euro(Quelle: https://blog.bitcoin.de/steuern-fuer-bitcoins)Ausnahme: Nach einjähriger Haltefrist entfällt Einkommensteuer.(Quelle: http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Bundestag-Bitcoinverkaeufe-nach-Haltefrist-steuerfrei-1897814.html)Szenario 2: Privatperson mined Bitcoins und tauscht sie gegen staatliche Währung.-> ? (Einkommensteuer auf Euro-Wert zum "Schöpfungspunkt" abzüglich Werbungskosten, Freibetrag 256 Euro)"Eine offizielle Einschätzung gibt es bisher nicht. Allerdings sollten die Gewinne aus dem Minen als private oder gewerbliche Einnahme gewertet und mit dem persönlichen Einkommenssteuersatz berechnet werden. Grundlage hierfür ist der Preis an dem Tag, an dem die Bitcoins erzeugt worden sind, es gilt ein Freibetrag von 256 Euro für private Miner, Ausgaben für Strom- oder Hardware können selbstverständlich abgezogen werden. Ungeklärt ist, ob Bitcoins von Minern umsatzsteuerpflichtig sind"(Quelle: https://blog.bitcoin.de/steuern-fuer-bitcoins)"Mining im privaten Rahmen kann als gelegentliche Tätigkeit gelten, die Einnahmen als Einkünfte aus sonstigen Leistungen. Bei denen kommt es darauf, wie viel man damit einnimmt: Bei bis zu 256 Euro im Kalenderjahr sind sie steuerfrei. Ansonsten greift der persönliche Einkommenssteuersatz." + "Besonders wichtig wären dabei Umfang und Zeitpunkt des Zuflusses der Bitcoins. Um den zu versteuernden Wert der Bitcoins zu ermitteln, gelten bei Privatleuten "Endpreise am Abgabeort". Dass heißt, ein privater Miner könnte den zum Zeitpunkt des Bitcoinzuflusses gültigen Wechselkurs an einer Bitcoin-Währungsbörse wie zum Beispiel Mt. Gox angeben. "(Quelle: http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Einkuenfte-aus-Bitcoin-Mining-koennen-steuerpflichtig-sein-1981629.html)Szenario 3: Gewerblicher Verkauf von Waren/Dienstleistungen gegen Bitcoin-> ?Vermutlich greift hier die selbe Regelung, wie bei "normalem" Geld. Der Wert der erhaltenen Bitcoins ist vermutlich für den Zeitpunkt des Vertragsabschluss in Euro umzurechnen.(Quelle: Eigene Einschätzung)Szenario 4: An- und Verkauf von Bitcoin im gewerblichen Maßstab (große Summen, regelmäßig)-> ?Szenario 5: Kauf von Waren/Dienstleistungen gegen "geschöpfte" Bitcoins-> ?Vermutlich selbe Regelung wie bei Szenario 2.(Quelle: Eigene Einschätzung)...usw.Ich glaube, wenn wir die Informationen auf diese Weise strukturieren, sind sie am einfachsten zu verwerten. Dann kann nämlich jeder einfach seinen speziellen use-case nachschlagen und wird sofort fündig.Was haltet ihr davon? Interessant auch folgende Links:[18.10.2013] heise.de: "Einkünfte aus Bitcoin-Mining können steuerpflichtig sein"Zitat: "Die im Juni von der Bundesregierung gegebene Einschätzung, dass Kursgewinne aus dem Handel mit Bitcoins für Privatleute nach einem Jahr Haltefrist steuerfrei sind, greift bei geschürften Coins nicht. Um als privates Veräußerungsgeschäft nach § 23 EStG zu gelten, müsste laut Ministerium zunächst die Anschaffung des später veräußerten Wirtschaftsgutes erfolgen. Beim Mining findet keine solche Anschaffung statt."[17.08.2013] heise.de: "Berichte: Finanzministerium erkennt Bitcoins an"[27.06.2013] heise.de: "Bundestag: Bitcoinverkäufe nach Haltefrist steuerfrei" Absolut. Vielleicht sollte man den thread aber noch als sticky markieren. Das ist er ja soweit ich das erkennen kann noch nicht. Hi Leute,worüber ich mich wirklich schon seit längerem ärgere, ist, dass es nirgendwo eine zentrale Anlaufstelle in Sachen deutsches Steuerrecht und Bitcoin gibt!Könnten wir vielleicht alle Informationen diesbezüglich in einem Info-Thread zusammenführen und diesen als sticky markieren?~~Smoke Bei Bitstamp hab ichs jetzt mit Kontoauszügen, auf denen meine Adresse steht gemacht.Elektonische Rechnungen werden weder von Bitstamp noch von Mt. Gox akzeptiert.Vllt sollte ich es bei Mt. Gox nochmal mit der normalen Rechnung von Amazon oder so probieren.EDIT: Bei Mt. Gox hats jetzt doch geklappt und zwar mit ner eingescannten Rechnung von Amazon (und einer Stromrechung als .pdf). Wie soll man sich eigentlich verifizieren, wenn man keine physischen Strom-/Telefon-/...-Rechnungen mehr bekommt?Bei mir kommt alles digital als eMail.Mt. Gox sagt auf der Verifizierungs-Seite, dass sie keine Kontoauszüge akzeptieren.Also, Frage: Wie verifiziere ich mich ohne "physical utility bill"? Mein Trading-Volumen überschreitet 2.500 im Jahr.Also halten wir mal fest: Sowohl Mt. Gox, als auch BitStamp und Bitcoin.de verlangen in meinem Fall eine Verifizierung.Local, bzw person-to-person, werde ich ebenfalls mein angestrebtes Trading-Volumen nicht durchbringen können.(Treiben sich bekannte "Großhändler" hier im Forum herum, die an soetwas interessiert sind?)Sieht so aus, als müsste ich mich dann wohl notgedrungen bei Mt. Gox und/oder BitStamp verifizieren lassen. Soviel zum Thema Anonymität bei Bitcoin-Zahlungen 
Meine Kontodaten werden ja auch zwingend zur Zahlungsabwicklung benötigt.Eine Kopie meines Ausweises, auf dem sowohl ein Lichtbild, als auch meine Adresse und andere Daten zu meiner Person (Größe, Augenfarbe, ...) darauf steht, jedoch nicht.Was ist mit https://www.bitcoin.de/? Weiß jemand wie das da abläuft?~~Smoke Hi Leute,hab schon seit ner Weile keine Bitcoins mehr verkauft. Vorher immer über MtGox gemacht, die wollen aber mittlerweile, dass man sich dort verifiziert.Wo kann man derzeit am besten Bitcoin gegen Euro tauschen, ohne seine persönlichen Daten hinterlegen zu müssen (mal abgesehen von den Kontodaten)?MfG Smoke Wann genau bist du denn eingestiegen? just for the protocol: kiba has returned the money he got back from mybitcoin to the pledgers.please don't answer to this thread, it's very old https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/TradeWe started end 2009 with zero exchange possibilites and we had no idea what one bitcoin could be worth. Now we have hundreds if not thousand of bitcoin-accepting businesses, we have several exchange markets who operate in different countries with different state currencies. We build a community with thousands of people all sharing the same ideal. We made that almost all the internet-affine people know about Bitcoin.All the products you listed where supported by huge profit oriented business and none of them was the first product of their kind.Seriously, I could go on and on.Saying Bitcoin is at it's end because it's not the worlds #1 currency yet is just offensive to everyone who is really involved with the bitcoin community and is totally ignoring what we, as a internet community have reached. We have started a freaking revolution via the internet, how can you just ignore such a thing?Feel free to leave us at any point, but don't think Bitcoin has reached it's zenith yet. I'm here for the full 4 years and I can prove otherwise. This is correct.To be honest, I don't know anymore. I think I was really into decentralized encrypted p2p file sharing networks at this point and was looking for less restrictive (more underground ) payment processors, because, let's be honest, paypal is very convenient, but it's politics suck hard.EDIT: oh, and I was totally anti-authoritarian at this point, informed myself about alternative political directions and so on, so the whole idea of peoples money and not state money fit pretty well into that.pm sent.BTW: I guess I was in fact the first German bitcoin user. At least I haven't met any German bitcoiner who was in the game before me. Can anyone confirm/disprove that? Unfortunately I don't have anything to contribute.I'm one of the oldest members of this board and actually had the chance to communicate with Satoshi, but all this communication was via forum posts.If you want to know more about what kind of a person he was (and propably still is) and what his ideals and ideas for bitcoin have been, I recommend to read his forum posts, beginning with the oldest:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3;sa=showPosts;start=520(don't expect any personal stuff, it's mostly dev talk, but you see what he thought bitcoin should be like) ~120 Euro zwischen Low und High, was ist heute passiert, dass sich der Bitcoin-Wechselkurs halbiert hat? facebook isn't the place to share files  I just added all of you, but nobody seems to be online.

This were the old days Actually nobody was interested in this auction back then.10k BTC would be quite a lot money today  Danke für die Info! Hi,is anyone willing to try to build up a darknet again?I don't care about the network technology. Alliance, WASTE, DC++, anything is fine with me.I have a new connection (DSL 32k) and something what seems to be a static IP.Soooo, who's in ?  Steht das Angebot denn noch? @Müller:Hauptsache mal an Beta-Software rumnörgeln.Unsere devs haben mit Bitcoin wirklich ein sehr gutes System geschaffen und wenn der Client dir nicht passt, steht es dir frei ihn zu verändern (da Open-Source und MIT lizenz) oder einen komplett eigenen zu schreiben. Wenn dir dazu die Fähigkeiten fehlen, solltest du hier lieber einen anderen Ton anschlagen. Hi, thanks for your pm, kiba.Since I gifted the 500 BTC for a good cause, I guess I won't make any repayment claim here.If the money shows up again, use it wisely for the interest of the community.Anyways, does anybody know who the domain holder of mybitcoin.com is?who-is says tucows.com, which seems to be who-is protection service.Has anybody ever mailed/talked to the mybitcoin admin? Are there any contact details?And can it be considered, that mybitcoin won't come to live again?The service does not seem to be offline that long, so I don't know whether it's just technical problems or serious theft.Make sure to let us know if something happens on that case. Hm, my mining.bitcoin.cz rule seems to be wrong, buit I can't see the mistake.Can anybody please check that ?
Sry, aber dein Post spricht für sich.Du denkst a) dass nur weil du es als schlecht empfindest, es für jeden schlecht ist/schlecht erscheint und b) hast du keine Ahnung von Silk Road und von dem was dahinter steht. Eine .onion-site lässt sich nicht wirklich DDoSen, außerdem schadest du damit dem TOR-Netzwerk.Statt so einen Unfug zu schreiben solltest du lieber deine Regierung davon überzeugen eine Legalisierung einzuführen.Prohobition verändert weder den Bedarf noch das Angebot und führt nur zu gesundheitlichen Problemen, sozialer Ausgrenzung und finazielle Unterstützung von kriminellen Vereinigungen (echte Kriminelle, die nicht nur Drogen handeln, sondern auch bei WAffengeschäften und Zwangsprostitution ihre Finger im Spiel haben).Der einzige Weg um das "Drogenproblem" zu beseitigen ist die vollständige Aufheben der Prohibition. Und das sehe nicht nur ich so. Wenn man sich die Studien der letzten Jahre ansieht (UN-Drogenbereicht etc.), kommen immer mehr Leute auch in höheren Schichten der Entscheidungshierarchie zu diesem Schluss. Ok, I tranferred a total of 292 BTC today. I apologize for not beeing able to transfer the whole previous pledged amount of 1000 BTC. This might help you:https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=499.0 https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9347.0 http://dot-bit.org/Dot-BIT_Project:Site_supportIs this the right address ?And do these things apply ?I've thought about it and I guess 20 BTC really is too low ...But before calling a new amount, I want to clear the things above. It's the opposite.I was pledging one carrot. But to get you that one carrot today, I have to pay as much as for 10000 carrots back then.Next time I will say I pledge whatever X USD will be in Bitcoins when it is finished ... Wenn du mit "unsere" die Leute meinst, die Bitcoins nutzen, dann gehören da nun mal eben auch die Silk Road user dazu.Außerdem ist es mir grob gesagt scheißegal was ein 0815-Mensch von Bitcoin hält. Ich nutze es wegen seiner Vorteile und wenn ich es dann eben nur mit Geeks und Dealern tauschen kann ist mir das auch recht.Der ganze Thread ist einfach nur Blödsinn, weil er das faschistoide Bild unterstützt, dass Drogen schlecht und alle die keine Drogen nehmen besser sind. Und gefährdet wird hier auch nichts. Bitcoin wurde als anonyme Cryptocurrency entwickelt und so dollte man sie auch nutzen können. Silk Road ist außerdem schon wesentlich länger als eine Woche bekannt. Ich habe ein anderes BIOS draufgeflasht, das mir größen Über- und Untertaktungsspielraum gewährt. The pledge was half a year old. Bitcoins weren't worth so much and I just wanted to support this project a little.1000 BTC currently are worth >20000EUR... Ich hätte mir gestern beinahe meine GraKa zerschossen.Dachte ich lote mal die Grenzen des machbaren mit dem im CCC eingebauten "Auto-Tune" aus.Pustekuchen, das Ding hat meine Karte ja mal sowas von übertrieben übertaktet.Nach ca einer Stunde (unbewachter) Laufzeit hatte ich abgebrochen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatte das Tool meinen GPU-Takt bereits von 750 auf 960MHz angehoben ! Ein absolut unrealisitischer Wert unter Belastung ! (Hatte dann auch erstmal riesen Grafikfehler trotz Zurücksetzen der Einstellungen...)Also lasst es euch eine Warnung sein: Das Tool ist grober Unfug ! Alles was unter 85°C bei der GPU ist, ist für mich akzeptabel. Ich habe meine 4870 mit RBE und WinFlash geflasht. Allerdings, wie der Name schon sagt, unter Windows.RBE hat tolle Einstellungsmöglichkeiten was den Lüfter betrifft. Vllt sollte man die Seite ersteinmal fertigstellen, dann überarbeiten und erst dann veröffentlichen  Alles reine Glückssache. Ich würde einen Pool ohne Gebühr empfehlen.An alle Anfänger: Beschäftigt euch doch bitte mal damit, was genau Bitcoin eigentlich macht, dann erübrigen sich solche Fragen. Sry, aber wer kein Englisch kann benutzt Bitcoin doch wahrscheinlich eh nur um Geld zu machen.Außerdem nimmt bitmarket.eu KEINE Gebühren und alleine dafür könnte man ihm so eine Übersetzung schenken.(Wenn man es denn unbedingt in Deutsch will. Ich verstehe nicht wozu das gut sein soll und es würde nur den Eindruck erwecken, dass der support des Deutschen mächtig ist, was aber nicht stimmt. Die Jungs sprechen afaik nur Polnisch und Englisch.) Wenn ich sowas schon wieder lese ... Sry guys....But the system is up, right ?So where exactly should those 20 BTC go ? Scheinbar müssen wir Deusctehn auch immer ne Extrawurst haben.Ich werd jedenfalls weiterhin hier rein posten: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=484.0  Solange du deine wallet.dat iregndwo anders gespeichert hast sollte das gehen.Sonst ist nach nem Neustart nämlich deine wallet.dat und damit deine Bitcoins weg. Darf man fragen welche Grafikkarte(n) du hast ?Klingt mir nämlich so, als wären die nicht OpenCL-fähig.
Spekulaten sind bei Bitcoin immer unerwünscht.Bei Bitcoin geht es nicht darum Geld zu machen und ich hoffe das werden langsam mal ein paar einsehen. Nach allem was ich hier so lese lohnen sich nur 5870er oer 6990er fürs Mining. Kommt drauf an was du noch so am Netzteil hängen hast, aber eigentlich sollten die restlichen ~140 W bei "Standardsystemen" ausreichen.Welchen Prozessor hast du denn drin ? Beim Gaming mit mehreren 5xxx sei angemerkt, dass die unglaublich schlecht skalieren im Vergleich zur neueren 6xxx-Serie.Wer sich also Karten primär zum Zocken kaufen und nur sekundär minen will, der sollte vllt lieber auf ein paar 6990er setzen. Welchen Topf ? Mich würde mal interessieren wie viel mtgox bzw MagicalTux monatlich (nach Abzug der Serverkosten usw) an der Seite verdient. Das nächste mal den richtigen Namen nehmen (Amazon ohne e) und damit die Suchfunktion füttern.Dann landet du direkt bei dem Thread meines Vorredners. lol ? a pool you need to pay to use it ? O.o? Außerdem gibt es mittlerweile viele Pools, die noch nicht separat auf bitcoinwatch angezeigt werden. Most pools are providing such an interface (usually they don't make it public I guess, but you could ask the site admins for access to it). +1I'd like to see a system where I decide how much money I want to give my government (taxes). And I want to decide what they do with my money.The only way how politics will work for their people is if the politicians get paid by the people for things they do for the people.Is there a state theory about this ? Respectively does such a system have a specified name ? the only rule I really want to have here is:USE THE FUCKING SEARCH FUNCTION BEFORE YOU START NEW THREADS YOU FUCKING FUCKS !if the board search is too complicated for you, use google with site:forum.bitcoin.orgbasically it should be like this:interested in information --> looking for available source of information -> no information found ? then, and only then make a new thread regarding your needs bitmarket.eu was planning to clone the site on several servers in several countries. not sure if that is still the current plan. ach sry, ich meinte dm Im schlimmsten Fall behalten sie deine Bitcoins. Das ist aber bisher noch nie bei irgendeinem Pool vorgekommen.Und sobald sowas bekannt wird, wirst du davon hier im Forum erfahren und der Pool wird sehr schnell seine User verlieren. Leider nein, hab vor ner Weile mal danach gesucht und über google nach ewiger Suche überhaupt nur 3 oder 4 Anbieter gefunden die ihren Sitz in Deutschland haben. Ich weiß nichtmehr wie teuer die Tarife waren, aber ich weiß noch dass sie für mich als Privatperson, die eigentlich nur günstig einen Server hosten wollte (kein Mining-Rig) viel zu teuer waren. Ja, bitte erklär das mal in einer für jeden verstänlichen Kausalkette.Ich weiß nicht woran es liegt, aber deine posts verwirren mich immer unheimlich. Ich kann nie direkt den Zusammenhang zu der gestellten Frage herstellen, weil ich einfach keine Intention und keine Inhalts-Essenz aus deinen posts ziehen kann. Das ist nicht böse gemeint, aber irgendwie komm ich auf deine posts nicht klar xD Nein, der LOEWE-CSC arbeitet mit Radeon Karten. (also normale Consumer-karten, keine FireGL oder wie sie heißen, das ist eigentlich das erstaunliche daran. außerdem sit er im vergleich zu anderen top500 supercomputern extrem ernergieeffizient(platz 8 der green500 june 2010)) Es gibt aber auch sogenanntens Tower Hosting bzw Housing.Die Bieten normalerweise Hosting-Pakete für Privatkunden an. In den tarifen ist dann Strom, Kühlung und Internetanbingung mit eingeschlossen. Woher kennst du bitclockers ?Ist das erste mal, dass ich davon höre.
Added three pools, still waiting for someone who will write a comprehensive guide of how to decide which pool to use. There's huge media attention from Germany going on. So, ihr habt also "Gelt" ? Da dann schaut doch was ihr mit eurem "Gelt" machen könnt, ihr Horste ...Scammer-Alarm ! Beides funktionier sehr gut, für den deutschen Markt würde ich aber bitmarket.eu empfehlen. https://csc.uni-frankfurt.de/csc/index.php?id=51Top500 June 2010 Rank #22Das wäre mein "Traum-Miner"  Ein Thread reicht eigentlich... Ich glaube er möchte Geld (in irgendeiner Form) gegen Bitcoins tauschen. Geht's nur mir so, oder findet noch jmd, dass dm eine merkwürdige Art hat sich auszudrücken ? Ich nehme an du meinst https://bitmarket.eu ja https://bitmarket.eumehr möchte ich gar nicht dazu sagen weil ALLE informationen dir ihr braucht hier im forum verfügbar sind und wenn nicht jeder immer wieder nen eigenen thread aufmachen würde, wäre das ganze hier auch wesentlich überscihtlicher  ~.~  für irgendeine distro gibt es bitcoin glaube ich direkt im repository.aber wenn du hier im forum einfach mal nach threads mit "ubuntu" im titel suchst, solltest du auch genügend informationen finden. guiminer ist wie der name schon sagt nur ein mining client, der keine transaktionen durchführen kann und somit auch keine adressen verwendet.deine adressen findest du alle in der wallet.dat deines original bitcoin clienten.die adresse die du beim pool mining ntuzt hinterlegst du normalerweise auf der pool seite und dann werden die cins auf dem pool server generiert und auf deine hinterlegte adresse geschickt.hoffe das hilft, is ist 3 uhr und ich bin müde ^^ Definition WKN ? es gibt einen -datadir oder -datafolder switch, weiß jetzt nichtmehr genau welcher es war.jedenfalls kannst du damit quasi das anwendungsverzeichnisfestlegen.so kannst du zb auch einen portablen bitcoinclienten auf dem usb stick machen am besten mal von allem ein backup machen und dann mit dem switch ein wenig ausprobieren, eventuell ändert er auch das verzeichnis für die blockdaten usw. Mindestens Tage würde ich sagen. gerade via google gefunden:http://bitcoingateway.comwenn du danach im forum suchst, findest du vllt auch feedback darüber AllianceP2P or WASTE?But as I see it, this whole Darknet thing only makes sense when we are a few people who start a network together.The current state is this: Someone show's interest, after a few issues we connect, and then he doesn't show off anymore. Then after a few weeks the next one shows interest and it starts again.For this to work we need a few more people to get it started.(Alliance will also only work without dynamic DNS when there's atleast one known peer online who knows the IP adresses of the other peers afaik.)  It really hurts seeing all those people just thinking about Bitcoin as a money machine.Bitcoin is much much more that you goldshitting mule.It has the potential to change something and you guys should see it with the necessary respect. Don't know much about javascript but this looks like an infinite loop of write accesses to the harddrive.
Oh man, I love this series. Mentioning Bitcoin in it would be awesome  Da man PayPal einfach wieder zurücküberweisen kann und du neu hier bist, wird dir wohl niemand Bitcoins gegen PayPal verkaufen.Nur so als Info. Interessant zu welchem Zeitpunkt deine Frage bzw das Angebot hier auftauchen, aber egal.Schau mal hier: https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=11909.0 Welches Motherboard kommt zum Einsatz ?Welcher DDR3-Speicher (Modellname, Taktfrequenz) ? 1x 2GB ? 2x1GB ? 4x512GB ? Wie viele RAM-Slots sind noch frei ?Welche SSD ist verbaut ?Weche 6990's ?Wenn ich 2669 EUR ausgebe, möchte ich genau wissen, was ich mir da gekauft habe. das Mt. Gox Widget ist kein liveticker sondern ruft alle halbe stunde (?) die daten von mtgox.com ab.ein liveticker würde preisänderungen sofort zeigen bzw sofort eine nachricht erhalten, wenn ein neues angebot bei mtgox eingereicht wurde.soweit ich weiß gibt es sowas zur zeit noch nicht. Soweit mir bekannt gibt es bereits "Kreditkarte -> Bitcoins" services.Sogar anders herum geht es. ja genau das.1. bitcoin client schließen2. wallt.dat in einen verschlüsselten truecrypt container kopieren3. original wallet.dat löschen4. truecrypt container "unmounten"5. truecrypt container auf zieldmedium verschieben (USB-Stick, andere Festplatte, ....)6. PASSWORT NIEMALS VERGESSEN ! SONST SIND DIE BITCOINS WEG ! Bitte die Leute nicht via pm mit sowas nerven, wir sind sowieso schon sehr geduldig mit dir, danke.Lad dir die Treiber von dem Link aus Stammis post. Unnütze Diskussion:Die Geschichte von Bitcoin gibt BitLex recht. Boardsuche nach -> stevenbucks und der Käs' is gegessen.So und jetzt keine Diskusion mehr hier ^^ Schau mal im englischen Wiki https://en.bitcoin.it Das sind normalerweise nur ein paar hundert KiloByte. Ich nehme an, das dürfte selbst für ISDN-User vertretbar sein. Unnötig bei externen Minern bzw Pool Mining. Da kann man die Clienten ruhig weiter laufen lassen. Gute Idee so ein Shop ! jo, wir brauchen ja nicht alles doppelt und dreifach und für jeden sprachraum eine extrawurst. winrar würde ich dafür nicht empfehlen.winrar is closed source, das .rar format ist undokumentiert und ich habe keine ahnung welchen verschlüsselungsalgorithmus winrar verwendet, oder ob sie vllt einfach nur auf einen bestimmten hashwert oder sonstwas prüfen.für kritische daten immer eine richtige verschlüsselung (wie z.b. mit truecrypt) Mach mal folgendes, wenn du in C:\User\Falko bist in der Kommandozeile:Code:cd "Eigene Videos"cd "Neuerordner"dircd "WieAuchImmerDeinPoclbmOrdnerHeißt"poclbm.exe --mit den ganzen befehlen hintendrancd bedeutet "change directory", auf deutsch: "Verzeichnis wechseln"ODER:du verwendest einfach poclbm-gui Certificates ares necessary for SSL connections.I guess you also need a custom pool server software which supports SSL connections.(google for json SSL rpc or something, maybe that will help) knightmb has over 300k Ja, wurde bereits gemacht. Such mal im Forum nach amazon. Hahahaha,sorry aber ... HAHAHAHAHAHAHADein Englisch ist so schön ^^Aber mal Ontopic:Lad dir einfach poclbm-gui (Link hat BitLex gepostet).Zu deiner Hardware hast du leide rimmernoch nichts gesagt. Ich hoffe du hast eine OpenCL-fähigke Grafikkarte, sonst hat das ganze hier wenig Sinn.EDIT: Gerade in nem anderen Thread gelesen, dass du ne 4890 hast. Die ist auf jeden fall OpenCL-fähig.falsch, das war joker, nicht DayRichardUnd was wir heir die ganze zeit mit Kommandozeile meinten, nennst sich unter Windows glaube ich neuerdings Eingabeaufforderung.Einfach mal danach im Startmenü schauen und von da aus die Programme starten, dann schließt sich das Fenster auch nicht gleich wieder.
Um das System "zu knacken" müssten sie eine Angriffsmöglichkeit auf die vom NIST als sicher geltende kryptographische Hashfunktion SHA-256 finden. Oder alternativ mehr als 50% der Netzwerkpower haben.Beides ist unglaublich unwahrscheinlich. Ich würde welche bestellen, aber ich hab ja noch eine ganze Menge von der letzten Bestellung übrig ;P Kaufen kannst du bei bitmarket.eu oder mtgox.com, ich weiß aber nicht genau, wie es dort mit Kreditkartenzahlung aussieht.Als Alternative kannst du auch Leuten direkt hier im Forum oder im IRC (#bitcoin im freenode) ein Angebot machen. Welche Hardware nutzt du ? Meine GraKa hat auch nur 512mb RAM. Das spielt bei Bitcoin eigentlich keine Rolle.Wenn du eine OpenCL-fähige Grafikkarte hast, würde ich Phoenix empfehlen.Für die CPU soll der Ufasoft miner ganz gut sein, gibt vllt aber noch bessere, kenn mich bei den CPU minern nicht so aus.Was meinst du mit "passwort-geschützt" ?Du brauchst um pool-mining zu betreiben einen account für den jeweiligen Pool. Dieser ist logischerweise mit einem Passwort versehen.Und wenn sich die miner gleich wieder schließen, rufst du sie falsch auf. Normalerweise macht man das aus der Kommandozeile heraus.Wenn du das nicht hinkriegst probier mal poclbm-gui oder poclbm-mod-gui, dann hast du auch eine Benutzeroberfläche. Nenn uns mal deine Hardware. Ich befürchte nämlich, dass du versuchst Solo-Mining zu betreiben, was nur noch mit absoluter High-End-Ausstattung Sinn macht. Ansonsten mach dich mal über Pool-Mining schlau. http://www.bvdw.org/presseserver/bvdw_statement_bitcoins/110601_bvdw_statement_bitcoins_final.pdf Die 4330 ist einfach absolut ungeeignet. An deiner Stelle würde ich mir Mining aus dem Kopf schlagen, zumindest solange bis du dein System aufrüstest. Den Clienten einfach über TOR laufen lassen und alle Handelsplätze in .onion hiddenservices verwandeln (oder .i2p eepsites).Verbote sind lächerlich und zeigen nur wie unflexibel aktuelle Regierungen sind. bitmarket.eu Nein ?Du bist also gegen Netzsperren und willst gleichzeitig seinen Beitrag zensieren lassen ?Denk nochmal drüber nach ^^Hier im Bitcoin-Forum wird eigentlich sowieso nichts außer Spam gelöscht.Außerdem sind Netzsperren doch jetzt erst einmal vom Tisch.Für Glücksspielseiten wären sowieso gegen das Grundgesetz, offiziell wären die Netzperren in Deutschland nur für kinderpornographische Inhalte angewandt worden (jedenfalls offiziell).Und sollten die Netzsperren doch einmal auftauchen, wissen wir doch sowieso alle wie man sie umgehen kann. Normalerweise solltest du den Wert für die Gebühren in den Einstellungen anpassen können.Aber wie bereits erwähnt, braucht es jemanden der den nächsten Block "löst" und der auch Transaktionen ohne Gebühr akzeptiert.Das kann mitunter ziemlich lange dauern. Versuch den Wert einfach mal etwas zu reduziren, wenn dir 0.01 BTC zu viel ist. Will there ever be an option to choose which coins to spend in the original client ? Hi FieseL,ein Konto im klassischen Sinne musst du dir bei Bitcoin nicht zulegen. Wenn du dir den Clienten runterlädst und startest, legt dieser automatisch eine Datei namens "wallet.dat" an. In dieser werden dann alle deine Adressen und damit auch deine Bitcoins gespeichert.Am besten machst du gleich eine Sicherheitskopie davon auf einder anderen Festplatte oder CD (am besten Verschlüsselt, damit kein anderer sie nutzen kann).Ich gehe einfach mal davon aus, dass du Bitcoins mit EUR kaufen möchtest. In diesem Fall würde ich https://bitmarket.eu empfehlen.Dort kannst du in deinen Account-Einstellungen dann aussuchen, welche Bezahlungsoptionen du verwenden möchtest.(Inlandsüberweisung, SEPA-Zahlung (europäisches Ausland), Auslands-Überweisungen oder PayPal)Danach "bietest" du quasi auf ein paar Bitcoins (genauer gesagt machst du ein Kaufangebot (x Bitcoins für y EUR). Dann musst du nur warten bis jemand dein Angebot aufgreift. Alle weiteren Informationen zum Bezahlen erhälst du dann per eMail. Wenn du bei den Optionen nur Inlandsüberweisungen aussuchst, solltest du dann also auf jeden Fall Deutsch mit deinem Tauschpartner sprechen können  Hi,persönlich kann ich da eigentlich wenig zu sagen, aber:entsprechend der Videoshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FThX1cDg-tghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzBCbO8U45whttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O_8KocRrFoist wohl das Board GA-890FXA-UD5﻿ zu empfehlen.Für die Grafikkarten solltest du vielleicht mal ein Blick in die Tabelle hier werfen:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison (sobald das wiki wieder online ist)Viel mehr kann ich leider auch nicht dazu sagen, hoffe es hilft  Spon ?Achso, Spiegel Online.Immer diese Abkürzungen *eyeroll*  Immerhin sagst du hier, dass du 0.01BTC gewonnen hast.Das lockt automatisch Leute an, auch wenn du dazu sagst, dass du noch Probleme beim Auszahlen hast.Mein Intention war eigentlich nur, eventuelle Interessenten vor der Seite zu warnen, immerhin geht es bei Bitcoin um eine Art "Geldmittel" und da sind Betrüger vorprogrammiert.Und wenn unter der selben domain dann noch irgendein password-stealer angeboten wird, ist generell vom Benutzen der Seite abzuraten.Ich bin auch ehrlich gesagt nicht davon ausgegangen, dass nach dem ersten post noch weitere von dir folgen, da ich, wie bereits erwähnt, vermutete, dass es ein reiner spam-account ist. Nachdem du dich ja dann aber doch nochmal gemeldet hast, muss ich das jetzt wohl revidieren. Also, wenn ich das jetzt richtig verstehe wird dein Service also "nur" eine MyBitcoin-Alternative ?In unserem Mailverkehr (ich nehme jetzt einfahc mal an, dass du der selbe "Kai" bist ) hatte ich irgendwie einen anderen Eindruck gewonnen.Edit: Ok, hat sich erledigt, habe gerade nocheinmal https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9744 durchgelesen  http://jhfire.net/?p=301Sieht für mich schon nach Malware aus.Tur mir Leid, wenn ich das ganze falsch interpretiere, für mich sieht es aber so aus, als wolltest du, dass der Link hier im Forum steht damit ein paar Benutzer auf die Seite gehen und die kostenpflichtige Lotterie nutzen. Sry for thread necrophilia, butAre these miners availabe anywhere ? From what I can see from the wiki, I'd be really interested to try them.
Das ganze sieht hart nach Spampost aus und auf jhfire wird, naja, nennen wir es mal Malware, angeboten.Ich geh mal davon aus, der Post hier wurde erstellt, um user auf die Seite zu locken und sie dann abzurippen.Also: Augen auf im Web-Verkehr. Darf man fragen, wie das gemeint ist ? Auf jeden Fall gebührenfreier Banktransfer.PayPal wäre eventuell auch für viele interessant, ich lehne es aber mittlerweile eher ab.Ein cooles Gimmick wäre, wenn man prepaid cards wie Paysafecard, Ukash oder CashU erhalten könnte, ob das allerdings dann tatsächlich genutzt wird sei mal dahingestellt. Freut mich, dass auch der deutsche Nachwuchs hier Interesse zeigt  A bitcoin ebay proxy would be nice. https://kalingeling.wordpress.com/category/bitcoin/https://encrypted.google.com/#q=bitcoin&hl=de&lr=lang_de&tbs=lr:lang_1de&prmd=ivnsl&source=lnms&tbm=nws&ei=LcrfTYTgB4jNswaj38S4BQ&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=4&ved=0CCMQ_AUoAw&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=615412996e2bb6b2&biw=1280&bih=860https://encrypted.google.com/#q=bitcoin&hl=de&prmd=ivnsl&source=lnt&tbs=lr:lang_1de&lr=lang_de&sa=X&ei=UMrfTZ7bLov1sgbtk8jWBQ&ved=0CAsQpwUoAQ&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=615412996e2bb6b2&biw=1280&bih=860 wenn du phoenix verwendest, musst du als usernamen NUR den namen deines registrierten workers eingebenund bei passwort nicht das passwort des accounts, sondern ebenfalls das des workers. Ähm, was ? I find it annoying. .onion + .i2p ftw! Sounds good  but it is double or float, not int. Oha, das ist ja das volle Anfänger-Fragen-Paket Am besten schaust du dich erst einmal im wiki um (en.bitcoin.it), wenn du dann noch Fragen hast, kannst du sie ja gerne hier noch einmal stellen. Connection is encrypted either way, so your ISP does not know what you are doing here.Thanks  Added to the list. Also:https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9347.msg134947#msg134947 https with the new domain (https://forum.bitcoin.org) should work fine, shoudn't it ? Hey guys,could one of you write an article that shows what the differences between the following pools are ?http://bitclockers.com/http://bitcoinpool.com/ (http://bitcoinpool.org/)http://btcmine.com/http://deepbit.net/http://eligius.st/ (http://pool.bitcoin.dashjr.org:8337/)http://gbyte.dk/http://mining.bitcoin.cz/http://mtred.com/http://simplecoin.us/http://swepool.net/http://www.bitcoinplus.com/http://www.bitcoins.lc/http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/bitcoin-pool/ (http://pool.bitparking.com/pool + http://pps.bitparking.com/pool)http://www.btcguild.com/http://www.continuumpool.com/(are there more known pools ?) So... where exactly are the differences between phantom and something like TOR or I2P with their hidden services ? Das upload folder ist schon lange voll und wird wohl auch nicht mehr erweitert werden, lade das Bild einfach wo anders hoch, z.B. bei imageshack.us. there is also a -DataFolder (or similar) switch for bitcoin, someone made a portable bitcoin version like this.I'm just not sure whether it was the original client or a modded one.
I guess you have to use the AGGRESSION=X switch, where x is the level of aggression you want to have (default is 4, lower -> more resources for other programs, higher -> more resources for phoenix) Nein, das ist falsch. Dein "Glück" einen Block zu lösen entspricht quasi deiner hashrate.niedrige hashrate -> geringere Chancenhohe hashrate -> höhere ChancenSchwache miner werden also nicht bevorzugt, sondern wie alle anderen Teilnehmer ihrer hashrate entsprechend behandelt. If all of us had kept their coins there wouldn't be a market like it is today, so look at your "stupidity" as an investment into the system. Done.Update- renamed bitcoin.xml to forum.bitcoin.org.xml- added support for deepbit.netLink:http://stm.square7.ch/files/rules-v5.zip afaik poclbm and poclbm-gui are both open source.I guess you could manipulate it so that the poclbm-gui will not use a tray symbol or something like that.If you found a way pls let us know. I could, but I don't want to I don't even want to buy coins via that service. But my (cleraly non-paypal) offers are getting accepted by users that want to pay via PayPal and the bid and ask match, because they also have bank wire selected in ther payment options.I think it would be better if you could seperately select which options you want for selling and buying. yep, https isn't working on the main site anymore, but it still works on forum.bitcoin.org Or you trade at bitmarket.eu Update- removed support for bitcoin.org main page (has no SSL support anymore)- added support for the bitcoin.org forum (forum.bitcoin.org still has SSL)Link:http://stm.square7.ch/files/rules-v4.zipnew version below. Attention: Do not use my rulesets until the next update !Due to the recent changes to the bitcoin.org site the site and forum are NOT reachable when my ruleset is enabled.I will try to update the set later that day. It's not even a problem. Port 8333 does NOT have to be forwarded. Are you planning to implement seperate payment options for buying and selling ?(For example: I don't want to selling bitcoins for PayPal but I wouldn't mind buying coins via PayPal)This is the main reason why my transactions are getting canceled T.T You should add your pool to the wiki - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pooled_mining So..... is this actually beeing used ? Maybe it was better if you could seperately set the payment options for buying and selling. Afaik dwdollar is the admin of bitcoinmarket.com.Maybe you can contact him via forum pm. I can't receive any Mt.Gox information anymore.Have they changed their API ? And will this app ever be compatible again ?I know it is not used by many people but it is the best bitcoin app in my opinion. this. still not able to connect. Could't connect to any of them so far.Port 1337 is forwarded.
(why is this in trading discussion ?) Is the transaction confirmed by the network yet ?

Sound's suspicious ...Anyway you could buy some coins at bitmarket.eu (some sellers accept PayPal there and since I guess you have EUR in that PayPal account, nobody has to pay currency exchange fees since it's a EUR market.)But be aware that PayPal isn't the payment option of choice for newbies without reputation. (chargebacks possible) Use Tor for encryption, then your ISP do not know that you are having Bitcoin traffic.As long as there is an exit node in your circuit that's ISP allowes bitcoin traffic we should be safe.And I'm not sure about the ports. Since we do not need to forward the port to have bitcoin work, I don't know if it was a problem if every network participant would have this port closed. So mabye port rotating isn't necessary, but I do not know for sure. Is there any documentation of how your laundry service works ?Can you point ot the differences (if any) to BitLaundry ? Well, actually they try to block them as long as they can but usually get evacuated by the police.At least that's how it works in Germany.Nobody would go to a castor transport stop attempt without having the goal to really stop it.If it wasn't for the police, these people would build small towns right on the castor transport rails. Uhm, there is.https://bitmarket.eu/It is currently moving to another server but will be back up soon. @clonedone:If you had watched the forum even a bit, you would have known that there are already severeal threads concerning that topic.We really don't need another one.Please discuss in the existing ones... Ha, someone's real serious about that. Hm not sure how good miners are when it comes to test the stability of a sytem.I can recommend some stress test tools:Super Pi (CPU)toast (CPU)FurMark (GPU)PCMark (whole system benchmark) http://www.politicalcompass.org/printablegraph?ec=-4.12&soc=-7.38Hmm, never seen myself as a leftist libertarian. Your interpretation:Original quote:I guess he means that the focus on Mt Gox is serious problem. And he points out to the low costs of such an possible attack.But I'm really tired of definding him -.-He should make an own thread and clearly state the things as they are. Are there currently any other laundry services ? Maybe even without fees ?
Hmm. I was convinced he did it, but only because I was sure to read the facts out of his posts.But to be honest his English is even worse than mine so it all could be just an attempt to make a joke or something.Currently I do not claim to know that he is behind the DDoS attacks. Could all be just a big misunderstanding. Hard to tell.Only thing I know is Mt. Gox is still under attack or atleast some heavy load and if the intention is to bring it to fall, I can understand that and it should get openly discussed because I see the progressing centralization of our little decentralized currency here will become a big problem sooner or later. For the protocol:After reading the whole thread again, I'm not even sure whether it was bitcoinex behind the DDoS or not.Please don't discuss this comment  Just want to make myself clear because when I've written my previous posts I was sure he did it. But then again, he stated a few times that he has nothing to do with these attacks. *confused* Both options sound fine to me, but I'm not sure whether it makes sense to split it.Would you need to introduce fees when implementing the second option ?Also, if all the money is held by an account of your bank we additionally have to trust your bank not to freeze the funds for whatever reason. DDoSing a website/server does not remove the owner's ability to speak elsewhere on the net.But I see what you are pointing at.Maybe I should have chosen a better expression.It's always wrong to abuse other people's property.But I can't see a problem when everybody is using his own machines to participate in a DDoS. (But most likely that is not the case here) It seems to me that PayPal only adds another point of tracking trading history to the whole system.SEPA transaction work very well and fast and there are only trusted parties involved (if I won't trust my bank to a certain degree, I wouldn't store money there).PayPal is known to freeze accounts and also charges fees.A few months ago I thought PayPal support was really a good idea, but now I think Bitcoin has come to a stage where we aren't dependent on third-party payment processors anymore.I can't even see the advantages of PayPal. The only thing the bring is transaction speed.But this speed comes with the whole load of PayPal's negative aspects (giving control of the money to another party aka freezing risk, decrease of money value (fees), risk of chargeback (fraud)). Well, for me this whole thing looks very different.But to make one thing clear: I do not know bitcoinex nor do I know his real intentions or idealogies.I can't see any links between DDoS-ing and business so I don't know what business ethics you mean.I also never heard of bitcoinex stealing money from his customers or something so TO ME he seems like a legit business man.I've never traded at btcex, though.Since btces charges no fees (afaik) I don't think he tried to steal mtgox's userbase.I got the impression that BECAUSE he's also running an exchange he has seen the problems coming with centralized exchanges and especially the focus on mtgox.com.But hey, who knows, maybe he is just a total douchebag, I don't really care and I don't need to defend his doings.Just keep in mind that never attracted any negative attention before that thing.For me DDoS is a matter of free speach, just like a digital sit-in blockade.Sure, as soon as it becomes a financial issue (which it is, because MtGox chrges fees) it gets really difficult to judge.But in my opinion bitcoin exchanges should be free of any fees. We do not have to make the same mistakes that other currencies/systems/communites have done before.(centralized market/market monopol + fees <-> government + taxes  )Aw man, feels great in bizarro world   Oh, I don't know ...I can't seem to find the right words to describe why I think this is a bad idea.Somehow I feel like the EUR trades will really get affected by that and will get fixed to the USD/BTC rate on other exchanges even more.I somehow like having a "European only" market.Well, we'll see what future brings. You won't see many offers here because PayPal has the ability of chargebacks.You're a new user so probably nobody will trust you.It might change if you offer a non-chargeback payment option like Bank wire/SEPA or something. I should have waited with my order T_TAnyway, the shirt is worth it  Ja, mittlerweile ist Solo-Mining quasi unmöglich geworden. Erschwerend kommt hinzu, dass du nur deine 2-Kern-CPU dafür nutzt.Es wurde bereits überlegt die "Bitcoins erzeugen"-Funktion aus dem Standardclient (bzw aus dessen GUI) zu entfernen.Mining lohnt meiner Meinung nach nur noch, wenn man mindetens eine aktuelle Grafikkarte hat und in einem Pool mit anderen zusammenarbeitet.Diverse Pools und wie man sie benutzt findest du im Subforum "Mining". Ok, maybe I will pull a massive amount of hatred on me now ...Let's get our facts straight:There is one person (bitcoinex) who thinks that the current market is much too centralized.Which is right in my opinion.He start's a DDoS-attack to prove his point and brings the site down for several hours.What's so wrong about that ?If he'd stayed anonymous nobody would be so stressed about the whole thing.But instead he made his intentions publicly available so people can discuss about it. At least that's what I am thinking.And instead of discussing, everybody is just like "herp derp, idiot, herp derp".So, my message to all of you is:Calm down, think about it and let's discuss in an open and mannered way.So far,~Smoke Somehow I really dislike seeing that whole russian-bashing.We have an international market. We have an international currency. We have international people. bitmarket.eu supports PayPal, but only when the sellers are accepting it. Seems like we really need a decentralized exchange. Not only Gavin, but all the elders of Bitcoin  Most likely. Welcome back !I knew you wouldn't have rejected that whole bitcoin thing I hope we will see a bit more activity from you now  down again ...
I guess printing all private keys on paper and find a way to scan them in a way to build a new wallet or importing these keys into an existing wallet would be more secure. According to this https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison it look's like you're getting a good hashrate.If you're using poclbm try playing around with the flags -v, -f and -w, maybe you can raise it a bit. Sounds good, but:Wouldn't that mean that if two people are using the same password they will generate the same addresses ?(I'm not very educated when it comes to the Bitcoin internals.) bitmarket.eu doesn't even have a fee.My intention was to ask whether my calculations are correct and to start a discussion about lowering the fees at Mt Gox. A bit off topic, but I didn't want to create a new thread for this:Has anybody recognized what kind of a money machine Mt Gox is ?I mean, the current volume is ~75,000 BTC. Let's assume the average price was ~3.00 USD,then the total transaction sum over the last 24 (48 ? not sure) hours was 225,000 USD.As we know Mt Gox charges a small 0.65% fee.Let's do the math:225000 / 100 * 0,65 = 1,462.50 USD per 24 (or 48?) hours ! Dude, that price is too high.~10 USD for a word document ? I mean, I know the Dollar is loosing value, but that's just ridiculous  I'm pretty sure he switched his nick and he's still among us. mkv is the container. the correct qusetion would be:"Its already in h264 & u want to compress further to reduce size?"Or whatever the video codec of the source file is... That doesn't even work. There are over 6 million bitcoins out there. Just crashing the market price doesn't destroy bitcoin. Oh alright, I was just confused because nobody reacted to my post.And actually no, I don't know anything about C++ or wxWidgets, I'm more of a Java fan  Am I getting ignored ?? That just isn't right. They aren't locked up and you don't have to use the command promt.They are freely available via Windows Explorer. sweet  Oh god, another posion on the market ... afaik the flag is called "-d" for device.-d 0 for the first device, -d 1 for the second and so on. Ordered ! Someone made a Bitcoin pumpkin last year. That was really awesome. awesome  One thing I like to mention:There is a display issue with the German version (only German ?) when setting the font-size to 125% in Win7.Bitcoin then looks like that:Note the Number in the lower right corner. Afaik it is the Number of total transactions but the label isn't fully shown.Also, when you click on ->sending (->Überweisen) you get this error message:And when you finally get to the transfer dialog, it looks like that:Pretty messed up. You have to resize the window to get to the "transfer" and "cancel" button.And since the "settings window" can not be resized like all the other ones, I cannot change the transaction fee:This sucks.I know this only affects like <1% of the bitcoin userbase but anyways,can this be fixed somehow ? Nothing is said about forbidding the selling of your own codes. It has only been said that they cannot support that.You still have the right to gift your gift-codes to whomever you want to. No matter what you might or might not get in exchange for that.
I guess you could do a SQL-statement that deletes all 0-post-users with a not-null signature which haven't logged in for a month or so. So guys, watch out, if we do not hear anything from gavin for the next few weeks he might be in Quantanamo Bay.  http://mojang.com/2011/04/26/achtung-uwaga-attention/Just for you guys to know. Die Fragen wurden bereits alle einmal im Forum gestellt.Wenn es die Leute interessiert, könnte man sich ja mal die Mühe machen und die betreffenden Threads raussuchen.Ich freue mich jedenfalls sehr, dass auch immer mehr Deutsche Interesse an Bitcoin zeigen  lol ^^ Yeah, I really liked beeing part of that small bitcoin family we were.I read all the new posts every day and there was this "all new, exciting" atmosphere around.I kinda dislike seeing the forum spammed by all this let's say "less important posts" nowadays because back then it felt like listening to some technology-socialist-anarchist-liberalist gurus.I'm glad Bitcoin is finding acceptance by many people now but it has definetly lost it's secret-elite-flavour. Well, back in the days Bitcoins were a very risky thing and nobody knew what could happen to the project.The pizza thing was one of the very first attempts to trade bitcoins with real goods.Everybody could generate thousands of bitcoins per months so they didn't have a real value back then. Hmm,what happens with unfinished seeds ?Let's say someone is sharing a file with 10 chunks, but only 9 could be seeded to the network.If I am trying to download this file I would credit the people for downloading the 9 chunks but could never get the 10th.This way I'd be spending money on data garbage.I like the idea, but I'm not sure if Bitcoin is the right thing for that.There should be some "traffic credit" which doesn't have any other value than spending for traffic.Actually I'd still like to see a revive of BitBlinder.http://torrentfreak.com/free-anonymous-bittorrent-becomes-reality-with-bitblinder-090611/ Mt. Gox isn't the only market.It is has just undeservingly become the biggest one.There are several other markets you should checktout if you want to trade bitcoins.See here for more info: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Currency_exchange(hm the wiki says mtgox accepts EUR payments, is that true ? afaik you can only pay via LRUSD.and btw: bitmarket.eu accepts paypal, could someone add this to the wiki?) From today's perspective I'm pretty lucky not to have sold them for 50 bucks  show me your janitors, your janitors, show me your janitors, your janitors, janitoria ! ^^ *shameless self-quote* Gotta try that some time. Sounds awesome. Hey, just wanted to say thank you. It's a great app.I'd like to see more markets/currencies supported in future versions  Don't worry. Madhatter is trustworthy. Can anyone recommend a good encryption tool for Android phones ? Maybe it was one of mine. I always post https links. Dude, -> https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2795.0mmkay ? Anwort erhalten  Wasn`t aware of the market fee. Shame on you Open Handset Alliance !
Son, I am disappoint. You should try to monitor your gpu temperature.There are a lot of tools to do so, google is your friend.Oh and btw: afaik the 8600gt was the first Nvidia OpenCL capable card ever, so it`s probably very slow and might not support newer OpenCL versions.Mabye that could have something to do with your crashes, too. Is BitCoiner available via the Market ?(btw: I guess there are already two other implementations of that: "BitcoinDroid" and "Miner Status") Since we're already at pointing out to bugs:https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2543.msg73100#msg73100 VPN != ProxyProxy = Routes your traffic unecrypted through a different station if you configure the programs to do so.VPN = Routes your whole network traffic encrypted through a different station (no further application cofiguration needed)btw: Mullvad supports port-forwarding. Habe Marco eine pm geschrieben und warte auf Antwort. * SmokeTooMuch outet sich als StudentIch wäre nicht abgeneigt meine Kommilitonen zu bekehren. Do you encrypt the incoming messages in any way ? Why isn't this thread sticky anymore ?! Great for all the 1.6 users.I just updated to 2.2.1 (CyanogenMod 6.1). I'm running 11.2, maybe thats why it is slower. I'll wait for the 11.4 final before installing it. As already mentioned, the nforce series is a chipset series, not a graphic card one. Actually it seems a bit slower on hd4870 @ win7 64. Yep. I will soon flash to a 2.1 custom ROM but before I have to study that topic more deeply. What is the best -a setting for slush's pool ? Hmm, with 100% fan speed my 4870 doesn't heat up over <80°C. (reference cooling system)Something has to be wrong with your system, maybe you need another case fan that blows out the hot air.btw: afaik -v isn't advantageous for the 4xxx series because they aren't that good at vector calculating (at least not for hashes). First, it's not called "walllet ID". It's called your bitcoin address.All transaction to a address go into the wallet.dat (your wallet file, you want to backup this!) that keeps the address. Any other ("external") instances of python installed ? Is there a reason why I can't find it in the Market app ?Found it only via  your link.EDIT: w00t, not compatible with my G1 T.T I'm going to give you 10 BTC when this is finished.Make sure to let me know via pm when this happens.EDIT: kiba has cancelled this project so I retrace my pledge.
Awesome ! Don't moderate the market. Moderate the government to legalize these things.It's as simple as that. Let me know how much and the desired rate. Maybe we can come into business. Offer closed. Can you give us some more info like what OS and which version of poclbm you're using ? Hmm, not sure whether you're joking or just don't know:http://encyclopediadramatica.com/I_accidentally_X You may be interested in that:1675 BTC for 1000 EUR or 1425 USD Where do you live ?Cash by mail ?I don't care about Mt.

Last time I checked it was 6 BTC per week.Anyways, why don't you use a free vpn service for that ? --> https://mullvad.net/en/bitcoin.php FTP over explicit TLS/SSL (FTPES) on FileZilla.

* SmokeTooMuch bumps his thread shamelessly Sounds really cool. There seems to be a problem with the timestamps: Hi,I want to sell 1675 BTC for 1000 EUR which makes ~0.597 EUR/BTCor 1425 USD which makes ~0.85 USD/BTC(I prefer EUR)Since it is a large amount I won't accept PayPal this time.Only bank wire.(I will accept PayPal only from highly trusted members)You send the money first, then I will send the BTC.I have a pretty good forum reputation so this shouldn't be a problem.If you are interested feel free to reply here or send me a pm. why don't you comment on these links ? your wallet.dat for instance btw: I am still looking for a Bitcoin car sticker and a t-shirt.EDIT: I have a t-shirt and some stickers now. hm why is the site offline ?edit: nevermind. let me know your hash and I will look for it in my rainbow tables.

Der Kerl, der vor dem New York Stock Exchange mit seinem "Stop the Fed! Use Bitcoin!"-Schild stand, hatte afaik Flyer verteilt.Aber keine Ahnung was da drauf stand und es war bestimmt Englisch. Geht eigentlich jmd von euch aufs Hambacher Fest 2.0 ? Gibts denn kein übergeordnetes Büro, dass die Spenden dann nach Bedarf aufteilt ?Oder existiert der CCC tatsächlich nur in seinen regionalen Formen ohne übergreifende Hierarchie ? Gerade Piraten sollten Bitcoin eigentlich begrüßen.Es passt genau ins Bild der Transparenz und des mündigen Bürgers.Allerdings kann ich auch verstehen, wenn man bei finanziellen Dingen sehr skeptisch ist und sich lieber erst überzeugen lässt, wenn eine gewisse Menge an vertrauenswürdigen Fachkörpern (in diesem Fall wohl EFF,CCC,GPF,...) der Sache angenommen hat.Das erinnert mich gerade daran, dass wir vor eienr ganzen weile 250+ Bitcoins an den CCC spenden wollten, aber niemand erreicht haben, der für Spenden, bzw der Einführung von Spenden via Bitcoin zuständig war.(Hatten wir überhaupt irgendjemand erreicht??)Kennst du da vllt eine eMail-Adresse oder Telefonnummer, JackSparrow ? 0 is cpu I guess Wow Atlas, stop smoking that crack from Silk Road.;P That's what I'm asking you guys, I already have enough bitcoins ^^ You are assuming that the bitcoin value will stay the same.I actually still think it will raise until some certain point, so it may be profitable.

https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?action=statsUnten mal März 2011 öffnen.Heute sind bereits 88 Leute hinzugekommen. Das ist neuer Rekord und der Tag ist noch nicht einmal vorüber. Naja irgendwo hat er schon recht.Die Mitgliederzahl im Forum hat sich in den letzten paar Tagen um ca 500 Leute erhöht.Außerdem kommen zur Zeit wieder sehr viele Newbie-Fragen im Forum auf (bei denen ich mich immer frage wofür es eine SuFu gibt >_<).Könnte also was dran sein. Was diesen Zufluss ausgelöst hat vermag ich jedoch nicht zu sagen. Your qustions show me that you haven't understood the concept of bitcoin at all.Maybe you should look in the wiki and the design paper first. Bitcoins have no "ID" or something similar. You can't say "coun number 1337 hast been transfered through 100 addresses already".All you can see is from which address(es) a transaction came, to which address it went and how many coins have been transfered. Afaik bitcoin sues OpenSSL for creating keys, but I don't know how OpenSSL handles their randomizing algorithm. Hm, not sure why that is happening.maybe it helps starting bitcoin with the -rescan switch You (the sender) pay(s) it (and decide(s) how much), and the one who generates the block, which your transaction is in, gets the fee.Afaik it won't really speed it up in the current situation, but as soon as bitcoin becomes more popular it will help proceeding transactions faster. works only with "ctrl right", but how to switch back to normal again ? You could try PowerStrip for overclocking. (Windows)But usually the official driver software is good enough. Congratulations. We haven't created a URI scheme like bitcoin:// yet, so you have to use a service like MyBitcoin.(Note: I have not tested MyBitcoin, yet.) Hmm, well actually I'm looking for a "full android" phone, so yours doesn't fit perfectly.Maybe some other people show interest in it.Good luck with selling it. +1 interwebs for you, sir. short answer: yes.with the Bitcoin client you are your own bank and you have the full responsibility for storing and using your wallet in a safe way.Also, there is at least one thread about this topic already.-> https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2698.0 How old ?Is there still warranty ? Do you have the bill ?Can you install android to the phone, or only use it from card ? I am sure you will receive them.Don't worry about that. well you can't make a per second statement, since, in theory, their could be thousands of blocks in one second.and because all of the transactions in one block get processed at once, it's hard to say how many transactions per second there are.I guess you are looking for something like this:"How many transaction fit in one block ?" and "Is there a maximum of blocks per second in the network ?" Can we see pictures ? uhm, so ? I sent you a pm.Thx for info ptmhd, but I will stay at 50 USD for this time.Maybe we will trade higher sums in future 
Oh, sry about that. I had the feeling there was something wrong, but somehow it seemed right ^^Ok so the offer is 55.55 BTC for 50 USD -> ~0.90009001 USD/BTC Hmm I couldn't find any trading history of you, so I guess I will ony sell BTC worth 50USD with if that's ok with you.I just want to be cautious.What about 45 BTC for 50 USD ? That makes 0.9 USD/BTC. (current lowest ask at mtgox = 0.9193) Sure, but it should be avoided/restricted in education and politic and all other "opinion/decision making" bodies. Once created addresses are permanent.You will receive payments on the old addresses even if you "select" a newer one in the client. Maybe it's you, ribuck Ok, so as I thought, his absence was planned.So probably he's still alive. That's good.But haven't he mentioned anything when he will come back ? Will he ever ?And what were his intentions to go "undercover" ? Not a "leader person" ? Afraid of consequences ? Other projects/real life ? Religion is by fact evil and should be avoided at all cost. Just for the case you will not be able to reach the site. From my experience the best way to cash out prepaid cards is to trade the codes with people directly.A firend of mine buys himself a rapidshare account with paysafe card from time to time.If you are interested in exchanging I can contact him.

As you can see from my ref number, I came to the system pretty early.Until now I got 700% of my investment back (600% win).When I remember correctly, it took about 1 month for for the first 100% win (win of 1 BTC). I like your point of view, ribuck. Use the search function next time. These question have come up several times now. Maybe we should come to serious talking again.I mean, has anyone seen any life sign of satoshi ?Accidents happen all the time ...

Hmm, it comes pretty close to BitLaundryBut as I understand it, you can track Alice by looking at the block chain and look for the amount that Bob received by BitLaundry.Then you check which address sent this amount to BitLaundry (probably one of the one-time-use addresses from step 4) and then check which address sended that amount to the one-time-use address.Is that correct ? This thread could become relevant: https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3927.0 this way recipents would only see the "mix proxy address" and transactions can't be assigned to the users since neither timing attack nor checking for amounts would work.is this correct ?EDIT: image is not online anymore Hmm, I'm looking for something like this:But with the original logo and a smaller "Bitcoin" text beneath or aside.Has anyone made something like this ?

Hmm, I don't know what, except for donating to you  Hi,was haltet ihr davon, wenn wir hier mal alle deutschen Bitcoin Seiten, Artikel, Bilder, ... zusammentragen ?Ich fang dann mal an:https://www.bitcoin.org/de - Deutsche Übersetzung der bitcoin.org Seitehttps://kalingeling.wordpress.com/category/bitcoin/ - Bitcoin bezogene Artikel auf kalingelinghttps://freiesgeld.wordpress.com/ - alte Adresse von go-bitcoin.comhttp://go-bitcoin.com/ - Eine Art Portal+Blog für Bitcoin bezogene Dinge Where is that data from ?Just want to see how to optimze parameters for my 4870. Somehow this doesn't fit, does it ? Forum wird auch im englischen Sprachraum verwendet, aber egal.Na dann lasst uns das Forum mal mit Inhalten füllen, sonst war die Eröffnung ja vollkommen umsonst  Antrag stattgegeben: https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?board=16.0Bitte hier nicht mehr posten. me2. When people ask me why I use bitcoin I show them this: http://gobarbra.com/hit/new-0f3016cec6a25792576494b37e693874
I'm not in a hurry and haven't really decided which logo I like best yet.I will reply here when I made a decision, but thanks for your offer. Hab gerade mal den Antrag auf ein deutsches Sub-Forum eingereicht.Mal sehen was passiert. Hey guys,I'm interested in a bitcoin sticker for my car.Should be around 10cm x 10cm.Basically anthing from these threads goes:https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=64.0https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=687.0https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1631.0https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1756.0https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3199.0I'd prefer a transparent background and the rest coloured.Does anybody know where to get something like this ?Maybe someone is already selling these ? In other words:doomed to fail  official build 0.3.20.01 works fine for me on win7 64-bit.but I haven't tested any of the new features yet. me2. vekja should correct their prices.25 BTC per week is just insane. I just can't understand why people are still using Mt. Gox.In my opinion bitcoinmarket is and was from beginning way better. aren't there any logs for the IRC channel ? MadHatter is one of the guys of the first hour of bitcoin. I can't imagine that he would be a scammer. Probably the genesis block by Satoshi  Der Service ist wohl von unserem Forenmitglied grondilu.Mit seinen 1500+ posts hat er bereits ein gewisses Interesse am System gezeigt.Und soweit ich das aus dem List of honest traders Thread entnehmen kann, haben bereits mindestens zwei Personen erfolgreich mit ihm (direkt, ohne den Service) gehandelt. https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=484.0Trade with someone who has already proven that he is a honest business man and send the btc first.btw: new offer for you: selling 1000 BTC for 750 EUR or 1040 USD. From my experience it depends a lot of what encryption algorithm you choosed and how fast the drive is.get a faster drive  3dsupply.degetdigital.de nice! if someone is interested in trading with me:my (limited time) offer: 0.65 EUR/BTC (bank wire or PayPal) or 0.895 USD/BTC (PayPal only)max volume 1000 BTCpaying paypal requires a certain trust level.contact: post here or pm me.Taken. I don't see why we need such a programm.backing up an encrypted copy of the wallet.dat is as easy as 1-2-3.I still appreciate your effort  Just one example of the various custom 64-bit builds (all unofficial, just so you know)->https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=866.msg10330#msg10330 There already are some 64-bit windows builds of bitcoin.use the board search machine.(afaik there isn't a 64-bit build of 0.3.20, but lower versions)
Unfortunately, our community is also still looking for such a service. currently not. That just seems unlikely Do you know Portal ?-> problem solved. ^^ 1. Bitcoin can fail anytime (see the thread about a google competitor) and electricity prices aren't the same worldwide.2. I don't see how they can be worth 0.57USD when the market price is way above. Maybe I misunderstood something ?3. I just can't estimate the growth in difficutly, there could be a jump-in or a jump-out of huge computation power anytime.4. If you need the cards for other stuff than mining, you maybe do. So, BitcoinMarket v2 is open for public now ?Is there a domain name already ?Or is it still in "testing mode" ?  Hi, I'm just curious.Would you buy hard drives (up to 2TB) with rainbow tables(lm, ntlm, md5, sha1, ...) on it ? while registering Well, somehow I don't like Alliance anymore.It's just too complicated to build a working network with people who aren't familiar with it.I guess the best thing would be a DC hub with encryption.Maybe I will workout a better solution for a filesharing darknet and post it here. Hmm, seems like Alliance needs static IP's or a dynamic DNS. List of honest traders 1 BTC = 2 USD would make me a rich man  Hooray for Java ! "testing the internet" usually takes just a few seconds. Maybe your port isn't forwarded ?And if you gave it a blank folder (no content).. what exactly should be hashed anyway ? EDIT: Also make sure to use SSL encryption !Code:VKkiZR&GyhHu4AThat's my new connection code for anybody who's willig to try. -> https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=12.msg52#msg52 Thanks Vasilev!I was aware of some mistakes but I was too lazy to fix them and the community didn't repsond very much to this. I'm looking forward to use your service in the sooner future. Why is this Thread in Local>Other ?It should be in Off-Topic. Moving between wallets: use bitcoin address instead of ipNot sure how to "steal" by editing wallet.dat.
My HD4870 is OpenCL capable and afaik the 4850 is using the same chip, so basically, it should support OpenCL as well. I don't think I want to donate to 4chan.It's not that I wouldn't like it. I just don't know if I want to support it. Reminds me of "How I met your mother" with Ted and Stella. Good thing, but the demonstration isn't that good. Hm, als Alternative zu php würde mir nur exzessiver Gebrauch von javascript einfallen und das ist meiner Meinung nach noch viel schlimmer. If your machine can't run on 100% for a while you definitely have a cooling problem. (have this on my notebook, but can't do much against it) Nochmal zur Erinnerung:http://web.piratenpartei.de/101105-Die-Piratenpartei-braucht-Deine-Unterstuetzung Hmm, seems like the site autmatically forwards http requests(port 80) to https.Also seems like encryption isn't working on the whole site, somehow that doesnt make sense (to me). So..., any news about Nenolod's plan to "destroy" bitcoin ? afaik only when "non-ip"-transactions are made (using bitcoin addresses).if you send money to a specific ip, the client which the port is forwarded to will receive the coins.(IP-payments are disabled by default (and will be removed in future versions afaik), so this isn't a big concern) happens all the time.nice to see bitcoin mentioned, though. Guess the best thing for you to generate coins is to join a pooled mining effort. I don't think so. BiddingPond's user base is not big enough. Praise the lord ! I`m not sure what you mean.Please specify what you were doing and what these warning messages told you, best is to make screenshots. What the shit, dude. What the shit. Yay, got it to work !Feel free to download. according to this https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets you don't need to upload it to the git.just putting them in the userrules folder should work, but somehow it doesn't. If it's not recognized as a currency, it should work like an exchange (one commodity for another one) and afaik exchanges aren't taxable,but I'm not a business man so better wait for some more answers. Hi guys,I guess most of you know the Firefox addon HTTPS Everywhere by the EFF.If you don`t know it yet, make sure to check it out, it`s awesome.EDIT: http://rapidshare.com/files/442718684/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules.zip (check my other posts in this thread for the newest version)This file contains rules for:bitcoin.orgbitcoin2cash.combitcoin2cc.combitcoin4cash.combitcoinmarket.commtgox.commullvad.netmybitcoin.comprivacyshark.comJust install HTTPS Everywhere and extract the zip to your HTTPSEverywhereUserRules folder.Example for Windows 7:C:\Users\~USER~\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\~PROFILE~\HTTPSEverywhereUserRules\If you want other sites to be added feel free to ask here.Have fun !(and if you like that, you could send me some bitcoins  see the sig for the address)Well, I tried to write my own rulesets for several bitcoin related sites.(also for bitcoinmarket, bitcoin2cash, bitcoin4cash, bitcoin2cc, mtgox, mullvad, mybitcoin and privacyshark)I put it into the HTTPSEverywhereUserRules folder but somehow it doesn`t work.Any idea ?
Es geht auch nicht darum, den Konsum zu entkriminalisieren, was, wie BitLex bereits gesagt hat, auch gar nicht möglich ist, da der Konsum legal ist, sondern darum den Konsumenten vor unverhältnismäßiger Verfolgung zu schützen.Eine "Geringe Menge"-Regelung gibt es. Nur ist sie nicht einheitlich in allen Bundesländern. Trotzdem besteht hier Handlungsbedarf, weil sie in der Tat wenig Einfluss auf das Strafmaß hat, da Verfahren deshalb nicht eingestellt werden müssen.https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/wiki/Geringe_Menge#Geringe_Menge_bei_CannabisproduktenIch persönlich kenne Hausdurchsuchungsopfer. Das passiert gar nicht mal so selten, da bei "größeren Mengen" (Interpretationssache) oft Besitz zum Zwecke des Handels unterstellt wird.Ob die ganze Sache erfolgreich enden wird, ist Ansichtssache.Natürlich wird Cannabis deswegen nicht legalisiert. Wenn dadurch das Thema aber wieder in das Bewusstsein der Bürger geholt wird und wir in Zukunft noch mehr Unterstützer finden, dann kann ich jedenfalls immernoch von einem Erfolg sprechen.Außerdem sind Petitionen ein Mittel der Meinungsäußerung bzw Meinungskundgebung und wer diese nicht nutzen will, versagt als verantwortungsvoller Bürger auf ganzer Linie.Just my two (Bit-)cents... just curious .. how long does international shipping usually take ? Hmm, seems like there is not much interest to support the German consumers in this board.  I somehow like the idea of the abiotic oil theory.https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Abiotic_oil /r/equesting further details http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hQUtitIO7Adoesn't work anymore... (GG = Grundgesetz = Constitution of Germany)Translation:Everybody, as a single person or in company, got the right to adress the appropritate body and the representation of the people in written form.No restriction on citizenship, as far as I can see.It's only a petition, not something like a plebiscite. Obviously, they are the same. Hello my dear Bitcoiners,we have a running petition in Germany, that intends to decriminalize cannabis consumers.The petition is open for anybody, even non-germans.If it reaches 50k signs, the petition will be heard by the Bundestag.If you like to support us, please feel free to sign the petition.Here is a how-to in English:http://cannabispetition.de/2011/01/06/how-to-sign-the-petition/main topics:1. raising the "low amount", until proceedings get ceased (maybe to 30 grams)2. make "low amount" consistent in all German federal states; own "low amount" for own needs (no dealing) shall not be chargeable3. growing of a low number of cannabis plants for own need shal be legal; maybe implement Cannabis Social Clubs (Spain, ...)4. boundary value of THC in traffic (like alcohol) to decriminalize consuments in driver licence right5. no house raidings in relation with small cannabis amountsSorry for my bad english ... http://cannabispetition.de/https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/index.php?action=petition;sa=details;petition=14613tl;dr --> Petition zur Entkriminalisierung von Cannabis-KonsumentenWär schön, wenn ihr unterzeichnen würdet. Somehow I was thinking about a different CIA... Happy Birthday. Yay! Yet another reason for using Bitcoin (via encrypted connections). hmm, this is relevant to my interests. donation /= paymentso, first offer something, and then we might donate something to you.tl;dr -> tits or gtfo. no fees. no charge-backs. no third party involved = no freezing.to tell only a few advantages. International shipping ? ;-P I'm not sure how up-to-date they are, but why not adding these IP's to your (or a seperate) list:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=59.0(make sure to read these two posts about fallbacl-nodes:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=59.msg14646#msg14646, http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=59.msg31133#msg31133) He's talking like a maniac. Thats makes him seem less serious... This can't be legal.
actually the speed of electrones in electricity  is ~ 2/3 speed of light. I AM A MOTHERFUCKER I just got this strange error message (attachement).Any idea what could have caused this ?Was this because of the restart ? I just got what does that mean ? the treshold says how much BTC you have to earn before it will be send to your wallet. Am I just dumb or something ?How to connect ? (registered account adn worker already) Well, we try to establish a new currency system and ebay isn't one of our biggest friends (paypal, etc.).so I guess the interest to buy such a share isn't that big. "Beta software ?On my satellite ?" Actually we all know that already.Next time try the board search http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2152.0 well in my opionion you can't overlook these messages.if someone is not replying, I guess he doesn't want to reply. Nice, with Bitcoin 0.3.19, poclbm 20101214 and catalyst 10.12 I get around 82000 khash/s now instead of 78000 with the old versions. Maybe we should start a poll about what we think is best and accept the result as a democratic decision.For me it looks like this was the best:[ ] Bitcoin main chain[X] start a new chain, with DCCs ("DomainChain coins").[ ] Permanent name registration[X] renewal necessary(registration for 1 year ?)[ ] Support for an unlimited family of applications[X] just focus on DNS.[ ] DNS "gateway" servers setting minimum transaction fees[X] burning a DCC to register a domain.(not sure if I got all the details about this)[ ] Include in the block chain, in addition to domain name: just ownership public key,[ ] ownership public key plus authoritative DNS server IP addresses, vs arbitrary DNS records.(actually I don't care about this)[ ] Single TLD .web or .p2p, etc.[ ] "advisory" TLDs which may be ignored[X] all TLDs being allowed in names.(up to 4 or 5 Unicode letters) I guess he is hinting at the very chaotic planning of .p2p which makes the developement really slow because they can't really start before the specifications are clear.Ignore that post. I was looking on the wrong page. any update on this topic ? This is my invite key (multiple uses possible).I am using SSL encryption so PLEASE activate it (options -> security).My port (TCP) is forwarded so connection should be possible. (You have to forward your port, too.)I'm online for atleast the next four hours, so if anyone is interested feel free to add meold post is old. I know, that was my intention for correcting you.Would be a shame if he buys the wrong card. I guess it's called "Ukash" not "U-Cash". Actually I live in Germany and would do something like that (not on a permanent basis).Are you interested ? you can also load the newest build here http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/.if you want to try it, I'd be glad to test it with you. Sure, I got quite a few left for sale.How many do you want ?What price ? Which currency ? (I currently accept EUR and USD only).
Afaik one connection is enough. All the others are just redundancy. Just for info:The trade was successful. I guess you mean something like a "karma system" where you donate BTC instead of karma points. PM sent. Now that you're saying it, sounds more like a "DO IT!" then a "don't !".Maybe this was the only legal way to ask for taking part. I insta-RAGEd when I read your post.There is so much wrong with this statement, I don't even know where to start explaining. I will. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1334.0orhttp://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1721.0Both work fine on my HD4870, but poclbm (first link) works with the newest official bitcoin binary.Nobody is using the "stealing" version from puddinpop anymore. I can't see any source for the adress you've given is the real adress of I2P. I guess his anniversary is tommorow the 9th. I'd be interested.How many do you want ?I'd prefer EUR. What about 0.19 EUR / BTC ?Look at this Thread:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=484.0Yo'll see that I have a longer trading history and am trusted by some people. I liked BitDNS, but I don't really care about the name as long as it works  You should sell it at other forums.I don't think you will have a big customer base here. Satoshi is not more than a developer.Especially he's not an authority.(nothing personal against you, satoshi) ooooooooh, I see ^^*shame on me* So, are you finished already ? Just want to remind you on that topic.Don't forget it tomorrow if you want to take part. much cooler than "vote or die". what are their sources ? Sometimes I call it Feces Book.
If this will work as it should, without errors or serious security issues,and if it is finished before .p2p,I pledge 1000 BTC.EDIT 10.06.2011: 1000 BTC is way to much now. I reduce my pledge to 20 BTC.EDIT 14.02.2014: Just for the record: In the end I transferred 292 BTC instead of the originally pledged 1000 BTC.

On a second thought, people will steal ideas from other people and try to be the first whos posting them.This way hey will make profit from other peoples ideas.I pretty much like the idea, but I see a high abusal risk there.But yes, your idea to make the "idearamid scheme" could be the first idea in the system. We definetely need more anonymous VPS's and VPN's.This would provide some more privacy to users outside the .onion and .i2p network. don`t you mean vorstand@ccc.de ? This sounds promising. Yeah, but I thought of SHA-1 hashes. use the board search next time. maybe you should provide hashes of downloads.this way people could be sure that the file they are paying for is the file they want. we have ~1200 board users all over the world.we have ~60 very active (~100+ posts) users all over the world.how many do think will show up ?3 ? 4 ? 5 ?good intention but this will just end as a fail. Mailbox.Just leave a message and tell them to contact you via mail or somehting. so ... how did something like that even happen ? nice vid. guess you should tell us something about that charity before we start donating...also, they can't buy much with their bitcoins (so far), I guess donating for these kind of foundations is better made with "real money". Seems like nobody has any relations to the CCC.I suggest you, as the BMAA founder call their mailbox and ask them about the donation.If you leave them a mail adress they will respond, I guess.

I'm not much of a money expert, but this guy seems like he has no idea what he's talking about.We talked alot about hoarding and why it isn't that bad for our bitcoin economy, as long as businesses see bitcoin as a (widely accepted) currency and not as a commodity. afaik the geforce 6 series does not have support for CUDA/OpenCL.you need geforce 8 and newer. That makes it even slower. Desktop responsiveness stays the same. down to 968724 USD )-; There was a non-opensource-client by puddinpop, but the official release will always be open source.

Hmm, Windows 7 64-Bit, Radeon 4870 here.m0mchil's poclbm is ~1000khashes/s faster and my desktop stays more reponsive than with yours.I guess I'll stick to poclbm ;P You could also do a phone call. Well I live in Germany, and I was only 13 when Iraq-War began, so I guess I'm excused Only heard things about WOMD and oil back then, nothing about the EURO. That sounds very interesting.

And btw it says: Event has been canceled.EDIT: That's the right link for Germany:http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=137331642983623 Just use https://bitcoinmarket.com instead. You can pay via PayPal, Moneybookers, Liberty Reserve and Pecunix. Not sure how this is even possible to happen - but, if you had made a backup, you wouldn't have that problem now ;P
I guess a "distributed mining" option in the original client shut do the trick.Just make a litle pop-up explaining what this is and why somebody would use it.Then the average user can decide which way he want to generate coins. so... has the letter been sent already ? would be great if all currencies had the same scale.oh and btw, it isnt MtGox PayPalUSD anymore, its MtGox LR USD  I guess I'll take this offer, since I need that money quickly.I'll pm you ribuckEDIT: sent pm, waiting for response.EDIT2: done business, a new name for my honest traders list ;P OK, lets say 6% loss for me.344,72 - 6% = 324,0368Somebody interested in buying 344,72 gox$ for 324,03 PayPalUSD (or the equivalent in PayPalEUR) ? I guess this should be the right: http://www.ccc.de/de/office Why don't you withdraw the MTGOX USD directly to your LR account ? Hmm, are you aware of that you have to start bitcoin in server mode for this to work ?Code:bitcoin.exe -server Well ~345 USD to 330 USD is 4.35% loss for me. This should be a fair deal. Hmm, give me 330 USD and we're having a deal. I'm looking for someone who will exchange my MTGOX USD into PayPal USD or PayPal EUR.I'd like to see a nearly 1:1 exchange rate here.The exact amount to exchange is 344.72 USD.Since PayPal has chargeback I need someone with good reputation on this forums. (shameless bump)...so ? Be aware to trade BTC worth ~55000+ USD with a one-poster.Also, 300000 BTC are currently about 6.75 % of all generated Bitcoins.As a comparison: Try to get 6.75% of all USD currently in market ... Will it help if I sell you my MTGOX USD via bankwire so you won't have to exchange it to LR first ? http://top500.org/listsI wonder how it will rank in the soon coming november 2010 list. use -datadir and change the port on the source code and then use a different dir and port for every bitcoin instance sent. There is a HELL OF AN INTEREST to withdraw the USD funds, but liqpay doesn't seem to be the right way.. Don't buy nvidia if you want to generate bitcoins.I would suggest an AMD/ATI Radeon HD 58xx/59xx nice work
Hello,I was the highest bidder on your iPhone 3GS 32GB auction at biddingpond., but unfortunetely the reserve wasn`t met.If you`re still interested in selling it, I`d be glad to give you 2000 BTC for it.If this appears too low, feel free to pm me, so we can dispute the selling price.

Can I do a 500BTC one-time donation without membership ?

Sorry for digging out this thread, but what if I have two machines running bitcoin behind a NAT, port 8333 forwarded to one of these and both bitcoin clients are generating coins. Is the "unforwarded cleint" even able to generate coins ? Do they get send to the forwarded client ? Well .. 256mb ..

Dude, it's the CCC. They know these things and will appreciate to see a HTTPS link. CCC approval is definitely a must-have. where to take part ?
I can cross-reference all 10 of the accounts.Your approach seems like a good idea but I think it isnt the last word on the subject. you can sell them at a fixed price or make a start price that seems acceptable for you and you potential customers, but anyways ..i guess ebay forbids to trade currencies. That sounds interesting. Do you have any web-sources for this ?@m0mchil:Is your Python OpenCL client using priorization ? like, can I start a game while using your client and it will automatically slow down the hash rate and my card will focus on the game ? I was thinking of something a bit different.If one of us would host an own Payment Processor, I mean a real business, then I guess (not sure if my thoughts are bulletproof, having some headaches right now) there could be a way of making sure that every real person only owns one account.The scheme would be like this:A customer registers at the PP(payment processor) with all of his data.Real name, real adress, real phone number, (maybe a copy od his ID),a public key and two passwords.One of that is a usual password, you type it on the keyboard. The other one consists only of numbers (5+ digits) and won't be typed on the keyboard, but on a virtual keyboard on the screen with the mouse. The virtual keyboard looks like the number block on the keyboard but the position of each number is randomly chosen.7 8 9              5 1 04 5 6   ---->    3 8 41 2 3              7 9 2   0                   6This way we make sure, that no keylogger can log the registration process.Then all of this data gets encrypted and send to the PP which will decrypt it.Now the PP checks all of this data for validity. Adress (and maybe phone number) have to be connected to the provided real name, like in a public phone book or somehting. Then the PP will send a letter with some random text to the adress. The customer have to call the PP via phone with the provided real phone number and repeat the received text.After the verification process the PP creates a certificate with the customer data and encrypts it with his own private key (to make it save against edits). then another encryption with the customers puplic key and sends it to the customer (maybe on a usb drive via mail, not sure about this yet).The customer now decrypts the file with the PP's public key and now has his authentifaction file.Now everytime the customer logs in he has to upload this file, has to type his password and again his "number password" on a rotating virtual number block.This processing makes sure:-that the password cant get logged-cracking a password is a lot more difficult because you will need to crack the real password plus the number password which will provide the 100000th fold security of the normal password (5+ digits = at least 5^10) plus to make a automated cracking script you first need to make the script recognize the number fields on the virtual keyboard-sniffing the network for the certificates isnt enough because you also need the password-if you are able to crack the password you still need to sniff the network for the certificate fileWell I really hope this would work and I'm not typing bullshit right now, this headache is killing me. 1 and 3 shouldn't be a big problem here, just a few json-rpc calls afaik. but 2 needs either an official standard code inside the html files that can be recognized by the addon or something like a database with all bitcoin accepting pages that have to be updated every now and then.I don't know how to make Chrome extensions, just wanted to say something ontopic. What prevents me from generating 10 GPG keys, publish a message with the first 9 that there was a successful trade with number 10 (and in the opposite direction) and then scam people with my 10th account which now has a fake reputation ? Hi, will mich hier auch nur mal schnell als Deutscher outen.PMs an mich können also auch auf Deutsch geschreiben werden. List of stolen PayPal accounts/scammers (md5 hashs to protect real users):5e03f3b731cdf0e9df83a160cc18f6196f0bfca764f8c5d028a29182a75e937e @dwdollar:Uhm, today, many of my bitcoinmarket transactions were cancelled, even if I already received the money.Does that mean the buyer was a scammer and the money will be retracted ? Or is it just a mistake ?It's about the jen...se@web.de address I mentioned yesterday. Trade ID 944.Feel free to contact me via pm or post in this thread. there is a survey ? you never heard of 4chan, did you ? But you can't change back prepaid cards into money, and I guess all the others are little to none known.I guess we should compare all of them and pick the best one for our purposes and make it a quasi-standard. Yeah, if we really belive in bitcoin as a good thing, we just have to come up with a good solution for these problems and we better be quick before bad news like this start to mass. I actually have some Mhash/s myself so I won't need your service, but I'm interested in your business model.Is your "machine" running 24/7 ? Any guaranteed uptime ?I mean, it's great to have 10Mhashs/s bought from you, but when you only let it run for about an hour, I'll definitely won't make any profit. I know that a.k...99@gmx.de ... He always retracted his money, good thing I haven't confirmed the transaction @ bitcoinmarket.Is jen...se@web.de known to cause any troubles ? Maybe we need an exchange market with "real ID's", like with post-ident or something.Maybe I`m wrong here, but I think anonymity isn't necessary while exchanging currencies.When we know the identity of our trading partner we can press charges against him.This could lead to less-doubious trades, but I guess it isnt 100% safe, and the need to reveal a persons true identity will probably lead to a very small user base ...An alternative to this would be a good "trust system", maybe with different layers of trust. the higher you are (the more you become trusted) the more you can trade. Only thing I'm not quite sure about is how the process of "trusting someone" is supposed to be.Maybe something like a karma (thumbs up/down) system I've seen in some boards. Or maybe like a detailed rating like ebay has.Another alternative would be a real official escrow service (I hope my definition of escrow service is right). Best without the option to retract the money (breach of contract).A real Ltd. or something with someone who is responsible for all actions, someone who can be charged if he is stealing BTC's or (other) money. But I guess the only way to make this system attractive will be relatively high fees, and who wants to pay even more than with paypal ?I don't know what the best option will be but what I do know is that we need to realise something like that soon. hmm flinc sounds interesting.well, I guess if we make a German section, we need some German speaking moderators.oh and yeah, by the way, I'm one of those evil evil Germans ;P and I know we're at least three (^_-) Then maybe I'm lucky. No trades with that email. Are there any paypal adresses that are known to be scammers ?I made a few trades with some guys which seem to be German (paypal names look german).Should I expect to get ripped off ? Yes, I am.Uhm, does anyone know if poclbm works with mutliple graphic cards ?

Actually, I can't see any glorification here.My guess is, that they try to show that the current situation is that critical, that they can't afford to hesistate.(shown exaggerated by letting the non-ecos explode) Afaik, the NSA is able to break a 512-bit encryption.

I've tried it two years ago.In my opinion Alliance is way better (but doesn't work with torrents), but if all of you are using OneSwarm now I will give it another try. http://www.maximumcompression.com/index.html I don't feel like throwing a coin when I see these ads on the site. age: grown-upgender: i have onenation: internetional;P Sry, not attractive to me  1) Have you been using bitcoin for more than two months?Yep, since Dec 2009.2) Are you currently attempting to generate coins?Not permanently.3) If not currently generating, have you attempted in the past? If generating, how long have you been generating?--> 1)4) Have you ever succeeded in generating a block? Many blocks?Yep, many :-)5) Why or why not do you generate? Purely profit-oriented comparison of cost of generation with market value in another currency? Just for fun? As a selfless contribution to the mathematical strength of the proof of work?Personal profit and contribution to the network. love that smoothing iron on his head xD I guess you could use a browser cookie in addition to the other security measurements.Still no effective protection, but might decrease the amount of cheating people.

Just found another fakecoin in my wallet.66 Oh, now I see.Well, until I found an adequate sha-256 rainbow table, I guess I'll take Number 55. Yeah but I thought the seed is inside the interval (1,100), isn't it ? So, basically what to do is guessing a number in the interval (1,100) and the (unsalted) hash of the solution is already given ? Made my day xD Sounds like a total rip-off. Downloading the chain block manually should speed up the initial startup of Bitcoin. Yep. You don't have forward the port to connect to other nodes. Last edit: 23.05.2014You first have to trust a person, before you can trust this persons list, but anyways:successful trades so far:(this means there has been at least one trade with these people, it does NOT mean, you can trust these people blindly)Users:alexmatbitdragon cavedenJollyGreenknightmbMahkulptmhdribuckSofoxSites:BitMarket (not in business anymore)LocalBitcoinsBitstampMD5-hashes of PayPal email adresses:2202d3ed20d9986cb50a9f09588286d427a03dee52adfccbf826c7f23d50a56550524068d1acf5fed516a40f78a8f9df5454fd104410683de72d5b584137968655369789466d7e1efaf7ad80e6cfeebe574fce66f2d632d9b2a58131617372da6c7bc5fffa5f2cc9262b00d626231d82c8d7a8bfcca7e634c4faacea5e4f00cec975ee5caca381c16bddaaf34ff434b5d84842b0d6523c40ef4d73531b9b7e6ceafe4c42739d9c906ec595c761ad2059eec1e9c2298a2f85a24649f3fb381348f1c923621eaebb843b44e18b8f2b0b43fd065bad1afc67c2ae772051f31ba331If someone does not want to be on this publicly available list, pls pm me and I will remove your name from it. But than you make a change in the system. That can be suspicious.If you're just reading it from the RAM and using it, nobody will know. Not sure whether I want to donate to a site which is overflowing with ads. the ip addresses aren't for trading purposes, only for staying in connection with the network. oic *donating* that's not really what I'm afraid of, but thats an issue too.hmm, but still, in theory, it would be possible for someone with physical access to your RAM to read my password, wouldn't it ? afaik you can get the transaction fees even if you are not generating coins at all. iOpus seems like a normal VPN provider, thats totally different from services like tor or i2p Maybe I'm, just too paranoid, but I think everyone who has physical access to the server on which your site is hosted can read my password out of the RAM if you only hash it once you receive it. and if he/she has my login data he could act as me and legally withdraw the funds in my mtgox account.  why not just hash it before encrypting and sending it ?EDIT 2014-02-27:See this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3876#msg3876 when you modulo-devide it trough 50, the rest could be from transaction fee, he's running ~1000 instances (or at least cores) of bitcoin, so the probability of him getting transaction fees is very high.
I recommend using the torrent.(Watch my sig) No, you don't.No, you don't, but it's always good to make a backup. it could be transaction fees. this won't prevent you from stealing your users cash and btc. pls correct me if i'm wrong.and i say it again, i want you to delete my account and all associated data.maybe i will re-register later, but for now i decided to not using your service.sry for making you such a hard start into business, but it's 5 am here and i'm a bit stressed out.will go to sleep now.EDIT 2014-02-27:See this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3876#msg3876 you could buy BTC cheap at one of them and sell them fore more at the other exchange service (if the exchange rates fit in that pattern)EDIT 2014-02-27:See this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3876#msg3876 so how does it work ?password --->encryption (ssl) ---> your site/server && decryption ---> hashing ---> saving/checking hash in db ?as long as you receive the password unencrypted, it's just not an option for meEDIT 2014-02-27:See this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3876#msg3876 You can't use unhashed passwords at a site, that deals with money. That's just one big mistake you just can't make if you want to make such a thing. What if someone hacks your database ? He could steal the money and BTC funded in all your users accounts.maybe the transmission is secured, but what's with your database ? Since you don't transmit hashes I guess the passwords get stored in clear text.EDIT 2014-02-27:See this post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444.msg3876#msg3876 https://mtgox.com/users/login?username=SmokeTooMuch&password=XXXXXXXwhat the fuck!?! use hashes for transmitting and saving passwords!!!!and btw, I cant log insorry to say that, but until now your exchange service is just a password-ripoff service .... BTW: I want you to delete my account and all associated info (like my password, dude!)I will re-register when you fixed that password thing ...EDIT 2004-02-27:Since this post has gotten some attention from reddit I feel I should clarify a few things.At the time of posting this I had a very naive perception of IT security. It is perfectly normal for sites to receive their users passwords in cleartext and hashing them after (server-side).I've since learned a lot about IT security and want to apologize for the inconvenience I brought upon the service back then.The real problem was not the un-hashed transfer, but the transfer via GET (readable in URL) as opposed to POST (non-readable in URL), so the only attack vector was an "over the shoulder attack". Bitcoin is not about generating coins and sell them for money.Bitcoin is about trading and people should start seeing it this way.Of course it`s nice to get some "free" coins by generating them yourself but if that's all what bitcoin is to you, you should start questioning whether bitcoin is the right thing for you. http://twitter.com/nenolodI'm curious about that. Is this why bitcoinexchange.com is down ? http://www.joeyrich.com/Maybe you try to contact him by phone, Just saying, if we will ever reach 21 million users, there were a potential budget of 1BTC for every user.Of course there will be rich one with several thousand coins and poor ones with only a thousandth of a BTC.Actually it isn't 21,000,000 fix units of bitcoins but 21,000,000,000,000 units of a millionth of a BTC.And i think there's the option to make them even more divisible (not sure about this), so deflation is not a problem here.-EDITED- Wow, that's ...... not really enough for having an exchange service^^ actually, I don't think bitcoins userbase will ever raise above 21 million, so there will be 1 BTC for everyone, which is devisible into 1million parts.I don't really see a problem here. --> BuyBitCoins.com - Buy Bitcoins with your credit card this is definitely needed. I can't see whats malicious about his actions.Hording bitcoins and selling them later to create inflation ?So ? Wow, inflation, that's definitely something a free market can't handle ... 15 connections was the maximum of 0.2 without port forwarding.but it doesn't matter how much connections you have, 1 is enough, all the others are redundant. i think you mean bitcoinexchange.com.not sure if this is really a market or an exchange service with fixed rates. Only me seeding right now ^^
BTW: You could do the Bitcoin community a great service with hosting this torrent for free:http://knightmb.dyndns.org/files/bitcoin/BitcoinBlocks.torrent https://bitcoinmarket.comExchanged 1000BTC to ~70 USD (~50 EUR after paypal fees) a hour ago.Current highest bid is 0.075 USD per BTC, so 995 BTC are worth 74,625 USD.And I expect the bids to raise the next few days. 995 BTC is currently worth ~50 EUR, so I recommend to adjust your prices. I think a buddy of me is already taking part of this. I'll ask him occasion, maybe I'll take part, too. ...so ?  ^^ WTF ?i guess this should be 0,021 and not 21. what a pitty ^^wait... what ? wow, the (asked) exchange rate doubled today.hope this won't make the people hord the coins even more but spend it for useful things or exchange them. That's true, but only when you brute-force every singe hash.There are other know attacking methods for SHA algorithms, thats why it is planned to replace the SHA-2 family with SHA-3 soon.German source:http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm#Empfehlungen 61°C shouldn't be a problem, so maybe it's a software issue.Can't help you with that, but I'm sure the devs will. That is correct.And thiscould also be correct. All newer CPU'S start throttling down their speed if they recognize a high temperature. It's a safety feature.So mabye that's your problem. Try reading you CPUs temperature sensor out (I recommend CoreTemp) and tell us what temperatures you have when the hashing slows down. Hey, can you please raise the amount of allowed signs in the signature from 300 to 500 ?300 signs seem to be enough but the bitcoin addresses and the links take quite some place, even if you shorten the links with bit.ly or like.If there's more space in the signature, I could write the people which successfully traded with me down for example.This could work as an proof of trust. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=316.0Maybe that thread helps. the thing is that the initial blockchain download is quite slow for most of the users.mostly because every block has to be verified first and i think if you download the whole blockchain as a file, only the last few blocks habe to be verified. but I'm not sure about this. The only thing that's slow is hashing the files.The rest goes pretty quick. make a windows binary and I'll be insta-testing  http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=13.0 Question number 6http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=44.0http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198.0http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=245.0Why is nobody using the board search ? If you want to do that you should do it as soon as possible because every new write-access could overwrite the sector where that file is still stored. hmm that indeed seems odd.if you still got the other version of your wallet.dat try to use that. you can use this torrent http://knightmb.dyndns.org/files/bitcoin/BitcoinBlocks.torrent for the block download. why use an external service with free user restriction when we can build our own infrastructure ?
ok here's the torrent.since i have no webspace and don't know a tracker without registration, i uploaded it to rapidshare, hope that's not a problem.http://rapidshare.com/files/406964866/BitcoinBlocks.torrent.html*seeding*edit: yay the first peer  ok, guess I will make a torrent to contribute here just gimme a few mins, i'll be back soon Maybe we want to torrent such a file ?When the file becomes bigger and more and more users are loading bittorrent seems like a good way to handle the traffic and ensuring the availability of that file. First of all, if you have 15 connections, you are running the old 0.2 version.Check the new 0.3 out.Second: Port forwarding isn't necessary for generating, receiving or sending coins.Third: It's pretty hard to generate any coins at the moment, so I guess you won't have any problem there, its normal.Forth: For setting up multiple machines, check this thread http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=54.0 I didn't really expect much more but if we put it in relation with almost-full-speed f2f networks it's just no option for me.I2PHex doesn't even connect to any host.iMule has about 190 nodes now and yes torrents seem to be the most popular filesharing thing inside .i2pIf anyone's interested in a f2f filesharing network with me, here are some details:- about 2 TB of content to share- DSL 3000 connection, but will probably updated to DSL32k soon The production rate depends on your hashs per second and the probability of 1 hash to be the right one.so basically khash/s * luck factor = generaterd bitcoins. http://bitcoin2cash.com/https://www.bitcoinexchange.com/https://www.bitcoinmarket.com/http://newlibertystandard.wetpaint.com/http://www.bitcoinfx.cz.cc/And if you want to get 5 free bitcoins:https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/Have I forgotten something ?Well, if you don't want to use any of these services, you can trade with me.I will sell you 1000 BTC for 15 EUR. If you want to pay via PayPal I want you to pay the fees.Feel free to contact me via pm.Offer expired. i2p filesharing is also kinda "closed".but i see what you mean.can you recommend any filesharing service inside the i2p service ?i heard about i2pshark a while ago, but not sure if its the best/most common solution.EDIT: ok I gave i2p a try, but seriously, it's terribly slow.I tried iMule, I2PHex and I2Psnark and I really prefer my darknet solution.So, if anyone's interested ... the offer for a filesharing darknet is still open  Hi,I'm trying to find people for a F2F filesharing network for quite some time now, and I think here, in an forum with members who care about anonymity, I might think I could find some people who are interested in such a thing.I prefer AllianceP2P for the software, because it has the ability to encrypt the traffic, is open-source and easy to use, but if you persist to use another software, feel free to tell me to use that instead.http://www.alliancep2p.com/ I`d like to see anonymous vServers. I also have a 10 PSC code that I'd like to sell.look here http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=15.msg2759#msg2759 Hey guys, after the slashdotting I bought a new 10 PSC code and I'm willing to again try to exchange it into bitcoins here.I want 725 BTC for a 10 EUR Paysafecard code.If anyone is interested pls pm me with an offer. I hope you will have fair exchange rates, because there is hard competition in this business. Mainly because the gold sellers are running bots or chinese children lol! Simple answer because it's 2:38am here:hashing Hi, since many people are having problems with Microsoft Security Essentials, why not making a thread about good anti-virus alternatives.I'm currently testing the free version of PandaCloud Antivirus.It's an anti-virus tool based on cloud computing so information about newly recognized malware gets instantly streamed to all peers, so its up to date at any time. And it doesn't interfere with bitcoin As far as I can judge now, I will keep PandaCloud on my system.I had Avira Antivir Personal Edition before, but with every new version they released it got more and more bloated and slower (personal impression). It still is a good tool which I used for many years now, so, if you don't trust the new "cloud-technology-antivirus-systems" it's a good choice for you. Didn't have any problems with bitcoin either.Now its your turn:Which antivirus solutions can you recommend ?Which are no-gos ? Is it possible to get more ports? maybe with a low one-time payment per extra port ?And what transfer speeds can a single user expect ? Is there any limit ?For example: Will you exchange 50000 BTC to 500 USD ? Or is this too much ? I don't think their is any renicing under Windows. I guess you are still at the initial download of the current block chain.until your blockcount is around 66k you still have to download the blocks and verify them. this takes quite some hard-drive performance, so maybe thats what is slowing down your system. I think posting all of that data is a bit useless now, afaik the threadstarter has canceled paused his project.
I recommend to remove the download links at the bottom of the main page.As you can see the links on the English page points to the new 0.3 release, but the other languages only contain links for the old 0.2 version.There's a download box with the current releases on the right anyway, so why not remove the links from the translated pages. C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\BitcoinThat's where the wallet.dat and the block database is stored.Maybe you can find the bug there.Win7 64-Bit here and no problems with running Bitcoin 0.3. Lovers gonna love  Does it really say, that the bitcoins could not get received or does it say the transaction is still unconfirmed ?Don't worry about the second case, it just means that the bitcoins have to get confirmed by the other nodes.This happened after 120 blocks in the old bitcoin version (0.2). I`m not sure about the amount of block on 0.3.If they really couldn't get received I can't give you an advice, this is above my knowledge, but I'm sure the other forum members are able to help you with that  Yeah, it sounds like a heat problem, but without further information about your system and the bitcoin version you are using we can't provide exact advice. yeah, usually you just forward the inbound port to the same destination port.that only differs if you run a service locally with a certain port, but you want people to connect to the service via another port.this scenario wont really apply to the normal computer user. oh, didn't know that.thanks for the info! Total agreement here. basically the advantage of making a new address every time is anonymity.when you don't want anyone (who knows your old address, typically customers or, if you made it public potentially everyone) to recognize you that is a basic step you have to do.In my opinion there's no disadvantage except for the minimum raised work for clicking "new address".The only exception here is if you want to run a static account (like when you post the address to get donations), because afaik you can't reuse an address once you got a new one. for example: ivacy.com offers a free usenet account and grants access to their own filesharing website.but 15/month is more than 5, so they better have to offer more ^^i think i will try your service when my system gets the new harddrive i am waiting for. a backup feature is a good idea and easy to implement. I`d like to have some details about this service.OpenVPN?PPTP / IPSec ?port forwarding ?p2p filesharing allowed ?any bonus services ?are you a relakks/ipredator.se reseller ?I was thinking about going to http://ivacy.com, but your service sounds interesting. Sorry but it's not the system that doesn't work.I tested your roulette quite some time now and I can say, that it is not a fair roulette.There has to be some pattern-finding algorithm built-in.Feel free to test it with "Play for fun". But make sure to try it a few times.As far as I can say right now it is not always enabled.(I know it sounds like I'm just stupid and really it's accident, but for example: last night i played and there we're like 50 times red in a row and as soon as I picked black it was red. This happened a few times now and not only to me but also to a friend of mine so it doesn't seem to beaccident.)I hope you didn't implement this by intention. I guess it's just the software you're using.But as long as I feel there's something wrong with your casino, I will not play in it, sry.EDIT:there's also some interesting info about your software and his developer:http://www.casinomeister.com/forums/casino-industry-discussion/17855-jackpotsoft-gamingcenter-vs-boss-media-2.html#post162201 Once lost = forever lost.we call it "natural deflation".the lost coins wont be recovered or regeneratet at any time. are you using opera ? Sorry, but that's just terribly wrong.And in addition: running an exit node doesn't make you able to reveal someone's identity. (at least not without heavy traffic analysis and further information about you)having an own VPS for proxy/vpn only makes sense if you can buy it anonymously.the guys who give good service always check your registration information, so faking name etc. doesn't really work.i haven't heard of any vps providers that sell their servers to an anonymous person, but if you know one, pls let me know.  to be honest .. the logo looks quite crappy..but i also like the idea of a bitcoin merchandise shop.i'd be glad to buy a (good looking) bitcoin t-shirt ! (maybe with the option to buy for bitcoins ?) does't the use of someone elses internet make the use of a proxy needless ?(i'm thinking of unsecured wlans and stuff) last weak my hard drive crashed, good thing i backed up my wallet as soon as i got my hard drive exchanged by western digital i will be back in the bitcoin system. and if you are not trustworthy, you will make a new account here this system doesnt work ^^
using proxies is only advantageous if the proxy owner can be trusted.I`m sorry but I dont know anything about you, so I wont give you my traffic.PS: if it can be considered that only the forum members use that proxy, it gives even less anonymity than a normal public one. if thats true, its pretty useless to make the website only accessable through tor.enabled javascript = not anonymous you mean an advertise service ?with banners?hmm, sounds interesting but to be honest, most of these services are distrusted because they never pay out or less than you should earn and I dont think an "untrusted" currency will cause more trust in such a service. sounds interesting, maybe the already existing bitcoin auction house (some .onion-adress i cant remember, but can be found here in the forums) can use that idea. tl;drthere already is a marijuhana store in the .onion network(will read the whole thread when I got some more time) I have a Quadcore with 4x2,66 GHz and it still takes very long to generate coins.Be patient  lol! Win7 64-Bit here. someone make a windows binary for noobs/lazy people like me ^^ is the gpu-computing-client compatible with the normal client so the gpu-generated bitcoins will emmit into the same pool as the cpu-generated ones ? In my opinion your translation is fine, DataWraith.Just two things:1. I think the "f" in Sourceforge should be uppercase. At least that`s what wikipedia tells me.2. It sounds better when you write it like this:Abhängig davon, wieviel CPU-Zeit Sie im Leerlauf beitragen können, kann es einige Tage dauern bis die ersten Münzen erzeugt werden - haben Sie also bitte etwas Geduld.(the &endash; doesn`t get resolved correctly, you better check that again or replace it with a normal comma) that reminds me of my intention to do a german translation ^^ are the different exchange rates for EUR-->BTC and BTC-->EUR correct ?shouldn't they be the same ? Win7 Pro 64-BitRadeon HD4870 512MB the new core i7 have RSA-acceleration, not sure whether SHA takes advantages of this. afaik it doesnt really matter if you set the priority manually because bitcoins creates new threads everytime it generates a block and these threads have a low (?) priority by default.correct me when i'm wrong. Auction is over.Since nobody has made the starting bid, the bitcoins do not change their owner. give us some more details about the ipod, pls. Interesting how people fuse my ideas ^^(paysafe cards (http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=15.0) and WeBid as auction platform (http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30.msg307#msg307), tried that before here http://bitbid.biz.uz/bitbid/, it's not in use actually)Only thing I have to complain about is that you combine TOR (site) and I2P (mail support), this makes things unnecessarily more complicated.I'm sure I'll make an account sooner or later, keep up the good work ! You're right but most of you live outside Germany or even outside the EU so the money transfer via mail is expensive and takes much much longer than a paypal tranfser. Additonally I don't think that there is actually a need of being anonymous at this auction.Everything is pseudonymous here and so is paypal (in a certain manner).But I see the problem in a lack of interest in receiving BTC, not in how the people have to pay them.Maybe I will start an "opposite auction" (aution USD/EURO off and people can bid BTC) next week, we'll see.
OLD THREAD IS OLD!Hi,I want to make a little experiment here:I want to auction 10,000 BTC off, starting bid is 50 USD.(10k BTC are currently worth ~65.50 USD)The auction will run for seven days.It will finish @ 6th April 3.00am German Time (usually UTC +1h, +2h at the moment).(for the correct time look here: http://www.weltzeituhr.com/laender/039_e.shtmlTo make a bid you have to post in this thread here and say how much you bid.Only condition: every bid has to be at least 1 USD higher than the previous one.After the auction is over, I will pm the highest bidder and will send him 5000 BTC, then I will wait until the bidder has transfered his money to my paypal account and will then send the other 5000 BTC. This is necessary to protect me from false/joke bidders.Enough said,Good luck  usually these services just forward your DynDNS name to your real ip.nothing is protected or hidden here.just type "ping DynDNS adress" in any windows console and you get the ip. Hehe, that was my idea you thief But there was a lack of customers, so I closed my service.Good luck with that  Can you rehost it somewhere else or send a non-freenet link per pm ?I never used freenet before and I dont want to install it just for this single document. I still dislike the currency symbol ... But at least the logos look good and clean. haha, reminds me of this http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Operation_LIONCASH ^^ This pretty much looks like your local ip.look here http://whatismyipaddress.com for your public ip. you should state some info about your service on the page.couldn't find anything about up/download speeds or traffic limits. why do we even need fees ? i thougt the no-fees-feature was one of the advantages of bitcoin ?! had the same a while ago with 50.26 Hi, one thing just came to my mind and I want to share the idea with you guys.Is there any free/cheap software or CMS for building an online auction house like ebay ?I really like the idea of eBay with BTC EDIT: ok, found some stuff here http://www.hotscripts.com/category/php/scripts-programs/auctions/, maybe i will set something up, hmm ... I don't want to buy the wallpaper for the same reasons I don`t want to buy wallpapers for real money:There are free sources for very good wallpapers, so why spend money for it ? Do you want it as plain-text or a .html or .php file ? i registered today and i think i see a major privacy issue there.when i klick on my profile i can clearly see my password, so i guess it is saved "as is" in your database and not as a hash or something.you should change this. I can translate it into German, if you wish. i will stick to BTC, too. 2x 0.01 BTC sent.0.01 BTC per Bitcoin adress and 0.01 BTC per IP-adress.I don't need it back BTW: http://trunk.torstatus.kgprog.com/ is telling me I'm using TOR, but I`m not. It shows my real IP. everytime i try to access the eCahce site it is down ... hmm. Can you give me working link of an eCache interface or something like a homepage ?Can't find a working link of eCache in the .onion network NewLibertyStandard changed the calculation of the exchange rate at January 2010.The reason was, that he wanted to set the price of bitcoins to the money he has to pay to generate them (electricity + internet).
