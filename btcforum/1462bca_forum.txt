rpc1MpV8KhQHpZ7hxL6xwvNRwCyYprRhrR It seems like I have an issue with generating coins.  Based on the current difficulty and my hashes/sec (about 4300khash/s), I should be generating a block about once a week.This seemed to work for the first block, but since then, it has behaved differently.  Here is the dates I generated.9/01/2010 (first block I generated)9/14/2010 (a little longer than expected, but not too bad)9/14/2010 (about 80 blocks after the last one)9/15/2010 (about 60 blocks after the last one)9/16/2010 (about 250 blocks after the last one)The last three seem way too frequent.  I was wondering if the difficulty suddenly decreased, or if their might be some issue.  Not that I am complaining about generating so many, it just seems like this is quite a bit more frequent than I should be generating.  Has anyone else had this issue recently?
