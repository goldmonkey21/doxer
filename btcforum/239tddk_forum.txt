But if you had malware on your pc wouldnt that mean that your wallet would be locked all the time as the virus would simply keep trying? I have a suggestion for a coin, but as i am not a programmer i need advice.Basically its a ppcoin clone with a few differences.1. The program should have a built-in voting protocol (one coin, one vote) so that you could split the coin like when companies split a stock. That is, when the value of the coin rises (hopefully) you could vote for a split to better enable small transactions. As i understand bitcoin, and bitcoin-like protocols the smallest transaction possible is fixed which i think is stupid as none of us can imagine how small transactions will be needed in the future.2. Perhaps i havent understood the "proof of burn" principle, but would it be possible to demand the burning of one coin to unlock the wallet. Im sure we all worry a bit about wallet-stealing software but dont these programs simply try millions of combinations precisely because its free. If each guess cost one coin wouldnt that make it far more secure.3. Is it possible to have the program come with a built-in i2p-router for better anonymity?English is my second langauge so please forgive grammatical clumsiness.Love to hear your thoughts. Check out bitcoinjobs.http://www.bitcoinjobs.com/ Thank you for the advice.I have decided to advertise bitcoin through google adwords. Is it possible to donate money to the bitcoinproject. Its a great idea but the software seems too limited as a tradeplatform, perhaps its due to lack of funding. If donations (banktransfers)are possible then please include IBAN-number.
