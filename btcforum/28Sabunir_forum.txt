I have no specific reason to doubt integrity, but verification is always desirable. https://mtgox.com/users/withdraw: "If you live in the US or EU we can send it to you by direct deposit. Minimum withdraw amount in the US by direct deposit is $800. There is no fee."Has anyone used this before? I would like to know if it is reliable. Feel free to donate to me, too: 1BHtsCnpmTvpgJEP7eMKEVhpJFunxSM8vq I think you have mistaken "public key" cryptography for normal cryptography. Please read this, if that concept is new to you - Bitcoin uses this technology for coin transfers. Otherwise, I must misunderstand you. I do not believe that this is a problem. When some receives coins, they have no way of telling who it came from. So if the hypothetical exchanger* and the seller shared usage data, all they would know is that you (and many other people) bought coins, and that someone sent coins to the seller.Of course, this is my understanding, and I'm not an expert.*There's no need to single out NLS. Agreement with DannyM. Bitcoin should not be centered around criminal usage.Â  Not only will it hamper Bitcoin's usage for legitimate usage, it will also harm Bitcoin's image (thus killing its potential to spread). Focusing Bitcoin on illegal uses is short sighted. Thank you. I have updated my "Accept Bitcoin" buttons and banner (version twos) to use your new coin. With satoshi's release of the new official Bitcoin coin graphic, I've updated my entries to use it. Choices are now between my recreation of the old coin and satoshi's official new coin. You have a valid point, fergalish. However, I think that more important than the total "economic importance" is the total human rights fulfilled. It is in the spirit of "Better to let 10 criminals go free than to condemn one innocent man".But I suppose a counter argument is if higher criminal "economic importance" would cause more human rights violations than were prevented. So, indirectly, you may be right. This thread has moved off-topic. I am interested in reading more responses to NewLibertyStandard's initial questions. Advantages:- Resist/protest unlawful/unfair taxes/government- Prevent privacy intrusions (financial records) from governments/banks/corporations- Counter-economic forceDisadvantages:- Criminal usage (including money laundering)- No means of refunds or fraud insuranceWhich is more important:The advantages will always be more important as long as there are more regular users than criminal users and there are no better methods for a user to gain the advantages. That is fine, BitcoinFX. I invoked Copyleft just so that everyone could do such things. Simply, you may do whatever you want with them except claim they are your creation and try to sell them.I am glad I could help you in your efforts to promote Bitcoin. Here is a different version of my design, to your specifications. I hope you find it acceptable.Again, I will accept and may utilize suggestions. Writing "bitcoin.org" on paper money is not good, I think. Is it not illegal to deface money? Does Bitcoin need to come to governments' attentions in form of a crime? Excellent. This would be a good resource for those participating in the banner contest. Why unequal dimensions?My only suggestion would be to make the coin's text stand out more. At tiny resolutions outlines tend to be come unworkable, so a better option may be to experiment with contrast. Making the text significantly darker than the rest of the coin would likely increase readability. Alternately, you could make the inner circle color darker, and the text lighter. I see. However, Copyleft is a general concept, and GPL is not its only form. For instance, there's also Design Science License or Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike. But if you want to adopt my images, I can simply drop the Copyleft.Also, I thank those two who have donated to me. You did "made my day", and encouraged me to make artwork for Bitcoin. I like them. Do they come in higher resolutions? I am not that picky. Growth of the Bitcoin network and promoting more widespread usage is sufficient reward to me. Public domain? No. My images are Copyleft, to myself (satoshi or any other Bitcoin developers can have the rights to these images, upon request). In practice, Copyleft works almost the same as public domain. You are completely free to use, share, or modify my images. If you do, please consider listing me in your credits or donating an amount of coins to me, but this isn't required. Good ideas. Updated:These may be used freely by all, but I will graciously accept donations: 1BHtsCnpmTvpgJEP7eMKEVhpJFunxSM8vqEDIT) Added smaller versions, inspired by Ensayia's submission.
I attempt a contribution:EDIT) This is old version. Design has been updated.Image original is saved as proprietary vector format, can be resized without loss of quality. Bitcoin graphic had to be remade by myself as vector. I will accept and may implement suggestions. Ideas? I would want a copy of this hypothetical CUDA-enabled client. However, I doubt that GPGPU acceleration would affect generation speeds very much. Only the most expensive of modern graphics cards have a clock speed of over 1 Ghz, after all. These improvements sound good. Thank you for your continued development of the application. As a suggestion, you could consider shortening "From: unknown, Received with:" to "From: unknown, Paid to:" How do you adjust this difficulty, anyway? (Administrating a decentralized system?) And what would prevent an attacker from setting the difficulty very low or very high to interfere with the system? My port is open, both in my software and hardware firewall. My router is handling it appropriately. Perhaps it has to do with my connection's very high latency (2000ms or more on average) and/or my high packet loss (sometimes up to 10% loss)? I would like to comment that as of late, it seems almost as if I am generating nearly no Bitcoins. Indeed, my rate of acquisition seems to be greater than ten times slower. If I cannot stay online for about fourteen consecutive hours (very hard to do on a satellite connection!), I actually get nothing at all.How this exactly relates to the difficulty adjustments is beyond my knowledge; I offer this feedback as a kind of "field report". It seems apparent that this offer is not desired. In interest of refining future attempts: Why?- You don't like the picture?- You don't accept the price?- Other reasons? Perhaps there should be a feature against this? For instance, if a transaction isn't accepted by the recipient for a long period of time (a month?), the transaction will be canceled and the coins returned to the one who sent them? I think that using any existing currency's symbol will cause potential confusion. Another disadvantage of that symbol is that it is not a key on most keyboards, so it would not be able to be typed easily. I would think that the ampersand (&) would be a better choice.I agree that its three-letter code could be BTC. Relatedly, what protections are in place for preventing someone from forging a Bitcoin Address? 1) What would happen if one attempts to send an amount of coins to an IP address that isn't running the program?2) What would happen if one attempts to send an amount of coins to a invalid Bitcoin Address?3) What would happen if one attempts to send an amount of coins to a Bitcoin Address that nobody owns?4) What would happen if one attempts to send an amount of coins to a Bitcoin Address that used to be owned, but has since been abandoned (recipient stopped running the program, or deleted their wallet)?I thank answerers for expanding my knowledge. Anonymous transferring of currency to other parties is a critical requirement of privacy. Additionally, the controlled inflation of Bitcoins is a trait that I find agreeable. Lastly, since Bitcoin doesn't have a central authority, it does not revolve around a parasitic entity.I lend my resources to the network to help support its growth, in the hope that one day it will grow into a viable alternative to existing monetary systems, and thus promote the privacy of networked individuals. Yes, encryption of messages would be a very good thing... So the problem is not that you can't store the message on the network, but rather, that you do not yet have a good way of encrypting it? So that transaction will eventually read "1000 blocks" or more? Is this information important? I believe I understand. Can the -datadir path be relative? That is, if the wallet.dat file is in the same directory as bitcoin.exe, would one execute "bitcoin.exe -datadir ./"? Hello. My understanding of Bitcoin is not perfect, so I would like to ask questions about its operation. When Generating, the user will gain 50 coins after creating 120 blocks. Why does the program continue generating blocks after that point? And why does one not gain another 50 coins after generating 240 blocks?Also, I sent a few coins to someone to test the transaction system. Even though it was just a few coins, that transaction's status currently reads "166 blocks". It seems that it will continue incrementing indefinitely. Why is this?I thank responders for increasing my knowledge. No messages that way? That seems less than ideal. Very well, what would be a more correct way to do this?For now, if anyone sends 500 coins and tells me in Private Message the time they sent it, I shall respond with a link to the picture. I second the request for 64-bit support, even if it wouldn't make the app run faster. I'm no expert, but I can't see any harm in it. On the other hand, it's a good way to embrace the future. I assume you tested it, then, and it didn't work? Very well. Hm, what about decimals? I notice that my balance is 0.00. Could I send 0.01 coins? It occurred to me: Bitcoin is supposed to be about anonymity. Couldn't one further protect their anonymity if they could use Bitcoin from any random computer, not just their own? In other words, why not make Bitcoin a Portable App?At the moment, the Bitcoin wallet resides in %appdata%\Bitcoin. For a Portable Bitcoin, it'd need to be saved on the flash drive.This would raise additional security concerns, naturally. Most notably, what if the random computer tried to copy your wallet from the flash drive? The wallet would need to be encrypted. So it would be a good idea if wallet encryption was added, and the user had to enter the wallet's password to access it. Bitcoin would also have to be careful not to store the plaintext wallet in memory, in case the random computer was spying on its memory.What do you think?
