Really??? Spamming people whose e-mail addresses were leaked from Coinbase?  Are you really that desperate for investment?I received this e-mail about 10 minutes ago at a vanity address that was ONLY used with Coinbase.Not cool... not cool at all. Honestly, as a shareholder who was hacked, and then re-acquired almost all of his original position, I wish you the best.  But I have to ask, what data center are you working with?  Are they new?I talked to our data center and they could provision 2 - 5 cabinets, each with 4 30A 208v circuits, in 3 days if I paid about $1k per cab expedite fee.And no, this isn't Bob's house of chicken waffles & data centers.  It's kind of the 3rd largest data center in the United States.  Cognitive-PR, you may want to remove the two links in the footer of www.cognitivemining.com.  One is MtGox, which is rumored to be having problems of some sort, and the other is to bitbank.me, which appears to have expired and is now owned by a domain squatter. It was a combination of a hack against my Google Apps for Business account, and a feature that Havelock has since removed that allowed you to view your GAuth QR code once you were logged in without having to re-enter a 2FA code. Just a heads up for everyone.  I worked with Havelock, and we figured out how the hack occurred.  And they went out of their way to make things right.  I know that doesn't help the share price, but at least the exchange is trustworthy and willing to do the right thing. Yep, I had Google Authenticator enabled.  Which makes me wonder how secure Google Authenticator seeds are stored at havelock.Also, I didn't have country based ip locking enabled, which was stupid, and means that they could have used Tor without any issue. Nope, I had around 230 shares, and someone hacked into my Havelock account, sold all of my shares, and then withdrew around 10 BTC.I'm quite pissed off about this.EDIT: Here's the damage: So I signed up for a coinpunk.com hosted wallet, and sent some coins to it to test with.  However, when I try to send the coins to another address, the process fails.  Instead, the browser makes countless calls to https://wallet.coinpunk.com/api/wallet via JSON.The response is ALWAYS the same packet of JSON:Code:{  "result": "outOfSync",  "wallet": "{\"iv\":\"NMK0+62o5cYYhC8h8Yjobg==\",\"v\":1,\"iter\":1000,\"ks\":128,\"ts\":64,\"mode\":\"ccm\",\"adata\":\"\",\"cipher\":\"aes\",\"salt\":\"TI3wvDYBqo8=\",\"ct\":\"...stuff..."}"}I now have BTC1.5698 sitting there that I cannot access, and since I'm not a node.js programmer, I don't know how to extract my private keys from the exported wallet that I have on my computer.Can anyone help me figure this out, or at least write a tiny node.js bootstrap that will decrypt my wallet backup so I can retrieve my private keys?Many thanks!EDIT:  Still going!  We're up to 2,167 API JSON calls now!https://i.imgur.com/i3uor36.png Yeah, my bad, sorry.  Whenever rock-bottom shares are showing up, I buy them.  We'll see if I am ultimately marked crazy or not. :-) Um, sorry to hijack an old thread, but did you really mean 24 years old? Did he say why?  Just curious. You know, a Cognitive dividend would be nice right about now, seeing as you are continuing to mortgage the security's future and whatnot... OOOH!  Can I please pay $19 per BTC from an eBay seller with a zero rating?LOL, I guess that's why we're all stuck in Newbie land... Thanks for the update, I appreciate it!  It's totally my fault that I read without being logged in, I guess... I'm just not much of a talker!Although my MTGOX account number is under 250... that must be worth something? :-D Thankfully I don't seem so out of place on this thread any longer... :-) I too have been paid, although I only had 6.10 in the account as a dividend payment...https://blockchain.info/address/1KZyvUeTD3anYBiEbsrL2o2SpKgcRjxGuy Hi there!  I've been a member since 2010, but since I only read, I'm still a newbie. :-(How do I change that?
