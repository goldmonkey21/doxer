shop no longer available... bump Â  send me your offer!Â   got more starbucks? o.o size of community is not really a good way to filter them out given that many have airdrops and then end up with many thousands of followers or channel members that don't really contribute and are just in it for the airdrop. adding link to a few lists decentralized exchanges: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2906237.0 https://coinsutra.com/best-decentralized-exchanges-dex/https://media.consensys.net/state-of-decentralized-exchanges-2018-276dad340c79  will there ever be non-edu codes available again? ;_; ohai! looking to buy Uber codes, preferably from an established forum member or using Paxfulty!Â   ok then  non-edu -_____________- good to hear back from admin  i'm gonna start trying out a few of the top pools listed here http://sumopools.com :/ on to next pool :p can't really use the form if the whole site is down... sent pm! could this be considered criminal activity by the SEC? prolly been mentioned before (somewhere in the last 30 pages): babypips.com  getting to Legendary rank  do you guys have chat or irc?

sent PM! considered adding a social login feature? cryptocompare does it, and they recently nagged me enough to convince me to do social login :p that would also give you more user data than just simply collecting username and pass. also, put some ads on it, even if it's just referrals to Coinbase or something  unless you have a few thousand smartphones, it's not profitable. got feedback from other forum members? check ur PM! thanks for your offer, but the post says non-edu  waiting for codeÂ   busco todo tipo de cÃ³digos AWS non-edu.envÃ­a PM!

ddr1? access, preferrably in country with lax copyright lawsÂ   can someone sell me a seedbox for btc  workstation of the dayÂ   ty, let me know by post here, or highlight me in any of the btc-related irc channels on freenode. of courseÂ   i'm @ 00918 (San Juan), so take shipping to here in consideration. usps is fine.only pentium 4+ and ddr1+ please.also, if you a small matx/mini-itx portable case/pc (like cube cases), offer up Smileythanks! very nice read, error.Â   i remember all the magazines and printed directories of the web.Â  like big phone books but full of URLs, tiny descriptions and sometime screenshots.Â  surfing on 9.6k and 14.4k was funÂ  but all good things come to an end, http://www.wwwdotcom.com/ Â   you guys test too close, choose a server farther away to see if the connection is good enough when connecting to overseas servers.what good is having 100mbit fiber to home when you only get few tens of megabits when connecting to servers a few thousand miles away... win7 32 on netbook, server 2008 r2 on desktop, ubuntu server on second desktop, and crux on an old g4 mac. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=something&l=1now you know. Â  no way to start the day... looks like an office connection or a server inside a datacenterÂ   u'd be surprised  i'd avoid the big-name e-colleges and go instead (if you insist on online studies) with online divisions of traditional univs. e-studies will sometimes cost even more than attending in person. (avoid university of phoenix and the like)have a look at PBS Frontline's "College Inc." http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/collegeinc/?utm_campaign=homepage&utm_medium=proglist&utm_source=proglist spend your money wisely.btw, what field of study you loooking at? much better now, upload still sucks. i'm currently on an open wifi (prtc dsl), if no wifi is available i connect by ATT 3G tethered via bluetooth from a samsung flight2.Â  the cap for non-smartphones is 5GB, smartphones get only 2GB then $10 extra GB.  at home i used borrow the neighbors' wifi using this:ancient wrt54g-tm, dd-wrt mega. just moved to a new place, might change to a fancy new Ubiquiti bullet http://www.ubnt.com/bullet no need to say exact location (unless you post speedtest.net results).how do you get internet? cable? dsl? 3G? wimax? fiber to home? office lan? campus wifi?i'd like a thread with pix of your gear and speed resultsÂ  
do not want. truecrypt volume backed up to private folder on wuala cloud + to friends computers with crashplan gps jammers cheaper on dealextreme i'm afraid to even be posting hereÂ  brb, a black van just pulled up and two men in suits are at the door... did you pay for that server or did you get it for cheap, Dangler?Â  can you run irc clients/bouncers on slice host? saludos a todos desde PRÂ  si alguien necesita alguna traducciÃ³n envÃ­ame un mensaje privado al inbox.quizÃ¡s esto sea el primero paso y termine compartiÃ©ndolo en un thread aqui en el foroÂ   thanks for the tip vladimir.sent my whole bitcoin balance over to you right now  fancy a sneakernet? isn't shipping a few dvds full of mp3s faster than most connections? hmm. very fucking clever.Â   i want about 50, but they should have a little tiny text that reads at least bitcoin.org or bitcoin.it or bitcoinme.comi wouldnt want to have to sharpie the url inÂ   trust? some nice specs/features you asking for.what old cheap electronics are you looking for? how is it better than noscript?Â  if i had a list of every domain that ghostery blocked and left all of those as untrusted in noscript, wouldn't it be the same? so for social networking, it would be like having thousands of facebook nodes, with every friend's data on their own plug servers? do i have to join to see what content is available? i pledge 0.01btc to this btw Planet Money is a nice NPR podcast, been listening for some time, check it out atÂ  http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/ congrats on your first legal saleÂ   does the facebook code work for existing (old) facebook ads accounts? For desktop I run Server 2008R2 converted to workstation (c2d, 4GB, garden variety of hard drives) and win7 on the netbook (aspire one). Â Sometimes boot up PuppyLinux on the netbook. Â Everything else local is virtual machines. Â On the production servers hosted offsite I run CentOS and Ubuntu Server. i recognize most of your deal from a certain extreme website Â  they have to be!will you carry more computer/networking related gadgets?
