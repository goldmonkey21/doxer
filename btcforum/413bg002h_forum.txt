Im a dual satellite user. Its a little bit like magic still to me. But now my coldcards sdcard never touches a computer on the internet. I still check my satellite node against a conventional internet connected node (hey, you never know), but I feel more secure with my sats never coming near the internet.  Make sure you get the bitcoins sent to your keys and that you have a very good system for maintaining your seed phrase secure. Send me a message if you want any advice 50% salary is a very big investment and you should match it with appropriate diligence in security.  Cereal? Serial. Youre website is a sham. There is no article. Assange did a fair amount of posting after being arrested. #lame If Assange is SN, he sure posted a lot after turning himself in 07 Dec 2010 (and being held for 9 days) I've put up a rough draft of my initial setup at an old disused website that apparently I've been paying to keep the domain name for...for about a decade...I made about every mistake you can make...so I have some embarrassing but helpful tips on what to do (and not to do): https://www.drgoss.org The real fake bitcoin best quote ever. I suppose the real fake bitcoin would be what miners say it is, even if the chain dies because nobody will buy its token. But yeah, I really dont care about conmenalthough I admit concern over bc.i & stellar announcementseems so much out of right field.  Is there a way to search for hero or higher members with at least 10 merit and make that a list to follow? So many threads and so many posts arent worth the timebut a more twitter like view of bitcointalk would be cool. Might bring us old timers back.   Yes. Anyhow, I defunded these for multi-key multi-state cold storage. Im not a believer in holding lots of quickly transferable assets.  I did the same with my full set.  These are rare and reliable. I just defunded an entire set (36 bitcoins). Each had the funds on them.  Yup. That is me. I had to break a casascius bearer bar to get back inhence my long absence. At any rate, I wouldn't do business with someone I couldn't verify out of band. Not with this sum.  Thanks guys. I also see we are still using SMF version 1 from 2009. Ghetto. Oh well, if anyone serious wants images, I can email them. I've been off the forum for a few years, I guess I was kinda hoping things would be different. I do all my forum stuff from an iPhone. Many people live in the post computer world.  Scratching my head on how to attach images. I'm not uploading these to another server and linkingthat's so 1998. Any hints how to attach? The announcement thread, back before it was bitcoin_talk_.org (via wayback): http://web.archive.org/web/20110515100056/http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7724.0;all I gotta  swing by the bank to get pics.  I am the only owner.  Once I find a potential buyer we can discuss price.  They are in good shape.  I'm hoping to do it as a set. It would be nice to keep the history together.   I ordered two full sets in May 2011. BitBills was gone by September.  I don't know how many they ever sent off, but demand was huge and it took forever for some people to get theirs.  I  x-rayed a one bitcoin bill just to see if any metal pigment from the private key could be discovered. I posted on it here at the time.  I believe I sent that bill to Luke Dashjr (he was new to mining back then and was one of the few, if not the only,  mining pool operator being verifiably honest about  appropriately sharing block rewards with miners). BitBills were the idea of a couple guys at MIT. One guy's name was Doug Feigelson.  They must've gotten good legal advice early on because they were not around long.  I believe they tried to patent this general idea of using a sticker to hide something, but I'm not certain how such an obvious idea could've been patented in the first place. Anyhow, I defunded the incomplete set in 2012 or 2013. I still have a cut open 5, 10, and 20.  I have no idea when the last full set was sold.  A full set entails 1, 5, 10, and 20 bitcoin bills. All funded, of course.  I have one of these too that I'd be willing to sell. But it's in much worse shape than this one. I tried selling it on OB, but no takers. The one in this thread looks like a gem. Anyhow, people with more than 25 bitcoins are hard to come by. I may end up defunding mine.  There were cards before coins. BitBills were the first I had. I also had a 10 bitcoin card I bought early on via bitpayI forget what it was called. But I'm sure there were more cards than those two examples early on. http://web.archive.org/web/20110712131117/http://bitbills.com/
Anybody remember BitBills? They predate casascius coins. More here, from Wayback: http://web.archive.org/web/20120518080136/http://bitbills.com/Anyhow, I have a set to sell to sell if anyone is interested.  Congrats on your third post!I'm worse off than you! I stopped mining cause it was gonna take a roughly a week to mine the next block of 50 bitcoinsand I never even tried GPU mining. I had decent hardware for early GPU mining too. Dumb.  That many transactions will cost a small fortune to consolidate. Like about 1 bitcoin in fees. You could save money on that step in a post-segwit world, but tx fees may be higher by then. With fees getting higher and higher, your use of the bitcoin blockchain for small payments is being pushed out. There's no telling if bitcoin will be useful as a money for stuff like this or not in the future. Maybe we all should consolidate before our outputs are not worth spending (beware the privacy issues here!).  Slashdot. July 2010. http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/07/11/1747245/bitcoin-releases-version-03Back then, you could CPU mine effectively with a laptop: http://uofr.net/~bcg/a.jpg Soft fork=more restrictions. Hard fork = fewer restrictions.  Very cool. I just moved to Arizona, so this may be in my future! Money is what money does. I want a SEPA account! Why bother with bitcoin just to get fast and cheap transactions? There's a better alternative for that. Artificially capping size of blocks limits the usefulness of the network. Bitcoin is not worth $100 in its current implementation, imho.  Block size limit is one of many limits in the consensus rules. There are limits to the number of signature / hash operations as well as input and outputs. I'm not sure you could make a >1MB transaction that conformed to these ancillary rules, but if you did no one would add it to a block. It might make for a decent attack vector thoughto clog up the relay function of the network.  Thx. I learned I was one of the first 500 or so accounts on the forum. Pretty neat! It's a bit busier than when I lost access in 2015! And I'm back. Glad to see the forum still running. Now I've got my password in two password managers so it won't get overwritten by mistake (iOS safari doesn't keep priors). Thanks again everyone! Why? Not even close to satoshi's style.  It is clearly in miners best interest to increase maximum block sizebut it is not in their best interest to produce larger blocks with the slow block propagation speed on the Bitcoin network as it stands today. I don't know who the idiot was that suggested as max block size --> infinity, tx fees --> 0. That simplistic view is complicated enough to make people think they are understanding some deep truth and react religiously as opposed to thoughtfully. Peter Todd had a great and very simple write up on the calculus of tx inclusion On the dev list about 1.5 years ago or so. Max block size is not the problem at the momentthe very high BTC25 block reward is the reason miners won't make large blocks. Block size will grow as block reward goes down and/or block propagation speed goes up.

Not particularly professional how things have been handled, imho, but the fact is that things are being discussed openly, and that's a good thing. The foundation is what the members make of it. I think lack of funds will make it easier to set priorities...I like the idea of having core mission expenses being paid for by lighthouse style fundraising. If people don't like an idea, it won't get funded. If they do, the support base could be much broader.  The remaining bitcoins to be released are 50% of the current supply. I like having well defined bounds on inflation. 
For a fair number of people, the answer is "break even." Howdy all...I want to make sure this message reaches everybody (not just those who are awesome at email).  We're restarting the Bitcoin Foundation Elections and redeploying on Helios.  Elections will be extended by 1 day.  Expect new ballots by email shortly.More details here:https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/runoff-election-reboot/Cheers,BrianElection Fingerprint: hj4sXtCY/u/4qaM4nY3v+YQXJOciYtY8BIFuxJ7Vc3Y Goat is still around and is as awesome as ever. You're just not hanging round the right parts... Are you with a university? What is your name?  Thank you OP. This perspective is sorely needed. Those wishing to keep a small block size are in favor of a useless Bitcoin network. Some may be simply being manipulated by some half baked economic theory that says miners will go broke if they process lots of transactions and the protocol gives them the ability to process many more per block...but I suspect there are people who truly wish to try and make raising the limit a real problem for the dev community. People advocating for a tiny max block size are no friends of Bitcoin.  Uhh...no. Raising the limit doesn't force the blocks to be filled. It just gives miners the option to make bigger blocks should market conditions make it to their advantage to do so.  The fact that he wasn't comfortable (initially) with Linux and standard things like LaTeX hints at his non programmer/mathematician/physicist background.  The images on the second link seem to match bio on cointelegraph site. I had just gotten an email from him on the 17th. He mentioned traveling on business.  It's not. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83794.0 I don't think it will happen. Just like he'll never be elected president...there are some things that won't happen to people who choose to remain anonymousand I think he will remain so.  The Bitcoin software, network, and concept is called "Bitcoin" with a capitalized "B". Bitcoin currency units are called "bitcoins" with a lowercase "b" -- this is often abbreviated BTC.Quoted from: https://bitcointalk.org/adrotate.php?adinfo Market manipulation may be a problem for a long time. There are laws and regulations about the topic, but enforcing them may be quite the tricky issue.  All transactions are positive. Difference between inputs and outputs is the miners fee (ie, any unused portion of an input by default belongs to the miners; this keeps tx data size smaller). Now with the price back down to earth (roughly the same as when this thread started) perhaps our community will bond a bit better.  It's fun to look back at this and think "I was a small part in making it happen..."All the best to our daring explorer. Hopefully a safe return with no ligament injuries! No worries. It's been dead before and it'll die again.  At a Minneapolis bitcoin meet up, the organizers did a manual implementation of a ledger where people were given a few dollar bills (everyone's balance known by all), called out their transactions (Bob gives Sally $2), exchanged dollar bills, and everyone recorded the transaction. The organizers then took the dollar bills away and the exercise continued. This doesn't address the proof of work concept very well, but it shows the value of the ledger.  If you give someone your money and they promise to take care of it for you, then the probability of loss is very high...this is true with conventional currency too though (though the loss is born by other people, not the depositor, in most cases). Lesson 1: trust no one with your money. Lesson 2: if you must break lesson 1, make sure you only bear a tiny fraction of the burden of loss (ie, be a citizen in a country where the people insure deposits via government program or otherwise). Lesson 3: If you truly want to protect your bitcoins, it can be done but it requires work, knowledge, and skill...although less now than in years past. If you are throwing non-trivial sums into bitcoin, buy a Trezor and learn how to use it and how to back up a wallet seed securely.  This isn't worth talking much about.  It's a foregone conclusion that the anti-spam measure called Max_block_size that was quickly added to the code without much though in the first place (other than: "yup, that'll be plenty big for a while") was destined to increase.The newbies that disagree just don't know the history of that kludge. We have the same troll problem on another popular forum that I have the burden of running a small part of. Trolls are not to be taken too seriously. Just ignore and move on. 
Great election turn out! Love the lotto tie breaker (presumably works better in person!) I used to think no one was getting paid to troll, but while I still think it's unlikely, I'm not so sure  Satoshi knew pool mining was coming just like he knew gpu mining was coming. Back when I was mining with my laptop, the tiny bitcoin mining world was about to shrink to include only those willing to buy gpu's. Satoshi saw that as bad because it would mean that it would take longer for a large number of people to obtain bitcoin. There was a gentlemen's agreement to delay gpu mining. I think coming up with a way to break blocks up so that 250 computers could mine 1/250th of a block while maintaining hash power in the network would help solve the pooling/central hashing issues.  My employer let's us split up our paychecks by fixed amount,  percentage, &  remainder. I'm definitely gonna use this service soon. Most of my income has a corresponding expense, but that will change soon once I finish training (radiology) this summer.  The incentives of those who perform work to improve the system...the system for a long while incentivized status quo.  There's a ton of work to be done before Bitcoin can justifiably be highly valuable. When the network can service a significant fraction of the world's transaction volume, then we can talk in such lofty terms. But sitting on our hands will guarantee Bitcoin goes no where....or goes to the rubbish bin. Incentives need to stay aligned throughout the growth of the network.  Go to armory and create a new wallet (on offline computer). Then you make a watch only copy for your armory installation running on an online computer. Then send funds from old  (non-armory)wallet to armory wallet.  Ahh. Phew! RC1 uses BerkeleyDB?  I find it incredible too. Tony is a smart guy. They're doing this not just for BitPay, but for all of the Bitcoin world.  Very clever. It'll take some practice but in my (relatively worthless)opinion, your idea seems pretty sound and practical.  You can put BTC in here by typing "[" btc "]" (no quotes or spaces).As far as using a font to do so, you're out of luck. There are no bitcoin symbols in Unicode; any font anyone makes that support such symbols will need to be on the viewer's computer for it to render as intended. The tricks I pull on my site above are done by having the webpage download the font and render it in the browser. That said, there are so many things in the font to massively improve upon. It's a lot of work...but it's open source and anyone is free to give it a go.  Here's a screen shot of my font above...it's trickier than I thought to move an image from my phone to a web server using ftp, ssh, etc from just my phone...grrr!Here's the pic: Easiest to copy and paste from web site (use the bottom section of the site, or copying this *Might* work: Bitcoin ଜ, mBTC ଝ, bits ଞ, Satoshis ଟ). To type directly, on a Mac, enable Unicode hex input and then hold option, type 0 b 1 c, and let go of option and the character at that position in the font you have selected will print. The character that really lives at U+0B1C is this one: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0b1c/index.htmThe font program I used doesn't allow private use area usage...Anyhow, no one will see it the way you do unless they install the same font. And when they copy and paste, it won't render right in another font. As far as keyboards and Unicode are concerned, there are no bitcoin symbols.   I modified a font to put in symbols for 4 bitcoin denominations...the rationale behind the symbols is here: http://.co/bitcoin.htmlThe font itself is here: http://.co/Coelacanth_btc_at_0b1c.ttfThe original font is here: http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/coelacanth By the same rationale, there are many former currencies that were used for a time after they ceased to meet that criteria.  Thx for the tip! Strong work!Hopefully others will chime in with better suggestions than mine! Nah, he's in the midwest.
Not exactly. Fake votes can be prevented by _trusting_ the voter list authenticator and token distributor to each perform their duties correctly/honestly, however, this violates ballot secrecy and does not eliminate trust.Now, you can minimize the trust required by making it easier for voters to check the vote and # of voters and verify all voters got a token; the block chain and a good block explorer makes part of this easy (presumably someone would notice a dishonest/incorrect distribution). If any voter failed to get a token, then having a well connected set of voters will facilitate discovery of the number of disenfranchised voters. The big problem is ballot secrecy.  If I distribute the tokens to authorized voters, I know who everyone voted for.  That's not a problem in some elections, but, it's a non-starter for many elections.You can separate the authorization of voters from the distribution of tokens to voters, thus forcing the authorizer to collude with the issuer to break ballot secrecy.  That's good enough for many elections, but still not perfect.I think we need to wait for the fancy zero knowledge computation stuff to come to fruition before we have secret ballots and transparent elections...but real-time voting is a new idea in election science and a very interesting concept to me...especially if voters can recall and recast their vote (securely) at will. Cool preview.  Is that John Barrett (https://twitter.com/btcandg) narrating? Hourly data would have to be calculated...but afaik, no one provides hourly data.  Yes and yes. And a tree structure showing where coins came from and went to. Oh, and something showing the fee and an estimate of how long it took to get into a block...and the calculated transaction priority...often people put on a fee when one isn't necessary. And some summary statistics would be cool...like # of transactions per hour/day (averaged over last hour/day, etc).  I'm of the camp that feels engaging Washington and regulators is an important thing to do. I also feel that Jim Harper is brilliant and highly effective...and he knows how the game is played. He is a huge asset to the Bitcoin community. That said, just like Gavin used to keep backups of the bitcointalk forum on his pc, he's shed some hats as things progressed. A year ago, we didn't have Coin Center or the digital chamber of commerce. The foundation tried to do it all...and it was critical at that time to do so...But now things have grown and it's not possible to (affordably) do all things well. If the foundation had to pick one thing to work on, I agree it's the core. Could the foundation someday grow into a huge organization with every possible type of specialist (programmers, lawyers, policy wonks, marketers, educators, etc)...maybe, but I don't know that that's really wise...having separate organizations for separate tasks makes for a more resilient system.  I agree OP...and it's not just here. I don't know if it's that the subject is money and that's what brings out the strangest inappropriate behavior from people who would never act that way in real life (sober) or the cognitive dissonance arising from the deeply held belief that money must be issued by governments, but what ever it is, it is really weird. Is someone bankrolling theses weirdos? I doubt it. That said, a good lesson to learn (one that I'm still learning) is to not feed the trolls. It's more than a cute saying. Not responding is by far the best thing to do...although i must admit, I love your self moderated topic...moderating and locking are the best weapons against the trolls. I've put up with a ton of trolling elsewhere, so I did some digging to try to understand the mindset that drives people to act so rudely...I found this really insightful: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1028-article-i-found-insightful-on-trolling/ To my knowledge, no. That said, the bc.i web page very recently was terrible for iPhone. The incessant stream of transactions made it nearly impossible to paste in to the search field. I was about 50-50 for successfully pasting...it looks like they fixed that though. I'd like to see a block explorer that made it easier to see which addresses coins came from. Blockexplorer.com did a better job of that than bc.i I sent 50,000 bits to Medvedev (MedvedevRussiaE). He hasn't collected yet. https://twitter.com/doctorgoss/status/542868594124529665 Well done. I enjoyed the read.  Should be in meta. OP, remember, keeping things organized is how most of us like it.  Future price predictions threads, up or down, always require at least a little hubris. This speculation thread is a bit above average though...If the market knew what would happen, the price would be stable... This is the kind of post that would get tips in the old days. Got @ChangeTip Danny? Continue converting a small amount of dollars every 2 weeks...the only thing that'll be different is that I'll get more BTC No. It's a satire site.  The stuff that they are asking you to sign off as true should be reviewed by a lawyer before you sign it. It's not really part of the request....it's like a subpoena plus your testimony...be careful, they are asking more of you than just to produce info.  Charles texted me a link to his Tedx talk this morning: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=97ufCT6lQcYHis points about documentation, identity, ownership, insurance are very insightful. He'd be my go to guy for thoughts on your post.  Bruce Fenton is organizing a Dubai conference in December...he's been talking about it for about a year. He's legit... I'm very interested in this idea. I have run precisely 1 election and have another to run in a little bit. My feeling is that ballots should be secret but that voters should be able to oversee the process themselves and prove that their vote was counted correctly and that the entire count is correct. Are you aware of a block chain based system that would prevent me, the election administrator, from knowing who voted for which candidate? I am no fan of trust and don't want any voter to be forced to trust me. What I like about block chain methods of voting is that you don't need a PhD to prove the vote was counted correctly...but if ease of verification requires trust that the admin didn't create 100 extra addresses to use himself, it's not worth it to me.  I think the ability to screw up multiplication by powers of ten is a uniquely American one. Too bad we stopped here...we should have converted back in the 80's. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metric_Marvelstl;dr: CRS multiplied by 100 instead of 10. 
You quoted the wrong part.  The quote is in past tense and is describing his previous behavior.  My condemnation of his accusations are in present tense in my post.   He is trolling in a very bad way, to be sure. Might be illegal (IANAL). That said, Bruno has done a lot of good and had a good reputation and we all knew he was a little quirky. But he was accepted...but it's gone too far now. It is sad. If you need help Bruno, ask.  Just ignore trollingit's not worth getting worked up over. Trolls are irrelevant.  The foundation has two main classes of memberships: industry and individual. The individual member dues are roughly $30/yr. That said, if you want to join an organization with the intent to destroy it, you might find you are not allowed to join. Duh. Such a childish, immature stunt. He has proven he is capable of doing useful work; I hope he continues to focus his energies on something useful, not total BS like this.  You could drive to Illinois and say hi. IIRC, he posted an image of his driver license. At any rate, he's just gone a little bonkers...my guess is that he will be back to normal in a year or so.  Bread wallet uses a symbol for bits; many wallets can show milibits, we had such a need for a 1 bitcoin symbol here we had code to create a BTC written and put on the tools bar. I think multiple units will be used for quite some time. I think recognizing the diverse needs of diverse groups if wiser than only giving one option for everyone.  Lol...I think having a significant value behind the international definition is wise and therefore I support making 1 bitcoin the official unit associated with an ISO 4217 standard and Unicode currency symbol.That said, I think we need at least two symbols to describe bitcoin subunits.  My wife had a good idea for symbols and I turned it into a web font...http://www.uofr.net/~bcg/bitcoin.htmlI did this on my iPad in a hurry.  I over wrote %, ^, &, and * symbols instead of using unassigned or private use Unicode code points...The m-like symbol for mBTC is just the BTC symbol turned on it's side to look like an m.The satoshi symbol is the greek letter sigma with an extra line...it's also basically the same as the bits symbol turned on it's side. Uhhh....yikes. That sounds like collapse...the exact opposite of what's happened the last 5 years.  I gave a copy to my father in law last night. He started reading the book and the bought the kindle version and finished it the same day. It's very fast paced, well written and interesting.  I like the m-mill / μ-micro idea. Very clever.  Thx for the input. Is the two decimal bits a better choice than the 8 decimal bitcoin? The advantages of two decimal places is obvious...the advantage to using bitcoins is you could prepend a micro symbol that doesn't case fold to a letter that could be interpreted as M for mega...Unicode has a separate SI prefix micro.  I'm on the working group. There are lots of options for units to go with an ISO 4217 currency code. Would XBT = 100M satoshis (1 bitcoin) be better than XBI = 100 satoshis (1 bit)?If XBT = 1 bitcoin, I don't foresee people writing 0.00098 XBT to describe the cost of bubblegum. People _might_ write 980 XBI though. I think we need more community input on this choice. Can we get two currency codes? Doubtful, but is worth discussing. Another related idea that I think needs community input is getting a Unicode currency symbol(s). We are all used to using BTC for bitcoin and some are starting to use ƀ for bits...unfortunately, a capital ƀ is Ƀ, which is also used for 1 bitcoin. Nothing like a capitalization error to cost you 1 million times more than you wanted to spend! Should we try to get Unicode characters for 1 bitcoin and 1 bit? Just bits? Just bitcoin? A benefit of using 1 bitcoin as a standard is that the symbol µ is separately encoded in Unicode from the Greek letter μ (which case folds to the Greek letter Μ). Therefore, 1 µXBT and 1 µBTC shouldn't accidentally change value at the whim of a shift key. I think a wide discussion is needed. Bitcoin is different. It's global. Different cultures would likely have different opinions and we should push for standards that meet all those needs.  You bet.  I need to make a list of book recommendations for bitcoiners.  This one is on the top of my future list! Exactly. Phin's point was don't believe a claim without proof. AFAIK, no one has been able to prove anyone has paid a membership fee...the foundation doesn't publish a privacy violating list of payers / identities & addresses...duh. The expectation that large membership fees would be paid in a single tx is a bit misguided, imho.  lol...do you think it's one tx? Just think about how stupid it would be if you could pick two parties and know the amount exchanged between them without their assistance. If a member wants to point to their payments, that's up to them...it would be a breach of imho for the foundation to publish tx of all their members.  I'll let you know my exit strategy in 10 years This is not an issue that needs addressing, imho. And bitcoiners of all people should understand that. Disclosing the address(es) used for payment could lead to significant breaches of privacy. Anyone care to post their largest transaction for hordes of people to scrutinize and track? http://bitgivefoundation.orghttp://bitcoin100.org/ We had a similar thread some time ago. I had pledged 10 of the 44 bitcoins for the bounty...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91068.0 Out with it man. If you're not disclosing a specific security flaw that others could use to steal funds, there's no reason to not tip your hand. Most are too busy to reply to "specific content" free posts
At $0, if we get there, I'm still gonna be running a full node...I might start mining again too.  Here's the archive of satoshi's post in that thread: http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/287/Link on bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306 Any one listen to episode 34 of Bitcoins and Gravy? The episode features the author of Thieves Emporium, a book that presents a very plausible near-future America where privacy is violated by powerful governmental regulatory agencies, personal liberty sharply debulked in the hunt for "terrorists," and the exercise of constitutional freedoms, while still legal, face harsh extra-judicial penalties imposed by those that control government handouts and those that control the payment networks.How could such abuse happen in the US? The author uses the Federal Reserve's power of inflation, or hyperinflation, to show how populations can be controlled by controlling the value of their money. Those that profit from regulation and restriction, for example, sellers of items with marginal production costs, seek to maintain their profits by using government to stamp out those that offer arbitrage services (example, books and pharmaceuticals are sold at vastly different prices in different geographic regions). In a troubled economy, more and more people find themselves in the position of being poor but compliant with regulations or being able to earn a living by facilitating victim-less crimes (assuming decreasing the profits of big companies via arbitrage is "victim-less"). How do ordinary folks in this future America earn a living without being imprisoned? Community. A community connected via encrypted internet communication, TOR, and anonymous internet access. Oh, and money. But not just any money. Money that flows freely between individuals, unfettered by regulations that ease its confiscation or theft. Digital money.  In function, if not form, the money used in the online community is very similar to Bitcoin.  In the book, the author shows how  populations can be controlled using paper money and how that can be resisted by using free money (free as in speech, not beer).I'm not one for political conspiracies, but, I do think the issues raised by the book warrant thought.  The book is a fun and fast paced exploration of this world, in large part as seen through eyes of a struggling widow with young twin girls. The heroine is a survivalist. Not a computer geek, but a mother. A mother that will do anything to provide for and protect her girls. Her entry into the online community, called the Badlands, and ultimate uncovering of a government conspiracy and escape from the country is a harrowing tale...and all too real feeling.  I recommend reading this book! I recall that thread. It's archived on http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org.  Got my preorder in! Can't wait to see it again! Well, the Foundation doesn't issue bitcoins nor control how they are issued, transacted, or destroyed.  It's the SPV implementation that is being referred to as decentralized.  A proper "I told ya so" post deserves a link to the original...it'll make you look much cooler when others stumble upon this thread! Exactly. Address reuse = privacy leak! You need a license for most states to run a business where you transfer money from person to person or place to place. And you must register with the federal government.  Oh, and the state licenses cost money. Lots of money in some cases...one needs >$1M to get started.  I believe this was discussed elsewhere...if I recall correctly, it was a db insertion hack and a fairly well known exploit. I think the user login stats on Satoshi on that forum did not update.  This is probably the best advice you can get. I encourage you to read it over carefully.  How about in each other we trust(Albeit to a limited degree and we use cryptography to essentially remove the need to trust eac other in the first place)  I'd say it depends on how it is used.  Trust? Why? You have nothing to gain and only stand to lose. Coinbase has nothing to gain by holding your coins either...except people might not buy through them if they can't get free bitcoin storage... It was fairly novel back in the day to be able to tip people who posted stuff that was helpful. There hadn't been a way to do that before. We take it for granted now, but, being set up to receive tips was kind of a way of identifying ones self as someone who was trying to be helpful... I can vouch that this is a legit research project. I participated as a research subject in their IRB approved research survey/interview this afternoon.  Lol. Did you realize every industry member pays ฿ and none of those private transactions are publicy tagged on the block chain? If I were a merchant and you bought something from me, and I told the world "cryptopaths paid me x bitcoins from a combination of these addresses: {y}," would you be agreeable to that? Would every customer past, present & future?If you think about it for a nanosecond, you'll realize the stupidity. But, if you don't, feel free to reuse the argument on a host of other similar situations...it will trick a few folks for some time I should think.  I'm calling you again on FUD. The bylaws require a director to be elected by a majority of quorum. That wasn't met and hence a second round of voting occurred. It's pretty simple. If you want to discuss further in a more appropriate context, feel free to email me (let's not hijack a crazy thread).  Cryptocrypt.org, but you need an invite.It's stacked with some influential people. 
Rigging votes? Simply not true. I ran the election...I am the primary source to refute this. It's FUD.  Are you insane? The Bitcoin Foundation is tiny...and has like $5M max in assets.  Exactly. It will help everyone know who has been here for a while. It will not help anyone know everyone who has been here for a while. Lol...I did it on call in the hospital, apparently. Cool idea...it'll help know everyone know who has been around for a while. Too bad I don't get a half green and half yellow final coin :-) Basically same story here. I'm cautious by nature but she ended up with $20k and ฿20 after a series of bitcoin purchases totaling about $4000.  Three good options, all reasonably secure...1) if you've got $120, get http://www.bitcointrezor.com2) if you've got $40, get https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mycelium-entropy3) if you've got skill and time or need true institutional level security, get https://bitcoinarmory.comIf you have $0 and no free time/skills:4) print off a few private keys: https://www.bitaddress.org/bitaddress.org-v2.9.3-SHA1-7d47ab312789b7b3c1792e4abdb8f2d95b726d64.html5) Make an encrypted disk image to hold a newly created wallet using an offline computer...write down some addresses in the wallet, send funds to addresses once you've stored a copy of the encrypted disk image in many places. I am really amazed at how many options there are these days. 5) used to be the only way...and that actually does take a fair amount of time of you don't have a computer that won't wver touch a network again.  Micropayment has been a holy grail of transaction research for over 30 years. The DoD funded important research on the 90's to go with this internet thing they made. Bitcoin wallets aren't made for micropayments and the network is only really set up for sequential micropayments between two parties...If you are really interested in the micropayment topic, see mike hearn et al's work: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=244656.0 I'm no expert coder, but I hear the early versions were quite a tangled mess... This. We need to decide if we want to actually obtain Unicode code points for bitcoins and subunits.  Exactly.  Hence the ratings.  I'm not sure about the numbers, but the concept is valid. I never intended to end up with basically everything in Bitcoin.  I can afford to lose it all though. I'm young enough and have a stable, reasonably well paying career to look forward to.  If young and employed and little life savings, I guess it makes sense. If any of those cinditions is untrue, I'd call it unwise to foolish.  Warning: necroRemember when it was as easy as "click generate?" Even then, very few people did, and often those that did, like myself, didn't do it for very long. It has taken enormous amounts of work to make Bitcoin into something worth the serious effort of miners. Bitcoin still has a long way to go to grow into a robust high volume transaction network affordable by all. I hope we get there. I think we will.  You do realize we didn't always have exchanges or local bitcoins.com, right? And if you want to buy or sell ฿500, there aren't many places to do that easily... Colloquial terms will vary by culture. The question of what unit to use and what name to give it will depend on the economic context and local culture. As far as what I want my Bitpay invoices and coinbase balance to show me, it's microbitcoins...which I call bits...but if I were buying a car or house, I'd use the unit and name bitcoins.  I like it when they get it. I help when they don't. I dislike it when they think Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme. I can't stand it when they are rude, demanding, or entitled. I hate it when they think Bitcoin requires no work.   No....that's beyond dumb. That's like me asking you to go to work for 6 months for free. That's like saying all food wants to be eaten, so let's rob the grocery store. I'll play no part in theft.  I think some  cultures will chose to use milliBits and other bits. With a bit having essentially zero value now, it will be a while before they are likely to be used (in single units) economically. But, it doesn't hurt to prepare. I don't think a Satoshi will be an economically useful unit in my lifetime (ie, >1¢). Satoshi's will be useful for non-economic tasks (like trading large volumes of altcoins values in pennies), but even the poorest of the poor wouldn't use any currency unit of so little value. The advantage to bits is that the two decimal places following  a bit gives precision down to the Satoshi. Lots of cultures use 2 or 3 decimal places after their major currency unit. Not culture uses 5 or more (some international banking currency units use 4 decimal places). At any rate, I think we should have unique unicode symbols for 4 denominations such that they don't casefold (eg, a lowercase Ƀ is ƀ...they both can't be used as symbols like $ and ¢...otherwise a sticky caps lock key could cost a fortune!) How about 4 denominations, each with its own Unicode character? Formal names vs colloquial names need some work...here's a vague scheme (with approximated glyphs)B⃦*,BITCOIN SIGN, value: 1 bitcoin₥ BITCOIN MILLIBITCOIN SIGN, value: 0.001 bitcoinsƀ BITCOIN BIT SIGN, value 0.001 millibitcoinss̸ or s⃫, BITCOIN BITCENT SIGN, value 0.01 bitsB⃦*(similar to ฿ with two vertical bars for those with old browsers) I have a full set of BitBills if anyone's interested. I also can reasonably assume I'm the first and possibly the only one to have attempted to use X-rays to read the qr code without disrupting the seal...non-metallic ink it appearsmy test failed. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=103464.msg1145251#msg1145251
You can watch it with me in Chicago on Friday https://twitter.com/BitcoinDoc/status/487718178605113344 Well...the next version will be 0.10, not 1.0...https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/07/07/floating-fees/ My wife will be there for the race weekend...hmmm... No. He's probably on vacation. He's well respected.  Last I heard (6 months...maybe a year ago?), Doug was working on patent / IP issues.  This is getting a bit outdated but...I posted this a while ago and David reposted it here: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/752-the-good-and-useful-things-the-foundation-has-done-for-us-members-compiled-by-dr-brian-goss/ Wow. Do you even know who Dmitry is?  Don't forget, we are all real people here.  Before you go about being much ruder to someone online than you would be in real life, think about who you're talking to.  Otherwise, you are just going to end up looking uninformed...as in this thread.  Anyhow, Rassah -- I didn't connect the dots between decentralized exchange and this Brock backed venture. You make a great observation.  Very good news for Bitcoin indeed. I'm curious why people think centralized efforts and pooling of resources somehow "violates" some fundamental principle of Bitcoin.  The foundation can not hurt Bitcoin. The foundation can not "run" Bitcoin. Centralized efforts and decentralized efforts are orthogonal to each other -- both can exist without affecting the other.The foundation is, at worst, a paper tiger. Having the foundation as "a central target" would amount to nothing but a decoy -- the foundation is not Bitcoin.  If I pay a developer's salary, or 5 developers salaries, does that make me a centralized entity?  What if theymos used donated funds to pay Bitcoin core devs? Would he be a centralized entity? Of course not. Good read: http://www.amazon.com/Currency-Wars-Making-Global-Crises/dp/B006JAM3UU/ref=tmm_aud_title_0Author served on a DoD war game where the USD was attacked by Russia... http://blog.coinbase.com/post/89405189782/its-bits As a regulatory specific term, it looks like FinCEN has already defined it. As a general term, I don't use it. I use digital or crypto currency.  I can only take credit for a few of the lectures. The lion's share of the work belongs to Charles Hoskinson.  I agree and use the terms crypto and digital similarly. There are dozens of turn of the century crypto / non-crypto digital currencies. (If you want to learn a bitbabout the history, check out my history lectures here: https://www.udemy.com/bitcoin-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-crypto/ ) September, 2013, Bitcoin Foundation to Federal Election Commission: "Bitcoins are often referred to as 'virtual currency.' The Bitcoin Foundation prefers the term 'digital currency.' "https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bitcoin-Foundation-FEC-filing-CAF-Advisory-Opinion.pdfVirtual currency is a term defined by FinCEN; it encompasses digital currencies, tokens, pre-paid gift cards, etc I suppose...      "virtual" currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. This guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currencyhttp://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html I think there's a solid and useful idea here...I'm uncertain on the details, but some way of making a ledger of "authentic" copies of digital objects that can be transferred. Right now, Bitcoin does exactly this for a specific fungible divisible digital object (basically an integer, # of Satoshi's). Your idea generalizes the concept to non-fungible or non-divisible (or both) digital objects that can be more than just integers. My gut tells me there is something brilliant in your idea...I just don't see it all clearly.  Yes. Exactly. The colored coin protection of access to a digital object discourages (but does not preclude) sharing as anyone sharing the object could transfer ownership exclusively to themselves or just take the corresponding funds. The software allowing access to the digital object needs to be trusted to only allow access when the user has the colored coin private key _and_ the colored coin is funded with the desired amount (do I have that detail right?)...I'm uncertain how that trust model would work.  An infinite # of users could have the same color coin...only one could spend it  So if I buy a digital print and get the corresponding color coin, why can't I make 10 copies of the digital print and give away 10 copies of the corresponding colored coin private key? As long as all holders of the private key don't remove the funds, all 10 people can use the digital print. Right? Apple can't push code to your phone unless you turn on (or fail to turn off? Not sure what default is) auto update. They can delete App Store apps from your phone...it's a power they have never used.  No multisig? They really need to use armory wallet!
Weight of gold is a continuous variable. Marks on a stick are quantized.  There's this in the cities: http://www.meetup.com/Everything-Bitcoin/and we have a small occasional gathering in Rochester: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1435672883312478/ Good to know. I think you guys and this forum provide a very valuable service to the community. I think y'all are worth paying.  Perhaps it was my fault. I thought the OP genuinely confused. I guess I'm too naive That said, we do need to try to keep things friendly for the genuinely confused.  The strong evidence comes from the predictable pattern of "nonces" that solved the earliest of blocks. The pattern suggests the person who mined the first coins mined about a million in total.  The tally stick's tally is indeed digital. It was a currency. It wasn't electronic or transmitted digitally.  False. Newly generated coins need to mature. Read above.  Are mods compensated? It would be awkward to put them in the position of having valuable accounts by virtue of providing a valuable service but not to pay them.   I think he would be surprised how quickly it's all happening. I think he thought Bitcoin had this sort of potential though.  Exactly. Now people giving their friends bitcoins have essentially replace the Andresen style faucets. It's not about the amount of money...it's about giving people a reason to care and to go through the process of learning about Bitcoin, establishing a wallet, getting a means of purchasing & selling ฿, etc. That said, what motivated me to do all that was far less than what I have to give away to get friends interested.  Bitcoin spurs growth on many levels! I'm no exception to the rule that we are all a work in progress! The thought had never occurred to me. But it's a good one! I'm all for freedom of expression, but I'm comfortable denying others the ability to express themselves further on this thread. I may PM you if I can't figure out how to lock the thread (I'm not on a computer...). Addendum: check out the lower left corner for lock option!Thx for making me a better forum citizen tspacepilot! Glad there's a disincentive there...What are the incentives for our mods not to sell? Gavin's faucet gave ฿5 away at a time. If was for educational purposes and you could put them back when you were done.  Remember the good old days when no one expected/demanded Bitcoin to make them rich, folks were willing to do work to make things easier on the next guy, and people didn't whine that others aren't doing more free work for them? The culture sure has changed. We were all newbies once. Compare my newbie post and response to what our OP has experienced: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=335.0Tipping felt more common back then...and I know why! While technically true, I'm sure his experience would be helpful, the wounds are so sore right now that there is no way this statement can go over well.  Defecation and language/expression issues aside, he's just confused. Coin maturation a subtle topic that few ever encounter...most miners have a level of insulation from what is actually going on provided by the pool. I wouldn't blame anyone for not knowing what he is complaining about. But don't be fooled into thinking that doggie coin doesn't have a maturation process. It's another easily adjusted variable just like all the variables that define the altcoins (derived from Bitcoin that is...). Sounds like OP is experiencing something most people except real old timers and those really in to mining know about: coin maturation. Newly minted bitcoins aren't instantly usable. You gotta wait 100 blocks after you generate (now called mine) bitcoins before you can spend them. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain"Blocks in shorter chains (or invalid chains) are not used for anything. When the bitcoin client switches to another, longer chain, all valid transactions of the blocks inside the shorter chain are re-added to the pool of queued transactions and will be included in another block. The reward for the blocks on the shorter chain will not be present in the longest chain, so they will be practically lost, which is why a network-enforced 100-block maturation time for generations exists." The general good citizen rules are hard to enforce...hacked or sold, I see too many newbie questions from hero accounts. Theymos does do a good job reminding people to change passwords with each potential security breach, but nothing will make accounts unstealable.  I'm confused again. Im not asking 1 party or pool to come up with 25 solutions meeting condition Y...the idea is that those that do find 1 of the 25 solutions to broadcast them to the network...mining pool operators can incorporate those solutions on their quest for 25 or forgo them in hopes of finding their own. The probability that any one pool gets all 25 I would think would be very low...it would also make it easy for pools to join forces against a dominant pool. Since the tx inclusion policy per block is now variable (there may be 25 separate policies per block), wouldn't that be better? We want to avoid 51% of hashing power being used in support of one transaction inclusion policy; 75% hashing power supporting 25 policies would be a good thing, right?I see one 40% mining pool having a huge advantage over another single 10% pool (as a sum on a binomial probability distribution), but that's a slightly different scenario where work isn't shared. 
Now I understand. It's easier to see in the extreme case. Thank you. if 10 non p2p type pools control 99% of the hash rate, miners have very few choices in terms of what transaction inclusion policy they want to support with their hash power.   +1E8The techniques you are using could be employed on more complex transaction sets and might yield useful tools. That would be interesting from a technical perspective.  Why not enforce each block to have 25 coinbase tx's to different payout addresses and force the hash of each of those addresses combined with a subset of tx's in the block to be less than a specified difficulty value.  Nobody gets a payout until 25 such hashes meets a difficulty threshold.  Here is the open source code for blockchain.info's iOS wallet app. https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-iPhone (presumably it's also published under a non-free license for App Store compatibility...I dunno...IANAL) Turns out, that Rouble symbol was made part of unicode 7.0 just this month. that's rather rapid adoption in apple's part I would say! Thanks for the pic...but the Ruble isn't on there.  It does resolve my mild curiosity on the W-like symbol. I don't understand why you say "PESOS!!!!!"::Confused:: this needs updating; the rates are fixed in dollar amounts now...not sure about the algorithm is for averaging/updating the fee in bitcoins. I hear ya. I don't know how the market works, but, I think they're st the stage of trying to find a way to get money for showing the movie. Typically, a distributor pays the film makers and then the distributors get paid by consumers...most film makers don't have vast distribution networks  Here is an idea (that very well may be of no merit): let each block be composed of 25 mini blocks, each of which may award themselves up to ฿1. Each block accumulates the lowest hashed mini-blocks until one of the 25 hits the target for the main block...or maybe when the sum difficulty of the 25 mini-blocks hits the target would be best. Would this make mining in smaller pools more attractive to those with hashing power?If it's a dumb or old idea that didn't pop up in my forum search, my apologies. He is a founding member. https://github.com/pmlaw/The-Bitcoin-Foundation-Legal-Repo/blob/master/Bylaws/Bylaws_of_The_Bitcoin_Foundation.md I figured it was a national currency (like this w thing...₩), but it was brand new on my net board with iOS 8 beta and I was kinda surprised I hadnt seen it before... Yes. It is condescending. If you really want to contribute, you go and do something. Hint: start with a PM to OP instead of whining about "and how much time does it take to hand them over to someone who isn't 'busy with other things'?" Are you volunteering? Go do some work and prove yourself worth listening to. There was little interest in the project when Charles started it (ICYMI). BitPay and Coinbase agree. http://blog.bitpay.com/2014/05/02/bitpay-bitcoin-and-where-to-put-that-decimal-point.htmlhttp://blog.coinbase.com/post/89405189782/its-bits I don't think your English is clear enough to result in a sensible response. Perhaps you could write in your native language and use translate.google.com? This is brilliant. Mike Caldwell, are you seeing this? Can you make some square 100 bits Casascius coins? The culture is shifting and the history is being forgotten. I applaud Jeff for being very transparent regarding his holdings and reminding people that it takes real work by regular people to make Bitcoin grow into its potential.  No he's not. He really means 2 less than 350... Charles got busy with other things. Pierre Rochard et al set this up: http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.orgIt has all Satoshi's writings. 
Jeff is dispelling the myth that everyone involved with Bitcoin development and all early miners are rich. He's not. I am an early miner (ie, laptop era mid 2010) and I'm basically of zero net worth (I have about as much bitcoins as I have med school loan debt). Not everyone who helped build the ecosystem was doing it just to get rich. I mined in the naive hope that the project would succeed and maybe someday someone who can't open a bank account can keep savings safe without having to physically defend them. I've been there. It sucks (I'm not exactly well built). Was I rewarded handsomely for it? Yes. Am I rich? No.  Good thing bitcoins aren't measured in dollars...any token intended to circulate in units of less than 1 dollar are illegal...but not tokens measured in other units (like troy ounces, grains, grams....uh...bitcoins) Wouldn't it be a new person with your memories :-) ? Bingo. Bonus for brevity.   Bitcoin as an investment may fail. I think it will succeed spectacularly as a payment network. That said, Bitcoin and gold have a lot in common and gold has been good money for thousands of years. The only advantage to gold is that it's extremely durable (it doesn't rust). There's roughly 1 Troy ounce of gold per person on earth and the gold supply inflates about 1-2% per year. While the inflation of the Bitcoin supply is about 12.5% per year right now, there are far fewer than 1 bitcoin per person. Bitcoin is much easier to store, defend, transfer ownership of, and transport. Fungibility of gold and bitcoin depends on access to ways of melting the gold and careful usage of bitcoins. Bitcoin has the properties humans want in a ledger system to keep track of our debts...don't forget, gold gets it's value for being a ledger that doesn't need any translator or language for that matter. Society accepts a 1-2% forgery rate in the ledger (ie, newly mined good)....the only reason people tolerate new gold is that there has never been something truly finite to use as a ledger and gold inflates slowly.  Coinbase joined Bitpay on this issue: http://blog.coinbase.com/post/89405189782/its-bits The first ios Bitcoin wallet app (called BitPak, with a k) had that feature years ago. It also downloaded the entire blockchain to your phone. But yes, your idea is a good one and is worth repeating to wallet devs.  The software is (unconfirmably) keeping keys encrypted (bip 38). It's as legit as you can get without reviewing what you know for certain is the source code (which I guess technically would mean compiling yourself). I'm using it for sums that wouldn't hurt to lose.  I'm not convinced that the coins will be unarguably the property of the buyer. Has the US Marshall Service really never sold property that wasn't theirs to rightfully sell? Not even once? I doubt it. I'm sure there have been mistakes in the past. The question is what can be done about improperly sold property? They're only requiring $67/btc deposit   Thx!  http://i59.tinypic.com/2h51pmv.jpg iOS 8 had a new currency symbol available when holding $ on US keyboard and having Thai keyboard enabled: ₽ It looks like a bold P with a horizontal bar on the upper part of the stem   There are probably seversl hundreds of early miners that mined briefly but stopped after a few hundred to a few thousand bitcoins. I mean, even Hal Finney didn't mine for very long. Keyword garble to trick automated sentiment trading bots? What is the biggest transaction you ever made? (Including within your own wallet)  Can you post the txid?  I think it's silly to ask for such private information. You know full well why, for very valid reasons, you won't get an answer...I wouldn't even acknowledge such a request made of me, much less comply... Then the world would laugh and quietly ignore such nonsense. But worry not, such craziness won't occur. It's not under anyone's control except consensus of the community. Even if the core devs vote to remove the 21M limit, it still won't make it so.  Strange graph. Here's a slightly outdated org chart, courtesy of David Allen. https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/796-bitcoin-foundation-org-chart-version-10-beta-march-22-2014https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lxawswcw56igpz7/AAD5ZdQjnkT1CZiUennG8AfEa I would have thought millibits would have more support. Anyhow, I think bits is better than any other term for microbitcoins and I support the move to a 6.2 format.   You could look at the same data and conclude the only terminology that has more agreement than bits = 10^-6 bitcoins are the terms Satoshi and bitcoin for 10^-8 bitcoins and 1 bitcoin, respectively. 
Any real info can be put succinctly. Tuning out for now.  I'm glad our clever ones are still working hard and doing useful work to make the Bitcoin network more valuable.  From the article:" The first companies that connected Skype to the phone network took risks. These partners need clear arguments around why they are safe and why the service they provide is in compliance with the rules."I'd argue that most Bitcoin companies are really "partners" and they need the regulatory arguments around why they are safe... Logo or character? I like the old logo, but there's no character to go with it.  You seem surprised...why? It's pretty standard. Members don't own the foundation assets. They're not shareholders. Just like people who join the EFF or their local NPR station can't call for and vote on liquidation of it's assets.  Are you a mining pool operator then? I can see the delay being an issue of propagating a larger solved block to the rest of the network...especially if you upload to another slow node (it's one at a time, just like downloading blocks, right?).It's a bit ironic, the high compensation for the block reward incentivizes small blocks or large tx fees. I now recall a discussion on the dev list on this. Well, time will change this as block reward decreases.  I wish miners would just fill blocks...why the artificial scarcity for a few pennies? It'll be a while before tx fees amount to much anyhow, why screw around with trivial fees _now_? You can read bylaws here. https://github.com/pmlaw/The-Bitcoin-Foundation-Legal-Repo/blob/master/Bylaws/Bylaws_of_The_Bitcoin_Foundation.md You should ask _them_...it's their private info.  If it were easy to answer 50 questions in a thread to everyone's satisfaction from my iPhone while on call in the hospital, I'd do it.  Far easier on me to have one quick conversation with one trustworthy person. But the tl;dr is this: nothing interesting or surprising.  Lol...the policy is no sock puppets. That's hard to implement. We've had "bill gates" and "warrem buffet" join too. What's not hard to implement is mailing a postcard with credentials required to vote. We may do this in the future and drop the voting rights deadline for signing up.I ran this election Phinn...if you have _any_ questions about it, you can call me. I'll be in Chicago mid June if you'd like to chat over lunch or something. There's nothing to hide here.  Lol...sorry to break it to you, but there's more than one receiving address at the foundation. Each member gets their own address. Go to members.bitcoinfoundation.org, login, get your address and see for yourself.  If you've taught me one thing, phinn, it's to vet rather than believe. Can you sign a message with the private key or keys used to txfer $100k to the Bitcoin Foundation as well as the transaction? The accumulated wisdom is that the first wave of adopters were technoidealists...dreamers with computers skills so to speak. NeXT wave was the "dude, I can buy drugs with this!" wave. Then the speculators came in with the entrepreneurs...now with Bitpay, coinbase, and circle, we are getting ready to get regular folks on board.  I look forward to chatting with you on Saturday OP.  Here's to Laszlo, who, depending on how you look at it, either fired the economic shot heard round the world in our humble financial revolution or was the spark that lit our humble economy on fire...well done, sir, well done! I'm a resident in Rochester...explain to me what this is and why it's worth my time...I'm curious...but not _that_ curious.  Lesson appreciated. I didn't vet. Glad there isn't some jerk hassling you! What was unclear? Send me a PM and I'll send you my phone # and I can answer any questions.  You should pick people from varying time periods, interview them, and track the changes in motivations over time.  The culture is evolving.  Creating a new definition for a word with several definitions already isn't a problem for English. English handles overloading words elegantly via contextual disambiguation.  Do other languages do this?  Example: "If I bit my drill bit and broke off a bit of my tooth, I might have to pay the dentist 100,000 bits to get it fixed."This makes sense to native English speakers, but, do other languages permit such a sentence? I think we need to think about that...if, say, 1/2 the world's population speaks a language that doesn't have identical words with many different meanings, we might be putting up a barrier we don't realize.  
This rumor is false (you could have asked me, you know...I did send out all the ballots).  No one joined the last day, although a few did join a few days before the deadline. He's been a huge resource, especially to newbies, on many shady things in the community...While I often can't follow his logic and I sometimes disagree, he digs up details like no one else I know and that's very valuable. Let the info be free and the truth will come out...or, throw all the $h!t at the wall and see what sticks  Overloading terms is very common in English.  I'm not so sure about other languages.  With native English speakers, I'm not the least bit worried that context will be insufficient to make obvious the type of "bit" being discussed.  I do think the psychological effect of "wow, I bought 40,000 bits for $20" will be beneficial to the exchange price.  It's semantics, but, I think it'll make a difference. A bit is a micro-bitcoin. This leaves two decimal places...From link above:"Fundamentally, the goal is to move to micro-bitcoins (uBTC, bits). This is most compatible with existing financial software." Having two decimal points is something a lot of financial software has come to expecthttp://blog.bitpay.com/2014/05/02/bitpay-bitcoin-and-where-to-put-that-decimal-point.html New around here? You don't know the detective very well. Perhaps you mistake his humor? Don't forget, we are all real people. Real people you could grab a bite to eat with or chat on the phone to. Do you normally slander acquaintances in real life, or just on the internet? Less than $5M, inclusive of the less than ฿10,000 being held unhedged. It's tiny. And the foundation has very little, if anything, to do with development.  MC can probably do a lot to suppress the exchange value of bitcoins. They're a huge centralized corporation that can bring huge resources to bear on a well thought out, organized plan to influence laws and regulations and make bitcoins less useful / more difficult for regular people. Might it be wise to try to pool our resources and have an organized response? Oh, wait, we did that...the Bitcoin Foundation has been making the connections with the people who will decide on how the other 98% of people who aren't as computer savvy as we get access to bitcoins.  Bitcoin _requires_ no central services of any kind...people do. But should centralized services be _forbidden_? Clearly they can be no more forbidden than they can be required. Bitcoin will go on with or without centralized infrastructure...the exchange value of bitcoins, however, is very dependent on it's utility. I think Circle will help many people find Bitcoin useful that otherwise would not be able to use it.  Don't tell anyone! Seriously, the founding members are not all really early adopters (from: https://github.com/pmlaw/The-Bitcoin-Foundation-Legal-Repo/blob/master/Bylaws/Bylaws_of_The_Bitcoin_Foundation.md):(a) Founding Members. The Founding Members of the Corporation shall be:i. Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin Developer residing or doing business in Amherst, MA, USA.ii. Peter Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab and residing or doing business in Bainbridge Island, WA, USA.iii. Charles Shrem, CEO of BitInstant residing or doing business in Brooklyn, NY, USA.iv. Roger Ver, CEO of MemoryDealers residing or doing business in Santa Clara, CA, USA.v. Patrick Murck, Principal at Engage Legal, PLLC residing or doing business in Washington, DC, USA.vi. Mark Karpeles, CEO of MtGox.com and residing or doing business in Tokyo, Japan.vii. Satoshi Nakamoto, at satoshin@gmx.com, author of the white paper Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System published on http://bitcoin.org and owner of the PGP Public Key with fingerprint: DE4E FCA3 E1AB 9E41 CE96 CECB 18C0 9E86 5EC9 48A1.I think people have a misconception about how big the foundation is...it's not like a big organization. Most fast food restaurants have more employees... And has been for years. Detective Bruno can make connections like no one else. Although I admit to not always having the insight to see them myself! He was a weird dude pretending to be female...read his posts and you'll see his conduct alone makes him unfit for membership in just about anything.   As chair of the election committee, I can assure you your hate should be directed at the voters. This was _their_ decision. But, you don't need to trust me. Every voter received the hash of their encrypted ballot and the list of all the ballot hashes is available to each voter.  To be clear: Satoshi is a member of the founders class and afforded the rights, privileges, and responsibilities thereof should he chose to participate.  Here now... I think I'm in the same boat you were in It's in the rotation to be at the top...it's been that way for a long time...From https://bitcointalk.org/adrotate.php?adinfo The Bitcoin software, network, and concept is called "Bitcoin" with a capitalized "B". Bitcoin currency units are called "bitcoins" with a lowercase "b" -- this is often abbreviated BTC. The Bitcoin client published at bitcoin.org is officially named simply "Bitcoin", though it is sometimes called "Bitcoin-Qt" or the "Satoshi client" to distinguish it from other Bitcoin clients. As chair of the election committee, I can assure you the "foundation" had nothing to do with the results. The results are soley a product of the desires of the 102 industry members that voted. But, you don't need to trust me. Everyone who voted has proof that their ballot wasn't modified...the voters could fully audit the election themselves...by design. I don't know Brock Pierce, but of course I know _of_ him. You'd have to have had your head in the sand not to.  Proof of solvency is a great step forward. Real world security audits are the flip side of the same coin, so to speak.  Really? Hmm...good to know. That sorta throws out more of the true academic mathy types as possible authors.  EPIC.  Thank you!  Thanks for being a backbone of the community!
Anyone have any guess as to what he hashed? I presume it's gonna be important later (to the good willed hacker who is trying to educate the masses of people here who need aren't gonna get it). The hash of Satoshi's password for ning?Well, I tried logging in to Ning as Satoshi with it...sometimes the hash of the password can be used to login to less well secured sites (as what happened here on the forum). No dice using 8bf0059274ca4df83675980c2be9204267bd8669ba7540b5faf2db5a8aa5d160[/size] on ning I think Mike's security practices contribute to the markup. I have a full set of BitBills (http://bitbills.com)...I don't think there is a markup on those. They predated Casascius coins by a while if I remember correctly.  Strong work theymos. Do you have control of the domain? There are many back links that would break if the domain goes away...getting a dozen mirrors up or migrating the site doesn't fix the back link issue. At any rate, I'm glad you stood up and took on the task. We need doers here and I'm glad to be a supporter.  Sold credentials to highest bidder? Looks like a PDF from LaTeX to me...and that's a document format, not a rubbery substance. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeXShould be trivial to check on a computer. I'm on my phone. http://Http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf I quite agree -- the three year old on a motorcycle analogy is perfect. I've also heard the idea that Bitcoin is stuck in "Linux gear" and can't move forward on the usability front (I don't buy that but I see the point). The idea of Bitcoin as a reserve digital currency is "nice" but I just don't see how it could happen. My vague notion of what the value of an "intrinsically worthless" token on a payment processing network should be involves concepts of how big the user base is, how much economic activity takes place on the network, # of tokens, etc. While there is more to a payment processing network than transaction per second, it's hard for me to see Bitcoin as a network transferring much value with very few tps (like currently). I'd love to see Bitcoin be in the position of not having to do much but still somehow have tremendous value. While I don't see all the pieces to that puzzle, the easy money notion seems to violate my poorly developed sense of how money and society interact. Also, I think the social benefits of having bitcoin be used by the masses for purchases large and small is far greater than having it as a reserve currency. That said, reserve currency status, being rarely used and used only by institutions when needed, would definitely decrease scam and theft  The idea of 1 microbitcoin being called 1 Finney goes way back, before this thread...it's an idea I still support! Hi all. I would prefer useful contributions only to this thread. I'll leave this here as an example of a truly useless contribution though. If you don't want to help people not get ripped off, please kindly step aside without posting.  Suggestions from the thread (scraped periodically from below)Great ideas:Grifferz: have wallets push security tips to users. LRCGroup: dispel "it will be there tomorrow myth" fight "comfort factor"Other ideas:Franky1: bitcoins dont scam people, people doLRCGroup: contact for fool proof scenarios. Destroy Bitcoin (face palm)Establish Bitcoin as reserve currency What can we, all of us, do to help bring better security practices to the ever increasing pool of Bitcoin users?Should we start with a thread (has one been started elsewhere?) on personal security practices? That's a huge topic. If we get a lot of good material organized on a thread, perhaps we could make a publication ready PDF?Like I'm sure most of you, I feel deeply hurt by the fall of Gox (but no, I wasn't actively trading with them and I sure as heck wasn't storing any coins on an exchange). I don't think our community can take too many more deep blows like this...we are losing too many good people. At the risk of personal humiliation, I'm linking to a (sophomoric) document I am working on with at least one other member of the education committee of the Bitcoin Foundation. It's here: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/784-bitcoin-storage-understanding-trust-relationships/The document is just a draft and shouldn't be taken as gospel. In fact, it needs much improvement! And there is so so much more to personal security practices than the handout above. What major categories/concepts could we organize personal security practices around? Surely there are those here with the time and skill to whip out a web community in a box...I wouldn't mind cosigning a multisig bounty.  Twas my mistake indeed. I hope he's not taking advantage of too many newbies.  I had a similar idea but lacked the technical skill to do it. What do you think of this:A virtual machine on a disk image (possibly on something like amazon EC) that had preconfigured web server, email server, irc, forum, etc with simple customization scripts that prompted the new local group to enter a few key details and get them up and running quickly. Generic logos with obvious places to customize them (and the software to do it) would help too!Of course, you'd always have the wackos accusing you of malfeasance of some sort  I think it's a great idea Mike. I'm a stretched a little too thin to take an active role, but I've made some documents and scalable vector graphics explaining some aspects of bitcoin...You are welcome to have a copy of any of my work. Aren't you a guy with a female avatar? That discussion was a long time ago and I think when I first put you on ignore.  You have a strange way of linking assumptions together. But if you are seriously interested in getting to know me (I'm not anonymous), give me a call.  SEC vs Trendon Shavers is still pending (AFAIK). The most recent web search that I could find gives a telephone number for those defrauded to call, so I presume it's still am active case. http://www.securitieslitigators.com/trendon-shavers-and-bitcoin-savings-and-trust-involved-in-first-ever-bitcoin-ponzi/  I think anything anyone can do to help strengthen a group of dedicated Bitcoin users is a good thing. There is nothing to gain by tearing people down (falsely at least!) or inventing reasons to hate stuff. It's far better if we support new initiatives and defend their right to exist.  I'm not sure what exactly happened at Gox....I'm not sure anyone is. But I think honest and honorable are necessary but not sufficient. I'd add able to the list. There are a lot of epode who are marginally competent at their jobs...I fear this to be the case in many areas of our nascent ecosystem precisely because of rapid growth.  Destroyed? Seems a little harsh That said, nobody has a patent on organizing people to pool resources around a common interest. Similarly, the Bitcoin Foundation has no monopoly. My belief is that the more groups pooling resources to help _all_ aspects of the community become stronger is a good thing. To state that the Foundation doesn't represent everyone or every interest is to state the obvious. The more we band together (be it here or elsewhere) the stronger we can make Bitcoin.  
Lol...you must be new. I wrote an iPhone app called mybitcoin...and I'm in my final year of residency  I bet is has to do with blockchain.com...as does everybody else I see  Have a look. The OP isn't well respected, so take no notice. https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/752-the-good-and-useful-things-the-foundation-has-done-for-us-members-compiled-by-dr-brian-goss/ Undoing the ignore long enough to skim this post was just not a wise move on my part... Depends what the work entailed... Lots of people have tried to trademark Bitcoin.  The US law is pretty clear on this: first use defines who gets to TM something...thus, there's no need for (or ability for anyone to obtain) a US trademark.  For other countries, it's (AFAIK) basically first horse across the regulatory finish line gets the TM, regardless of who has been using it (doesn't matter who was first, what they were using it for, how long they were using it, etc).  Mark used his own funds to defensively trademark it and then (i guess) purposely never enforce it so as to make it essentially free to use (he's a French citizen, i think, so he did this in France).  I don't know if that means no one can TM it there or it re-opens the door for someone else to TM it...but  he was praised for doing this for the community at the time.  If someone came to you and asked you for a few $k USD to TM "bitcoin" in your country to pre-empt squatters, would you be willing? Believe it or not, a newbie's post on a forum is not likely to get noticed by the Bitcoin Foundation.  While I'm a member of the foundation, I don't speak for the foundation (just like I'm a donator here but I don't speak for bitcointalk.org).  Anyhow, The domain name issue you speak of is news to me and of doubtful significance.  The Foundation didn't pave a way to MtGox; rather, MtGox paved the way to established a Foundation (with the help of a few others).  You assert the Foundation accepted funds while MtGox was on the verge of bankruptcy, what do you mean?  If you mean they've been on the verge of bankruptcy for a few years and they paid membership dues, then, uh...duh... If you mean something more relevant, explain yourself. I can only speak for myself, but, no Mark didn't pay me (or AFAIK any of my my 800 friends) anything.All this said, I do think those who lost funds will end up having some recourse; the amounts they recover will depend on what exactly happened and where the funds are.  AFAIK, the truth about what exactly happened isn't known, not even to MtGox.  But don't confuse the two organizations: MtGox and the Bitcoin Foundation had one thing in common: Mark was a board member on both.  While he essentially ran MtGox, he was just one of 5-7 board members at the Foundation.  Mark did not run the Bitcoin Foundation.  In fact, of the minutes currently available  (which is OOD, IMHO), Mark didn't go to Foundation board meetings and instead sent his second in command to the board meetings (who attended 70% of them). OP you might give http://bitgivefoundation.org a look too. I like your multisig idea.   https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=407Grant deadline is today. I'm sure it's at least slightly flexible. If you have a well thought out proposal, read the link above and submit a grant...you'll at the very least be early for consideration in the next round!From above link:"Submit your proposal by email to grants@bitcoinfoundation.org. Award decisions will be made within 4-6 weeks of submission deadline. If you have questions, please let us know. We look forward to hearing your ideas!" There is a post somewhere on this forum (5 btc 0.001 milliBitcoin bounty were key terms in the thread) where a clever person suggested this format:3฿234This mean three leading zeros after the decimal place and then the numbers 234...it would look like this;3฿234=0.000234 (ie, 0.234 m฿)I think this deserves more thought now that a fair amount of time has passed.  Stop feeding the trolls... You're too funny. No, the IMF is not thinking about getting a ฿ reserve. That old paper you reference is for some journal in Chicago...in no way written by anyone with the IMF.  On the chance that Gox gives all funds back, does that change anything? IMHO, no. I'm particularly unhappy about how Mark decided to blame Bitcoin rather than himself...that's not what I want on my Bitcoin Foundation board. The next election won't be kind to him (if he chooses to hang on that long).  I don't think you understand block chain based cryptocurrencies...there is no magic behind # of confirmations. With small altcoins, they will be more vulnerable to double spend attacks due to the massively lower computing requirements needed to, say, replace the last 10 blocks of transactions... The Bitcoin Foundation was started, in part, to fund the position of chief scientist...to fund a core dev to work on it full time.   The current foundation has 3 board seats for non-industry members. 3 seats for industry. 1 seat for a tie breaker. Anyone can run for election for 6 of the seats, member or not...but only members vote. Terms are 2 years.  The calculations are really dumb in the article. The author doesn't understand the concept of money velocity. $600 billion in business _per year_ could theoretically be done with a sea shell worth a 1¢. That sea shell would have to change hands ridiculously quickly...given that internet money can change hands quickly, to simply divide 1 years business by the number of tokens implies bitcoins change hands once a year...the bank of America paper is better thought out...although I disagree with their model inputs, just not the model (as in this case). http://cryptome.org/2013/12/boa-bitcoin.pdf There is a planned 30 min server upgrade downtime today I believe...http://blog.blockchain.info Decent thread: our last attempt at logo redesign (the switch from the gold to the orange logo was a huge step forward, but leaves something to be desired...but it looks like it's working still!)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91068.0;allOthers to dig up:Laszlo's ฿10k pizzaKnightsmb ฿300k walletSatoshi's gentleman agreement not to gpu mine & start an arms raceGavin's announcement to present at CIA headquartersBitcoin foundation announcementMathew n.

Some sold more than others. But there are probably a few thousand of modestly well off folks who are wondering how to incorporate the unexpected funds into their life goals... Without things like this, bitcoins would still be worthless...trade = spreading coins to more users; the broader the user base, the more valuable bitcoins become. Thank you for pioneering Laszlo! And for protecting our nascent network so that it had a chance to grow up! If your address has funds on it, or ever had funds on it, then it is public.  Ok, who let pirateat40 out of his metal playpen with barbed wire fence? Miners focusing in fees is kind if stupid at this point. For the $50 they get in fees they really muck with the user experience of Bitcoin...making the average user unhappy and making the average usefulness of Bitcoin less. The fact that it's the users fault is irrelevant...the token on the network is only as valuable as it is spendable; if it takes forever to spend, it is worth less than a token spendable in 10 mins.  Flawless plan? Depends on perspective. If you don't mind paying your customers 20% to go learn about bitcoin and become a user, it's a great idea. A very noble donation and great contribution to the community. It is the spread of adoption that is driving value now, and that needs to continue...so it may be in your long term best interests. From a myopic, immediate self interest perspective, of course it makes sense to take 100% fiat and buy 20% worth of ฿.  Yup. You were trolled. But what a darn good reply! It goes up when needed. 'Nuff said. A payment network that processes little has tokens worth little as well. Hopefully the Bank of America paper has made that plain.  Worth the read. Thanks for posting.  They've been slowly working on it for years. It's a big change. Version 0.8 partly addresses the issue (DER malleability). I think you could implement this as a colored coin concept running on top of the bitcoin block chain. You could have several layers of volatility/stability trade offs.   I can pass a message through a friend if it's urgent.   I will not buy another Apple product until I can download a native wallet app. Right now I'm thinking the LG Flex looks pretty cool and I kinda want a larger screen than what my iPhone 5s has...but I don't _need_ a new phone yet.  Or buying a lotto ticket or gambling Get over it. Someone just put some of the biggest ideas in a generation in front of your face. You should take 30 seconds to realize that by listening...Eventually you'll get to know who's who and not need an intro like the rest of us.  Well, as a physician, our common practice is to disclose any possible conflict of interest. I think asking speakers to disclose which crypto currencies they hold in investment amounts is appropriate. I suspect everyone would know the answer anyhow. I also think knowing what projects they donate to or contribute code to would also be helpful. I think keeping it voluntary is a good idea.   https://members.bitcoinfoundation.org/current Someone with an identical name to Andreas' is listed as a member of the Foundation.  A lot of people kicked the can down the road, picking up a few hundred bitcoins in the process...mining wasn't something a lot of people stuck with for long periods back then...remember, when Bitcoin was a year and a half old, mining was easy with a CPU and bitcoins were essentially worthless.  I've met a few guys in that general scenario and they're busy with their already busy lives...just a few hundred kilo bucks richer--not enough to last a lifetime of living large! I don't think the subject of a SAR is allowed to know that they are...(insert horrible pseudo-reference) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_activity_report#ConfidentialityAt any rate, the allegation uses email quotes from Charlie liberally. Hard to see how that is unlikely to be true. It's not just failure to work hard enough to discover rule violations, it was failure to do the job of a compliance officer. It may not seem fair that different rules apply to people buying eggs low and selling high than to people doing the same thing with money, but the rules are different. For this use case, bitcoins are more like dollars than a commodity like eggs. 
And anyone can donate too!   ...as in move...not sacrifice the lives of millions of my fellow citizens  No. But I would give up my country. I think you also need to prove him Catholic...but I'll spot you the $100k miracle  Fewer would want to participate if they felt they were just working to make him rich. As it stands now, he has not touched but a tiny fraction (if that) of his coins, so it's unclear if he ever intends to become known and/or spend his coins.  In the Catholic Church you mean?I'm not catholic but I think the bare minimum requirements include: being dead, causing or being subject to a miracle in life, miracle ascribed to the proposed saint posthumously in response to supplication...You could start a church yourself though...I hear it's easier than starting a 501c3...

I just googled bitcoin price (on wife's phone) and the sponsored link/ad at the top said it was to mtgox.com...only it wasn't, it was too mtgoox.com. The site looked like mtgox.com (even offered to switch to mobile like the real gox site does). Does Google permit this kind of fishing?*edit-- updated thread title I've gotten a few random Bitcoin payments over the past few months I wasn't expecting...I heard that this was going around the community and no one was sure who was doing it or why. Anyhow, it got me thinking. I'm a physician, a radiology resident (see my npi in my old posts). There are several physicans that work where I'm in training that helped found a hospital in west Africa. They just installed an X-Ray machine and they don't have an ultrasound scanner. Getting the hospital set up on the internet and getting a PACS (radiology image sharing) network installed could really be useful (volunteer radiologists could read cases remotely). Ultrasound would have a huge impact on patient care and they're not incredibly expensive ($20k ish).  With a reliable internet connection, getting the hospital set up to accept donations in bitcoin wouldn't be a huge stretch (the hospital is aimed to become self sustaining/self funding). Has anyone done something like this? I think it would be cool to show in a real way how Bitcoin can change and save lives. Pipe dream or do-able? How do I bridge the gap between the real world and digital currency gently (without sounding like a crook or used car salesman)?

He turned back due to knee pain (probably torn ligaments). http://transantarctic.wordpress.com Way to go Faysal! Safe journey home! Version 1.0 will not be a beta, by convention. 0.9 will be the last major new feature update during beta. Incremental updates 0.9-1.0.  http://transantarctic.wordpress.comI can only imagine how hard this is... I'm over 400 GB in < 30 days...wow!
How the big fish see it:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/885843-banks-research-report-on-bitcoin.html I hear ya. You are running a full node and you wonder at what level of economic activity on the the Bitcoin network will your bandwidth requirements force you to upgrade to higher bandwidth. Clearly the late stage evolution of all crypto currencies is to centralize in pockets around cheap, wide bandwidth, as well as cheap electricity. If keeping up with blocks now is your concern, you need to ensure you can pull 0.1 megabyte (0.8 megabits) per minute (~15 kilobits/sec) through your connection. If you are using a 14.4 kilobaud modem from 1994, you probably are gonna have trouble doing that now; but a modern 56k modem from 1998 might work just fine Seriously though, bandwidth requirement right now is fixed by the 1 MB/block safety limit. It shouldn't trouble your connection too much! ...because I don't need dollars... If you wait a long time it may become economical to spend your dust. The transaction fee defaults go down periodically as price goes up but most miners don't change the default settings; the next version of Bitcoin-Qt will hopefully have a market based, free floating transaction fee.  No need to share wallet.dat; just post all your addresses.  A Fin (after Hal Finney: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0) How much ฿? A lot can be done if significant value lost. Don't write to drive.  A January 2009 address was used to send bitcoins to DPR. That's the thrust of the article and claim (probably valid) of Ron and Rivest.  Whoop dee doo. Probably of no consequence but could shake the markets at a time no one can put fiat money into an exchange. (Reposted in this thread with a more informative title...in case you were wondering why the identical post in the haha thread) A January 2009 address was used to send bitcoins to DPR. That's the thrust of the article and claim (probably valid) of Ron and Rivest.  Whoop dee doo. Probably of no consequence but could shake the markets at a time no one can put fiat money into an exchange. That's rather clever at least... Yes. That's the Shamir as in rSa.  Now _that_ was funny. Classic! I didn't think there was a way to estimate easily...one would probably have to poll a sample or pool operators to make a guesstimate.  Blockchain.info reports taint analysis. Is this bad or wrong? What do you think of this company that is creating a whitelist? http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/11/13/sanitizing-bitcoin-coin-validation/Tge question is, how are we gonna point out the ill defined nature of such a task and the impossibility of doing it perfectly? The people who will be making decisions that will heavily effect the value of your bitcoins are likely to want this in the Bitcoin protocol. That's not on the table, but, they might even think they can demand it. We done white or black list our dollar bills by serial number. Why should we do this to our bitcoins? Such arguments are more helpful than an angsty "NO NO!". Others are working on whitelists:http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/11/13/sanitizing-bitcoin-coin-validation/We need to fully think this stuff through. It's happening. We should be clear to separate what is part of Bitcoin the protocol and what is a possible feature/crippleware in a wallet program. There is no do discussion of making any such listing part of Bitcoin the protocol (which is silly anyway).  I think the foundation needs to have a policy on the issue. It think it's a non-starter, but, the foundation will be asked about it and the entire community needs a reply better thought out than "no."Besides, the government doesn't need permission to make it's own such list. It's not on the table to put this inside the protocol (the wallet, sure, but not the protocol).  I'll defined question, I know, but any justifiable estimate?Specifically, can you answer Jerry Brito's tweet:https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/401025057105125377 Call your congressman's office and ask. The congress reps are really approachable. Edit: Rassah -- glad to see you are on the right track.  yesalso, you shouldn't be solo miningthere's little point to it.  Time to join a pool. Bankers don't work weekends; with all the newbies who don't know the money stops flowing, they're surprised by the fall in price as we head in to sunday.  If it weren't for china, I should think we'd rise every morning and crash every night! uh....not all that well....who knows, maybe they ~150k bitcoins they got were his whole stash.
I was able to compile bitcoind from https://github.com/donSchoe/ptsminer for OS X; that's as far as I can get; I'm not sure if ptsminer is supposed to compile on Mac or not...I'm no programmer, so it took me like two hours to fix all the bugs in the makefile.osx and get my libraries linked correctly...Any news on a mac pool miner?Oh, I'll keep my nodes running in validation mode to help others get started:addnode 96.42.211.116:3888 addaddnode 96.42.211.116:3889 addaddnode 96.42.211.116:3890 addaddnode 96.42.211.116:3891 addNone of these are speed demons (the oldest is a core 2 -- not even a duo; I'm not even sure how much ram it has...) seems to be compiling ok now...if you get stuck compiling db.cpp, change the makefile.osx to say: DEPSDIR=/usr/local(instead of /opt/local)make sure you have deps installed:brew install berkeley-db boost miniupnpc openssl(make sure you install berkely-db 4.8...this might be useful:cd /usr/localgit checkout e6a374d Library/Formula/berkeley-db.rb (get right version)brew unlink berkeley-db (unlink wrong version)brew install berkeley-db (this should install the right version...but it didn't work for me...I'm trying brew install berkeley-db4 right now)(grrr....where the heck does brew put db4?) I'm working on fixing the make file for OS X...I've got fair amount of brew installing to do first though...It's been too long since I've compiled stuff... Awesome service to the community. Well done, sir! I hear yamy old MacBook does too (although I did find a block!) Wowmuch harder than that I thought it'd be! My 2009 mac laptopno so much cutting' it!Pgqh7CW6nrneH94NS3UG76UH2P3qjUgtR5 http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1q18k3/we_rise_again/ Awesome job all.  I must say that our community has been scammed a great deal and defenders with skeptical inquiries will always be needed; we're a motley crew and we all do our best. In time, we'll all get more used to expecting / using the awesome transparency that Bitcoin provides.  Well done Goat. Thank you for your support of the community.  Cross-posting my experience here:WowUpload speeds are crazy fast (~2.8 MB/seclikely limited on my end; see below). Program runs flawlessly in the background; no problems closing the laptop lid or rebooting.  It gracefully resumes where it got cut off. Functions similarly to Dropbox and allows the upload and download bandwidth to be limited independently.  So far very impressed.  WowUpload speeds are crazy fast (~2.8 MB/seclikely limited on my end; see below). Program runs flawlessly in the background; no problems closing the laptop lid or rebooting.  It gracefully resumes where it got cut off. Functions similarly to Dropbox and allows the upload and download bandwidth to be limited independently.  So far very impressed.  Flag dimensions?  Hard trip. Mustn't be too big.  Busy in the hospital at the moment. What we have here are simple cultural differences (computer culture differences as well as geographic ones). It takes a little not-so-obvious work to fully utilize the transparency that Bitcoin affords. I don't fault anyone for not following what seems like standard operating procedure to many of us in the community. Misunderstandings like this are to be expected with such a new technology. That said, I think we all should thank Thorkill/Sirius money for sponsoring this rather brilliant campaign. Does anyone remember when John Matonis's Twitter account was hacked and started asking for donations? Stuff like this is going to keep happening until we all, as a community, come up with some best practice guidelines. I will be working with the Bitcoin foundation with input from members here to devise some guidelines for journalists and fundraisers. To put my money where my mouth is, so to speak:https://blockchain.info/fr/tx/958a8f11c0f27d2ec01eb5f5189a1b29082d8f88d42a90ff0f68535a4436c225He's over ฿15 now.  Richard, the author of the coindesk article, interviewed Faysal via both gmail and his public figure Facebook account and confirmed the Bitcoin address with Faysal (the brave explorer). This is as legit as it comes without signatures and irc logs. I think we need some best practice guidelines so folks not as accustomed to computer nerd security culture can make themselves stand out more clearly from scammers. Again...I believe this address to be valid and Thorkill (the big 6.8 BTC donor/Sirius money) to be legitimately acting on Faysal's behalf.  Looks like the goal of 2000 was met. What we do not have is irrefutable proof that the donation address is valid (but no specific reason to think it's a scam either).  Looks like the goal is essentially met (2000). A signed message from the donation address is the next step. (In retrospect ought to have been my first step and the first step of any bitcoin journalist).  Wow! Things are moving fast! Strong work all! Need someone very close by to him to make it.  I'm in. This is legit. See the coindesk article:http://www.coindesk.com/adventurer-make-first-ever-bitcoin-transaction-south-pole/ (in phins post too)
Might be better to print a few private keys via bitaddress.org and give those slips of paper instead. No waiter/waitress has time to install apps and setup accounts and serve your food.  Safepaperwallet.com Exactly. Not one cent per year per user; just one cent per year. Period.  http://www.coindesk.com/adventurer-make-first-ever-bitcoin-transaction-south-pole/1Gt1anYr6gEuiNgacFouhy4RUNQFH3YY9YI'm in.  Coinjoin? Is this much different? Won't fly upon app review by apple. Not to mention that they won't mine a dime's worth of coin.  You only need to keep an entire copy of the Blockchain if you want complete trustlessness (For example, if you cannot trust anyone supply you with the last n number of blocks). This doesn't make a lot of sense given the cost for most users. The only reason there is a block size limit in the first place is to protect the Blockchain from spam. That's how it was set up originally and that limit will eventually increase. That limit isn't truly part of the Bitcoin protocol per se. There are some who wanted to spam the Blockchain considerably and wanted The block size limit to remain fixed in place so as to drastically increase the transaction fees. I don't think anyone holds that opinion anymore. I think we all, more or less, recognize that a Bitcoin is only as valuable as the size of the transaction network behind it. I need such a service now in fact! Count me in for the trial of avail. Goss@btcedproject.org Safepaperwallet.com I've got a few references on the technologies that preceded and enabled Bitcoin. Send me an email: goss@btcedproject.org http://bitcoin100.org/ Congrats! Most people don't understand the privacy implications of reusing bitcoin addresses and thus see the failure to reuse addresses as a bad thing.  Those sophisticated enough to be using paper wallets are certainly  sophisticated enough to understand that if address A sends money to address B, the change does not got back to address A, but rather to address C (another address in the same wallet as A).  This is a failure to communicate the core principles of the protocol, not a failure of the wallet software. Well done! Where is phin when ya need him? The worst thing they could do is hold them in uncertainty...oh, wait, that's the plan. As has been pointed out elsewhere, it is hard to estimate supply when inaccessible bitcoins look identical to accessible ones. For example, if an address has had 1M bitcoins in it without a transaction spent in 3 years....is the private key lost or just part of a savings plan? You must not know Dan. He's a real programmer (darn good too...really darn good) with a real reputation.  These look cool:https://safepaperwallet.com/ There was a time, in the us at least, when there was private services for things like fire fighting...the fact that governments supply this service at high cost under monopoly conditions and accept payment only in paper does not intrinsically make the government useful or irreplaceable.  Are you sure it is a requirement to have a credit card? I imagine they intend to add a level III verification tier in the future, but not necessarily requiring credit card for level two.
You have to put things in context. Back then, things were changing really fast. I remember these coin things that I made with my laptop and I thought were worthless actually had a non-zero value...it was surprising. Don't forget, early on, every body (not many) had more coins than they knew what to do with...because there was nothing to do with them...Gavin started giving them away in a recycling faucet...you request 5 BTC play with it...send it back when you're done...it was a trivial amount of bitcoin for the time...Going from a value of 0 to not 0 was a huge "% increase". It seemed every month the price went up...then every week...then every day...the effect on one's brain of this process was truly remarkable to experience...it was (for me) unbelievable...but I believe it now...Bitcoin is here to stay.  Exactly. Well said. http://freico.in/about/I call it theft coin...or digital pseudo-fiat  Surely this is commonplace, no?  I mean, if they get burned with a reversed transaction at some point, they scale back business until risk/benefit ratio changes...is there really no precedent for this with other institutions? That was Charles...and one of the reasons I became a student in the first place!That said, his lectures are great.  I watched them all on double speed. (for reference http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/) I think this is of general interest (and thus worth a reply rather than a PM):I consider PGP a requisite skill that any serious Bitcoiner should know (although Gliph is 10x easier, it's new, not open, and could require trust).  Thus, I'd watch LECTURE 15 How to Use PGP for Secure Email Communications  Bitcoin Faucet...then I started mining the old fashion way...cpu... Hello All,I've got two new lectures up on udemy with the Bitcoin Education Project (http://btcedproject.org): Closed != insecureAnd yes, I rarely use PGP anymore...it was a PITA to begin with. Wow that was fast...I'm a new seed (5 Mbit/s up)... Mycellium? I had to google it (I'm not an android guy...yet...mycellium looks cool)....to me mycellium is something I write a prescription to treat  Y'all gotta see Gliph. There's a web version and an android version in addition to the iOS version pictured below...But Gliph is about way more than sending bitcoins easily...ever send a secure text message? With Gliph you can, and it's free. It's basically replaced pgp amongst my important contacts.  I'll float the idea and see if it gains any traction. I'll ping Elizabeth as I think it's right up her alley.  Would you be interested in a startup kit from the Bitcoin Foundation? (Not that one exists, but maybe we should package a web site, forum, customizable logos, mail server, etc for use with a virtual server...this way localized foundations could assemble and organize quickly).  If such a blacklisting scheme that worked were implemented, it would be used against us at best and would kill the value of Bitcoin at worst.  <TinHat>Kind of a far fetched extension of the OP's idea, but, perhaps the FBI waited as long as it could to bust DPR hoping to increase their take...perhaps the debt ceiling crisis forced their hand to take him now...maybe this is the contingency plan for a collapse of the US Dollar...owning 5% of all the Bitcoin isn't a bad position to be in at the start of a financial armageddon. </TinHat> Lol. The pre-gpu days were pretty neat. We had so little clue about what was going on. But Satoshi's gentleman's agreement to keep away from gpu mining meant that ฿ got widely dispersed to lots of people. Having a wide user base increases the odds of getting sufficiently talented people sufficiently motivated to finish the work of getting the network off the ground. We are still not done yet.  Turning off CPU mining from my laptops because it would take over a week just for one measely block of only ฿50.  I would ask him what his travel plans are for October. Oh, and what his address is.  Try taking a social network trip. Faster. Better. Cheaper.  +1Feature of both houses and Bitcoin...not a flaw. 
Bitcoin's numerical INFLATION rate is decreasing. It was outrageously highly at block #2 and has been decreasing with _each_ block since. To think Bitcoin is not under severe inflation now is to miss the most powerful point--despite a rapid rate of increase in the Bitcoin money supply (even the US doesn't print such a large fraction of its money per year), the purchasing power of 1 unit of currency is not going down in proportion. That's the real Kicker.  The membership dead line for voting rights was announced ahead of time, but no one thought to modify the sign up pages to repeat that message (it should have been plastered in big bold letters every where). We had a dead line to prevent somebody from spending $250 bucks for sock puppet accounts and buy g the election. More rounds of voting would have been better IMHO.  It's never a mistake to engage the community...recognizing that the community is really a bunch of individuals from which great ideas, companies, and groups form. But, in the end, the foundation election was decided by foundation voters.  I listen to LTB (let's talk Bitcoin) at double speed on my iPhone. It's a great podcast.  If governments wanted to make crime fighting money, they'd have done so long ago. The friction that comes with building crime fighting features into our money would be so economically damaging that we forego it and fight crimes using the infrastructure used to account for and store our money. https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=261Read the linked document -- it's brilliant. Such legal work doesn't come cheap I suspect!. Whether it's supporting Bitcointalk.org or the Bitcoin Foundation, we are stronger as a community when we can pool our resources.  Wow...you guys rock! http://www.acronymfinder.com/In-This-Thread-(forums)-(ITT).htmlIRL no one has this problem  There are a lot of people running with beliefs likely different from yours our mine...but I wouldn't classify any of the candidates as extremists or "nutters" at all.  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Days_DestroyedSpecifically, cumulative %of bdd.  The general idea is interesting but the petition would be better if it was written by a native English speaker or simply done in the OP's native language. Anyone care to rewrite it? I think it's a long shot but a coherent petition might not fall on deaf ears.  The problem with trolls is their response to feeding...Waste. Of. Time.  The visual presentation is great.  The info is sketchy.  Relevant comparisons would be to the alternatives.449b4d45b0b08271bb58a0d0b4beb02f6647034aa081fd4aa4627703aa623052 I sincerely hope we don't cut each other down as we try to build the Foundation up. The last thing we want are people leaving the community over the election. A strong foundation will be useful for many things, but, the community is and needs to always be more than the Foundation. You can never stop the community; the Foundation can technically be stopped, but another similar entity would emerge from the community to take it's place. If that ever happened, and I hope it doesn't, where do you think it would reemerge from? I would bet right here, on bitcointalk.  Amir,Well done! The more implementations we get the better able we are to see bugs (like the 0.8 issue). We need a robust plan for analyzing this; was one of the Bitcoin Foundation grants given to address this? You're about 20 years too late. It was called MicroPayment Transfer Protocol (mptp://) (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-mptp) Anyone up for making an open source equivalent? For the record, Rassah was on my short list. The truth is that we had a large number of great candidates....great candidates who are and will continue to be great stewards of the community. Our main goal should be figuring out how to build an effective community and I think the Foundation is part of it. Others disagree and that's ok. I donated a small amount to bitcointalk (฿10? It was cheap at the time) and some think that's stupid. I disagree (and I think history is on my side on this one). Only time will tell how effective different parts of the community are for different goals. But I think arguing that Bitcoin doesn't need any community at all is foolish. I'm proud to be members of the same community and foundation as everyone who ran. Each deserves a hearty thank you for stepping up to be counted amongst the doers.   You can see how few votes it would take to buy the needed votes to sway this thing. The foundation is focused on growing globally (and Elizabeth is quite in support of that). I do think having BF-USA underneath a Bitcoin foundation alongside BF-EU, BF-China, etc is the way to go. Keeping us together through that transition rather than splintering I think is important.  I got in about a week before a big difficulty jump. Blocks were being found rather fast. I mined for about a week, on and off. I generated ฿200 overnight once (which I still think is crazy...but I'm rather glad for it! http://uofr.net/~bcg/a.jpg). I generated about ฿400 ish. I "wasted" almost $20 on bitcoin on bitcoinmarket.com buying around 200-ish btc. I've got more than half of it left, but, I sold a bunch in April. I'm lucky to have gotten what I've got for essentially nothing. I mined because I believed in the idea of Bitcoin, not because it made sense economically. I'm glad I, and others, participated at various times to keep it going, even before there was a monetary value (in fiat). It's also good that there are many like me who pitched in for a short time, getting something to keep motivated to participate in the community, but not getting so much so as to ensure few people got anything. 
Weusecoins.com is a great short video intro; I've used it twice in meetings with congressional staffers. Coindesk.com has a ticker at the top. Great way to see price and news at the same time. The Bitcoin Education Project (btcedproject.org) has some great material for those looking to become a local Bitcoin expert.  Our decision making process was made via a thread on our forum. I coordinated the thread and put the recommendations we made to the board on GitHub. A large fraction of foundation members are not from the US...not sure exactly how many...maybe 30-40%? I think internationalizing the foundation is critical and should be a priority. I suspect that's driving some votes.  The intent behind the sign up deadline was to prevent someone from stuffing the ballot box; membership is cheap but foresight is not. We didn't want someone spending a months salary and buying the election.  It's kinda pricey...and it sounds like a gimmick...it's just an über expandable kit...I have a billion dollar block eruptor farm with 100 YH/s...it's the size of Texas but must be sited outdoors in Alaska to be profitable to run...Does the performance / watt / dollar of their kit miner massively outperform anything else out there? Is this the reason the $/฿ price dropped like 10% over the last few hours? Link? I didn't see it...-edit- Found it: http://virtualminingcorp.com/shop1/index.php?id_product=23&controller=product Yikes. We need to get said devices distributed widely then. Gone are the days of my laptop generating 50-200 bitcoins a day... That's a significant fraction of the mining power of the network...Do you think they meant GH/s? Is this for real?http://bit.ly/13g96v8I figure you folks would be a better judge than I.  ...then their salaries for working on Bitcoin will be cut Seriously, if they were compromised, we'd lose a lot of free employees... Glad to see folks here still remember this thread! Thx for jinxing it  The OP's point is subtle and very intuitive (if mathematically unsophisticated...but hey, not many people are, right?). He is asking will the series converge (sum of all created bitcoins) even if "we keep shifting the decimal point."That's a very valid question and I suspect many won't understand it. Anyhow, the issue of shifting the decimal place is mathematically identical to adding more decimal places...so the question is "does the series converge even if there is infinite precision?"  The answer is yes and it will converge such that you will have the same fraction of the final overall total of bitcoins created that you have today, regardless if how the decimal gets moved about.  The deadline for these agencies to report back to the senate is august 30...see the last paragraph on page 3:http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/download/letter-to-secretary-napolitano-on-virtual-currenciesI'm sure getting help understanding this stuff was greatly appreciated...kinda like getting tutored the day before a test... Haven't heard anything yet. Expect some news (maybe not from the foundation) 8/30. See the last paragraph here:http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/download/letter-to-secretary-napolitano-on-virtual-currencies I'm too dumb to contribute to the code...but not so dumb as to not contribute to the bounty.  Thank you for the detailed explanation of this important issue. +1That's why we need to educate.  Strong work! +1We must be wise in how we choose to use Bitcoin. Businesses bqeing totally hands off regarding how they let others use their services could lead to consequences they did not predict nor desire. That could bring unwarranted restrictions for all of us. Bitcoin is free speech; what is a Bitcoin transaction other than rule based editing of a shared public ledger?If I shout loudly my private key, and a terrorist hears me and creates a ledger entry increasing the number of bitcoins associated with a private key known only to him, am I funding terrorism?Anyhow, bitcoin (in the US) is money now:http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/08/06/Bitcoin.pdf Hey joe. Did you have a credit card 15 years ago? You are right to point out the trivial: they don't "eat it" they distribute it (again, a presumption...but it's not worth the time to discuss). The non-trivial point is that the individual card holder used to be on the hook for fraud. 
This was normal a few years ago...it's an artifact of a still small network (small number of asics, that is).  When I did better than this with my laptop, I didn't think it was scary or bad...I was supporting the network. This makes an apt comparison. Remember 15 years ago when credit card identity theft bankrupted people?  I mean, it used to be the card holders fault that the credit card network was so insecure.  Now, most credit card companies eat the cost of this insecurity. I used to CPU mine...while we all know someday we're gonna need super high power computers to run a huge network, we simply don't need that much processing power right now.  That said, the more powerful hashing devices we create, the more we need them to protect our network.  If someone decided to make an ASIC back when I was mining with my laptop, they'd have owned the  then rather puny network (and might not have cared if they trashed it...bitcoins weren't worth anything back then). I don't understand. ? Yeah. Or, you could just insist on having his contact info. Give up anonymity and gain instantaneous transactions. Low tech, but easy.  I took radiographs of the original BitBills cards. Notta chance of getting the private key with those using standard body radiography equipment. A Casascius coin would be much more difficult than a BitBill unless Mike is using some crazy ink with an absorption peak near the k edge of iodine.  OP -- good points. I'd add to be sure to make it work best for mobile platforms (who wants a computer anymore these days anyway? The days of the computer are numbered).  SRO's are part and parcel of every industry. Think American Bar Association, American Board of Radiology, etc...most likely, these organizations (including DATA) will have only indirect influence in your life.  Without the ability to exchange, yes. Exchanges, perhaps not. There's another group of geniuses working in this issue. See my link above.  OP has a good point (thx clean up crew!). Bitcoin is worthless if too few people own it. That's part of the genius in bootstrapping this whole thing. I started mining with my laptop over 3 years ago not because Bitcoin was valuable, but because the system provided ideological motivation. Things moved to the "hey, I can buy drugs with this stuff" type of motivation and Bitcoin grew as it expanded to this new, more populated user base. Now we are entering the third wave where significant financial gains are motivating smart business people to set up real industries around the technology. It's this maturation and entering the day to day lives of normal people that will drastically increase the value of Bitcoin. But it will take time (like 10 years, not 10 weeks). I'd also add that the value scales not solely with the size of the userbase (a temporary phenomenon), but also with transaction volume. A technology that could never handle more than 7 transactions per second isn't worth much. Mathematically, I would say Price = k*(u/sqrt(1+u^2))*T^b where k is a constant that depends on the currency you're buying bitcoins in, u is the # of users (scaled), T is the transactions per second the network is doing and b is the constant you throw in to look smart later.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=229315.0Decentralized exchange. We need it -- because the OP is kinda right. Bitcoin will take longer to hit it's much decreased peak potential should such a global crackdown occur.  Right, just spending them does.  Yes.  Next question. Great historical stuff on this topic: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_in_the_United_Stateshttp://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/BookPreface.html I'm a sucker for improving the logo...I think there are some very strong design concepts here. Of historical interest, see coinabul's thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91068.0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-regulatory_organizationThis is normal development of any industry... The field is wide open. I want the best person possible representing me. Get the word out! Detective Phinn, you've been serving the community for quite some time now...are you interested in running? The key ring idea is an oldie but goodie!http://item.mobileweb.ebay.com/viewitem?sbk=1&nav=SEARCH&itemId=300495374337 This idea has potential. It's already possible to get the same end result for free (bitaddress.org), but some variations on the theme could make for a novel and viable product.  Anybody here have an interest in representing the general members of the Bitcoin Foundation? I'm willing to nominate any qualified person who could bring new skills and energy to the board. Note, you don't have to be a member to run (but if you win, it would be rather awkward if you didn't want to join!). Here's the current board composition:https://bitcoinfoundation.org/about/board
I think Satoshi would approve of a centralized effort to protect the decentralization of Bitcoin...or at least a centralized effort to fix his kinda sh!tty code  Well, if 1000 people had ฿10,000, that'd be 10 million Bitcoins (roughly as many as are in existence). Thus, I'd say 200 is a pretty darn good off the cuff estimate. I believe the "mathematics" employed is called "multiplication." :-) Does not apply. Results are very predictable. Want the source? If anyone was wondering what ever happened to this app, well, it's back.  You have to pay Apple $100 / year to keep apps in the app store.  Seeing as I hadn't made enough money from the app to cover the fee, I let it go.  Anyhow, I paid again to get access to iOS 7, so , it's back up.  Warning though, if you set the local settings to be anything but the US, it doesn't handle the localization correctly.  I'm not sure when I'll get around to fixing it!Here's the link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mybitcoins/id539677499?mt=8&uo=4 Very interesting Piotr!  Now I know about the Y2.038K bug  I have a full set of original BitBills (฿1, 5, 10, 20) for sale as a collectors item if anyone is interested!Glad to see you back Doug! Brian Goss Murder isn't the kind of crime that one can choose not press charges on...the state always presses charged for the crime, you can't stop it...but there must be some evidence to charge someone...and it does not require funding to prosecute. I'm confused... The default answer is now ฿0.0001/kb for Bitcoin-qt 0.8.2 and up. But, in reality, miners charge whatever they want. If evil mega-Corp buys a ton of ASICs (or miners collude) and controls nearly all the hashing power....they set the true minimum fee. 0.8.2 Release notes===================Fee Policy changes------------------The default fee for low-priority transactions is lowered from 0.0005 BTC (for each 1,000 bytes in the transaction; an average transaction isabout 500 bytes) to 0.0001 BTC.Payments (transaction outputs) of 0.543 times the minimum relay fee(0.00005430 BTC) are now considered 'non-standard', because storing themcosts the network more than they are worth and spending them will usuallycost their owner more in transaction fees than they are worth.Non-standard transactions are not relayed across the network, are not includedin blocks by most miners, and will not show up in your wallet until they areincluded in a block.The default fee policy can be overridden using the -mintxfee and -minrelaytxfeecommand-line options, but note that we intend to replace the hard-coded feeswith code that automatically calculates and suggests appropriate fees in the0.9 release and note that if you set a fee policy significantly different fromthe rest of the network your transactions may never confirm. I don't see what the OP is talking about. I guess I'm dumb, he he.  I wasted all that time getting degrees in astrophysics, mathematics, engineering, and medicine...just to find out I'm a dummy :-)OP, do give us the big reveal! What do you see that I can't? I'm genuinely interested and darn curious! I think regulatory efforts will be focused on the exchange points. I mean, how else could they do it?  Proof that consults worth paying for don't have to be doctor-patient based... Well, for the most part, they've been rather smart about it. Not that I condone it, but I applaud their technical skill.  You're still holding strongcoin? There's still an exchange rate? I thought I sold the last 1000 strong coins before the main exchange went down. Strong coin seemed purpose built to make that dude money. I'm glad I got out.  Interestingly, DARPA funded some early research on digital payment schemes. Google Payword and Micromint.  This report was old news when it came out, presuming it was created in 1996. There were much more comprehensive reports in the civilian literature by at least 1999. The report mostly covers David Chaum's work on Digicash...which was publicly disclosed and only months away from being purchasable at the bank at that time (you could buy Digicash in 1997 at Mark Twain bank in Missouri)The report lists several protocols, not a single one of which is in any way similar to Bitcoin. I question the OP's true motive given the document.write call and the truly misleading statements that the report is eery similar to Bitcoin. OP, did you read the report? Are you trying to hack visitors? I think the constellation of findings warrants a comment from you.  You're input is needed.  With the current max block size limit, never... I'm sure there are places on earth today like this...bring your own government...but I'm not exactly sure where and I doubt it's a pleasant place.  Good call.  I see it now.  He really should get anti-reflection coating on his glasses. Very intrigued.  I watched it and enjoyed his artful story telling, but, I did not pick up on a subtext (other than he's been having futuristic thoughts for a while).  
An option should be: not now, but someday, of course. I'll presume it is. Sent. https://blockchain.info/address/1DyBBYUKbzeEsgi63XES1bwzS9SYn3aGdaZero fee. Confirmed with 3 block delay (about 31 minutes). Not ideal but certainly not bad for being free.  Is the address in your sig a good one to use? Ask your friend if its possible (_possible_, not probable or definite) that this specimen contains cartilage...I see what I think are a few blue islands...that could be cartilage...there is supposed to be cartilage here... Lol Matthew...I wish it were that easy! anybody know a pathologist?  I need help identifying the types of tissues present on a histopathology slide:This is a sacrococcygeal teratoma and should have two or three embryonic layers present.  The slides are ultra-low resolution (but it's what I got), and I can't for the life of me identify any of the tissues (I need to annotate the slides).  Med students, you're closer to this stuff than I...BTC0.2 bounty if you beat me to it (I'm gonna keep working on it as I presume it is hopeless).   Does the push for eliminating dust raise the desire for off-chain transactions? I should think this would jumpstart off chain efforts. He revealed treason, IMHO.  He will be _accused_ of committing it.  It depends, are you talking about the US Dollar, dollars, bitcoins, or the Bitcoin?Not rocket science, but subtle enough to be missed by some.  He revealed a CRIME in progress.  I thought it interesting how Obama turned Bush-esque and said, even with a sort of stupid look on his face, "No one is listening to your phone calls."  Of course not.. He didn't say, which would have been accurate and more descriptive, "We are recording every one of your phone conversations and, should it prove useful, we can listen to the recording without anyone else knowing about it."He revealed a crime of the highest order: treason.  The NSA was attacking the fundamentals of democracy (which I could explain in great detail at a later time).   for the moment...don't forget, we still are boot strapping.  The purpose is to limit block chain size growth while the network infrastructure matures.   Both noble efforts, IMHO!  Strong work man! July 2010 slashdot article. I CPU mined on my laptop for about a week. Sometimes it worked (http://uofr.net/~bcg/a.jpg).  But the difficulty grew so fast a few days later that I never generated another block... Perhaps the FBI would be better to ask? Maybe I'm naive...but, the CIA can't release anything about Bitcoin? Surely there's plenty that is no secret to anybody...like notes from Gavin's presentation.  http://marc.info/?l=cypherpunks&m=95280154629912&w=2>I wouldn't say ecash has to use blinding, but I would argue it would>be a misuse of the word "ecash", if something which was revocable were>dubbed ecash.>>With that definition it is not technically possible to implement>electronic cash at all without tamper resistant hardware, because>reliance on a mint, or double spend database means your "cash" can>become worthless over night if someone (say a government) decides to>switch off a computer (the one holding the double spending database).There are soem alternatives which would come closer to this definition.One possibility is to make the double-spending database public.  Wheneversomeone receives a coin they broadcast its value.  The DB operates inparallel across a large number of servers so it is intractable to shutit down.The greater danger is that the mint would be taken over and forced tobehave badly, say by issuing too many coins.  This would degrade themoney and make it worthless.Another possible form of ecash could be based on Wei Dai's b-money.This is like hashcash, something which represents a measureable amount ofcomputational work to produce.  It therefore can't be forged.  This couldbe a very robust payment system and is worth pursuing further. Wow...I'm honored to share the forum with you.  I've been looking into the history of digital currency and I have great respect for how clever hashcash is (shouldn't we be using it by now?).  Thank you for providing links to our very poorly understood and under appreciated history.BrianPS -- just read your newbie intro post. Too funny. People like you get white listed upon request around here! Are you sending more than a $1? More than ฿1? There are many tens of billions of XRP...why are people buying them?Full disclosure, I sold the vast majority of mine for ฿2.5. There are like, what, 80 billion XRP? Roughly 8,000 XRP per currently existing bitcoin.  If XRP value as a currency equaled Bitcoin, then I guess it makes sense to buy 35,000 XRP for 2.5 bitcoins. But, XRP isn't a currency really, right? I'll admit to not fully understanding ripple.  I think the IOU idea is very interesting, but skeptical that mixing friends, family, and money will work out well. 
Looks like a complicated transaction...funds in an exchange get dispersed? Tip? Perhaps someone like a post? What intrinsic value does a car key have? It's useful for driving, but intrinsically worthless.  +1. Well played  There have been many attempts in the past at making digital currencies. Bitcoin has a very different validation/double spending prevention/redemption model than anything before it. While I don't think Bitcoin will fail, I do think future modifications to the protocol will determine how likely it is to be widely adopted. So do you mean to have a signed, valid, but not transmitted emergency transaction sending all of your funds to a new address not in your wallet (For which you have a private key stored elsewhere)?This would set up a race condition where whoever gets their transaction into a block first wins.  Since change addresses are precomputed and stored in the wallet, you would need to create an address outside of your wallet carefully.Alternatively, what if they stole the target address private key? Then you would have no way to spend your funds safely. The Bitcoin protocol does have a method of sending funds to an IP address and the computer at the IP address will supply the recipient address... So, in theory, the private/public key pair of the destination address need not be created yet. You could register an account with a large mining pool (who could get your send to IP address transaction in a block quickly) to create the recipient address and store the private key for you and handover the funds when the incoming coins from the addresses you had told them they would come from arrived. I'm putting together a lecture on the pre-history of Bitcoin for the Bitcoin Education Project (btcedproject.org). Digital currency has been heavily researched since the 1980's (including DARPA funded groups). For some background reading, this book is good (start on page 230-ish):http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Trust-and-Risk-in-Internet-Commerce/L-Jean-Camp/e/9780262531979/?itm=7&USRI=l+jean+camp I suppose you could do it socially...ie, only known friends can join the club. But that kind of like centralization in and of itself. How do you validate new users/miners? Consensus is what occurs after you decide on validation parameters...what stops Corporation X from hiring 25,000 stooges? This is the part I find confusing; inputs are different than addresses?  I suppose they must be, by what you're saying.  What if the change address was the same as the sending address?  The answer has got to be no...right?  I mean, I could scan the block chain and look for all repeatable transactions and wreak no small amount of havoc otherwise...That sure would teach folks not to re-use addresses! My apologies if this is the wrong forum.If I send money to Bob using my 1SendtoBobAddressL0r3mIp5umD0lr address and Alice sends me money to that same address, could Bob rebroadcast my raw transaction to get double paid? So, S=n^2/650 It will be interesting to see if this parameter pops up naturally in some equation somewhere.  You could raise any term to any power...why pick the ones you did? Yup, it gets stored. It'll be there when you get back . The recipient address does not need to be anything other than a well formed address. In fact, the recipient address doesn't even have to belong to someone...see 1bitcoineaterhttp://blockexplorer.com/address/1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuEThis vanity address is so long, there is no way someone knows the corresponding private key. Money sent here is just plain old lost.  Limits on the block size, IMHO, should be determined by the market with some temporary fail-safe stuff hard-wired into the code and updated as needed (like our current block chain protecting max block size). If a miner wants no other transactions in a block (and forego the associated transaction fees), so be it. When the block limit has a reason to be set above 1 MB, it'll be up to miners to use that extra space in the block as they see fit.  Is the zero transaction block not an expression of market forces? I mean, if I want to charge high fees, I can artificially limit transactions by mining lots of blank blocks.  You really think so? What sets crypto apart? Is it just the ease of fraud? Definitely bots. I was playing with one last night. I kept putting in top buy bids for ฿20 and it would shortly follow with a small order just a hair above mine. I'd cancel as soon as his started to fill.  Welcome. Your design looks great. The site just got overhauled very recently.A big visual challenge that hasn't been well met, IMHO, is how to graphically depict the block chain...I'm also all for a new Bitcoin logo  
I get this error at least once a week...I'm on a Mac Mini with an internal 2-disk SSD RAiD.  I thought maybe it was on account of the RAID...which would be really weird, but, guess not.  I'm not the only one... Rich dudes putting all their eggs in one basket.  Yes...that's more or less what satoshi suggested. We did just hard fork a few days ago...not sure many noticed   It _can_ be done relatively seamlessly. Rock on! I'm still vetting the history on this, but, I believe the 1 MB limit was originally set arbitrarily as a way of protecting the block chain from attack. It was never intended to be a limit on real economic activity.That said, from a technical perspective, it's easier for the network to deal with 7 tps (transactions per second) than 7000 tps. With the way the block chain is stored now, 7000 tps would make for some rather big blocks and rapid block chain growth. I'm uncertain how much magic can be invented by our mostly unpaid devs to implement the technically challenging pruning and compression that's oft written about (but it's a boat load of work and would cost a fortune in the real world).  Anyhow, I view Bitcoin's value as paralleling the total # of tps. It's a relationship that's held generally true. Those who have bitcoins stand more to gain than those who don't by raising the max block size, IMHO. Those with no or few Bitcoins can make more money by devaluing Bitcoin by limiting the max block size and creating their own Bitcoin-like network for off chain transactions. To me, it's just a question of what do you want to be more valuable, Bitcoin or off-chain-processors. I also believe the limited resource argument is FUD. Miners set the real limit no matter what the max block size is (well, not above it!).  Wow. Thank you for sharing that cultural insight. I'm rather sheltered as an American, and I know I take a fair amount for granted, but wow. I'm surprised how arbitrary the government can be and the people put up with it.  I don't think non-humans or anonymous humans can win the prize.  If you could do this with your coins at the blockchain level, yes, you could have piece of mind...but, telling your exchange you don't intend to withdraw and hoping a malicious hacker also obeys your wishes doesn't seem likely to help  Too many non-movers undermines the point of the conference. You need the right number of the right kind of people for the conference to be a success...and success is not measured in # of attendees or ฿ collected in conference fees. The goal of the Bitcoin Foundation holding the conference is to advance Bitcoin and hopefully not lose money on the event. In fact, if I recall correctly, in the early days there was talk of "hoping to break even." OpenCoin doesn't recommend using XRP as an investment...but that's what they're doing, right? I sold most of my free 35 kXRP for ฿2.5. Perhaps I'll regret that someday, but, OpenCoin won't get rich if we all invest in (and hoard) XRP! Well, donating to people who perform work to continue making Bitcoin would be wise...and in his (and our) self interest.  Good luck getting your $300 back...well, $300 presuming you joined before the ฿ fee grew way put of sync with the $ fee. I just used $ to immediately buy and spend ฿ right after an adjustment, so it cost me the intended low $ amount.  We have a lawyer for the foundation? Oh yeah, that guy. He don't post much.  A testnet mega workout would be helpful.   I'm running a testnet node on consumer level (but decent) hardware on a decent (but home based) internet connection.  Perhaps we could all offer our computers to the devs to run a stress test on testnet?  We could try block sizes of 1-100 mb and see how it goes. The video is really well done. I'm not sure where the tipping point is for the block size to push the little guy out of running a node, but surely it's a lot more than 1MB. I love the idea of off chain transactions. Is it anything more than an idea at this point though? Are all banks registered as money transmitters? It seems to me that a money transmitter should be transmitting money between _different_ people. Real deal.  Ditto. I keep some hot, but not much.  I don't pay fees or wait...try sending ฿1 from an address that hasn't had a transaction in a while. See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees#Technical_info
Wait...you mean the devs need to eat? I thought they just ate code and went around giving gifts to people like Santa Claus all year round...My whole belief system is ruined. I feel your pain Gweedo.  If you're on an iPhone using safari, you have no second search option. The header search isn't there. It stunk using blockchain.info's website on the phone anyway as the search box in the middle of the page moved with each incoming transaction...made it tricky to select! If it rhymes with the month of May, oh, then yes. It's a great place for radiology residency. I did med school in Chicago.  I don't frequently send amounts less than ฿1 around, but, I've never had to pay a transaction fee. I mean, it would be awesome if sending 10¢ could be free (computationally and fee wise), but, the technology simply isn't there yet for that. Thus, the fee. The miners set the fee that they are willing to accept. The nodes bear the storage costs, but they have no say on the fee process. The default relay settings for dust is the only defense of storage costs and we have been trying to make fees so this job. Hopefully dust reduction (combined with fee reduction) will help push the lower limit on ฿ transaction value down a bit and speed up confirms.   I don't see this being a big deal. Merchants take checks which suffer from the confirmation problem, right? The difference with a check is that you know who wrote it. If someone wants to pay with Bitcoins and skip confirmation, then perhaps knowing who they are and where they live would solve the problem? Tulane? Me good idea think have you. I style change now too also. Be hidden so bots not find on me. Actually, my approach is to just be real...and since it's hard to be actually become and remain rich anyway...don't try too hard to be rich. Life is short, enjoy it  Doctors are already very public.  The place they practice is public knowledge by law.  Privacy on this issue is taken away from the physician as a service to the public.  There's just too much fraud going on...I'm not comfortable being anonymous in medicine. This is a very important point.  Anyone can pretend to be anyone online, and there are plenty of stories of some doctors practicing well outside the scope of their training.  Even more confusing, since most specialists have to do at least one year in basic medicine or surgery, we get double listed as specialists and generalists as well.  Anyhow, here's me (I'm in the US):Brian GossNPI: 1427284033https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/NPPESRegistry/NPIRegistrySearch.do?subAction=reset&searchType=indmy email address is my last name, period, first name @ a very large non-profit multi-specialty group practice located in south eastern minnesota (PM me if you can't figure this clue out, but, there are very few world famous clinics with names that might be confused with condiments).  You could do this in fiat too...I still see fraud as a big issue.  Doctors are not immune to committing fraud.  In fact, fraudulent self-referred medical imaging is a major problem in health care (it's technically not a violation of the laws the prohibit self-referral if the imaging equipment is "regular in-office equipment"...such as an urinalysis test strip machine...but, some doctors claim MRI's and PET scanners are not sophisticated pieces of equipment but just routine office stuff; anyhow, medicare bought it hook line and sinker). The problem is the payment processing system for dollars employs very weak authentication and dollars are not intrinsically cryptographically secured. It's sad so many people are exposed to this risk.  Gavin is the only guy paid to make Bitcoin software. The Bitcoin Foundation started in large part to come up with a way to convert Bitcoin from being a hobby project to something one could make a career out of. Some people in the Bitcointalk forum community think it's wrong to pay people for work,  or at least work of this sort (ie, revolutionizing money). Additionally, Gavin changed a config file to protect our network. The new config forces people running a version of Bitcoin software to change settings if they want to open the floodgates of tiny transactions of no economic value. Again, some thought this was wrong. He set the lower limit of transactions worth mining to ฿0.00005340. There is significant harm in permitting cheap access to large volumes of transactions...significant harm that can't be undone in the future.  What kind of Internet connection do you have? I'm running a full node on a refurb low end Mac mini...I can't tell that I'm running it...I do have a 100mbit/s connection, but I think I would do fine with 1/10 that.  Slashdot, 2010. Back when your laptop could do this: I'm a pseudo early adopter...I mined a few hundred ฿ before you needed anything more than last years laptop...but those were short lived days for me. I remember "wasting" like $20 on bitcoinmarket.com when the price rose sharply from less than a penny per coin to like several ¢ per coin. I'm not afraid of the wild success of Bitcoin. There are many far ฿-richer people than I who's holdings are more or less well known...I have no intention of ending up incredibly wealthy. I've got a great career ahead of me that will provide well enough for what I want to get done in life. Bitcoin is a bridge to get me through the rest of residency...not my retirement plan.  This is a very good social observation. I think that mainstream adopters won't think twice about liking Bitcoin on Facebook. So, I agree that the number of likes is a low estimate of total users (although it's higher than I thought it would be...and perhaps many likers are not users), it's probably not a bad estimate of main streamers. We don't seem to have many women on this forum, but I think the female perspective is sorely needed here in general.  I'm a doctor. I can't think of a way Bitcoin can help (other than auto-taxing all transactions to fund health care stuff...but that would be a regulatory option overlaid on Bitcoin, not really Bitcoin itself) Perhaps 100 Satoshi's should be a Fin? But that would collide with a natural SI prefix (micro)...may be 1k Satoshi's = 1 Fin? You're idea is a very good one. Very good when you consider what Mike has done with his Casascius password software (which lets you share a private key that is password protected with a password of your choosing). You should PM Casascius if you are serious about making money with this idea. He's got experience. I'd buy one of these...when my wife and I were married, we got a 3D photo of us engraved in a clear plastic cube. It would work well for provate keys. We were married over 8 years ago, so the technology ain't new.  I can only read one entry on the list: bg002h. Retarded comments like your thoughtless dribble here wastes my time. Since I haven't got much time,  I'm gonna extrapolate and presume you're existence on these forums is not worth my notice. 
I think Hal makes more sense to honor as a unit.  The average user won't be running BitcoinQt (or any full node, most likely). Even if I set my validating node to relay non-economic (non-Bitcoin economic) transactions, it won't matter if it never gets put in a block.  Woohoo. Great idea and thanks! +1Never thought of agree with Gweedo on something though :-) Well that is clever. Two birds with one stone. I'm glad there are people smarter than me thinking this through. I do wish someone would invent anti hysteria cream...perhaps it's just plain old teenager angst run amok, but, people seem to think something more than just "ho-hum" is going on. It's kind of a big yawner (unless you're SD or misinformed)... My understanding is: no, it won't fork. Anyone who wants their mining node to behave like it did yesterday can go ahead and include no value transactions...and non-mining nodes can broadcast such transactions, but, everyone who upgrades won't relay those transactions or attempt to put them in a block.  Me too. I think they could, but, it won't show up in your wallet as a transaction. That makes it the users job to go get the confirmation of loss (as if the lack of a win doesn't make that clear, but, whatever). Alternatively, SD could write their own client or web wallet or anything that monitors for those notifications...but, they haven't. I'm not sure if they're just not so bright, too busy, or they want to push the limits of Bitcoin before some one else more malignant decides to do it.  Ripple? If you want to spend hours and hours curating large sets of addresses containing trivial sums of cash, you're crazy. In fact, it will cost you a bundle to do so, patch or no patch. The dust issue is supposed to be eliminated by transaction fees...but, transaction fees (which IMHO are too high, but that's up to the miners) aren't high enough to make it truly expensive to stuff the block chain with large amounts of tiny transactions (bear in mind that transactions can also carry arbitrary text too). Thus, any jerk with $100 can insert text into the block chain that is illegal is some jurisdictions. I mean, I don't live in a country where the government might kill me because I have a file on my computer that say "to hell with {insert religious figure}," but there probably are Bitcoin users who do. The only people really affected by this patch are those using the blockchain for non-economic purposes (like Satoshi Dice saying, sorry, you lost...that's just transmitting information, nothing of current or relative value exchanges hands). I think a wiser approach (which is being debated by the devs) would be something like tying the dust definition to the size of a transaction fee. Also, they can undo this change in the future, so keep your worthless SD transactions safe...someday you might be able to spend them in an economic manner.  Voted x 61GCDzqmX2Cf513E8NeThNHxiYEivU1Chhe@doctorgoss Why did I unignore? My bad.  I fear more the unintended network split that doesn't get detected quickly by happenstance (we got kinda lucky recently). De-splitting the network is painful and might not always work out as well.  Yup -- royal we without question. That is the normal way to write formal scientific publications.  How about asking theymos for a subforum?  I'm all for us pooling our ideas and resources.  That's a big donation. The Bitcoin foundation fee is considerably less.  This would take some of the pressure off of the max block size limit issue and make it easier for regular people to run validating nodes. This has the disadvantage of merely evolving our banking system rather than revolutionizing it. It also seems hard to me for the bitbanks to have much motivation to provide these services without being able to makeover by lending (hard to lend when price is unstable).  Shameless is right. He sounds much more intelligent and reasonable here: http://rt.com/op-edge/if-bitcoin-exchanges-shut-down-518/ Thanks for posting this. Until I have good reason to do otherwise, this, my first Keiser experience, will also be my last.  Lol. You're going to need a lot more consensus than the foundation could muster for that one!How did the foundation go from being a "hey guys let's pitch in and get Gavin a salary (and generally put our heads together to promote Bitcoin technology)" foundation to a multi billion-dollar conspiracy organization? The privacy policy is an important point. Thank you for mentioning it.  Same with the tax status. Do you hade a back ground in this sort of thing? I think we could use someone who knows something about this. The foundation has a lot of work to do in addition to advancing Bitcoin. But bear in mind, the vast majority of the foundation membrrs are just like the members here...except we paid $30 (about 1/3 if what you would pay to join the Linux foundation). I will put it on the agenda. Many thanks. 
http://blockchain.info/charts/network-deficit There has been a lot of good discussion on this topic over the years.  I'm more interested in the Bitcoin logo...if you look at big companies (or even new ones like BitInstant or bitpay), they're logos are way cooler... Looks like there is a lot of source material to work with.  I'm not exactly sure what historians do with historical data, and preservation is important to be sure, but, there's got to be a lot more to it than that (I confess, I'm woefully undereducated in history and most of the humanities). I'm sure with a community as big as ours, we have folks experienced in this sort of thing. The MNW bet deserves a mention.I think we should have a child board dedicated to preserving our history.  Anyone feel the same? +1000.  Very insightful.   I'm all for honoring Hal Finney (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0). I think 100 Satoshi's or 1 milliBitcoin to be called a Finney or "Fin" would be appropriate.  -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----Version: oPenGP 4.0 on 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=No7E-----END PGP MESSAGE----- We do speak of _the_ Dollar though...For example, one would never say, I'm writing about the history of Dollar  But I agree, we often rephrase things to avoid placing a "the" before Bitcoin ("I'm writing about Bitcoin history," for example).  And we do use Bitcoin to mean something very different from bitcoin or bitcoins.   If a bitcoin is not worth anything, it would take an awful lot of it to pay someone  A valueless bitcoin wouldn't be very useful.Also, the payment processing network of Bitcoin is the "heavy lifting".  If fees generated by the network (in bitcoin) aren't worth anything, then there is no reason to do the heavy lifting.The store of value aspect of Bitcoin is by far computationally easier.  Why mess around with a robust payment network that could generate lots and lots of transactions (and associated fees) when you can just take a bigger percentage fee from the occasional massive value transaction the comes through?  You wouldn't have to buy new hardware to run the network.IMHO, the best path forward for Bitcoin is to be a massive payment processing network where the actual bitcoins being processed are the stored value units.  This whole block reward thing is just to help get us there -- the reward is not most important part -- it's like a government subsidy to pay people to build the processing network. I certainly hope some day there are enough transactions for the fees to be bigger than the current 25BTC block reward.  But, that'll take lots and lots of transactions. You'd need about 400 tx/sec paying 0.0001 BTC to get to 25 BTC in fees...with the current limit of about 7 tx/sec, you'd need a fee of roughly 60x that, about 0.006 BTC, to get there.  That's about $0.60 at current prices and prohibitively expensive for regular folk if Bitcoin were, say, $10,000 each.If Bitcoin were designed to truly replicated the credit card industry, though, the fee would be a fixed percentage of the amount transmitted (like how Visa does it) rather than scaling (piecewise) linearly with the size of the transaction (size as in bytes, not bucks).  I left a review. Well done.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=564.msg5607#msg5607Knightmb. 370kBTC.  Or to a new one you didn't even know existed in your wallet (there are many change addresses pre-computed in your wallet). Some have lost money by not understanding this concept and only having backups of the addresses they knew about. The way these change addresses were pre-computed was changed in bitcoinqt to make this less of a problem.  Bitcoin cares nothing for energy. If computation cost next to nothing in terms of energy, the price of Bitcoin wouldn't go down. Bitcoin is useful because it has a payment network attached to a mint and a bank and the equivalent of a secret service agent validating that every transaction is not counterfeit. The more computational power securing this whole process, the better, regardless of the electric bill.  Zero-coin type anonymity. A Bitcoin network that can handle huge transaction volumes (think 1000x more transaction volumes than we do now). We will need a good pruning and many high speed validating nodes.  There are at least 100 good stories. Probably 1000. Here are some events at random (kids screaming): Satoshi's cypher punk release post. Hal Finney's receiving the first transaction (which he wrote about here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0). MyBitcoins.com. 10kBTC pizza. Knightsmb making people crap their pants with his screen shot. Zhou tong. Pirate. Glbse. BitBills.com. Mike Caldwell Casascius coins, including the typo. The slashdottings. June 2011. There are so so many more.  Strong work all. We have a good community. Glad your coins are safe. Now you've got a good story to tell...a story with a lesson too! I made the same mistake in my early days.  I have friends. I'm too lazy to make a shadow account. I'm a busy fella. I don't always need great privacy.  I think I understand you now. Leys sau you took all the cash from your pocket and spent $1780 on 20 coins($89/coin), waited, and then sold 10 coins at $116/coin and put that money in your pocket. You're wondering how much money is in your pocket now compared to when you started, right?You have $1160 in your pocket now.  You used to have $620 more than that in your pocket. Equivalently, you could look at it as having bought 10 Bitcoins at $62. The 20% capital gains would be on 270 bucks, or a whopping $54 tax bill.  It needs none of that. But, if you're lazy, that's the easiest thing to do. It's what I did. I'm lazy.  I think it's a terrible investment. Real businesses don't take your money until they ship. Anything else is unwise. That said, if you get your ASIC by July (read October) many others will have theirs before you, making it not worth it. Oh, the title of your thread is rather perplexing. It makes no sense. 
Bingo. It's kinda the most important part...and I don't understand why so many "words" (commands) are needed... Definitely worth the $10 you were initially charging, judging from watching about 45 minutes of a few lectures.  Great intro. Appropriate depth. Strong work.  The blockchain.info app for iPhone is your only choice (non-jailbreak). There used to be a full node app, but Apple took it away. I believe a copy of your money is stored both on the device and on the web, but, nobody has an unencrypted copy, not even on your phone. It's as secure as you're gonna get. They offer two-factor authentication for their web site too. It's not security perfection, but, it's good enough for me. I've used blockchain.infomon and off for a while. I've trusted them with 100-200 bitcoins or so with no issues.  Bitaddress.org works for me Your skills are pretty cool! Neat secure EMP safe DIY solution.  If I understand it correctly, you bought and sold 10 BTC simultaneously at $116. Hence, you did nothing other than realize a profit (taxable event just about anywhere). I guess I'm not clear on your purchases and sells. You would pay tax on the 10 btc x (116-89) Clever idea. Good luck. I'm still unclear how scripting works...perhaps the anatomy of a transaction in script would be helpful... Sounds like you just create a taxable event, but don't have anything left to cover your tax obligation.  Oh. You're right. PM me your address.  That is an inflation rate of 50% per year at 1 year.  Or at least profitable Who knows, maybe they'll ask you to use an address they control. ..and they'll pass along the remainder. The accounting would be transparent at least (unlike the current system where ya gotta trust their numbers).  I just ordered one of the java rings. I like the nostalgia. I've gotta get my hands on a reader now! I'd love to hack it to type my password...I should be presenting a hardware & software hack / kludge I made to turn an iPhone in to a dictaphone and pointing device for radiologists at the RSNA.org 2013 meeting (abstract submitted). How cool would it be to incorporate the ring in authentication? Anyhow, Mike's ideas clearly have legs. Physical implementation of encrypted communication seems so natural and so obvious, how could it not happen? Why shouldn't it start (anew) with us? I'm slightly handy with a soldering gun, arduino, teensy, java, c, obj c, etc (but crypto unskilled, despite my training in math)...And I've got more money now than a radiology resident ever has.  I'm game.  Wow...even in translation his thoughts are very lucid and very insightful.  The comment on Bitcoin likely to cause a constraining of credit growth is something I hadn't thought about, but, I think in 10 years, we might all find out he was spot on.  Time for me to read up on this guy...In case anyone is interested, he wrote a series of books (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_Wars).  These are controversial but suggest private influence in governmental financial policies.  No wiki article on the man himself though. If we say there are 10,000 words and a password will be 4 words...that is 1E16 combinations. If we have 26 uppercase, 26 lower case, 10 numbers and 10 symbols, then a 9 char passwords has 72^9= 5E16 combinations. So, a good 9 char password (really hard to memorize) is as decent a password as a 4 word pass phrase. That sound right? Righ. So it's not clear to me that only paying a 20% capital gains tax isn't still tax fraud. I mean, if I sold my old gym shoes for $10000, would I pay capital gains on that or regular income tax (which could be much more or much less)? +1000. But that's not the official response from the foundation of which I am a member.  Yup, just a member...states so very clearly in my avatar. Sorry you missed it. But, I am a member that thinks asking certain questions that are intrinsically silly can be ill intentioned and do not deserve a reply. For example, a question like "I heard you enjoy doing {insert universally disdainful act}, is that true?"I don't think that's worth a spot on the agenda.  Yes. Duh. Next.  Lol.  Hard to be the richest person on earth if all you own are Bitcoins...even f you owned all of them and could sell each one at current trading prices  Let me be direct: your concerns amount to hysterics. Nobody on the foundation wants to (or could) change the rules of Bitcoin. I'm not interested in having hysterics in a foundation that tries to get real work (the kind of work worth paying for) accomplished. Please start your own foundation to pay for stuff. I suggest you use a name that sounds less like Foundation and more like "club" or "well-wishers." This way you'll find it easier to keep the feeble minded from thinking you are evil. Oh, don't charge more than $30 entrance fee and update your btc based fee each week if necessary to keep the fiat cost low (instead of once chabging it once a year...or forget using that whole Bitcoin thing for actually receiving payments, it's too unstable to be useful...please note this is sarcasm).  Weird idea ya got there. Your emailing the secretary will not get a reply. You need to ask (or become) a member to get items on the agenda. I would not support wasting time on the obvious and will not suggest it as an agenda item...your concerns are unrealistic. I don't want to set a precedent of having to reply to every wild accusation to appease people who aren't even paying to advance Bitcoin. 
Not sure I'd care... I think he intended to become rich. I think he intended to remain anonymous to make it easier for people to forget that advancing Bitcoin makes him richer. In fact, all future Bitcoin users are what speculators are banking on for profit. It's not that different from a Ponzi scheme...but it's not technically a Ponzi scheme (Or, it's no more a Ponzi scheme than fiat).  I suggest a sister poll: I can vote because I'm a Foundation member: y/n How much money have you spent compensating people to work on the protocol? If you did pay to make something Bitcoin related better for us all, I would thank you rather than mock your efforts.  I think you meant to post this 4/1/2013  Doesn't look like the market jumped up there for ya... Cough...Bitcoin Foundation...cough...Something to think about....Bitcoin is worth paying for. And it's worth paying to make it better.  We want the miners to make lots of profit...they are securing the network and we want the network to be worth securing.  Not a good idea for currency. See Freicoin...demurrage currency ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency) )Another bad but similar idea: How about a coin that knows who owns it? This way, coins can redistribute themselves from rich people to poor people each week...and currency ownership taxes can be paid automatically every hour! I bought some at $66. Price nearly doubled. Dropped down to about $100....kind of a crazy ride.  These are just growing pains Charlie.  Eat well.  Sleep when you can.  This too shall pass.  Thank you for what you do for the community.   Ever import a private key to MtGox?  I'm not sure what happens if you re-load a previously imported private key... Open source programming isn't worth paying for? If you are likening yourself to a slave, what work were you forced to do? Have you quit you job to work on Bitcoin? Did your wife approve? Did you worry about saving for your daughters college fund...her wedding...your retirement?Real people with real lives and real talent need more than "heart" to make life happen.  No. My contention is that these guys made you money. Without them, you would have less. Don't forget, the main goal of the foundation is to pay the devs. The Foundation has no authority. It's basically setup to take handouts and give them to clever people who otherwise could not afford to quit their jobs to work on Bitcoin. I doubt any of us realize how many nights, weekends, and vacations have been spent on making the protocol actually work. For free. That's why there is a foundation.  This sounds childish. The foundation has zero authority. Zero. As in none. The foundation exists to get money from lots of people and give it to few people so they can make Bitcoin better. It's rather simple. Supporting the foundation is supporting Bitcoin, not some authority. If you are like nearly everyone on this forum, you either never contributed code to Bitcoin or you were never paid for whatever it is you have done to advance Bitcoin. Consequently, very few people have dedicated their careers to the Bitcoin protocol  We can't keep hoping that the important work on Bitcoin keeps getting done for free (or quickly...during someone else's nights, weekends, and vacations).  And you worry about authority? Yes, board members decide how the donations are spent. If you don't like that, all you can do is to be a part of changing it. But you can't do that from the outside.  I've had several attacks on my Mac mini...not sure if any were successful, but, my Bitcoin funds in my encrypted wallet were just fine. There are some very important security issues to figure out with Bitcoin. Ideally, clients would be able to employ physical keys that would make an eaves dropper with complete access to all the files on your computer and able to record every keysteoke unable to steal your coins.  Don't be silly. These are the people that are making your Bitcoins worth something.  I'm no advisor, but, seems like the price stability points to people who have been holding coins more or less dormant are starting to sell. Might take a while for things to move up again.  I tell them I don't need to worry about money until after residency. And if bitcoin really takes off, maybe several dozen more years after that. 
Lol. Great analogy. No, they shouldn't diversify in pacman pellets. Our pellets are risky. They should dabble in pellets like most of the rest of us.  Don't listen to people in this thread. When Casascius released his first version of his coins, he had a typo, and people who contribute nothing to the advancement of Bitcoin were really harsh. Screw the freeloaders. Give it a go.  See what happens.  Of course no one can cite an instance of audit caused by suspicious IRS filings related to Bitcoin. I should have said (for the statistically impaired): I strongly suspect that anyone who writes "Bitcoin trading" on their tax return is going to markedly increase their odds of being audited.  I'm in OP! Go for it! I should bring back my iOS program for monitoring Bitcoin addresses. With the btc price increases, I can afford it now.  Paying taxes on bitcoin is likely to raise flags. Once they know what you're involved with Bitcoin, they're gonna presume you're underreporting and audit you. I think I would file this under "duh," and I'm not sure it's worthy of a thread on the main discussion. I think an appropriate time to wait for a response from Mike would have been 1 month.Poor form aside, do recognize that it is not trivial to counterfeit these. But, like anything, of course it could be counterfeit.  I'm not aware of these generally circulating though.  They're more of portable piggy banks to be used amongst trusted parties. Yes. That's why inventors don't get Nobel prizes It's a prize for science, not assembly.  Google Adsense? Which time zone? No. While clever, there is no new science in Bitcoin. He just put well tested ideas together.  Many computers get infected with malware. Most computers don't have cash that you can make a copy of either though. It doesn't take much thought or effort to find examples of decidedly not dumb people losing Bitcoin. Bitcoin will redefine "bank," not eliminate them.  ZOMG That pic is soooo cute!!!!1!!I think that's about all we will get if we keep ourselves in the mentality of DIY instead of finding someone awesome and compensating them for giving it their all.  My point exactly. I'm sure Coca-Cola did the same thing.  We have a big DIY culture here...but few truly skilled at design. $50k for a logo (and fonts) is not crazy. Back when we tried raising funds for a Bitcoin logo, the roughly 40 BTC bounty didn't get us very far. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91068.0This was IMHO the best idea:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91068.msg1063106#msg1063106There was lots of this kind of stuff:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91068.msg1069054#msg1069054 +1This is a great response.... It is best to emphasize this idea...Bitcoin is backed by the only person who can take yours away: you.  The most amazing thing is not the flag (no, it is definitely not), but that bitflag.org exists. Maybe you should erase that flag and instead put up an email address or an online vote system where the most talented bitcoin designers would submit to you the flag of the day. Maybe only people from bitcointalk.org would be able to post to bitflag.org to make sure things get a little bit tunneled?[/quote]That'd be a great idea. Do a contest and let's decide on a "official" bitcoin flag.[/quote]I think it's great that people are thinking about a flag. I hope someday we get one...also hope we someday get a logo that doesn't suck so much. We need a graphic artist to overhaul everything Bitcoin so we can stop looking like little school children with a papier mâché volcano.  Reported and ignored. Thx Maria.  +1000. Coolest teacher of the year award.  I would say: "You're right, Bitcoin is backed by no government ( just a bunch of regular folk running validating nodes (like me), enterprising miners securing the network, intrepid business owners adapting the technology and increasing acceptance, and clever devs creating the technological basis for our future money)....dont forget, Bitcoin is not exposed to incredbly large sovereign debt burdens or central bank mismanagement risks either." 4010004010704410479be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f817 98483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10dOic. Not. Context please?
No. And it's not that uncommon either.  It would be nice if miners broadcast their hash power, transaction fee and maximum block size settings...it would be cool if clients could aggregate the info and present an estimate of time to confirmation vs transaction fee.  Did anyone look back at the 6/11 crash? I think these curves lag the crash considerably.  I'm gonna buy $20 million in ASIC hardware. If you want to be in my block, you better pony up...or be willing to wait a week or two  I intend to cash out before then....but, I don't think it's paranoia! My opinion is that you are thinking pragmatically.  It will probably happen in a country where personal property and freedom isn't highly respected by the government...but I doubt the US will be immune.  I just hope I can squeeze a transaction into the (possibly perpetually full) block chain without loosing my shirt.   That's good to know.  It's still a fledgling organization itself, so to draw on the resources of the greater business community is wise. I put a suggestion on a btf meeting agenda to consider hiring someone to teach public speaking, communication, etc. I'm not certain if it was discussed (it's not like they are set up like a hard core committee with minutes and what not), but I didn't get the idea that anyone on the board was keen on being groomed as "the PR guy."In time BTF will have a pr person I'm sure. And a decent logo. And font set. And color scheme...etc...just like all big organizations.  Since a lot of people have their client set to show xxx.xx mBTC, I move to make 0.01 mBTC (aka, the millibitcent, 10^-5 BTC, 10 uBTC, etc) the Finney. So at $100 per BTC, a Fin will be worth 0.1 pennies. At $1,000, a penny, at $10,000, a dime. The Finney (thus defined) has a reasonable token amount associated with it over a broad range of exchange rates.  That trick works on easywallet too. Hope you're as rich as I am.  Is this sarcasm? http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD_depth.htmlSelling 1 kBTC would yield an average price of 78.62 at the moment. The drop in price this would cause is hard to determine as the price fluctuates faster than I can type on my iPhone. The highest ask price was 78.55 at the time I ran the test order of 1000 btc., so I think the market can handle that sum easily.  Lets suppose I'm a big receiver of Bitcoin (like Bitpay). Lets say I'm really a big business with 100 transactions per second. Could I receive private keys instead of having my customers try to squeeze their transactions into the block chain and then construct one transaction with many private keys and "change return" public addresses from my customers to transfer the coins to my address and dispense change to each customer?Is there any advantage to this approach in terms of block size limit (presumably a limit on data size, not #of transactions, but I'm uncertain) or fees? Or is this just a hard/risky/generally pointless approach? Uhhh...no. The p value of 0.05 means the probability of the study results occurring due to random sampling error is 1 in 20. It doesn't mean the result is true...and when p=0.1, the result may be true but the probability it's due to chance is double that of the 0.05 cut off.  It's called inflation. It's meant to help people want to spend their coins.  I would file this under "duh."  Defaults = trivial thing to make your transaction go through reasonably quickly and are, by default, meant to help the novice.  Yes...you have defined a commonly used scheme for laundering money. If someone hands you cash and asks you to drive it somewhere and drop it off, you are acting as a money transmitter...if the amount is small, you'll never be prosecuted.  Some what ifs:If all the Bitcoin now in existence (11 million) were of equal value to the annual world wide gold production (2.7 kt...about 2.7x10^9 grams{Wikipedia}...$50 / gram), then BTC1 would be worth $12,000.If this years production of Bitcoin (btc inflation rate is about 10% now...25*6*24*365=1.3E6) were to equal 1 yr gold production (gold inflation rate is about 1.5% btw), then 11E6/1.3E6~=10....so, 1 Bitcoin would be worth $120,000.If all the Bitcoins that will ever exist equaled all the gold ever mined (about $10 trillion), 10E12/21E6=$500,000/btc. If you add in silver and platinum...you get the idea So, yeah, BTC21 is a lot. Maybe I should hit up dailybitcoins.org...their 1/100 of a mBTC payout might someday be worth $5  This is wise. +1.  Wow. As a physician, I am humbled by your adaptive capabilities. I think most of us, myself included, use much lamer excuses for not getting stuff done. Thank you.  FinCen doesn't make Bitcoin legal or illegal...they just recognize that Bitcoin works as money and they want everyone to know that financial cimes with this type of money is under their jurisdiction...just like if the beaureau of tobacco, alcohol, and firearms declared laser pointers to be firearms...this doesn't make laser pointers legal or illegal...and it doesn't imply that other government agencies can't regulate laser pointers or declare their possession or production illegal. 
Required is unarguably the appropriate term. If you don't upgrade, you're technically not running Bitcoin anymore (and may end up on your own split chain). Required doesn't mean you must...it means you must if you want to run Bitcoin. Recommended would imply if you do nothing you'll still be running Bitcoin.   I highly doubt it breaks any law in China; their economy has done very well with variations on that theme. I mailed a BTC1 BitBill note to this guy named Luke a few years ago...what a stupid investment...all he ever did was save the block chain...pfff!Oh, yeah, and start that verifiable mining pool.  Bingo. I agree.  This experiment is still in progress.  A true protocol it is not.  Is that the goal? Yes.  But we need to survive until we get there.  The 1.0 release will be very interesting...hopefully it won't come too soon.  We can't have oopsy network splits in 1.0.   It's not the miners who make the call in the max_block_size issue, right?  I mean, all the miners could gang up and say: "we're not going to process blocks with more than 2 transactions," if they wanted too.  It's the validating nodes that make the call as far as what will be a valid block.  If all the nodes ganged up, they could change the limit as well.  I think miners should keep their own market determined limit on transactions.  If I was a big pool, I'd make people pay for access to my speedy blocks.  They're being nice processing no fee tx's as it is. Are we still vulnerable to a network split?  I mean, surely a very similar block to the one that caused all the problems will pop up again shortly... OP: you're right. But I think you miss the point of the Bitcoin project: to create a decentralized payment processing network. Your observation would be better put: "we're not done yet!" Exactly...there Isn't much money available if someone tried to sell millions of coins all at once...certainly not $500 million! We can't all sell our cons at once and all of us make "money." Idealistic thinking meets practicality...I think an unintended network split would have been foolish to just let happen...making two weaker Bitcoin networks is in no ones best interest. This wasn't a fork per se, all transactions were broadcast to both halves of the split network. Not many transactions would've been "reversed". Most transactions were on both chains anyway. As I understand it, the balance of hash rate on each network was about equal...thus the split network could have persisted for a very long time....increasing the possibility of more transactions becoming reversible. It's probably a still possible attack method on the network. What fraction of the first n Bitcoins ever created have been spent?  I would presume the first 1 million or so belong to Satoshi. I thinkHe was likely smart enough to periodically mix them though.  Exactly. There's not much money on Gox.  There only like 5 million bucks on MtGox.  Good thing someone honest was the cause of the double spend... Quoted for posterity. Hats off to you gents! I love this guy. Luke -- perhaps this is a good strategy for miners to adopt. Perhaps someone should pay you (the Foundation?) to keep running like this to catch bugs quickly.  The typical scenario for having knowledge of the presented paper but no published reference to it is having the meeting program (given to attendees). You cite that way before the proceeding are published (which is some time after the meeting).  But if someone's put it out publicly and not cited it as "in the proceedings of..." it's gonna get propagated that way. It would be nice to at least look at the proceedings from the meeting though.  That's interesting. That bibtex is incorrectly formatted to begin with. If that's the way it's publicly available, yeah I agree it's a waste of time. It's very odd to not see page numbers in the reference. That reference doesn't actually tell you where to find the abstract. Lol...you're joking, right?  That's how you write in nerd speak. This absolutely in no way implies more than one person wrote it. There are many subtleties to true nerd culture...it takes one to know one indeed!For remedial reading, see: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_plural From Satoshi's white paper reference section #2:H. Massias, X.S. Avila, and J.-J. Quisquater, "Design of a secure timestamping service with minimaltrust requirements," In 20th Symposium on Information Theory in the Benelux, May 1999.This is an unusual Citation format. It's more common to cite the proceedings of the meeting (which are published after the meeting) rather than the meeting itself. To me this implies that Satoshi was at this meeting, most likely as a presenter or because the meeting was held nearby to his academic institution, and he kept his copy of the meeting program.  There's no way there was a zillion people at this meeting. I suspect one could, with minimal difficulty, compile a short list of names of people who were at the symposium.  Satoshi's name would be on that list. To answer the Q in your thread title: No. How long have you known Dashjr? 
http://www.dailydot.com/news/bitcoin-bitinstant-12000-stolen-heist-hack/ I concur. Great to be back! Funny you should mention Amazin and pizza...you're wrong in each point by the way. You can buy pizza with Bitcoin and BitPay just figured out how to provide service for sellers with goods in an amazon warehouse. You should try reading the first page of threads in the main forum (this one). You might learn something that will help assuage your fears.  Nice selection. Very relevant (unlike the following poser).  Oh. My bad. I thought the crash had to do with a very large number of sell orders. Mods -- lock and move please.  Great while it lasted! The OP makes a good point. I think I need a plan. Ya never know, my stash might be very valuable someday. It would be a shame to have it lost with my brain.  Perhaps this thread should be in the meta forum, but I think that we should have a Dev tag for those who have made code contributions to BitcoinQt. I was browsing the test site http://174.142.20.146/en/development and I noticed the names of several people that had made commits to the code repository...and I had no idea. It's one thing to toil without compensation, but a whole different thing to toil in obscurity. We should celebrate their talent and efforts...thoughts? He never took money during the bet...no one even had to prove they had the number of BTC (or XBT I guess) they were betting (I suppose some betters pulled a Matthew in that respect as well, but we will never know).  rHjzYmzfj1ArvmxcVJgKZSSCgoqt8VJrmo Thanks! I'll put you in my contacts...and then...we'll see what I can do! rHjzYmzfj1ArvmxcVJgKZSSCgoqt8VJrmoI'm in!I'm also willing to run a server to support the network when ready.I can't follow directions...doh! I'm new to ripple...what's this about a bot?rHjzYmzfj1ArvmxcVJgKZSSCgoqt8VJrmo I would consider running two nodes...one for the slow Bitcoin with tiny block chain and one for world dominating megachain Bitcoin...there may be a use for each type of Bitcoin.   There is a thread on summing up all known inaccessible coins...if memory serves me correctly, the sum was roughly on the order of 100,000.  The OP's idea is well thought out...but is this a good idea? I mean, recreating banks? Seriously? What the hell happened to revolutionary ideas? Now people want to recreate banks? What about replacing the financial infrastructure? Why are we talking about supplementing B&M banks with their digital equivalent? I will never support an artificial code based highly restrictive limit on the Bitcoin economy. I argue the miners will by far be the most screwed if the limit does not increase; if the limit never increases, then once the limit is reached, there's no reason for new users to join.   ...if the bitcoin rules don't change, Bitcoin will be renamed to UselesslySlowCoin, and all the dolts thinking they're gonna cash in on transaction fees for UselesslySlowCoin will realize they have killed their cash cow via artificial scarcity...So much for the revolutionary thinking that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin...I feel rather harsh disdain for those who wish to kill society's chance at having an open and robust payment network that can actually replace banks because they think they scan squeeze a few more dollars out of someone. A limit of 7 transactions per second will mean BITCOIN WILL NEVER REPLACE BANKS!  In fact, it will never replace PayPal. A good rough answer to that question would at least be what has historically happened to other currencies that have become worthless. Exactly. The miner with the most hash power could charge a larger transaction fee for faster processing than the other miners. A smart miner would never forward transactions that included a large transaction fee To other nodes, so that they can earn the transaction fee when they finally find a block... I think trying to capitalize too early on transaction fees is just stupid. That's why we have The block reward for so many years. Don't forget, miners can force a smaller limit if they so choose. Thus, if the biggest miner has a large hash power, they may only include a few transactions in each of their blocks to increase fee they can charge. The actual trading occurs at the exchange...not on the block chain. People might have trouble getting Bitcoin into their accounts, but, that's about it. I'm not in favor of an unspendable Bitcoin. Why not set the limit to 1 transaction per second? Or 1/10 that? Will that make Bitcoin better or stabilize the price? 
I think the price of Bitcoin will drop like a hot potato as soon as people can't spend them Due to the low transaction limit. There's absolutely no question that the transaction limit will go up , because Bitcoin will become practically worthless If people can never spend them At a reasonable cost and miners will Miss out on getting Small fees from many many many many more transactions. I wouldn't take it as a given that more transactions per block would mean fewer fees. If the network could've been processing 2000 transactions per second instead of seven, I bet the miners would make more In fees. If Bitcoin does fork, does that mean we would all have coins on two Bitcoin networks?You can imagine there being multiple different Bitcoin networks each with a higher number of transactions per second, and An associated exchange rate between them.  The current limit is to protect against transaction spam...at least According to the wiki. I don't think the intent was ever to leave the block size at seven transactions per second. Compared to approximately 10,000 transactions per second For a real payment processing network, seven is slightly anemic. We can't expect Bitcoin to be of any significant value if we limited to only seven transactions per second. If you want to hit 12 btc in fees per block, you're gonna need a lot of transactions...big transactionsDon't happen that often. You will need to _raise_ the limit to increase total fees... Miners will want to increase the block size eventually...false short supply of transaction space in a block might temporarily increase the fee paid per transaction...but a block chain that can't support many transactions won't be very useful...so people won't use it...whereas a high block limit would increase the total number of fee payers (and probably decrease the mega fees paid by a very small number of people).  If I understand correctly, one's ID number is derived from their location history. This should be unique as no two people travel the same places simultaneously...even people holding hands or driving in the same car don't share the exact same path.More simply though, no two people ever share the same space at the same time (with exceedingly rare biological exception). I suppose since there is no way to pinpoint location with great precision, having multiple rough estimates of position over a period of time is used to resolve ambiguities. I think my iPhone does this  I think the partly told backstory of why using the established channels is horrendously inconvenient was underplayed. This is precisely the application of Bitcoin that's gonna change the world.  The submit button wont respond to tapping. Probably no surprise, but, it doesn't work on iOS.  Uhhh....yeah....welcome to Bitcoin and to the forums. I'm afraid the rest is gonna hurt... I have a guess as to where he was on a particular weekend last millennium... Your kids doing well with this still? Have you paid them in a fixed btc or fixed usd amount? If the Number of coins per week decreased over time, how did they respond to that? If they noted value of their allowance going up with time, how do they respond to that? This might be off topic. My apologies. We know the time of Satoshi's posts, right? With different sets of assumptions, this time distribution could be used to generate a set of activity profiles...ie, if we assume he posts during evening hours most often, and didn't move frequently, his post time stamps suggest his time zone was... I'm a huge proponent of electronic freedom...but I will likely ways own an apple phone. Why?It works. It works well and doesn't require me spending time to make it work well. If I really need freedom on it, I jail break it until they come out with new features on the sanctioned platform. Right now, I have blockchain.info app on my phone. If they take it away, I'll give it back to myself via jail breaking. I'd jailbreak 10 times before buying a non-apple phone. That's not to say I'm happy about their self- interested policing of the App Store. But having a a non-vetted crap store is worse than useless to me.  It would be a non-starter. Amazing isn't going to use Bitcoin as a tax evasion mechanism. It's a real company.  I believe the terms were something  like "I'll double the money you didn't send me or accept a scammer tag". He met the terms...he took the tag.  Bingo...at least one bitcoin wallet is not forbidden...and works quite well!  I'm guessing he won't pay everyone. I'll bet 100 million billion trillion Bitcoins. Any takers? Uhhh....no it's not. http://blockchain.info/address/1HB9mgo3cdqBoC3jPemDpD8TPHFxcuQ8ADThe OP isn't foolishly claiming the numbers he is listing are the total amounts owned by each user. That's just silly. Everyone knows that. You could also look at this as a "who in bitcoin land chose to make their balances known" exercise. My estimate is roughly correct and since it's never gonna make me ridiculously wealthy, I'm not all that concerned about who knows. If it does make me crazy wealthy...well...I guess people will know that. 
It's been a long time since I've run the satoshi client...I got a mac mini to keep one computer in the house always up and running (and connected via ethernet), so I decided to run a node for the network (might see if it should support testnet though).  Anyhow, I have a somewhat fast internet connection (100 mbits/s) and the initial download wasn't so bad...after I opened the port settings.  Total download time ~12 hrs.  Not ideal, but, not catastrophic.  I'm trying multibit now...it's instantaneous....I'm pretty impressed!Addendum:  spoke too soon...I'm still downloading the blockchain on my satoshi client.  The download goes really fast initially...then, not so much! I think everyone realizes this...but, no other analysis is possible using publicly available data.   That's very interesting. I guess I'm not super surprised at the distribution. Could you plot registration date on the forum against #btc received? I'd be curious.Also, plot the cumulative % of the total btc own by forum members by rank (ie, the richest dude owns 12%, the top 2 own 20%, the top 3 own 26%, etc... I expect governments will still require paper accounting in fiat...they don't want you buying a house for 10K Bitcoins and selling it 10 yrs later for fiat profit at 1 K Bitcoins...they'd never get taxes from you... Hahah...I found 4 blocks in one night on my laptop CPU...man have things changed. If only I had found Bitcoin sooner...it was literally a week later that CPU mining went kaput... Wow. That's pretty clever! Now reputation of the escrow agent matters most, rather than clunky eBay feedback systems. Nicely done! Strong work! What is the probability of coming up with a valid Bitcoin address if the appropriate number of characters are selected from the appropriate sample space? Is it very unlikely to randomly guess a valid address? I originally had two full sets. I opened one and redeemed them on mt Gox without a problem. The other set checks out fine when querying the addresses. He (Doug) did disappear suddenly. I think he lost a fair chunk of change. Not sure why he never came back. Perhaps he feared some legal issues? I never heard anyone have trouble with a BitBill...but I'm not sure how's my were ever made. It was kinda short lived.  Still seems like a good idea, but I think Casascius coins work pretty well too. Anyhow, I'm glad to have this bit of Bitcoin history.  Bump...any news? Perhaps Trendon should take his story to Hollywood....I'd watch that movie! +1These examples make teen investing sound wise... Dude, that's clever! It's pretty slick.  Lol! In other words, "that's exactly what I said...but different." He he  I'll just cross-post...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=136882.msg1469461#msg1469461MNW...if you feel the need to pay me for the silly bet, do so by continuing to find ways to advance Bitcoin...and follow through with it. I think you've got talent somewhere inside your noggin.  Yes. I support the agenda that pays smart people to make stuff for me...as opposed to hoping someone will keep doing it for free.  Privileges? None really. You get to participate in setting the foundation agenda.  Matthew,You made a silly bet out of ignorance and a horrible understanding of mathematics. Greater stupidity made you extend the bet beyond your means of payment. Even more stupidity made others take financial risks they could ill afford on the good faith and credit of some guy they don't know who sucks at math. A sincere apology is a appropriate...but, there are plenty of people who took part in making your silly unbelievable bet go way overboard. Heck, half of us on here were part of the pirate scam...taking money from hopeful "investors" under the false pretenses of thinking this pirate guy found a way to make Ponzi level returns without running a ponzi. Even Theymos proudly took pirate money. I'm not saying what you did was right. It wasn't. But don't forget many people didn't _want_ to believe they were scammed by a guy named pirate (that sounds so silly!) and others didn't _want_ your bet to be fake...At some point the grown ups need to step in and tell the children to grow up.I wouldn't try too hard to make amends. I mean, heck, you could have outright stolen coins and faced no consequence (not that that would make it right). Did Trendon ever go to prison? Get arrested? Get more than some phone calls? Someone please tell me the identified thief was prosecuted!For the record, I vote to keep the scammer tag. Only because Matthew was bad enough at math to believe that he might actually have stood to gain and he had no intention of losing...it was a statistical scam.  As just one Bitcoin Foundation member, I certainly can not speak for the whole organization, but, a big part of this organization to to pool funds to actually pay people to get stuff done. Bitcoin has become something more than a hobby experiment...and we can't keep relying on the good will of smart people to keep the gravy train rolling, so to speak. People tend to think of Bitcoin as this huge thing, almost as if there were no people behind it...in fact, it's a very small group that actually develop code for the protocol. A measly few BTC membership fee, which one could easily spend on dinner and a movie, is a small price to pay to buy programmers to help make your remaining btc worth more.  Very cool. How about a micro u symbol (easy to type on Mac)?
For a split second, I thought this post was stupid. Then I realized the ingenuity in the comparison. HTML and Bitcoin are valuable because they are useful if people agree to use them...otherwise, they're not.  15 min down per day sounds reasonable...with all maintenance extending this downtime as necessary. 1 day off per month. 1 weekend off every 6 months for big upgrades.  Necro warning!Any way to check the value on these cards anymore? The verify code wasn't the best idea...simply putting the address on the card would have made it simpler on you guys. I've bought two full sets of BitBills, Casascius coins, and a lovebitcoins.org Bitcoin gift card. Good job retep. Professionally handled too.  Color is one dimension you could build a scheme out of....I mean, as long as you're inventing an organizational scheme to physically represent a non-physical concept, why not vary the size and shape as well? Maybe have "Reeded" edges like real coins...I still feel using SI prefixes is the best approach...it's just not as familiar to us Americans because we (like Liberia and Burma) don't use the metric system. I don't think the ROW will see this as big of a problem as our axis of non-metrication fellows might.  Works for me...2 factor auth. They deposit to your bank to verify.  Ftfy The reference client is not intended to be the dominant client used by regular people...it is intended to show others how to implement the protocol in their own clients. While there are major improvements needed in the protocol to help make a better general purpose client, this is a separate issue. Things like import /export of private keys is important in non-reference clients...whereas über long downloads are an issue with the protocol (and hence solutions should first be implemented in the reference client).  Wish I had the fiat back then! Anyone interested in a full set of BitBills? BTC1, 5, 10, and 20 notes. These were the first Bitcoin bills...before bitaddress.org or Casascius coins, there were BitBills! This is your chance to own some early Bitcoin history!Pm me if interested. Payment in BTC only.  While I'm a Christian, I think I'm going to start giving gelt to my kids...it's a good way to teach them about money...now I have a good reason (for me) to use Casascius'/bitaddress.org's bill printer thing...Thanks for sharing this interesting bit of culture! ...yes, iOS is for the rich and/or the busy...I like telling Siri to put X on my shopping list and it auto syncing to my wife's phone...or everything just showing up on my new iPhone after upgrading...or apps and books purchased on one device just showing up on another...perhaps other platforms can do all this, I dunno...but ease of use is my excuse for participating in a system I don't ideologically agree with.  3 kids, resident physician (some weeks are equivalent to 2 full time jobs) and no currently active Bitcoin projects...my Bitcoin app for iOS is off the market...I can't pony up the $100 annual apple developer fee to keep selling my $50 profit per year app  And a good web front end will make it all human readable and seamless.  Courts? It's an escrow service...you are the judge   Well, you could send a series of transactions to the address in binary code describing the proposed transaction...then 100% of your communicating could be done via the blockchain itself (and you wouldn't have to post on forums the details of the transactions). Escrow could work like this: joe registers with Casascius escrow ltd and tells you his credit card info and a Bitcoin address. Bob registers with as well and tells you his Bitcoin address...when joe wants to make an offer to sell, he uses the Casascius offer encoder to send himself some Bitcoins as a string of 1's and 0's that fully describe the transaction (serving as proof of the terms).  Bob likes those terms and sends the coins.  The "Casascius insta-p2p distributed exchange block chain analyzer / trade detector" notices that bob kept up his half of the bargain and issues a charge (according to the terms) to joes credit card. I think this is your next business...why not? Mike -- another excellent idea. I like where you are heading with this. Any way to encode in the block chain the the price and currency of the completed trade? This way reading the blockchain could also tell you the ticker price.  You could imagine other forms of communication and time stamping using the blockchain (ie, sending binary messages in the Bitcoin amount...spy's could communicate this way, for example) Could Google fiber have something to do with it? https://fiber.google.com/cities/#header=check 2012-12-08 Slashdot.org - Bitcoins-join-global-bank-network"Bitcoin-Central, a currency exchange that specialises in virtual cash, has won the right to operate as a bank...."http://yro.slashdot.org/story/12/12/08/0931247/bitcoins-join-global-bank-network
"Bitcoin-Central, a currency exchange that specialises in virtual cash, has won the right to operate as a bank...."http://yro.slashdot.org/story/12/12/08/0931247/bitcoins-join-global-bank-network Very cool. The software seems to truncate the Satoshi upon deposit into the bank...is this a fee or a bug? This would make a good topic for the foundation..  I'm not sure he quite understands what he's talking about, but he seems to have a gut level sense of what Bitcoin is...I'm surprised he acknowledged himself as an expert...rather than an enthusiast. I wouldn't go so far as to say he's a waste of space and get all upset and use swear words and what not (which IMHO reflects poorly on the community)...I think the big boy thing up do is to communicate to him about him...not to us about him... Congrats. You just made my iggy list.  I guess I don't understand...http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/ Wow. Strong work Walter. This is like...the real deal...Why is it that I can hear Wayne and Garth saying "we're not worthy" over and over in my head... 500 Btc isn't that much money compared to a programmers yearly  salary... Crackdown on Bitcoin by big governments would hurt Bitcoin at least in the short term. You can not kill Bitcoin by legislation, but you can affect the exchange rate quite a bit that way! Whatever your feelings are for Greenpeace, I think most would agree these folks have chutzpah...my guess is that they would support Bitcoin. Anyone a member? Has Bitpay been in touch? Rock on! If I tell you who they are, what are you gonna do to them? That's the question to ask... I got mine essentially for free...back when CPU mining was do-able. I mined 200 coins in one night on my laptop...Bitcoin grew so rapidly that after the next difficulty change (which was like a week after I started mining), I was way way out classed and unable to mine...so I forgot about my coins until just before the crash. I sold some as we had become unexpectedly acutely poor due to health issues with my daughter and I am very grateful they became worth something. I don't actively put money in Bitcoin, but I consider not spending the coins I have left as my investment (and as a resident physician, my 500 BTC is a huge investment for me).  I should think a place like McDonald's would have more to gain.  How about surveys in addition? +1. Not a ponzi....but as scammy as all fiat.  I guess I disagree here. Fiat is a ponzi precisely because its value is derived from the investment of time and effort (work) by the next guy to receive it. Over time, inflation guarantees more investment is needed to maintain value. Sure, governments don't say "join our investment with incredible returns" but the fact that they sell fiat and rely on the fact that people will do more and more work to acquire it or have the fiat collapse in value seems to fit the definition of ponzi.  Uhhhh....Bitcoin is money...hence, it's a Ponzi scheme. It's a little different in that those benefitting from the scheme are all those who hold BTC rather than the printer of fiat. But, I mean, duh -- it's as much a Ponzi scheme as the US dollar or GBP.  It sounds like he is BTC broke or wants people to think he is...and really, what's the difference? Maybe the threat of one person unloading would be different if his stash were spread around many people....but that's about it. I'm inclined to forget about it all...other than the clever use of amazon...sometimes it's the simple ideas that really pay off!We shall see how this alternate crypto currency goes...I was hoping he'd stick around and help Bitcoin grow...oh well. Souns like they've got an interesting solution to the transaction spam "problem." Maybe we can learn from that. Addendum: missed a few posts. How do we know the search warrant is real?Anyhow, I think something fishy is goin on.  What is in your sig? Are you selling ASIC hardware? I'm guessing there is more to be made in scam preorders than actually building the hardware...I hope I'm wrong and can't wait for proof that I am. 
Hehe...I do. I presented at our radiology residents conference and I made my last slide the take down notice used when domains were seized and I made a brief comment about Wikipedia going offline and SOPA and mentioned EFF...oh, and I had a form letter to our state senators for people to fill out.  Thank you, sir! I get your points...but I wouldn't exactly call child pornography main stream  I'm not exactly up to date with the whole ASIC thing, but I see a lot of pre-order links and stuff on signatures. Are ASIC rigs being used to mine? Are they for sale? Or are these just a scam?Pardon my uninformed state! I'm not seeing any reason laws couldn't be passed to make Bitcoin or some aspect of its technical underpinnings illegal in the US. There's a clever fella in here who has the tagline "Democracy is the original 51% attack" (or something to that effect) under his avatar...there are a lot of things that can be made illegal by passing laws that would be tough to argue are unconstitutional.  I think the old radical has a very significant point. I wasn't alive at the time, but we all held gold in the form of USD (we meaning the US and many WWII allied nations) because our dollar was backed by gold and many nations currencies were pegged to the dollar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system). Nixon nixed that. Suddenly, a large fraction of the world began an experiment in fiat currency. Fiat unseated gold....right out from under the feet of many sovereign nations. If countries like the UK and France couldn't stop the devaluation of their currencies, why do we think bitcoin will succeed?  While it may be technically challenging to completely stop Bitcoin, it probably won't be too hard to make it inconvenient enough that very few people want to use it. If bitcoin does keep growing, there will be a battle....perhaps a bit more literally than one might think...I'm not as hard core as the old radical and I would probably fold quickly. Heck, I might fold while the folding is good....but I'm folding into gold.  I just noticed the "Bitcoin" text on the booth...it looks like the same design as from the new logo contest thread... Well played boys! If the only point of the change is to make it easier to compute hashes....then no, I think it's a bad idea. I think the protocol can be modified in the future to support yet to be invented encryption techniques though... My hero too. I remember when the first round of Casascius coins went out with a typographical error...the response of some of the less useful among us really ticked me off...Well done again sir. Well done.  Very cool. Do you know who runs blockchain.info? This sounds like a very interesting country. Perhaps a vacation trip would be fun...someday...any recommendations?...wow...that's really off topic.  I thought you were blind!  I didn't watch the whole interview, but way to go in spreading the word.  The government is going to want people to think that it is illegal to sell bitcoins just like it's illegal to sell drugs. It's no different than giving the panhandler money, however, the truth will be difficult for most people to tell apart. It is illegal to aid and abet a criminal. Selling bitcoins claims to a known drug dealer would be a form of aiding and hence criminal. I sincerely doubt that the person was a true drug dealer, and I highly suspect that this was a law enforcement officer. They will have significant difficulty in going after silk Road directly, however, they can take out the secondary market for bitcoins by prosecuting relatively innocent people under this obscure law... And no one will object to this method of trying to stop bitcoin because it just sounds so bad when an otherwise law-abiding citizen does something like help drug dealers.I predict within the next year we will see the first bitcoin related criminal prosecution, and I doubt it's going to be anyone who did something really all that wrong. I'm sorry to hear about all the contortion and....uhhh....transrectal violation...thanks for going through all that! Well written and worth the read.  How _exactly_ would you pronounce that? What happened November 2010? Anyone remember?When did Gavin present at the CIA? I had forgotten about Bitcoin between summer 2010 and the bubble...Addendum 4/27/2011 is when Gavin posted he would preset at the CIA.  I don't think Mike is Satoshi...lol. Mike is a guy with a well known full name and address. Sure, he's clever, but clearly we have lots of clever folks in our community and we don't think them all to be Satoshi. Also, I presume Satoshi is rich. If Mike were rich, he would hire people to write his code 
That's the main reason I joined... Because Bitcoin is like cash and kinda anonymous, it's up to real people to decide to engage in real transactions using as much of an accountable and real identity as they'd like.  It's tough to have anonymity and accountability at the same time and we have plenty of non-accountable scams to show for it.  It will take some time for people to figure out a good way to do Bitcoin business without being so open to fraud and (hopefully) not having to completely identify themselves... Sweet design Mike.  I like the graph as opposed to the old formula for a probability distribution...more people will get this concept.   Having forgot about this fiasco, I wrote a simple iOS app called myBitcoins to keep track of my offline addresses.  Oops Anyhow, it's on the AppStore for a buck (see sig). The answer is simple: they have their own coin.  They don't believe in store of value or permanent reward for work.   They have their own demurage currency http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency) called Freicoin: Bitcoin with demurrage. Basically, money not spent decreases in value to encourage spending and decrease people saving money and getting rich.ADDENDUM: didn't realize this thread started october 12, last year! Currency is the biggest ponzi scheme of them all...there is no way governments are just gonna let this happen...we need people to be well equipped to defend Bitcoin and we need to organize now...otherwise, I fear Bitcoin will be crushed before it gets big... yup..you're a good Bitcoin citizen I doubt it would...there are like....uhh...no significant transaction fees...right?addendum -- nothing compared to the block reward, that's for sure... http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/156072/bitcoin.pdfThe article does raise a very serious point (oversight) in the bitcoin protocol -- suppose I put a high transaction fee on my transaction because I want it verified quickly....and the first node that I send to (and let's say the only node I can connect to) see that high fee, why would that node send the transaction to other nodes rather than spend a few weeks trying to include it in a block that it solves itself (and hence collects the fee)?Receiving nodes have no reason to forward transactions on, and in fact, have an incentive to not forward paying transactions.  That to me sounds like a big deal...you don't want each client to have to purposefully connect to thousands of nodes to broadcast transactions to get a decent confirmation time...that's not very p2p  +1.  Seriously?  Profound ideas and some issues with English...and people want to talk about the English?  tards... I second the motion...we can wait 5-10 years to get back to the B||...but we need a killer logo to introduce the B- symbol...Logo Design Contest by Coinabul maximum security would be open code...not necessarily your being able to trash the device  typically one couples data with claims of fact...(a link to a wiki site is not my idea of high quality data, just sayin...) not to my knowledge  cross posting:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=114961.msg1254315#msg1254315 on the 17th of september pirate said the earliest he could pay out was october 12th...there are some paste bin links in the thread list... s/casascius/your own easily generated key pair/g and those messing with the poll are almost certainly guys...

Good point...it's the famous and rich who pass everything to their lawyers... time for satoshi dice! It would be nice to have an educated, well thought out, and reasonable estimate of the amount of time it would take for a large fraction of users to have the BTC symbol work (and for someone to fill in all the assumptions with reasonable guesses)... I fell for it too! Think so...why? I'm not sufficiently skilled to do the work with what I know now...although I'm sure I could figure it out, I haven't the time -- and surely there are people around here who know how to make it happen.  Just seems like a good idea and a good money maker for someone who can pull it off... wow...we have about as many "others" as women...i'm betting 90% of those have a Y chromosome... i guess it's a function of the OS more than the broswer then? buy a casascius BTC1 coin, peal it, take a digital picture of the private key and first bits, copy the jpeg to a secure/encrypted SD card (easy to do on Mountain Lion)...use MtGox to cash in the private key and send to a new address... what OS and browser? I have your answer: yes. looks the same on safari and chrome on mountain lion. Don't people typically delegate most of this type of communication to their lawyers?  I mean, don't people just typically say here's the info for my lawyer -- talk to them?  Is the contact info for his lawyer known? Luke -- here's how it renders on Mountain Lion / chrome: Lol!  I'll let you know how it works out.   looks like $12 for a used credit card machine...I found a PC/USB cable for $50...I've yet to find a programming manual... That's not a bad idea.  ...off to ebay... I have $50 worth of those...I just stocked up on $100 in coins to help teach my 2 and 3 year old about money...along with this gizmo I just ordered...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZaRgMOo-Ig  I'm betting in 5 years it'll still be broken for about half of folks...
Part of me wants to believe there is something more to this than just simple theft...I just don't think it's the  smarter part of me... An app could do it...and there's lots of ways to do it on a computer...My thoughts were more along the line of security... How long until implementations work for most people? 1 year, 5 years, a decade? I wrote an app for iPhone to do it... I'm in.  Bitcoin needs a voice and a way of funneling resources to the tasks that require them.   I must confess, I'm confused.  I would have thought he has already had enough time to arrange his disappearance....must not have gotten all that much money (or maybe he feels hidden enough).   How hard would it be to build an electronic device that could generate and display a Bitcoin public / private key pair?  It would be nice to have a physical device that could, without connecting to anything, give you a new safe address to dump your coins to at the press of a button.  Let's suppose for a moment you are a US citizen and you made a non-trivial sum of money in Bitcoin.  Did/would you report it as income to the IRS? They're not exactly nice about tax evasion... so he hasn't completely disappeared? this argument is ridiculously difficult to prove true or false...anyone up for a scientific survey of goldbugs? i just can't believe he got away with it... good point...their inventory is their hedge... which will turn into the end of the month... [/quote]http://coinabul.com/Gold and silver != drugs.... Love your site none-the-less! reserved to answer questions from PM If anyone is interested, PM me.   It renders correctly on my laptop... Why not given Ben a call and ask?  Most journalists are not impossible to get a hold of! Not that I'm aware of...I mean, not directly.  A cheap Ellet would go a long way 
interesting observation....I think you may be right... I think the main point is to act as a public front and means of delegating resources to tasks that will promote the spread of Bitcoin...I'm not quite sure why so many people are so worried... http://twitter.com/withfreeiranI ran a proxy server for connections originating in Iran a few years back.  Bitcoin + Iran (with its loads of young, smart people) could be prime for true revolution... I agree on perma-bumping this... I missed this...when/where did pirate say that? Does MtGox know for certain who pirate is?   Did anyone really not see this coming?  I mean, can you really think of Bitcoin becoming big without a foundation? I vote BS.  It seems if you can get people to think something is happening for long enough, people eventually either forget they were robbed or stop caring that they were... What, technically, can be done to centralize Bitcoin? I mean, I can see how one could centralize the addition of new features, but, you can undo what's been done.  Bitcoin is Bitcoin...it's not like it can just suddenly become this completely non-anonymous, heavily fee based network via a central authority...everyone running the software would have to agree... Another good use was pointed out in the excellent TEDx talk (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=115555.0):the ultra poor -- those who have no means of establishing financial arrangements with banks and have no safe place to store their money -- could use Bitcoin not only as a bank but also as a global payment system.  No doubt the cash like aspects of Bitcoin do encourage cash like use, especially in the same illegal ways cash is used; but to fail to see the global, society changing differences Bitcoin has from cash I think is short sighted.  Bitcoin is a bit more than drugs, porn, and guns.  Great talk. Excellent observation that innovation does more than political agitation. Of the three technologies you mention, I think bitcoin will be the only one significantly improved/progressed/wider spread 5 years from now. But the combination of the three, fully developed, would be society changing.  Had him on ignore already. The whole bet debacle triggered a ton of new additions to the ignore list.  Regardless of how you earn money, you pay taxes on it. If you get paid in chickens, you pay taxes... Lol...I sold 1k solid coins right before the tiny market folded...I think I got a whopping 6 or 8 bitcoins for it.  I see...so it will require two codes to generate...in time I suppose the implementation will catch up with the spec. I get Bbox on my iPad on iOS 6.  I thought that was just a theft... I sold a bunch at $18 a piece and kept the rest. If Bitcoin crashes, I won't feel like I missed out on the cash...I kept a bunch as well, so if Bitcoin takes off, I won't be upset for having sold out. I got mine for basically nothing...back when CPU mining was possible, even on a laptop.   The B double vertical strokes is a Unicode symbol?  What is its code?  I can't find it on any list of Unicode symbols (maybe I'm not looking in the right place?).  Yes - which is why we need to use it. There was an effort to design a bitcoin logo around it a few months back...something like a BTC50 bounty (of which I pledged BTC10). There was even a pretty good design, but, nothing really got a foothold.  Sweet!
I would be more worried about corruption if bitcoin value exploded...which I don't think it will do without TBF. I see it as a catch 22... Think so:http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/Bitcoinfoundation.org Did you have any other closed threads (plural ) in mind? If Bitcoin went up in price and adoption increased while privacy remained unimproved, would that be bad for Bitcoin? Seems like that's the agenda... Good investigating. Someone needs to build a physical device that generates address/key pairs offline so you can take a Polaroid of it and stick it in a safety deposit box.  Yup. That is the best proof of anything I've seen on this forum in a while... I think you need a new doctor  I can get you the name of a few good ones if you'd like Your idea is interesting...I'm not sure it would be in need of the Bitcoin protocol and associated proof of work though... One of the guys on here has a service for setting up a virtual machine connected to the Internet for rent...pretty slick idea.  If you have all the addresses, you can use the iOS app I wrote to keep track: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mybitcoins/id539677499?ls=1&mt=8 Love that site. Hadn't seen that before. So, not much of an announcement to be made then? Didn't Gavin issue a somewhat deprecating post on the topic?  Either way, these guys are the true revolutionaries here...the devs and the business folks...it's fun to watch.  Very cool. Enabling others to stand on their own...we need more of this.  True. Create a new identity that is unconnected to a real world identity and make the new identity public. Maybe have a bonding agency to vet new identities and arbitrate disputes for a fee... I think the fact that Bitcoin is inspiring the same type of behavior as real money is a good sign that Bitcoin is replicating money...I would love for society to stop being evil, but, if Bitcoin didn't inspire things like theft, deceit, etc, would it be useful at all? Hasn't yet, as far as I can tell...would have to drop the pseudoanonymity to build a reputation though... Irreversibility and relative anonymity....not likely to bring out the best in people... +1Scared me for a second! Who removed them? I think people are intrinsically repulsed by the concept of intrinsically worthless money...they just don't realize that that is precisely what they use...people don't quite see that Bitcoin, while still intrinsically worthless, can't be created ad infinitum. It would be unwise to kill our only magazine for spite... Has anyone added up the amount of btc passed via ppt operators to Pirate?  I'm not interested in what people believed their account balances to be, but the actual net number of Bitcoins that flowed in to pirate...
I think the scammer tag is a super way to educate.  I'll chip in my ill gotten BTC2 when you all are ready.  Matthew,What you did was dumb. There is little point trying to teach people a lesson - you are no better teacher than a lifetime of experiences, and your lesson won't be learned. There will always be this exact type of situation everywhere you go. Everywhere. I'm sorry you hadn't realized that. I must admit I liked the Bitcoin movement far more before your stunt. This has brought out the bad side in so many of our community...we've gone from revolutionaries to whiny brats, big dreamers to big babies, bright individualists to a herd of thoughtless beasts...how are we gonna get anywhere if all we do is rip each other off or trick the stupid in to ridiculous bets? There are better things to be done and in your absence perhaps it will be easier to get good things done...or maybe we will just keep gambling and scamming... I agree the whole idea of the bet is kinda childish, but the expectation of others that Matthew pay out in Bitcoin rather than accept the scammer tag is silly.  I'm not a fan of drama and theatrics (cough...Ellet...cough) but Matthew taught me a lesson: people don't think when they are being greedy. I mean, even our forum founder holds stolen Bitcoin unashamedly and he has the gall to consider Matthew a bigger scammer than himself? I'm not certain he would have taken the money had he won, in fact, he offered scammer tags to all who chose not to pay. If people paid Matthew, it would have been to get the scammer tag taken off...not because they lost a bet. I hold two stolen Bitcoins (roughly).  It's easy for me to admit I don't deserve them because its not much money...I should like to think I would feel the same way if I held a large amount of stolen funds. But even if I had a large amount of pirate profits, I sure as heck wouldn't brag about it or try to convince others that "I didn't _know_ at the time it was a ponzi, therefore it's ok that I keep my winnings now...."  I kinda have to agree...I mean....seriously? People are upset they didn't get something for nothing? I guess if you got ripped off by pirate you would fall for this to... Can't wait to hear it.  Lol...he got his scammer tag...the deal was pay up or accept the tag... The debt of a bunch of scammer tags?  If I put up a big bet, I'd take the scammer tag option.  I guess he intended to set up a heads I win, tails you lose scenario. Hence the limited use of escrow. The fact that he did some escrow (I'm presuming its true) makes me think he intended to win and get btc or scammer tags galore doled out.  I had anticipated a collapse earlier than it actually collapsed...I figured if small timers like me are able to get in, it must be close to the end.  Good luck with that. If he really does have law enforcement involved, I believe your claim will have to wait... This needs to stay...too good not to quote.  I'd like to hear his reasoning on this... +1 So....did he take more money than you did?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=105288.msg1155862#msg1155862 I don't care if he gets a scammer tag or not. I think we need a gullible and/or complicit in crime tag for the ppt folks who assisted in the theft. And a clever crook tag for those who actually made money on the pirate fiasco (for the record, I made a little over BTC2...which I'm willing to return).  I think he succeeded at achieving his aims...https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=101751.msg1173889#msg1173889 What is the rough electricity cost of a block? Hopefully less than its USD equivalent... Now I get it. Brilliant.  I hadn't seen this. This is interesting...gonna have to think about this...Addendum:  thought about it. And it's brilliant. Matthew turned a large group of people who were claiming with certainty that pirate was a scammer and anyone investing with him an idiot into people who bought hook, line and sinker his own equally silly scheme...Pretty funny. Childish. But still funny. Anyhow, I'm hoping mesh networks take off. I do see a need for banks with multisig to protect those that need it. I hope our point of sale merchant services guys can crack the market. I'm totally gonna get a BitInstant credit card. I hope our devs can get the size of the blockchain down...I still see the future as bright. Addendum 2: I confess to using my iPhone for this. And not having read all the info available at the time of my OP. I've only got so much time in a day. 
I don't doubt the creative resiliency of the clever. I'm sure there will be people from ham radio heroes to members of the civil air patrol broadcasting/distributing copies of the block chain...  That's a valid point. If fiat collapses quickly, much of our public infrastructure will stop working...we need an orderly transition in order for Bitcoin to have value...we need a minimum connectedness to keep Bitcoin running... +1. Insightful.  I'll give you a $100,000,000,000,000,000,000 if you can spell Mississippi backwards......awaiting scammer tag... No funds changed hands...as far as we are aware. Lets take a lesson from Matthew and not rush to judgement. That said, I'm betting no money changed into his hands.  People smart enough to know the term should be smart enough to never have gambled on pirate or rely upon a bet from this guy on the Internet to hedge against the crime they opened themselves up to.  Not trying to explain it away. I'm trying to show that precisely this type of reasoning is childish.  I have listened to it. It's what makes me think he's a decent guy. He sure picked a foolish bet, but then again there were many people gambling in pirate...equally foolish. But Mathews point is well taken...it reminds me of the people calling Casascius an idiot when he made a typo on his first series coins...people who hadn't actually done something for the community...(not that I've done much) Now that we've given a scammer tag to a man after just a few hours of his even being able to verify that he indeed lost a crazy bet (a man who was probably sleeping at the time by the way), perhaps we should move on to something more significant. Where's the revolution going next? Mesh networks? Insinuating itself (brilliantly) amongst the big established credit card companies in the fashion of BitInstant? Bitcoin banks with multisig?As much as some might hate to admit it, it's gonna be someone like Matthew and decidedly not someone like Pirate that pushes Bitcoin forward...if you can't see the difference between a real scammer who profited off of others and what Matthew did, or think they are somehow equivalent, I suggest you think carefully. Most grown ups can see the difference...and no one really believes something that is too good to be true, much less act or rely upon it...Good day all.  Now that he has a scammer tag, he doesn't need to pay. Brilliant.  People give pirate 3 weeks to repay money he actually took (and he doesn't) while people give Matthew 3 hours to pay a bet he says he reserved the right to cancel....People are too gullible. I'm sorry. This is all so silly. We are supposed to be engaged in a revolution, and it's come to _this_???  Not wise.  Bitcoin -- stolen with impunity since 2010... I'm surprised all those people lost money and no one has the FBI on pirates tail...it's a crime across many state borders I'm sure!Oh, and I only put up BTC5...not because I couldn't have bet 100x more, but I felt guilty taking advantage of someone who seems a bit idealistic, naive, and mathematically inept...but generally a darn decent fella who happens to get stuff done for Bitcoin... I wouldn't worry. I doubt anyone is getting paid...except maybe those with the best chance of prosecuting pirate.  What if everyone that profited gave money back? +1We should be thanking them for turning something bad for Bitcoin into something that could actually help Bitcoin grow...the general public now has something to read from our perspective when they google this Romney stuff... I think BitInstant didn't do anything so terrible. Because everyone knows there never was a real extortion threat, BitInstant doesn't look bad for offering to help out in jest.  We really need to sticky the OP. Expecting personal responsibility doesn't mean we condone criminal activity or shun police involvement in crimes.  Korea. It's in one of his posts in the bet thread. 
Did this go through the court? Is this the first completed Bitcoin lawsuit? Must be a form of dev testing...it's going to gmaxwell's address, or so one would be led to believe It could also be a really funny joke...Look where it came from... Indeed not.  I'm a physician -- I should hope I can do better Anyhow, you didn't address the issue...your post and your words seem to imply you know the inner workings of the pirate scheme.  Is that true?  Or are you simply assuming that, for some reason, Goat's refusal to give Pirate info he never needed before is going to result in your losing the bet...It sure riled you up... Matthew -- to me, your post suggests you have insider knowledge...how else could you know that goat's actions could actually affect pirate paying back his debtors? I mean, there is no obvious reason pirate needs info to pay people back now that he didn't need before...  Seems hard to connect the dots without knowing inside stuff...should i be disappointed in you? +1.  Something smells rotten in Denmark... i wrote an an iphone app to keep track of my offline addresses...see the link in my signature... Isn't the whole Romney extortion thing a joke? I mean, it's not real, correct? +11... anyone notice the title of the thread? I don't see many responses to the plea for help...That said, just because we want Bitcoin to be decentralized and all that jazz, it doesn't mean we shouldn't get law enforcement involved when thefts occur.  It's computer hacking or fraud at the very least.  No point. We all know that every step taken by an ant is in some way, shape, or form related to a scam.  I think people remember events better than dates... There is a long time between the beginning and the 2011 bubble.... Hopefully the devs have a stake in Bitcoin from being early adopters...thus, they work to increase the value of their own coin. Also, it's not just devs that make Bitcoin valuable. Perhaps we should pay magicaltux, Charlie at bitinstant, coinabul, Casascius, Matthew, etc.  I'm not quite sure how chips work in a casino, but, can one really walk up to the....uhh...check out counter and plop down $9k worth of plastic chips and get handed $9k cash, no questions asked? the stupid feature of exchanges are instant withdrawals....why not keep everything in cold wallets and process btc withdrawls once a day...manually... +1.  I think community leaders should step up and pressure those who gained on the loss of others to make restitution....in any way that doesn't let Matthew win the bet  I won some BTC at this game...a little over BTC2.  I had a good feeling it was a ponzi and will be nearly convinced it was if Matthew loses his bet (to be completely convinced, I'd need to look at a balance sheet and see incoming deposits being sent out as interest payment).  I don't feel morally entitled to the BTC2 that I "earned" in "interest."  I am grown up enough to see that when a story sounds too good to be true, it is. I had a decent hunch I was being lied to when I made my deposit, although the revolutionary nature of Bitcoin does blur the lines between plausible and crazy just enough to keep one second guessing oneself.  I think it would be best for the community if those who profited on this scheme helped make restitution in some way...although I doubt anyone profited enough to make much of a dent in the losses. Describe, if you please and in detail, the type of payment you anticipate winning the bet on... i think a nation/state financed attack on the network would actually be quite harmful to Bitcoin.  They could hire a much bigger nest of hackers oh...and they can kidnap people and send them to Cuba...without too much international outcry...  I think anything can be laundered, not just fiat money and Bitcoin money. All laundering is is an attempt to conceal the identities/amounts of a transfer...of anything. Doubt there has been any case yet to clearly decide if laundering services are illegal. 
We shall see... +1I am looking forward to the announcement. A little misstep here and there is fine by me...since when did we come to expect our revolutions to run smoothly? I have invested very little (back when that could get you a few hundred coins)....I'm just along for the ride. I'm having more fun being part of the community than I would if I sold.  Nature abhors a vacuum. Lack of on topic info breeds flames.  +1. Even asking it Luke a question can be harmful. For example, hey Matthew, isn't Blind the guy who was arrested for having child porn and sexually harassing Goat's goats? ....but if they settle for less, you lose the bet matthew... Pirate said he is in default. Matthew can win the bet if pirate's statement is false and he does pay all his lenders with interest up to the hour it was sent on or before September 9th.  Not sure understanding either is necessary to understanding compound interest...and that's all ya really gotta know to see through the pirate scandal.  Gigavps -- why did you leave the swell feedback in btc-OTC? Most are interpreting that to mean you leant him money and he paid you back (which I think is a fair assumption given the intent of the site). Edit....found the answer above. Sorry (dang tiny screen) Why until the date he announced default? The terms said interest until the account was paid off...up to the hour...I missed the doubling down...but, it makes me firmly believe something other than a simple bet is going on.  It would be bad for the community if most of it got labeled scammer... I'm a radiology resident and back when BitBills came out, I took a low kV radiograph of it to see if I could bring out any detail...I was hoping the ink was made from the oxide of some metal...no luck. The BitBill was glorified laminated paper, which would be much more susceptible to xray hacking than a metal coin. I strongly doubt anyone will find success with a Casascius coin.  It is hard for this to end well...maybe he is BTC rich and this won't be a large sum for him. As a btc poor early adopter (500 bitcoins was kid money back in the day), I know there were plenty of people here 2 years ago with that kinda change hanging around... iPhone wallet from blockchain:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blockchain/id493253309?ls=1&mt=8Simple app I wrote for keeping track of the balances in your Bitcoin addresses (most of mine are offline):http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mybitcoins/id539677499?mt=8 I know when I steal money, I'm always careful to declare capital gains appropriately...Seriously though, theft isn't a capital gain and this not an IRS issue.  There is a reason Matthew didn't accept deposits for the wager...and offered a non-monetary penalty for those who didn't pay...I think he is teaching us a lesson in greed and stupidity...a lesson sorely needed in this community...it would make a great Bitcoin magazine article as a follow up to the article on the pirate scandal.  Matthew said 3 weeks... Favorite coin: the 2009 UHR gold coin remake of the St Gaudens $20 gold piece.  And we all know pirate is a man of his word.... I made about BTC2 via bitcoinmax...perhaps I'm holding stolen goods? I'm probably one of the few willing to give back any goods deemed stolen. 
Do we know what the actual total losses are? I mean, I presume there are plenty of people who have gotten their original investment back and maybe even some interest...and plenty of people wanting the huge amount of interest they were promised...the net effect may be small... How much in deposits did pirate actually receive?  I believe he claimed to have 500kBTC, but, I'd claim that too if that's what I needed others to believe to keep my gravy train rolling...Anyhow, maybe we haven't heard much because he is small potatoes with huge phony debt... #26Did I miss that the Q&A session was over?  i ordered #2 today.  Hoping to get #3 at B&N come September! The first person to win a criminal conviction in a massive Bitcoin case is gonna be famous... I think there may be a generation gap kinda thing here. I respect Matthew's move. I think he is wrong and perhaps not too good with math, but I respect that he had a belief and is putting his money where his mouth is.  It's unclear if pirate is named in the thread title and unclear if he has shafted anybody...but midland Texas has something to say about trendon shavers use of checks:SHAVERS, TRENDON   101078   09/21/1982   THEFT O/20 U/500 BY CHECKFrom:http://www.co.midland.tx.us/da/hotcheckwarrants/list/?lname=sz I'd donate to a Bitcoin Mag PR campaign.  I thought multisig was being designed to have scripts that can set conditions on the transaction...for example, if I put aside BTC100 for a years worth of internet service in 12 chunks, can't I set the script for each chunk to be paid to such and such address at such and such a time?  This way, my ISP can take their money when its  due without me having to remember to push it on time...they can't take it early...but they could forget to take it  Or, I could take it back if I needed it before the payment was due...If this is how multisig scripting could work...then it's really quite brilliant... #25Do you intend to win the bet on a technicality? +1 -- insightful. I feel rather stupid for not having realized this before. The implications are very widespread...it's like a cancer intermingled throughout civilization, ultimately causing us significant harm (I mean, we've even messed with the climate with our monetary subsidization of consumption). There is nothing worse than subsidized consumption. Bitcoin is better because it subsidizes production. Thank you.  For the record I vote pirate is a pirate/ponzi. If not, he was very generous...or didn't realize there are cheaper ways to borrow money  I made money off of pirate. I put BTC10 in some passthru and took BTC12.4 out. It was a gamble, and I didn't get greedy. I was actually surprised when I got my money back.  P.s.  my belief is that anyone offering such wild interest rates is a ponzi...I mean, I'd mortgage my house to get in on a scheme like pirates if I were him and I knew I could make a fortune...so why pay others so mucj interest? It doesn't make sense to borrow money at crazy high interest rates if running the scheme with his own money could make him so much money so quickly. The maths just don't look good to me.  If Matthew wins the bets on a technicality like that, I'm taking the scammer tag and walking...but I don't think he intends to play games. My gut feeling tells me he is pissed that people called pirate a ponzi without proof and he would rather see people out their money where their mouth is. Also, I'm not sure he can dole out scammer tags as he sees fit. I imagine if there was not agreement in who won the bet, then a lot of people might get labeled scammer...that would hurt the community...imagine if bitcointalk is calling regular users scammers, what's an uninformed visitor gonna think when a large fraction of posters are "scammers."  Not good.  What is this hash for?  It's not in the block chain.... Do we know this wasn't independently discovered by some more malintentioned person? From what I gather from the OP, it was never a silent bug (at least on the client side), right? I think osmium or iridium is more like it....http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmium Matthew -- if this is going to ruin you financially...I don't want to take your money...if not, I'll buy Bitcoin Magazine with the winnings.  Ballsy but respectable. 
Just because you send the coins back to the address they came from is not equivalent to returning them to their owner...as others have pointed out, if you withdrew from your brokerage to the campaign address, sending it back to the broker doesn't truly reverse the transaction.  I presume the price will crash when pirate pays out...all those coins rushing back to folks who could sell them... I'm surprised the bets haven't amounted to much. Perhaps someone knows something I don't. I still doubt the price fluctuations have been enough to get all the coins he needs. The fact that he's closing and still needs to manipulate the market to me means that he decided to shutdown before he had all the coins he needed (someone please correct me if I have the timeline wrong).  Rock on! I like it So perhaps pirates operation was quite a bit smaller than I had thought...I mean, I figured it involved thousands of people. It might be easy to verify a smaller group of sub lenders. We shall see how many Bitcoins were never forwarded to pirate in the first place... 5 BTC1GCDzqmX2Cf513E8NeThNHxiYEivU1ChheI bet he will not pay. This bet will be hard to settle. You have to verify that pirate:1) paid back 100% of the borrowed principle2) paid 100% of the promised interest3) and paid 100% of the debt holders according to 1 & 2 above. Unless all the books are opened...this will be tough to prove. If the books are opened, sounds like someone needs to write code to verify it all...but then there will undoubtedly be some exceptions and informal transactions, etc. it will be messy. Many people will lie and claim they didn't get paid fairly if they can't be proven wrong...if only to win this bet.  ...and I could have sworn he was killed nearly instantly by an incredibly well shot arrow... I think you mistake the intent of the reference implementation and the nature of bootstrapping an entire social movement. The standard client is needed to run the network and is not needed by casual users to use Bitcoin. Right now, its better to attract the competent who can help build the network infrastructure and services needed to transform Bitcoin into something useful, simple and safe for all users.  Bump Way too funny...do we make Steve Gutenberg a star too? (Different episode) Simple. Extremely high interest rates mean there is a time in the not too distant future when the interest owed is larger than the Bitcoin supply. Clearly it can't go on forever. It's hard to reconcile the absolute finite time period the operations can continue with the desire to hold out for longer. If all accounts are made square according to the deposit terms, I will be incredibly impressed and presume the man is a genius. If he falls short of his mark but people getost or more than their deposit, I'll be less impressed but impressed nonetheless and I wouldn't be quick to label him a scammer for missing some interest payments. If he cuts and runs, well... Dude. Sorry. Are you okay? It is possible that no double entendre was intended.  As others have pointed out, the phrase is so uncommon people don't even recognize it when they use it ("two bit" being a phrase that pre-dates computers meaning small for its small monetary value ... A quarter). Perhaps Satoshi didn't think about how very appropriate the name was, but I'd like to think he did  Well that's good to hear. That should add 20 weeks or so to my initial estimates.  Bit - it has two relevant meanings for BTC.  The lesser known one is a slang term in many western countries for cash (eg, a US bit is worth 1/8 USD...see http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_(money) )If there is an intentional double entendre here and Satoshi thought of it...perhaps he was, culturally speaking, western and not Japanese. His posts sound American to me, but I've only read a few.  Sleep, food, sex...some things take time. But of course 7% interest has to end...specifically, if pirate had 2.6 million BTC outstanding 10 weeks ago, he's got 10 weeks or so until his debts are higher than the number of bitcoins in existence.  I think this is what happens at the end of a thread. All that can be said on topic has been said (which really wasn't much) and increasingly off-topic posts, like this one, don't have any place to go but inline at the end...no sub-posting a la slashdot.  Uhhh....yes.  You'd think a government would announce something like that. And any change in the law would require an act of congress or the supreme court...I doubt Uncle Sam is ever going to be happy about Bitcoin unless they can control it. Will we see a fork for UncleSamCoins? I doubt that too. Is Uncle Sam gonna allow banks to hold Bitcoin as currency for meeting reserve requirements? I doubt it. But now I really am curious...
Dang it!  Now I have to read it all carefully again...after finally agreeing with the multisig camp...At least it's fun though  Seeing as this thread is already way off topic, I figured I'd throw in my two cents. I want a phone that works. I do not like that an arbitrary decision can be made to exclude a program, however, that's the price I'm willing to pay to have my phone just work. Bitcoin is bigger than Apple. Whether Apple realizes this or not is irrelevant.P.S., I didn't type this and I'm posting from my iPhone. I think some general education about forking the block chain is in order -- for myself included, as I am not an expert or terribly well-informed. However, I believe that if such changes were to occur, they would have no impact on those already holding Bitcoins. These new rules would define a new crypto currency and people would likely give it a new name; however, if they didn't, it would be really confusing. So....give it a try?  Sometimes a simple "no, silly" speaks louder than eloquent, precise logic  Enjoyed your post! So 3* addresses are usable by clever folk, not people like us  +1 Or the owner responds and gives you the private key. I doubt he even knows he has it in his wallet, presuming its not lost.  Seems to me like a real Bitcoin wallet...that keeps the coins on the server, not on the phone. Not a Bitcoin client. Pretty cool.  I'm not understanding how the 3 addresses aren't valid...their relation to op_eval, multisig, hashes of scripts, etc....but by this link it appears to me that a 3 address can both store Bitcoins and transfer them to a 1 address: https://blockchain.info/address/3DLCRW4v2zcMoWfk8HH95JvMtQgCKhgKYtNow, please, I don't want to be responsible for killing anyone...if you feel you might rupture an intracranial aneurysm, please stop reading and go see an interventional neuroradiologist or neurosurgeon.   +1. This is what mining will be about in the future... A link to a tutorial...it's kinda a lot of work to redeem a private key with the Satoshi client. Maybe a link to blockchain.info? @Coinabul -- What's the good word? Not many people use ""? ...just like every freekin Mac user who doesn't notice the OS making that substitution for three periods.  Sorta, but it's not easy. It's not like someone can just look up all your wallet addresses in the block chain...but making connections based on spending patterns and ip addresses with some degree of certainty can be done. Bitcoin isn't perfectly anonymous, but it has good enough anonymity for a reasonable number of uses.  Bitcoin is rapidly inflationary now, with decreasing inflation caused by the fact that the creation of Bitcoins is never proportional to the circulating supply and the halvings of the subsidy/reward. Keeping the block subsidy/reward steady at 50 btc just slows down the rate of inflation decline -- but both models end up in the same place -- only a trivial fraction of the circulating coins are created each year for many many years.  Someone needs to do a Bitcoin magazine article on this concept. Illicit activities will be the first thing governments try to use as a reason to sway public opinion to allow legislation to get passed to try to outlaw Bitcoin. 100 years ago, everybody used non-traceable, anonymous cash and try weren't all SR fans, pornographers, or criminals. Somehow people seem inclined to believe that Bitcoin is bad because even they could use it to launder money...but they ate quick to forget that laundering is a privilege given only to the wealthiest people in the current system.  +1 that is wise. And ask his donators to not reuse the same donation addresses. Some of the sites accepting Bitcoin donations on the thread below have utilized the single address for all donations approach...I looked at the block chain for a few of them...no one has gotten much by way of Bitcoin donations...the biggest I saw was 700 or so.  Bitcoin is too much of a pain for him to use, I fear. I think he will realize soon that anyone can vet his donations and demand an account of all those who donated more than the set limit. He may not even realize if someone (possibly an adversary) sends in too much...and if he doesn't notice, any Joe Schmoe can prove he violated campaign funding laws.  The bills aren't meant to circulate. You give the private key away and the new owner transfers the coins immediately or takes your contact info in case they decide to transfer later and it bounces...like a check that has the option of being instantly cashed.  What is the ratio of most nations physical currency to their total money supply? What is a typical fractional reserve requirement? Could anyone estimate the total money supply of Bitcoins in a fractional reserve system similar to modern fractional reserve systems? I'm not sure where to begin...
Why did you crop the author from the quote? While price is unstable, Bitcoin will be used as an intermediary currency, quickly bought and sold to purchase goods or services whose price is stable in another currency.  While Bitcoin deflation is rapid, it's other use will be as a value store. An rapidly inflating coin would be either unused or highly circulated. A quasi-stable, slowly deflating coin seems to me to be the steady-state for Bitcoin in the long term, should it survive.  No trust required. Verify the bill before accepting...you aren't trusting the bill to be valid, you are verifying the private key is backed by Bitcoins.... I take my Internet connection with me everywhere I go... +1We need more Internet/RL PR stuff like this and the coinabul posters. Well done Pratyeka! Do you use an encrypted disk image?  I would.  Yes. But I'd only keep mine with MtGox. I've been with MtGox pre-2011 bubble and feel comfortable with their security and efforts at doing things legally. Not me. I'm with MtGox and I'm verified. I am comfortable being known and don't desire total anonymity. Some of us have to be willing to play by these rules if we want Bitcoin to succeed...so that hopefully in the future such privacy invasions won't be necessary.  While the value of Bitcoin is unstable, it can only succeed as an intermediary currency (ie, you exchange fiat for btc, transact, and reverse the exchange quickly). When value is reasonably stable, Bitcoin can be used like fiat.  Not a bad idea. Another idea (unrelated) would be to print a change address QR code on the bill. This sure is a lot easier than building it's electronic equivalent! Don't banks need cash? What? No gopher://?  What are they gonna do at UMN? You need to wait to spend them until they are worth spending. The transaction fees are in place to discourage what you are trying to do (ie, make a huge transaction with hundreds of inputs) for effectively no Bitcoins. Should your trivial sum be worth spending in the future, the transaction fees will be lower and then it would make sense to spend them. Right now, hold onto your "dust" collection. Boy wouldn't it stink to have a substantial sum of Bitcoin in a huge number of addresses each containing a Satoshi? I recall reading that too. I guess we know how many btc he controls.  Brilliant! Seriously though...the more coin you put in your head, the larger the number of people who will have access to it...I'd have a better chance, given a rubber hose, of getting your pass phrase from you than from your safety deposit box at the bank.  Sure doesn't sound like a proud father talking about his baby, that's for sure. No one would design Bitcoin the way it is if he knew the kinds of things Sassaman did.  I'm not thinking he was Satoshi -- he had a lot of negative things to say about Bitcoin -- albeit in a dispassionate, factual manner.http://twitter.com/lensassaman/status/81084436518674433http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2011/07/len-sassaman-on-bitcoin.html It would be neat to have code that could query the block chain and plot the number of bitcoins unspent (or spent a certain number of times or less) within a certain time frame (ie, since generation, last 6 months, etc). A 3-D generalized version of this would be very informative.  This is very informative...should have a mini orientation with tips like that...or should I put this reply in another thread...buried in meta to guarantee no one reads it  Great news!
That didn't take long... Not a bad idea....good luck! Lol...I still don't get the necrobreaker thing though....despite google's best efforts  does it have something to do with getting rich? If the price drops too far too fast, the miners will stop and the network would become less stable...that might allow for an easy 51% attack...not sure if thy would really kill Bitcoin though.  It's interesting that when most coins were spent, the low in price was about a buck (or 2)...currently the price is rising as the percent unspent goes up...but if 2million coins were sold, the price would be about a buck again.  Brute force...With or without a rubber hose? For future reference, here's the thread:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=98641.0 Interesting thread today on the 2 million btc that have been generated but never moved. If all sold at once, the last one would sell for a buck.  Wow...I haven't owned a real computer for almost 10 years...just laptops and dinky things. I can't wait until I have both the time and money to build my own systems again.  Too good an idea (one had and discussed by too many) not to happen.  Thanks!These will make great demo keys to show people how fast one can turn a Bitcoin into cash. Imagine if the first time you saw Bitcoin, it was by someone logging into Gox, redeeming a private key and selling at market rate...it would be very fast and quite impressive I should think.  A massive cash out could mean it would take many years to recover ones investment.  Pm'd  will that work for you? Lol. Many thanks!I had vanitygen compiled on my Mac laptop...in my downloads folder, which I emptied literally today. I had been meaning to generate a few more in the near future...I remember what a pain it was to compile on a Mac in the first place. I had the ocl version running. The make files didn't work back then...and I don't know make at all.  1 Satoshi probably won't matter to someone who has 10^5 Bitcoins...but I doubt I'll live to see the day where a Satoshi actually could buy something common. I'd love to be wrong, but I think the math is on my side.  What hardware are you running? Pm'd! Perhaps. I can't say I remember much of the 70's, but I recall the 80's fondly  Are they hoarding? I have no idea what that means...
Ok, whose production effectively runs out in the creators lifetime...but let's not argue the trivial. Etlase2 is right.  Did he say why he was leaving? Glad the dude didn't (presumably) die suddenly.  I'm not offering a bet...I'm asking would you run this process on your wallet worth up to a million bucks and send someone 1/2 of the RAR file set? I don't know the details of RAR well enough other than the program doesn't do anything unless you have the whole set.  Interesting theory...did no one really know _anything_ about him? Surely someone knew something...if no one really knew anything, then I doubt he's dead...he was always planning to disappear.  Ahh...I see the confusion. I mean the bounding box...not the actual logo shape (eg, a circle has a square bounding box, an oval would be a rectangle).  Cool. Thanks!  There is someone else in my small city relating transactions. Cool...I have no idea who though! Would you bet BTC500 it's secure? BTC100,000? A tool to split your wallet in two so that each half can be backed up to different cloud servers but neither half can be used to spend your coins... No brainer. I'm in.  According to bitcoincharts...yes, 2 million coins could be sold:Sell 2000000 BTC for 1987718.05 USD...or about a buck a piece.  I concur. I think people are waiting for the market to mature. I see it as a bullish sign. Why sell now if you can get more later?  Could 2 MBTC be sold?  That's one way to drive your point home. Pun intended. I see your point very clearly now though. Not a bad idea.  Good point...best to focus on Bitcoin related hacks...there are all sorts of urban hacks that would be fun, but a little off-topic. Now pardon me while I go see if I can hook up our municipal electricity supply to our water tower...don't go pee for the next hour or two, ok? To clarify -- the two aspect ratios stuff above...I think we need a square-ish graphic logo and a rectangular graphic logo + slogan/text. Many web/mobile uses need square shapes (favicons/app icons) while website front pages often have a rectangular logo/slogan combo in the upper right corner. At any rate, I'm more generous than picky, so good luck!  I hope we see something great; we've already seen some great starts. I appreciate your foresight on this issue...Bitcoin needs to look as cool as it is, or people won't spend the time to learn how cool it is.   Modify bitaddress.org to print private keys onto the fancy banknotes Casascius commissioned:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92969.msg1044025#msg1044025The thread is long, but a good read! Some really good designs got funded.  We need a Bitcoiner population density map... I've got some to spare...but, since I really need to be sure you won't try to reverse the transaction and I don't want you to know who I am, I need to be paid in...uhh...Bitcoins! Yikes...I didn't hear about that one...should be easy to diff and find any nefarious code.  How many Bitcoiners live within a short drive of another Bitcoiner? I don't.  Wait...what scam? What are you guys talking about?  Oh man....why did I mortgage my house and convince my father to do the same?</sarcasm>
Very successful thread. Great designs guys.  I think we should stick with milli and micro and skip the centi.  Bitcointalk forum...revealing all passwords... Sounds like a service needing to be written...anyone up for making a web app for it? I'm riding the mediocre express... I got my BTC early, mostly for CPU mining for a few weeks, and have been an interested observer...I don't have enough to get rich (well, unless they shoot up to a few thousand a piece), but I don't have a lot of extra cash to risk. I'll get a real job soon enough...and perhaps them I'll think about investing...if it's not too late! Too funny. Nicely played MNW. Well filmed too.  Suddenly realizing I've lead a rather boring life... Can't wait to see it! Rock on...@coinabul -- can you update everyone on the status of the fund and how the funds will be paid out? Things have slowed down a bit as I think perhaps people believe your designer is the winner.  Correct. Radiology resident. As for the antivax stuff, it's more like a religious debate with antivaxxers...in part, under vaccination is why whooping cough is now epidemic in my state. Kids still die of this vaccine preventable disease.  Dude don't give away all our secrets! I wish more people would understand this...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see how this will work out in the end.  I wouldn't say Bitcoin is currently deflationary...in fact, the _inflation_ rate (as measured by the amount of new BTC created as a % of circulating BTC) is ridiculously high -- eg, how many coins existed 1 year ago cf. today?If you measure inflation by how much stuff costs, then every time the ticker goes up, bitcoin is deflating...but that's happening despite massive % increases in the coin supply...if governments tried to pull that of, their currency would lose tremendous % value.   TI basic on the TI-99 and cassette tape storage...and how cool the commodore64 was. Next thing I remember was upgrading from dos 3.3 to 6.22   +1. I can't find stuff anymore...I'll need to start "watching" more threads.  Sometimes raising a dead thread is a great idea...very good read.  For those of us scrolling through the thread on our phones, it would be great to collect all the winners in the original post...just a thought...things like scrolling through 20+ pages or using the search feature is a major PITA.   That's a little gloomy...I hear Switzerland is nice this time of year... or a month in the NICU! Dec -- I'd like to invite you to the logo competition here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=91068.0BTC44 up for grabs. If you need whitelisting to post your submission, it can happen. 
@Coinabul -- Any news from your meeting with the designer?  I'm liking the ||B logo...I see lots of potential there... Why is it that "depositing" coins in an exchange requires you to transfer coins to the exchanges BTC address? I mean, why do you give them complete control over your coin before you even decide to sell? Do exchanges use all the "idle" BTC for loans and stuff and just keep enough around to handle withdrawls?Maybe we should have to enter our private keys or transfer coins only when we place a sell BTC order...it seems to me that the exchange concept ignores some of the security features of Bitcoin in exchange for convenience and liquidity.  While MNW's flare for the dramatic is palpable...I think deep down everyone is curious if he can really pull this _huge_ endeavor off. We not talking trivial ideas here...it just seems too dufficult a project and rather hard to believe.  It's a little unwise to permit instantaneous irreversible withdrawals...anyone running the exchange who was watching events unfold would have known to halt trading...but once the funds are gone, you can't just roll it all back. If you won't program your computer to halt trading when ludicrous events occur, perhaps one should build a time delay in before withdrawals are permitted to allow time for human review. I feel bad for everyone who lost their funds.  I vote hack vs. scam vs. clever stunt by the exchange to get more deposits.  +1. Too funny! Any news? I'd say easy for some to lose. There is no denying that you'll always be able to find someone who can't understand Bitcoin, someone who is careless, and someone who is in too much of a hurry to think about security. I wouldn't call it a major problem of Bitcoin, but I wouldn't dismiss it outright. Not many people want money that disappears when their POS computer crashes.  Congrats!  That's a healthy weight! What a blessing.  May your death act bring you fame and fortune! Break a leg! (Strange as that sounds, that's a phrase of encouragement over here).  +1. Moving the decimal place doesn't change anything that isn't already easily handled by people familiar with the metric system. And it would seriously futz with the data types in the client.  Wow....strong work. Can this become a standard part of the satoshi client? I guess it's not a personal insult if you make your insults conditional and apply to everyone. I kinda take it personally....and so, to show you how I think personal insults should be handled, say hello to my ignore button.  Most people who would understand what p2p means and the implications therein don't need it in the logo...those that won't understand it wouldn't be all that interested in the decentralized aspect of Bitcoin anyway. Anyhow, multiple logo options are likely anyhow.  I've learned a little bit about graphic design from this thread...And its really a lot more complex than I realized. The ||B logo stands head and shoulders above all the other logos in the thread...It's got a lot of good ideas built into it.  If what we've seen is nothing so far, I can't wait to see what is in store.  I like the 2 line idea better...it sorta reminds people of the $ symbol...I just wish there was some way to evoke the same feeling of cash you get with $£¥...the text based B with the horizontal bar (a type-able symbol btw) helped evoke the sense of cash too...I wouldn't drop it for anything.  I like the lines at the top an bottom of the B shape...It screams "money." Unfortunately, I don't think that the "alarm clock" style display were are all familiar with now will be recognizable by my kids when they are my age. It's a technology of yesteryear, not a timeless symbol.  I think the only requirement for all coins generated in a block is that they sum to 50.  If I were running bitcoinica, I'd blame some kid too. I was rather taken aback at their deliberate attempt to make people believe that they know the one person who did it, rather than simply stating the evidence and demanding an explanation. Or better yet, to talk to the kid in private first and then go public with the findings. It's not just highly unprofessional to do it the way they did...it casts strong doubts on their motives. I don't think many people are paying attention to the deliberate attempt to sway opinion without argument.  I'd ask Luke-jr about this. All his pools payouts, no matter how small, are all newly generated coins. I bet you could pay him for 50 BTC1 newly mined blocks. Much cooler than the one transfer idea. 
Pardon my genuine ignorance...why is Bitcoin not currency? How about using the word "global" instead of decentralized or p2p?  Most people don't think of their money as centralized per se...most people see money as something specific to each country with no true "global" currency (although many international transactions are denominated in USD or euros, I would hesitate to call either a global currency).  I think the old, distinctive font was better...it stands out much better and sets a brand theme. Also, I would drop virtual and use the word electronic...it's real currency for real stuff...virtual currency to me means WoW dollars or Monopoly money.  +1 I love how this is turning out. The logo part still doesn't shout "hey, this is money" like the $ or old logo did...I very much like the look of this one though ... I like option 1 +2. Very insightful. Had to read it twice...I think understanding the present isn't always the best way to understand the future.  +1 the symbol on the left is a bit abstract, but I think you are on to something. The font choice is awesome. The colors look good.  The demographics of Iran seem to make it a fertile ground for adoption of Bitcoin: lots of young people, many un/under-employed college educated people, relative oppression of the young by the state...I ran a proxy server for computers in Iran after the last election debacle a few years back, hoping to be a small part of helping them take their own freedom from the govt.  Here's a start: Bitcoin is a new way to send money over the Internet. It's just like cash, so there is no credit card company or bank to take a fee, delay payment, or reverse transactions. Because it's like cash, payments can remain private.  I have my addresses in an iOS app I wrote...it's simple, but it works for me. More info in my signature.  Nice shots! ...Luke-jr is a pretty smart dude.  I use Bitcoin Ticker on my iPhone...I get non-email iOS alerts when the price crosses a certain threshold. Might suit your purposes just fine... The first person to buy a car with Bitcoin is totally gonna be more famous than that pizza guy  I presume he's the volatility maker...things need to move  a certain amount up and down for anyone to make money in a system where there is no intrinsic safety buffer provided by short selling. He needs to recycle his cash on each swing.  He makes each swing happen by using a small amount of funds to drive the price down and a larger amount to drive it up. The hyper-reactive lemmings do most of the dirty work for him by accepting the new price he sets and push the trend up or down farther than pirate has funds for. Then he capitalizes by trading against himself, much like the OP has been doing. I made 10% in one day by following similar logic (I used 8 and 8.75 as targets).  Casascius.com +1 Splitting the private key to front and back would increase security but would increase the rate of printing errors (imagine a single sided printer and multiple bills per page...multiple pages in a print job...you're just begging for mistake).  Isn't bitcoin still beta software? I would say proof of concept is a good description...soon to be a bit of an understatement though. 
A little over 500. Basically for free.  No radiology Q's yet I presume? My vote: (2||4), 3, 1 are you interpolating from the 2010 data and 2017 incremental GDP estimate? If so, your number should be about 30 trillion dollars (about 1000x less) Source? Sounds do able. The more electronic you make the paper note, the more it begs for a fully electronic implementation.  Apple wants to basically do this same idea with the new passbook program in iOS 6. For example, why not let your phone present a partial private key and your rsa fob the other part? Just a thought: could you have the QR code for the private key spit out a string that required a fingerprint to decrypt?This way, you could use your own fingerprint to keep the bill secure, and not worry about losing it. You could even have a place on the note for endorsing by placing an inked finger on it and leaving your mark. Might be a stupid/unnecessary idea, but it would solve the "oh no, he snapped a photo of my bearer bond" problem.  Give it a whirl...the right colors and it might work! Luke is too smart for me! +1 this is good.  A deed or title I suppose... Looked fine in safari on iOS and Mac.  Too funny. I ne'er did follow that tonal thing...tl;dr kinda thing. Anyhow, Luke is a good guy. I wonder what he'd think about the designs. I know he's held at least one BitBill before.  Very insightful. Very tough to do well. Aim for the skies boys! I like the role your own idea. Do you have any coins without the number of BTC printed on it? ...it would be hard for freicoin to have much value if everyone who got some realized they could grow their freicoin wealth by selling, buying anything inflating at less than the freicoin rate, and just waiting. This scenario benefits the last adopter most.  Why is it that the secret donator/VIP forum has me more motivated to donate than my altruism...we all know this site is great, why haven't more of us donated? A lot of people would spend a similar amount on something less fun, entertaining, or long lasting... Just would like to post my experience...I put BTC10 in and took BTC11 out a few weeks later. All transacting was very fast (considering its one hard working guy doing it and not a computer).  I'd have to agree...the current logo is ok...a little cute and unserious looking, but friendly and unthreatening. I'd like to see something better. I'll throw in BTC10 for a set of vector format public domain logos. I'd like to see a three colors (or less) version, a full color version, one that looks good in grayscale and in binary black and white. That set should all be "the same logo," so to speak (clearly each will be slightly different to accommodate the constraints). We need at least two logo sets with different aspect ratios: a square logo and a rectangular logo...not the same as each other, although one might contain the other.  I just realized, I'll have to add two lines to my iOS app for tracking addresses...I'll need to let users select an image of the new yet-to-be named bills and bearer bonds to assign to their address. I have Casascius coins as an option, but it would be cooler to have one of each type of coin/paper as a sub-option. 
Needs a little asymmetry to look really good. I'd move the Davinci photo off center...just like on the $20 bill I like this design...Anyone know anything about archival quality printing? A laminated version of this on archival stock/ink would be cool.  Wow...this could be huge. Best of luck! I've been coming around for a while, and I never knew you could get a tag for donating...silly me! The 720p version, not the old old version with the hard drive. I just sold mine a week ago for $185 on eBay. It was jail broken and had some open source software installed.  If you have the old version, it's going for above retail on eBay.  Hasn't changed my life yet, but, I hope it will someday. I've learned a smidge about pgp, but that's it really.  Oh, and I hope this isn't necroposting...I don't want a text laden image of a creepy guy reprimanding me.  ...just thought of another way bitcoin might get destroyed...What if Satoshi isn't gone... What if he is here, working on the protocol, client or a BTC business in our midst...and holds a few million Bitcoins...and we all realized our efforts at promoting bitcoin were only serving to keep the price up while he sold his coins.... Please note, there is no fact here...there is nothing to suggest this is true.  Mike -- if you make it, I'm buying it! The blockchain doesn't need to be as big as it is, right? It's in the white paper. I don't think the dev deities have implemented the method of decreasing the size of the block chain...yet.  As promised, here's my iPhone app:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mybitcoins/id539677499?ls=1&mt=8It's a buck... That is, until Apple takes Bitcoins.  Sweet.  It's not an amazing app or anything, but, I'm a resident physician (who's wife just had their third girl 1 week ago today) with limited time and skills...but hey, it works  Hello all. I suspect I'm not alone in that I have several offline bitcoin addresses. I have a smattering of Casascius coins, PrintCoins, BitBills, a vanitygen address, etc. I found it to be such a pain to keep track of what I had and how much it was all worth at the current market rate.  Well, now there's an iOS app for that. It is rather simple, but it works for me and it's dirt cheap!  My app is called myBitcoins and it's up on the AppStore:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mybitcoins/id539677499?ls=1&mt=8Now, some of you may be thinking, "Why did he name it myBitcoins?" The answer is simple -- I wrote it to keep track of my bitcoins. As I'm sure many of you know, there was a scandal where someone (afaik no one knows who) running a bitcoin web bank called mybitcoin.com who got people to hand over their money (BTC) for safe keeping....and...well....the rest is history. It's sad people lost their money, but it's time to reclaim the name. My app has nothing to do with the mybitcoin.com fiasco...and I'm a real person...not too tough to find should issues come up.  Glad you solved it. PrintCoins rocks.  It took me 1/2 an hour to explain the whole changing address thing to my mother in law...she at first thought all of bitcoin was a scam but eventaully came to understand how the changing address feature makes BTC more like cash. I highly recommend using a static address by default. The newbie doesn't need to know all the privacy advantages and associated nuances...at worst, bitcoin risks being misunderstood as something intrinsically nefarious. I would go so far as to say that the option to use a new address for each transaction should be made slightly difficult to get to (ie, anything not directly visible on the same screen as the balance /send money stuff...even further down on the page or hidden behind a folding menu on the same screen would be fine...those that can't find the option shouldn't be turning it on!) +1 to this. I wrote my software to start emulating this function of blockchain....I just hated logging in, so I made an app.  I have a 2 and 3.5 year old. I've got over a dozen Casascius coins. Both my girls seem to get the idea that the numbers on the sticker are what is valuable...my 2 year old asked where the sticker on her quarter was. Too cute.  I wish I would have seen these before submitting my app to the AppStore!Strong work. Interesting analysis.  I like the idea that people are more or less logical and tend to put their money in what seems relatively safe (when given two options). I would think there are some über BTC rich, but I wouldn't brag about it if in we're them either!
It would be interesting to see a rank order list...my ~500 BTC puts me in the top 20,000 (for the moment), but I seriously doubt there are 20,000 people with 500 BTC.  I think it would happen in a defamation, hysteria, legislation cycle. Throw in a few high profile prosecutions/imprisonments/assassinations (presumably of "terrorists"). US would forbid citizens to own or trade BTC and throw them in jail if they do (tough to prove a person guilty, so new privacy invading laws will be needed).  That would delay Bitcoins adoption...maybe by several years, IMHO.  Apparently I named it myBitcoins (had to check!). I thought about the mybitcoin.com fiasco (crime), but I seriously doubt I will get more than a dozen buyers, if that, no matter what it's called. I wrote the code for myself to use and it does what I want it to do. I am putting it up for $0.99...if there is any significant interest, I will spend time improving it for others (presumably for fellow forum members). If I were hoping to strike it rich, I would not pick the name (nor such a simple logo). While I feel bad for those who got ripped off in the mybitcoin.com theft, I remember thinking the whole time it was so stupid to deposit money with some guy no one knows. I think linking a real identity to a username is sorely needed to give Bitcoin more legitimacy, and I think Mike's work with Casascius coins is a great example. I'm also not a fan of announcing stuff in vapor ware style (cough...ellet....cough), but my stuff is done just awaiting the Apple review...and it's no where near as important/revolutionary as what MNW is claiming. Brian (1427284033) I will have to add transaction lists to it...right now it just converts first bits to addresses, confirms with block chain the balance, grabs a qoute from MtGox, and keeps them all in a list (more or less...you can select an icon for each address...eg, bitbills, casascius coins, easywallet, printcoin, etc). I wrote an iOS app (that is waiting for review) to help manage bitcoin addresses...pm me and I'll give you a free copy when (if) it gets approved. It's called myBitcoin. Hopefully will be available within a week.  Now I am confused....I thought the OP made a blatant attempt to get people to sell Bitcoins and the second poster demonstrated (rather hilariously) how to more directly connecting the dots...Or was the OP serious?  I didn't see an actual argument in the original post... How does this block chain checkpoint thing work?  Can one skip downloading the first 185 kBlocks? I heard via slashdot in July 2010. I hear talk about the first and second slashdotting, but I'm not sure when those two events occurred. All I know is that about a week or two after I started CPU mining, my laptop couldn't keep up with the big boys. But before that, I did ok. I freakishly generated (to repeat myself for the hundredth time) 4 blocks on my laptop in one night. When the mining got tough, I stopped and forgot about it all for nearlt year. Nearly lost my roughly 500 Bitcoins to a hard drive failure, but thanks to time machine, I inadvertently got it back....and ignored it some more. Then I heard about it again (I think on slashdot...could that be the second slashdotting?). I launched my long ignored client and found all my coins. Worked out well. Thank you Apple! Good to hear...I couldn't phonetically translate or even figure out how to say bit...found this for kilobyte:κιλομπάιτ...I presume the word is split like this... κιλομ/πάιτ...bit I'm not not certain where the μ goes  Don't ya think they'd use Greek letters to search?  Uhhh....what's a BFL?Is it like finding a DVT on PEX and having to get a CT CAP to r/o PE or pelvic VTE? Don't ya just hate it when you don't know the lingo? Has anyone searched old forum posts for lost coins from old members who may not have visited in a long time? Anyone want to correlate the OP's graph with a BTC price chart? I'd have typed it in java, but I don't have that kind of time Seriously though. Why publish so early? To what end? I'm confused.  Works well. Clever idea. Would be nice to be able to import public keys (watch address) and private keys ( for spending).  So many thoughts come to mind when seeing this dude...mostly things like:Haldol, olazapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, thorazine, clozapine...etcIt's a scary world out there.  I buy bitcoins...in the form of casascius coins, bitbills, lovebitcoins.org cards, printcoin checks, etc. I've got about 100BTC in these varying forms. Oh, and like any good bitcoin user, bitcoin magazine.  Bump. I hope this project is real. Sounds ridiculously cool...but oddly prematurely announced to no apparent advantage to anyone but the competition... [[[[head alloc] init] scratch] harder] 500, half from CPU mining.  Bitpak rocked and I'm sad to see it go. Could you resubmit it as a secure, verifiable pgp based broadcast  message delivery app?You could spin it as a numeric string sending program and have screen shots of vanity addresses like 1Comboxyz containing an 8 digit string for a locker combination. I do this already. It's really handy and I never have to worry about backups!Change the app name to batpik ad company to arminous megacorps...get a new developer membership and never mention bitcoin et voila...they will be none the wiser!
Connection issues... Is this device real?Elletsys.com won't load. Kickstarter finds nothing when searching or Ellet. Anybody know the creators? Love the idea!  I've got my order in and paid! I created my addresses using vanitygen offline and photographed the screen with the public and private keys. I then copied the addresses down by hand...then I copied it again by hand but reversed the case. I copied this set by hand again. Put memory card and paper in the safe. Tested 1 address (in and out via MtGox) and then sent my funds using the client into the unused addresses the safe. I put my full set of bitbills and bitbill bank card in the safe and some of my casascius coins too...but I kept my 25BTC and silver 10BTC casascius coins out to play with...oh, and I kept my casascius bearer bar out as a mini bank. Those are just too cool to put away  Well done guys! Great piece on bitcoin transactions. Great magazine -- I read every page.  Was out of town for a week. Got very excited to see my new bitcoin card and copy of bitcoin magazine (which is also great) and forgot too look at the stamp  Anyhow, the card is great. Much more durable and stiff than the bitbills were. You guys did a great job (presuming my card is redeemable...I'm not trashing it to get my BTC back so soon!)Any plans for a bank card?  Just put the public address in place of the verify code and the matching private key behind the hologram and stamp 0 on it (or bearer card, etc).  The private key is printed in human readable form next to the QR code. You can redeem it at Mt. Gox (and via other web sites and by at least one unix-y method.  No worries.  It's a different printing system on the hidden side for the private key.   Rock on! I hope this works out well for you guys. It's a great idea.  My understanding is that this is a totally legit business plan but totally legit folks. But I'm sure that these are real people with real lives....jobs, kids, health, etc. I am hoping they can ship soon, but I more just want them to iron the business details out. This idea is too good and will benefit the community too much to fail.  That's good to hear. I think their idea will really help the bitcoin community spread. The expiring bitcoin card is brilliant. I'll just have to be patient. I have no problem with that. Revolutionary ideas take time  Are these guys for real?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=73978.0;allThey've got an awesome idea for bitcoin gift cards, but the radio silence after accepting bitcoins and not shipping the cards is a little disconcerting. I put 10 BTC in, so it's not a big deal to me if it's a scam. Just a shame (and such a great idea gone to waste!). Anyone else in this situation? How's it going?  This is why I didn't spend much...I'm starting to think that was wise :-/ Fantastic idea. You could put some of the private key on the outside and some on the inside without any real security risk.  Have any of these shipped yet?  Hope you got lots of orders! What does the binary inscription on the gold coin say?25btc=you asked for change, we gave you coins10btc silver =bitcoin, an idea too big too fail(or something like that)I've got 12 series 1 1BTC coins, 2 series 2 1BTC, and one each of the 5, 25, and 10 BTC coins. Oh, and a bearer bar. They look cool with my bitbill set. We shall see if the lovebitcoins.org cards look good in the mix shortly.  Has anyone gotten theirs yet?  First impressions? I can't wait to see how they stack up against my bitbill set.  If I order a second silver round, can I get one with a silver hologram to go with my gold one...or do you have a bunch of prestickered silver/gold combos you need to move first? Are you going to use silver stickers on the 5btc coins? A few other points:These are proof struck. Very deep field. Slightly thicker and smaller diameter than an American Eagle 1 oz silver coin. Reeded edge It's not a copy of the 25 BTC coin scaled down. The binary inscription is different. This is probably the hardest struck coin i have.  Anyone who thinks vladimir's idea is a bad one must realize that of he doesn't do it, someone will. In fact, if no one try's hard to build powerful rigs, that is equivalent to bitcoin not being valuable (otherwise people would do hard things like design ASIC chips and assemble mining farms and companies to earn valuable bitcoins). I think it is a good thing for bitcoin that people are treating them as valuable enough to work hard to mine them in a professional manner. Everyone should try to do what Vladimir is doing, instead of saying no one should work that hard to earn bitcoins (and hence implying that bitcoins aren't valuable enough to work really hard for). I think this means bitcoin is moving from hobby to capitalism. 
Why does the expiration mean on the front of the card? You don't take back the bitcoins if left unused for a certain period of time....right?  I got my silver bitcoin today...I couldn't resist opening it up and playing with it.  Might have to order another one to keep all nice and shiny looking.  Does anybody know if the silver bitcoin has a different message encoded in binary on the back than the 25 BTC coin? CPU mined a few hundred on my laptop July 2010 in a few days....I heard about bitcoin via slashdot....difficulty shot up real quick and I forgot about bitcoin for about a year.  Luckily I didn't loose them.  Nice shots! I like that idea! I rarely venture over to this board, but I guess I should have sooner. Anyhow, I recently ordered one of the 10 BTC silver coins and I'm very eagerly awaiting it's arival. Anyone have these in hand? What do you think of it? I think they look really cool. I'm a bit of a coin nerd and my 25BTC coin is my favorite to keep in my pocket. The binary inscription on the reverse is brilliant. I might need to buy a second one to break out of the case and carry around...it might be my new favorite pocket coin (and I've got lots). http://casascius.appspot.com/group?type=5 http://casascius.appspot.com/group?type=5I've got one of these heading my way...as a coin nerd, I'm quite excited. I have one of the 25 BTC coins and it's my favorite coin to carry around. Very cleverly designed binary inscription on the reverse too!Anyone have one in hand already? In my head I had been calling μBTC "Mikes" and mBTC "Millies". I think this slang terminology was discussed here elsewhere. I also internally called 5 Satoshis (base units) a little bitnickel...10 Satoshis a little bitdime , etc while calling 0.05, 0.10, 0.25 BTC a big bitnickel, big bitdime, etc...I guess medium versions for Millies could be considered too (ie 0.25 mBTC being a millie bitquarter).  Great time to use your Casascius coins....or bitbills... I got my 25 BTC coin today...wow...as a hobbyist coin collector, I must say, this one was pressed with gusto...it's more like a mini 3D sculpture than a plain coin...the relief (in numismatic terms) is ultra high. It feels great in the hand...as does the gold plated bar!Well done again, casascius! DrG,I'll be your consulting radiologist. I'm currently in training in southeast MN. DrGoss (hopefully not too confusing!)1GCDzqmX2Cf513E8NeThNHxiYEivU1ChhePS - please direct all questions to DrG...Radiologists are docs for docs  Lol...I generated 200 BTC in one night on a laptop...back before there even was mining. That method didn't work very long, thanks to slashdot. http://www.uofr.net/~bcg/a.jpg Didn't ther used to be a noob filter for this forum? sure didn't take long for someone to import that address...I better take the BTC off it  this is prettier:Pattern: 1Combo                                                                Address: 1Combo78Edke1PrKEhYwwpGmEES9zBZmc3 Rock on!anyone want a locker com addr? It ain't pretty Address: 1LCKrcMBhZtBbJyETwN41UvCen6jpNz5tUPrivkey: 5JqTbKW74pQVumabM84eUQmJmLw7fJYyWunHhr2Cy6FeLuh1dE8 Perhaps a silly idea, but, if I created a vanity address like 1lockercomb....and funded it with 0.12027016, would I always be able to see that transaction? What if I took the BTC off the address? Will the transaction always be in the block chain?I had my locker combination in a note on my phone, but somehow lost it...it would be nice if something more permanent could keep track of this kinda stuff for me  About as legit as my new Pope coins...if you mine enough you go to heaven...or you can buy some from me  As a proud owner of a dozen original casascius coins, I'd like to say you're moving in a great direction. Could you laser engrave a private key into a gold card (securely)? That would be the most permanent offline wallet. Anyhow, great job once again! ...or generate an address, write down the private key on paper...destroy the digital copy, put paper somewhere safe. Now your savings address is as safe as it can be from hackers. 
฿THAI CURRENCY SYMBOL BAHTUnicode: U+0E3F, UTF-8: E0 B8 BFon a mac...goto edit, special characters...search for baht...copy...paste. try Alt +E3F...not sure if it'll work...otherwise, you might have to pick the symbol from a font picker... Ditto. Why?Also, why can't we take the encrypted wallt.dat file off of Dropbox and load it into out computer bitcoinclient?Anyhow, congrats on a solid iOS client. You've done the heavy lifting! It's all polish from here on out! (necessary polish, but, polish none the less).  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_MUSMOemxoHQ/S_GCyziGg2I/AAAAAAAAAAs/0ikCivddX1s/s1600/563px-Official_gnu.svg.png1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C ...does anyone else hear Simon & Garfunkel playing?1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C looks like the friendly advice giver was correct.... Doug (a la bitbills) is working on bringing things back up...he has revamped his website in preparation for taking new orders. I have a bunch of bitbills, but I got them mostly as collectors items...(same as my awesome casascius coins)... ...honestly, who cares?  Simple crap can be fixed simply...putting together a production process is step 1 to making a streamlined, cheap way to produce long term physical representations of BTC...the last thing we want are central bit coin banks to issue their own coins with no private key (only the promise to redeem them for one on demand)...the start of fractional reserve bit coin banking I think could end up being a very bad thing... Got mine too...and three demo pieces for the kids to play with.  They look great next to my bit bills  Forgive me if this was already discussed, but the address pictured had no value at the time of the original post...now it contains 1 bitcoin...are you loading them as you fill orders? Are the private addresses really destroyed (save the copy in the coin)?Btw - Like bitbills.com, this is a great idea...and quite frankly, I don't give a crap if you can't spell (or edit, really) and don't know jack about Latin. Getting the product out the door and the ingenuity to get the project up and running is far more important in the real world...a much more important contribution to Bitcoin than some pompous @$$ (not quoted) and his comments. DrG1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C well done...and fast code too!DrG1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C Nice custom strap...price is way too high for a 7750.  If you want to spend 1/2 that, try www.ball.com and find truly luminous watches. I think $650 tops for the watch and $100 bucks for the strap is upper reasonable. I kinda think we should play nice...I mean, if we don't protect those who are creating and inventing and pushing the limits of what can be done with bitcoins, we all lose...everyone is gonna make a mistake, but if we encourage the clever ones and hassle the dumb ones to do the right thing, we'll all be better off.  DrG1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C I don't think this is good advice....sorry...I think a much better idea would be to create an address & private key pair on a "live" OS, write both down on paper, attempt an import into a wallet to prove you copied correctly, and then reboot to "hide the evidence"...Now, if you are really nuts, memorize the private key and 6 or so initial chars in the public address (in case you don't trust your paper or ink)...put your paper with the public and private keys in a safety deposit box...That's way more secure than optical or magnetic media (which will degrade faster than paper) and way more resistant to cosmic rays than solid state media....obviously nothing is invulnerable to physical attack DrGoss1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C Hey...how about I pay you in BTC instead of cash...it's simple...just download some buggy software, fire it up, and wait several hours...then, you can confirm that I really sent you the BTC that I claimed...Oh, by the way, did I mention there will be ~1GB download?This is better than cash?  Not for everything.  We need to trim the block chain to a still safe but manageable size, IMHO.  14 months ago, this issue was barely noticeable...now, it's a problem.DrGoss1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C If I put, say, 10 mBitcoins into an address, does the block chain contain enough info to follow those 10 mBitcoins even if they are split into uBitcoins over many transactions? I suppose if they GoldBits are only ever split and BTC are never added to a GoldBit address, then the info would be there...but as soon as Bitcoins were added to an address that contained GoldBits, the next split would be impossible to parse into BTC and gBTC...maybe a dilution factor could be calculated?I agree that independent, decentralized verification would have to be in place for this to work...kinda like a separate block chain idea also mentioned here...people need some hope of gain to participate in verification...I guess a transaction fee lottery might work  I upgraded to the newer OpenSSL hoping to compile with Dino's makefile...it pooped out...oddly enough, things compiled after running make against the makefile.osx in the package followed by running Dino's. It's a pretty simple makefile, but I confess to not digging into it, I was just kinda happy that it worked! I'm sure you could just ask...I mean, if you've got a valid reason to be in the forums faster than the rules allow, you should discuss with a moderator. I get by all sorts of rules in day to day life by appealing to reason...you just need a good reason. DrGoss1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C Don't get me wrong, bitcoin doesn't need backing any more than the US dollar does...and this concept is exactly the opposite of what makes bitcoin awesome...but say I had 1 kg of gold (which I don't) and wanted to promise to present a share of the gold to anyone who held a bitcoin...preferably a subset of all bitcoins that I charged a premium for...and call them GoldBits or something equally silly...would it be as easy as duplicating the www.bitbills.com setup and fixing the total number of shares to issue? Redemption would be by returning a valid bitbill with only the original transaction on it and shipping off the gold...in this sense, bitbills could be used to share anything (as long as you trust the central authority...always a bad idea but could work amongst friends or certain groups). On a completely unrelated note, anyone looking to compile vanitygen or oclvanitygen (to get an address like this: 1DrGossc3QidjzgDXzveCAQGiPWsoiDZ8C) on a Mac, pm me...the makefile for v0.17 on github and the makefile in the forum don't quite cut it. I'm just a "newbie" by forum rules, so I can't post elsewhere. DrGoss I think this point needs to be stressed in the BTC documentation...it's kinda like the uncertainty principle: the more useful the work, the less suitable it is to being proof-of-work for currency purposes (kind of like how Heisenberg himself misled the Nazi's doing "useful" work on the bomb)...
