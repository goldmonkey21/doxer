So far I've bought some glbse shares and 4 fpga mining cards.   Well, been a member on here for months lurking around and reading posts.  I figured I ought to be come a contributing member of society so Hello all! Yes, since applying this patch I've generated 2 blocks. The original patch posted is working just fine for me (Opteron 2376), and did double my performance over the stock 0.3.6 client.  I was even able to port its minor changes to 0.3.7 successfully, with the same results.Is there a way we can confirm that the variables are being aligned properly?  I'm wondering if the Intel procs are less tolerant of misalignment than the AMD's.
