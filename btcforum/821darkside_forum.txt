I don't think. An athlon 2200+ 1.51Ghz and 1.5Go of ram. Hello,I installed your soft one month ago.It is said, it "only" the free cpu. That's right, when i want to watch a divx etc.. no problem, no lag.But recentely i installed freenet, this mean too other soft : fuquid, thaw, frost, fms.And i have problems when bitcoin is active, freeze.If i "control+alt+del" to set the priority level at very low for bitcoin, it solves the problem.On this panel control, priority cpu level for bitcoin is "normal".Of course, the problem could be from one of other softs running.But, it could be very usefull on window xp to select the level of cpu priority you want in setting tool. Because all run auto when window run. and the best is not to have to set manually each time.For exemple, at the same time I run :-freenet-emule-frost-fms-fuquid-mozilla.-bitcoin-watching a divx.When i have a freeze, set cpu priority from normal to low for bitcoin, solve the problem. And bitcoin is still running.Thanks for your work and your idee, a great idee.In hope the next update will solve this.cheers ^^.
