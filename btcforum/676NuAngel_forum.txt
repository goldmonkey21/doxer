Given how hard they are to generate, in my opinion (if I worked 24 hours a day for 3 weeks, I'd certainly expect more than 50 cents)...  I'd have to say that 1 BTC is worth about $800.  I'll trade my 5 BTC for a PS3.Given there's no realistic way to determine the value of something which is randomly generated, I'm giving up on it.My 5 coins from bit faucet will go to you, martin, just because your address is listed.  They're all yours, knock your socks off.  Don't spend'em all in one place...  or do...  if you can...  good luck.NuAngel Are there odds that you'll NEVER be the first?     Think I'll be uninstalling.  Evidently my computer isn't fast enough to compete or "earn" money.Nu I've had BitCoin installed and running practically 24/7 since July 23rd.  My KHASH/S value is only about 352 - Pentium 4 Dual Core 2.8Ghz w/ 2 GB of RAM.  My Balance of coins has not gone up, even though I've processed 72,110 blocks.Am I ever going to see a sudden burst of BTC's or will my balance show "one" some time in mid-August??NuAngel
