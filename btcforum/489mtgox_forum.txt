Hello EveryoneI created mtgox on a lark after reading about bitcoins last summer. It has been interesting and fun to do. Im still very confident that bitcoins have a bright future. But to really make mtgox what it has the potential to be would require more time than I have right now. So Ive decided to pass the torch to someone better able to take the site to the next level.MagicalTux has already contributed a lot to the bitcoin community and in many ways he will be better at running the site than I was. He has much more experience with web programming, system administration and integrating with banks and other payment processors than I do. Everything will still work the same as always for the time being. But expect a lot of positive changes after he takes over including:Automatic (and free) funding from Euro accounts.Automatic ACH deposit and withdrawal.Margin trading.Interface redesign.Lifting the $1000 a day withdrawal limit.Thanks to everyone that has supported mtgox so far. Cant wait to see BTC hit $10!I can still be reached on the forum as "jed" or through fivegrinder.com Yeah the new server is up. The DNS will just take awhile to update. If you are in a hurry you can try flushing your DNS or put 174.121.74.59 in your hosts file TheKoziTwo: I checked the IRC logs. There is nothing in there about this trade.Here is my post for a 3rd time since it keeps getting buried and people keep asking why I haven't posted. BCEmporium: He was withdrawing $1000 a day since he first deposited. ShadowOfHarbringer: What more do you want me to say then this:You want me to just keep posting that over and over? There wont be anything new to say until baron gives me more info. Here is a more complete rundown of what happened with the baron account.Person A had their mtgox account compromised by Person B.Day1: Person B sent ~3000BTC (the mtgox $1000 a day limit at the time) from person A's account to an address owned by baron.Day2: Person B sent ~3000BTC (the mtgox $1000 a day limit at the time) from person A's account to an address owned by baron.Day3: Person B sent ~3000BTC (the mtgox $1000 a day limit at the time) from person A's account to an address owned by baron.Day4: Person A logs into their account and notices the missing BTC. They change their password and contact me about the theft.DayX: Person B finds an exploit in my LR code and manages to send himself a good deal of LR from the site.DayY: Person B steals money from 2 other mtgox accounts after compromising them with a dictionary attack. This is discussed elsewhere.I have talked to Person A on the phone extensively both before and after the theft.  He had much more in his account than what was stolen.baron claims that he bought the BTC in question from someone on IRC with Liberty Reserve (LR). He hasnt been able to provide any evidence of this transfer. I see nothing even close in the IRC logs of bitcoin-otc about this transfer. To believe barons story we have to believe:1) A thief would trust a random person on IRC they have never met before and no one else on the channel knows to send them $3000.2) The thief would transfer directly from mtgox to the buyer before knowing how much BTC they would end up stealing from mtgox.3) baron cant remember his nick, the thiefs nick, or the IRC channel that was used for the trade. 4) baron can no longer find the record of the LR transaction.5) baron is unable to talk to me on the phone because according to him he is mute.baron also refuses to provide proof of who he is or where he lives.We are left having to assume that baron is in fact person B. barons account on mtgox holds less than the sum of theft by person B. ----As I have said previously we dont want to be the bitcoin police and this will hopefully not be necessary in the future since we have fixed these security issues that allowed Person B to steal from us and other users in the first place. Bimmerhead: I'm waiting for him. He isn't waiting for me. I've been trying to get him on the phone since this happened. Also I'm not holding his funds because I think he bought stolen BTC. I'm holding them because there is a chance he stole BTC. BCEmporium: How can you say what you would do when you don't know what is really happening? If I allow him to trade and he is a scammer it is very easy to send the majority of his money to another account just by clearing out the order book and then trading with another account he makes.And of course I have talked to the victim and am convinced his account was stolen from. I don't enjoy just blocking random people's accounts. I wouldn't do it unless there really was no other option. wow 16 pages!Guys I really don't want to go into details about this until it is resolved. If baron is in fact a scammer the less he knows about what I know the better. I'm still talking to baron and trying to get to the bottom of this.  There is pretty strong evidence that this guy was involved in some theft of BTC. I'm trying to talk to him to make absolutely certain. Just post this on criagslist. Someone will do it for sure. sgornick: is that number of nodes online at that time? That is way more than I expected. People keep asking me so...The only accounts that were compromised were cryptofo and one other who I emailed. No other accounts were compromised. If you are still worried about it simply change your password.I've paid out a lot to fraudsters since I started mtgox. But I admit I should have had something in place to prevent successive login attempts. But also a password such as abcd1234 is 4 letters and 4 numbers but would be found very quickly by any attack like this.  Anyway it seems fair to restore half your coins.  Almost everyone had transactions from "united". It does NOT mean that your account was compromised. It does mean that the attacker has your username. It was just them using the merchant API to send you 0 BTC.There were only two accounts that had money stolen from them as far as I can tell.It was a dictionary attack since I saw it happening.I plugged the vulnerability that allowed them to run the attack so your weak passwords will be safe again.I'm still working out with cryptofo if/how to reimburse him.Ideally Liberty Reserve would help us since they can easily fix the issue. But they don't seem to be cooperating. Anyone have ideas there? > Any news from mtgox and getting his bitcoins back?Yeah it is unfortunate. I've contacted Liberty Reserve about it. I fixed it so they can't use this attack anymore. I think his and one other account (I've emailed you) were the only two compromised. Anyone with a decent password would be safe. strule: I can handle some Euro withdrawals now. strule: yes you should be able to withdraw Euros middle of next week. I had to do this also. They seem fine to me I've bought a lot from them. I'm just going to convert EUR -> USD right now to keep things simple. I might set up EUR <-> BTC later if the volume is big enough.I'll use this exchange rate: http://xurrency.com/api/eur/usd/1
We now have a European bank account so can accept deposits cheaply from the EU. email for details. I think to most people the benefit over other payment methods is:no feeability to do micro transactionsanyone can use itMost people won't care about the austrian economic/libertarian aspects.  I should be accepting euros sometime next week. Why not just use mtgox? You can sell them there for that right now and get LR. Also you can use the dark pool at mtgox which is a great way to get a large amount of BTC at current market prices.  So depending how the network routing works it might be vulnerable to this attack when the cartel has < 50% of the network. It could maybe work something like this:Cartel maintains as many connections to other nodes as it can. When the cartel finds a block it only tells the other cartel members. When a non-cartel block is found, the cartel publishes the previously found block.Since the cartel has many connections chances are > 50% of the network will accept the cartel block over the non-cartel block and thus the cartel block would become part of the main chain.repeatThe cartel's advantage would be that the rest of the network would essentially be doing nothing during the time the cartel found a block till the time someone else finds a block. So the cartel would get a much larger % of blocks than it should. So you don't have to have anywhere near 50% of the processing power. You just have to be faster to get your saved block on the chain. What happens when two people both transmit a different valid next block? How does the network determine which chain to keep growing? Paypal is only holding $5,000 now. > If we all withdraw money, can MtGox guarantee no bank runIf everyone withdraws their money that is the definition of a bank run so I suppose there would be one if there is one. I think you are asking will I cover the missing $5k. Yes I am covering it. Both options and margin trading are on the to do list. > Is an order publicly visible if someone selects "dark pool and normal"?Nope Doesn't this just shift who is taking the risk? A sends Item to BB gets Item.B claims he never got Item.B gets his bitcoins back.Am I missing something? Ok I'm going to accept paxum manually right now and if there is any demand I'll automate it.So send me an email letting me know you are adding funds this way. And send the funds to paxum@mtgox.com. They charge $0.25 to transfer funds. BiddingPond: Sorry no sandbox. I'd just put it up on a non-public URL and try. There is no transaction fee so you aren't really losing anything. Well. the market would have dropped to about .05 without darkpools. I don't know if etrade runs a dark pool but there are dark pools for probably everything traded on etrade.The dark pool seems to be working very well. It is allowing people to place big orders closer to the market price. The result is greater depth, tighter spreads and less wild swings of the market. brocktice: Your proposal is there now. There was a bug that kept it from showing up. btw each group has its own forum so you could post your proposal there since it is really a discussion.Oh I see your group doesn't have a forum. The group admin needs to create the initial forum categories. He just needs to start some topics. you are right it is just on the real time mega chart. Don't worry I'll post the entire order book soon. LobsterMan: You should be able to? Can you send me an email explaining what is going wrong?Freemoney: Mega Chart does have the entire order book. That is where he is getting it fromkiba:2. There isn't a fee for sending funds5. Like I said on IRC your notify_url wont be hit until the transaction has 6 confirmations. Are you sure it isn't being hit after that? Yes email is the best way to tell me about bugs or feature requests. No I won't drop LR I have a paxum account so if anyone wants this let me know and I'll set up withdrawal to paxum.
Is anyone interested in adding or withdrawing money on mtgox with paxum? They seem better than LR.  I like ⓑ. It looks like the bitcoin logo. ฿ isn't bad but it looks too much like $ I think.   Ah I wanted to see this chart. But...What are those data points? There should be a ton after the price spike to .5 that are much lower. That curve doesn't seem to fit the actual data? Was the price just sampled right when the difficulty changed? Could you sample more frequently. I think the graph will look pretty different. I think I never actually posted this here but I made http://FiveGrinder.com. It allows you to form a group and democratically determine how to spend the group treasury which can be denominated in either BTC or USD. aurumxchange.com only charges 1% for a bank wire. kiba: that is fixed.ribuck: heh. Yes I need to make this more clear. The slider is your vote. It uses range voting so you give each proposal a rating from 1-100.You only spend your group fee no mater what proposals pass or how many you vote for. So you can vote on as many proposals as you want.  I just added the ability to donate to the group so you can increase the treasury. > On one thought, the democratic structure of five-grinder could leave our treasury drained due to people voting themsleves money.But other people also have to vote for them to get the money. And they won't without a good reason. mpkomara: If you select "dark pool and normal" it works more like what TTbit said since it will also fill against the normal orders."Dark pool only" will also fill if there is a single normal order that is large enough. > So if I am understanding this correctly this is the same as writing a trading bot that watches to see if there is a certain size bid at a certain price and only then issues the offer?Well not exactly since the other bid isn't displayed either. It is just asks and bids that don't show up on the order book.TTBit: No if you select dark pool only, you will only get filled from the dark pool. So your bid wont get filled until some one else places an ask on the dark pool that crosses yours.Right no one can see the dark pool orders. dust can you email me I'll still report that the trades happen. I just added the ability to add buy and sell orders to the mtgox Dark Pool. The dark pool allows you to buy or sell large quantities of BTC without moving the market.You can mark any buy or sell order with a value over $1000 as being in the dark pool.Orders in the dark pool don't show up on the order book.More info here: http://mtgox.com/support/darkPool It doesn't require javascript on your site. But there is javascript on our checkout page that the users are sent to. I'll change it to allow you to withdraw whatever amount you added instantly. I wont have time to do this till wednesday probably. >And I also know many people who says that mtgox absolutely incorrect shows trading info.bitcoinex:  What trading info is incorrect? davout: It is just a display issue. You really have something like $11.487 in your account. So just withdraw one penny less. I'm not using floats to store the account balances.   I suppose I should just floor the amount displayed. Yeah I wanted to do it in javascript. But I can just port this. Thanks. Can someone point me to code somewhere that determines if a string is a valid bitcoin address? ok works in chrome for real now. It works in chrome now
I'm in the process of making a real time chart you can order from. It still has a ways to go but it shows data much nicer than the old charts so I'll go ahead and post a link: http://mtgox.com/trade/testThis probably doesn't work in IE. who just bought bitcoin.com? I was trying to buy it from that guy and you grabbed it out from under me! It is trivial to make this button using mtgox checkout:<form action="https://mtgox.com/merch/checkout" method="post" >   <input type="hidden" name="business"      value="Your MtGox Username">   <input type="hidden" name="currency_code"   value="BTC">   <input type="hidden" name="item_name"      value="Donation to Blah">         <input type="hidden" name="amount"      value="5">   <input type="hidden" name="return"      value="http://yourdomain.com/thanks">       <input type="submit" value="Donate BTC"  /></form>This will donate 5 BTC. dust: I'm sure it will slow thing down a bit. but this fee is about the same as on forex and there are tons of bots on there.shadow: We'll see how much it ends up being. there are other ongoing costs that I have to cover also. If someone wants to be a mtgox $ exchanger talk to me since I can waive your trading fee for doing this. jgarzik: I might do some sort of flat fee all you can trade for a month type thing. grondilu: I'm not selling any bitcoins. All transactions are between the users. mtgox is just an exchange. sturle: I covered almost $5000 in paypal fraud I have to make it back somehow sorry. Finally got some LR in my account. Sorry it took so long. > how about ach deposit?I haven't gotten that set up yet. If it is a large amount ($800+) I'll handle it manually though. send me an email. Nice logos. I want to use them on mtgox.com. who do you want me to attribute them to? bitboy? Also if anyone is in the US and wants ACH (check to your bank account) withdrawal email me.  I'll escrow the gox USD if it makes either party feel safer. morpheus doesn't have a lot of posts but he is in the top 10 traders on mtgox so he has been around. I bought a bunch from aurumxchange. I'm just waiting for the wire to go through. These things take a while that is why I started this thread to see if some one had some now that I could buy.Anyway they tell me it should be there tomorrow. aurumexchange.com had the best rate I found. I haven't gotten my LR from them yet though so I'm not sure how long the process takes. I wouldn't have to ID you. Say:You deposit X BTC. You open a position for Y BTC/USD.  BTC/USD goes down a little so your position is only worth (Y-X). I liquidate your position. Now mtgox has (Y-X) + X which = Y which is the amount of the loan.The exchange hasn't lost anything so I don't need to know who you are. They never get a negative balance. Their account would be margin called (positions liquidated) before that. It isn't exactly a loan. It works basically like this:http://www.babypips.com/school/lots-leverage-and-profit-and-loss.htmlIf your margin balance drops too low all your positions are liquidated. It basically allows you to increase your return or your loss from trading.It would be pretty risky with how volatile the current market is but some people might be into it. Would anyone be interested in Trading BTC/USD on margin? Like how trading is done on most forex sites? sturle: I've bought enough LR to support withdrawing again. I'm just waiting for this wire to the seller to complete. So you should hopefully be able to withdraw on thursday.
S3052: Well I'm hoping a 3rd party will set up this service with various funding methods. It would be fairly lucrative if they just charged .5% to add or remove mtgox USD. I never stopped accepting new users.And like ribuck said the volume has been way higher for some reason since the paypal thing. davout: If you want liqpay I can do a small withdrawal that way. I have some liqpay balance left from the brief time it was open. email me. kiba: Thanks for the sentiment but I'm trying to get the exchange fully functional again before I worry about trying to make a profit. I'm not in danger of being under capitalized. FreeMoney: I think all Forex exchanges charge a per trade fee. It isn't very much though.noagendamarket: there aren't enough users to make anything from adsense. Well the process to get LR from any of these places takes several days. So I've suspended LR withdrawal until I can get some LR in the mtgox account. So still if anyone has a lot of LR and wants to help get the exchange working again please email me. jgarzik: I don't see the option on the site. I emailed them though and got this response:funny since it is their blog...idev & Drifter: thanks these seem good. I had only looked at that bsrates.com site and all those charge a lot. Hi as a lot of you know mtgox recently switched to using LR as a payment processor. The problem is I have a bunch of cash in my bank account that I need to convert to LR so people withdraw their mtgox USD. I'm trying to buy a bunch of LR on exchangezone but the process seems like it will take a couple weeks. So if anyone is holding LR could I buy it from you with a bank wire or ACH? Thanks for any help. jimbobway: yes once paypal unfreezes my account I'm pretty sure I will be able to send you your money from it. If I can't then I'll open a 2nd account to do this. but you are buying BTC so why do you care if the Gox USD is backed or not? Keefe: paypal will give it back. Even if they don't things will be fine. I'm treating LR USD just like USD. I didn't make it a 3rd currency.twobitcoins: I'm still trying to get ACH but it doesn't look good. kiba: you misunderstood me. You can withdraw with Liberty Reserve.  Ok I've given up the search and started integrating Liberty Reserve. You can now add payments with LR.I'm doing withdrawals manually for now. ExchangeZone.com seems the best place to buy and sell LR since you can do it with out the crazy commission the other exchangers charge.Please email me if you have issues. esop: please read the original post if you want to know what happened. I'm not sure what you are rambling about after that but you seem like a troll. Do you even have a money in mtgox? You can now send and receive BTC and USD from other Mt Gox users. This means that people wanting to get USD into Mt Gox just need to find people that want to get USD out of Mt Gox and then trade USD by whatever method they can agree on (Paypal, LR, AlertPAy, Cash etc)I'm hoping a few people will try to do this formally the way LR has exchangers. There is a merchant API so it should be easy to automate if you want. Please email me if you are interested and need help getting set up.Anyway use this thread to list offers to buy or sell mtgox USD. Ok you can send your mtgox BTC or USD to anyone else now. So people who want to withdraw funds just need to find someone that wants to add funds. This isn't the final solution of course but it should help people that need their money ASAP. esop: What is your point? I'm not hiding. I'm still here.kiba: I haven't implemented it. There doesn't seem to be much interest.AlertPay: We violate their acceptable use policy.I'm still waiting for our registration to be approved by our ACH provider. Hopefully that will happen begining of this week. Monday you should be able to send BTC or USD to other mtgox users. This will allow 3rd parties to buy and sell mtgox usd for paypal or whatever other method they want.  (You can actually do this now with the mtgox merchant api) Keefe: Yes I'm adding ACHS3052: > I also echo the request to enable a universal and globally acceptable withdrawal.I want the same thing you do. Please let me know if you find a good one. If anyone wants to withdraw USD but can't use liqpay and doesn't have a US bank account send me an email and we'll figure out how to get you your funds. moneybookers said mtgox.com violates their acceptable use policy.I'm talking to paynearme.comstrule: I'm not european so I can't open a european bank account.  Ok liqpay should be working now. Please let me know if you have issues.
If anyone is willing to help me test liqpay can you please email me. info @ mtgox gumtree: Is there a way to automate this? You can set the budget of any proposal. So just make the one you want passed to be 50% of the total. davidonpda: ACH is fine for the US. But I think less than half of the gox users are from the US. So I want to get a global solution up first. I don't see how currency fair helps? They don't let you transfer to particular people.> Would you consider getting a consortium of interested parties together to fund a merchant account so that you could accept direct bank transfers? I don't think US banks do this. They have either wire transfers or ACH.  nanotube & cavden: LR is 1% to transfer between accounts. To convert cash to LR is 5% or more and to convert it back to cash is 5% or more. So it becomes quite expensive.nanotube: I probably will still set up ACH. It takes more time though.bitcoinex: I don't have a bank account in Europe so I can only do bank transfers in the US. I could wore to europe but this is expensive and I haven't found an automated way to do that.I'm not saying liqpay is perfect. I haven't used them enough to know how shady they are. But there doesn't seem to be a good alternative at this point.  Do they allow you to send money between accounts or only do currency exchange? I got liqpay to work finally so we will be using that. I should have it hooked up tuesday. Kiba: It isn't an issue of time. It is that I haven't found a good alternative. Here are the only choices I have so far:ACH (only works in the US)LibertyReserve: (ok except expensive to transfer in and out)Okpay: (Even more expensive than LR but possibly more funding and withdrawing options)Ones that wont work:AlertPay, Amazon: (still has chargebacks and mtgox isn't in their Acceptable Use Policy AUP)liqpay: (I can't get the SMS from the 4 phones I tried)Moneybookers: (violates their AUP)click2pay: (No US sign-ups)ikobo: No APIand more ... I'm definitely not reversing any trades. mcjohn why don't you email me your username and I'll see what I can do for you. Sorry this is taking longer than I thought. All these payment processors have issues. It is actually very hard to find a good one. (All the more reason bitcoin needs to get widely adopted).There are still a few more to investigate... mcjohn: Like I said in the original post, I'm getting another payment processor. That doesn't happen instantly. I do this in my spare time for free so don't get all uppity. If you have BTC in there that you bought with paypal this paypal issue doesn't even effect you. You have the same 30 day waiting period you had before paypal froze my account.If you have USD in there you will be able to withdraw it once either paypal unfreezes my account or I get a new payment processor. Or if you are in a super big hurry just buy BTC on there and withdraw it.  Well alertpay still has chargebacks. so it will run into the same issue with stolen credit cards. Has anyone dealt with these guys before? good, bad? twobit: I can't issue checks anymore since I no longer live in the US. The bulk of the rally seemed legitimate. I'd say only 5-10% was fraud.Bimmerhead: Yeah I can repo their BTC so it isn't really a big deal. Just a hassle. In fact I'll make money if the price stays this high.ribuck: These people are using stolen credit cards so the real card holder complains before 30 days. Anyway the point is moot since I can't use paypal anymore. idev: your funds won't be tied up for 180 days. I only kept a portion in paypal for this very reason so as soon as I have another payment method you can withdraw your gox USD again. Well PayPal decided to drop our account because of too many chargebacks. The funds in there now are frozen for 180 days. So we can't do any more paypal funding or withdrawing.  But not to worry... I should have another payment processor set up shortly.I'm also calling them on monday to hopefully get things unfrozen faster.Anyway sorry guys, but don't worry things will be sorted out shortly. Thanks I fixed. What do you want the name to be? you have 30 characters There are a lot of threads out there collecting bounties and trying to raise BTC for various projects to promote bitcoins. I just created a site that I think will make this process easier. It allows people to form groups. These groups have a fee to join which goes into the group treasury. The group members then vote to determine how to spend the group treasury. Basically it allows you to form a mini-democracy.It is still in alpha so a lot of things don't work correctly yet. But the basic functionality does.Anyway check it out and let me know what you think: http://FiveGrinder.com 
> 30 days waiting period for paypal dollars deposit meant that influx of new buyers at mtgox ain't possible.No it doesn't. they can trade immediately. they just can't withdraw. Just curious, why not use mtgox? You can sell 25k on there right now for more than .04 or mtgox does this also.  It wasn't neogold or whatever that guys name is. I thought it was fraud at first but it is actually someone with some trading strategy that I don't quite understand yet. Thanks for the support guys.I'm actually right in the middle of moving so it will be a couple weeks before there are any big updates to the site.> 1. What happens if PayPal reverses some payments in or payments out?This has happened once now. I'm just eating the charge which sucks so please, please don't do this.> 2. What happens if the operator of MtGox dies (or is kidnapped or imprisoned or whatever)?The site will still be up so you can just withdraw your funds. Or just keep trading...> 3. What happens if someone hacks the website and finds a way to send themselves everyone's BTC balances?Not sure. If it is a bug in bitcoind you will probably have to take it up with satoshi :) Are you based in the US? (I'll play when it is up) gridecon: Yeah I'm looking into it. I'm pretty sure I know how it happened so it should be fixed soon. The depth of market table is there now. I wanted to do something cooler but haven't had time so I went ahead and just put the table there. Poker sites aren't illegal in a lot of places. In fact they aren't illegal in the US. It is just illegal to fund the site with a credit card and even that is about to be repealed it looks like:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_gambling I think bitcoin poker will really establish the BTC. Ok we dropped our commission. So the site is complete free now except for paypal fees. Nice! I was going to try to get someone to do some sort of market review for mtgox. Where is the market headed next week? Weird I guess fopen() in php dies if the response is 500?It seems like errors such as invalid address should just be normal replies just not "sent" so we can just check the reply string. I think of 500 errors as the server itself having an error. I also get it anytime I send an invalid bitcoin address. Which is weird since it doesn't seem like that would effect the connecting. Well it works 95% of the time which is what is weird You are right I'll switch to using decimal arithmetic. Withdrawing BTC is automated now.Depth of market chart is a bit more useful.Added Payment processing for web merchants: http://mtgox.com/merch/about Occasionally bitcoind will not respond to RPC I'm calling it from php and I get this error:Warning: fopen(http://127.0.0.1:8332) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error It happens a lot locally on my windows machine and less frequently on my linux server.Anyone else have this problem?  Why not just keep generating them and sell them? you should be making a profit still at the higher difficulty. oh thanks. fixed.
I made a version of this already: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=537.0or http://mtgox.com/merch/about Yeah when you go to pay it is one of the options: http://www.thefarwilds.com/order/order.php?name=jed&id=53 I made a Bitcoin payment button for my game and thought I might as well make it generic so anyone can use it. Basically if you paste this snip-it of code into your site then you can start accepting Bitcoins. More details are here:http://mtgox.com/merch/aboutLet me know what you think about it and if you have any questions. Online Strategy/Collectible Card Game: www.theFarWilds.com Yeah I know. I'm 90% done with the code part of it. Just seeing if someone had already made a button image before breaking out photoshop.So wait to code yours since hopefully you can just use mine :) I mean an image. You know a nice one that people can put on their checkout webpages. Yeah I agree. I posted before I saw this but it would be nice to get events. I'd like to get them all not just for addresses I ask about. Hi it would be really nice if bitcoind could be configured hit some URL or run some shell script anytime it gets a transaction in with over a certain number of confirmations. It would be nice if it passed this script the label,address, and amount.This would make writing any kind of payment processing much nicer. It would make it event driven rather than having to poll bitcoind all the time. Made some improvements:Optional Email notifications for trades.Sorting your open Orders and past trades.Rough Depth of Market data although it still has some issues. This is when you place an order at the default price? That default price is only set if there is a counter offer at that price. So It should be filled. maybe there is a floating point rounding issue. Try placing it slightly above or below.  NewLibertyStandard: It seems like you should use both. right now the best place to buy is on his exchange and the best place to sell is on mine. Last price on there was .061 and last price on mtgox was .081 so you would be getting 32% more for your BTC on mtgox. Which dwarfs the 2% spread. There are some real arbitrage opportunities right now!I'm hoping that we can somehow link the 2 exchanges. They can be restored.  Yeah bartering is legal in the US. I was wondering at what point a thing switches from being considered a commodity to being a currency. There is an exchange that sells pork bellies for example and that is totally legal. I feel like bitcoins can just be considered a commodity and thus be legal to trade/exchange in the US. Big time. I'm really hoping bitcoin makes a huge dent in them. It annoys me so much that they get 5.9% for running one UPDATE statement in their database. Nice work! Good to get this stuff organized early. I implemented it (hopefully correctly) with my exchange.I have a question though about currencies that are not traditional. How should we list them? For example I want to add a virtual currency from a game. Should I just make up a reasonable pair symbol that isn't taken?For this: bitcoin/fxchange.pairs.json Yeah paypal's fee is 2.9% + $0.30 USD This is a great idea! This will really spread the word I think. InterArmaEnimSil:We make money by keeping a 2% spread between the buyer and seller. But the price you buy or sell at is the price you get. The way it works is if you enter a sell price of X the buyer sees the price as X*1.02. So your trades will complete at the price you see on your order the other guy will just be agreeing to a slightly different price.Adding this info to the site now...Withdrawing: Yes you only need to enter in the fields pertinent to your withdraw. I'm going to make this form dynamic and better tomorrow. All withdrawals are manual for a few days until I'm more certain there are no major issues. But paypal and BTC should both become automatic soon.Adding both types of Funds is automatic right now. Just curious are these happening? Great send me an email when you get a chance or chat me up in the irc channel.This was just a display bug and is fixed now. Let me know if you notice anything else.
Who gets the transaction fee? The person that solves the block your transaction is in?  Yeah I don't think paypal is a long term solution. I just wanted to get the site up. I'm thinking of other funding methods now. I don't have depth of market data displayed yet. I should have that in later today.Right now you can just see what the lowest ask and highest bid is. It says it on add funds page. but I'll add the info for unregistered users. It just takes paypal right now.Adding more soon. RHorning: This is a problem I think but it isn't specific to bitcoin. Other people are working on a general solution. Check out: http://www.maidsafe.net/ MacRohard: Cool graph. It would be nice if it should time on the x axis and number of blocks on the y I'm looking for someone to act as a market maker on my exchange in order to provide better liquidity. You would have to always hold both a buy and sell order near what you thought the current bitcoin rate should be.Please email, PM, talk to me if you are interested.Thanks! I see:Current Lowest Buy Price   0.1224Current Highest Sell Price   0.05882Meaning someone out there is wanting to sell BTC for 0.1224 And someone else is wanting to buy them for 0.05882so if your buy price is below 0.05882 it wont show up until all the ones are sold at the better price. (better from the perspective of the seller) This is exactly what I'm doing.  > Why would I use Mt. Gox instead of BitCoin Market?It is always online, automated, the site is faster and on dedicated hosting and I think the interface is nicer. SmokeTooMuch: Almost all sites do it this way. Are you worried that I personally will learn your password? You can just set your "password" to be the hash of your password if you are really worried. (or use a different one for mtgox) Don't worry the passwords are hashed in the DB. SmokeTooMuch: It is a post over https. It is secure. I'll PM you about the login issue if that is ok.PulsedMedia: The spread is 2%. Is that too high? I think you are just looking at the difference in what two people are offering. That isn't what you should look at.  The exchange site in my sig. I should add this to the site but...that ticker is:Last Price:  (The price of the last successful trade)High:  (the highest price in the last 24 hours)Low:  (the lowest price in the last 24 hours)Volume: (the total amount traded in the last 24 hours)Current Lowest Buy Price  (This is the lowest buy price currently offered by another user)Current Highest Sell Price  (This is the highest sell price currently offered by another user)All trades are between users. So the current buy price and current low price is just what someone else entered. You can always enter a lower or higher one. Hi Everyone,I just put up a new bitcoin exchange.Please let me know what you think.https://mtgox.com How often does the difficulty get adjusted? If I'm taking bitcoins as payment on my website how many confirmations should I wait for before accepting the payment? heh it wasn't me. I don't actually have any yet. Oh it isn't listed here: http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=apilistreceivedbylabel doesn't take in a label according to the wiki. It is more useful if it does. Does it also return the address in the array?
