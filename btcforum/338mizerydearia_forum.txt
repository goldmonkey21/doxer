I'm not so sure.  I've been watching way too many youtube vids from keyword: "risperidone" or "risperdal" and I am even more traumatized now watching them portraying the experiences of others as they had endured for years of taking the medication.  But they are fake, right?  I should not believe things I see on the Internet.  Doctors know what they are doing.  There is no such thing as evilness or corruption.  us dollar is good.  bitcoin is bad.  I have found you can find happiness in slavery.But still, I know what I must do relative to my own rationality and competency that I strive to consistently maintain (besides the sarcasm as shown above).  I trust myself.  And especially I have a health journal for these very things that I fear, uncertainty of the health industry or the medical industry.  I shall still continue to actively participate, but also I will still document things.  As I arrive in Pittsburgh, I would like to begin the habit of voice recording all interactions with doctors and others and provide text transcripts of everything so that I can provide even more account of many important things and efforts that progress.  There have been many key things that have been discussed between my therapist and myself that are forever lost in time.  I would like to prevent that in the future.Again, as much as this is a battle for myself, it's also a battle for everyone else that has similar health issues.  I need more hit points to sustain this battle.  Does anyone have any healing potions?At least I keep telling myself that, ever since someone suggested to start a journal. Note: I have not taken the medications yet.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TwdsYVHjGARisperidone is Risperdal Source?  This is fabricated entirely out of thin air.Since this is unlocked now, see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=68167.0 The suggestion of Morgellon's was long ago introduced by others.  I do not have Morgellon's.  See this.Thanks, however, I must take action to begin.  And perhaps as I am in Pittsburgh, if there is anyone there, I could receive assistance to do just that where otherwise I am failing to at my own initiative or effort.I did not mean to seek attention.  Nefario created a new post that sought the initial attention which many people on Freenode IRC network directed me to.I highly agree.  Thanks.  It will be a kind of motivation and inspiration to take action, just as other threads have been.  Hopefully it is enough.  But, again, if not, if anyone is in Pittsburgh next month when I relocate, perhaps there will be better opportunity to motivate and inspire me to take action by encouraging me in person or locally.  I like to think I can trust myself, but clearly, there is much delay.Note: I suggest Pittsburgh, because as I relocate, that is when I have set a plan/goal to assert for myself to take action and to regain control over myself and to be productive and accomplishing and during such efforts, I'd also like to include resolving this issue as well. I sense a meme... Yep. Last year I added to https://gitorious.org/health-journal/mizerydearia/blobs/master/infos and https://gitorious.org/health-journal/mizerydearia/blobs/master/linksI do not have "black specks, fibers or pustules" and thus my health issue is not related to Morgellon'sAlso, this thread is connected/related. Hi Bitcoin community.I am just chiming in to say that I will be relocating to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania shortly after April 5th as part of some kind of effort so that I can experiment with a lifestyle where I do not live in the same living space all day every day and especially one where I can actively be outdoors most frequently, constantly moving, perhaps getting away from the idea of parasites chasing after me, or rather, thriving whereever I am.Again, for the case that my health issue is psychological, then me experimentation/evaluation may portray my experimentation as ineffective or unresolvable.Though, in the case it is parasitical, perhaps I may observe some kind of escape, but also, still I consider that in the case it is parasitical, I may be host to them in which they thrive and propagate from me and thus, I will never get rid of them.Also, there is another reason why I desire to go to Pittsburgh.  It is to be near someone that is very inspirational and motivational for me to continue where I am becoming very desperately overwhelmed and emotionally distressed, and I wish to lead a more outdoor lifestyle, but I am seemingly unable to do so here, living in this living space where I am accustomed to, and unable to establish new patterns or new habits.  I will still be around periodically to update my journal and also perhaps even I can contribute effort to resolve witcoin conflict, and I really would like to.Also, if anyone lives in or is nearby Pittsburgh, perhaps I can be available to introduce myself.  And then the bitcoin community can capture me and hold me hostage until I resolve the things I've been neglecting (e.g. witcoin), but preferably or ideally I would like to be held hostage in a mobile fashion, one where I can escape traumatizing nibbling sensations from staying in the same place for too long.Also, of the medication that I was prescribed, I wish to postpone consuming them until after I endure experimenting as mentioned above.  They do not expire until next year, so I should still have the opportunity to resort to psychological/mental treatment/medication in the case that my experiments/tests/observations do not yield recognition of a biological health issue.l3estest l2egardedsness,Miz I am able to type long posts as Nefario has said.  I can write.  I can express myself.  However, I cannot concentrate on other things.  It is very easy, though, yet somehow I struggle.  I also do not get it.  Yet I do understand.  It is surely an established psychological issue that seemingly has incapacitated my brain.  But, again, I can still write elaboratively.  So, ....  I accept the labeling of 'thief' for now.I haven't used them.  I will prove it later.  But for now, assume that I have used them and assume that I am a thief.  Assume the worst for now. re: Nefario's post suggesting I am a thief.  I admit that it seems rather shady of me to not take action, however, seriously, I am still struggling so very much.It is unimportant though.  Everyone is welcome to evaluate and consider me as a thief and pursue hostility and any other similar type of negative effort or evaluation to me.  I deserve it, until I resolve the issues for which I still am neglecting.  I am just chiming in to reply.Thanks and I apologize.  Please forgive me to all those that are still burdened and disgruntled with me relative to this. I am not sure if this is directed to me.  If it is, there is not a single line of code that Bitcoin Consultancy has contributed to witcoin.  Again, as I have said elsewhere, the very latest commit to the private repository was June 3rd, 2011, which was before I even participated with Bitcoin Consultancy.  And I am uncertain what there is to apologize for relative to Bitcoin Consultancy.Also see this.The power of slander and misinformation. =/Othewise if you meant the message directed to noagendamarket, the codebase is not his.  It is practically entirely mine.  I say practically because glancing at the repository I see commits also by tcatm as late as February 2011.  The rest since then have been entirely my own.  Though, I do recall tcatm having helped me with some css later, which I had included in my own commits.  But otherwise noagendamarket hasn't contributed any code whatsoever and is not a developer/programmer. Can you elaborate on this?From #bitcoin-dev December of 2010:Then unrelatedly in a private channel on Dec 26th, 2010:And so that idea affiliated with 'witcoin' name relative to noagendamarket's creativity/thoughtfulness is his intellectual property.  That base idea, which is similar to one I have had in affiliation with a previous project, a competitor to justanswer.com and the plethora of other for profit question sites was then evolved amongst my own ideas as well as several others of noagendamarket's.  However, the very first moment which led to the matching of the idea with a name was noagendamarket's. Actually, in modern society, this is exactly what happens.  If you're female, raped by a family member, and for years after growing pains, speak about it to your family, it is more likely that you will be punished by your family more than any punishments directed by the person that raped you.  Ideally this is strange or unacceptable, but realistically, it is commonly practiced to this day.Kind of relatedAlso As I first arrived and first attempted to gain access to my home computer, I had difficulty to do so and also much delay trying to contact someone back home to help restore access to my computer.  But once I did so, I was able to retrieve a copy of my encrypted keepassx password database and then gain access to all of my accounts.  It wasn't until then that I was able to do anything.  I do not recall the exact timing of when that happened, but I admit that I wasn't able to access anything immediately upon arrival in Poland.In the very real case that I have committed a crime, I highly encourage you to consistently preserve your consideration towards handling your responses to such a crime as you would in any other fashion that causes negative impact upon yourself or others.  It is not necessary for you to offer suggestion or consideration for which if I do A then you will not do B.  I accept and encourage you to preserve your efforts towards criminality or legal concerns and to take things seriously, even in the case that they are used against myself or otherwise affect, hurt or interfere with me.  In the case that what I am doing is criminal, illegal or otherwise punishable or fineable, I recognize and understand the necessary implication of such as a means to resolve disputes or issues such as this one, and I understand your concern or consideration for resorting to such measures and therefore, you should allow consideration of them as you wish entirely at your own inspiration, motivation or influence and not on the basis of interests of others including myself.I have yet to resolve witcoin-related matters, and so, like even over half a year ago, still this is an open issue.Again, I'm not sure why you bring Bitcoin Consultancy into this issue.  Perhaps you disregarded the reality of which it has been communicated on several occasions that Bitcoin Consultancy are not affiliated.  Intersango is not affiliated with witcoin.  Spencer Dailey of Bitcoin Bulletin is not affiliated with witcoin.  My father is not affiliated with witcoin.  Even if you were to beg and plead with my father to force me to fix issues for witcoin, there really is nothing he can do.  There is nothing Bitcoin Consultancy can do.  There is nothing anyone can do but me.  I am the sole person responsible.  For you, or anyone else, to desperately seek attention from others so as to encourage them to help influence, motivate, inspire or othewise convince me to take action, ... it is not so effective.  And, well, even as I consider for you to direct your such communications solely upon me, and acceptable even in this public platform, which I highly encourage (I'm so very afraid of privatization), even then, it is something that I must take action for, and once again, I shall strive to do so.I do think it is strange that you offer a repetitive consideration for which you include Bitcoin Consultancy into these affairs even after being advised of the reality of which they are not affiliated, however, I also consider or understand the idea of which, as my mom has portrayed so very many times, that anything and everything is possible including complete incompetency or incomprension or the ability to make rational, logical, or otherwise understandable statements or communications.  And she is my mom, and still living in nearby environment, for which she offers such continued influence over myself, which I seek to avoid and not allow to become something I practice or result in my own affiliations with others.  And perhaps that is why I elaborate so much, perhaps as a kind of derivative of such personalities or behaviorisms.  And well, even these elaborations are annoying and practically useless.  Again, the most important thing is to take action.  It isn't important that I clarify or respond to justify or explain myself, especially so repetitively.  So, I shall stop and be productive towards accomplishing things...relative to witcoin. I do not consider myself a 3rd party.  The specifics of what happened was CryptoCoinMedia expressed he could no longer afford to pay for teh Linode vps.  You can read more details here, so relative to amiller's generosity for helping to pay for the vps, amiller funded CryptoCoinMedia's linode account with us$20 to cover the next month of hosting the vps.  That was not acceptable to CryptoCoinMedia and still he was intending on cancelling the service and more desiring expected me to move the codebase and website to CryptoXChange's dedicated server.  Again, as you may see in the witcoin thread, I was quite skeptical about it especially relative to how immediate CryptoXchange's Ken Armitt assumed the consideration of which I was interested in doing so.  I wasn't.  I did not live in Australia and have a friendship or any other affiliation with him as CryptoCoinMedia/noagendamarkat did, and so, I pursued a skepticalness.  And instead I learned along with collaborate of amiller's generosity towards helping to fund a few month of witcoin, that I could transfer the vps to amiller's account entirely intact and without modification.  And that is what I did.  For the next three months after October 28th, everything on the vps was intact and untouched, unmanipulated.  However, in perspective of CryptoCoinMedia's view, perhaps it may seem as if the vps was taken from 'him' since it was affiliated with his account, in which under my user account hierarchically structured under or affiliated underneath his own account, I also had administrative access towards the server.  And even though the server was affiliated with his account, everything on that server was entirely from my sys administration in which noagendamarket didn't have expertise or familiarity with linux, programming, developing or otherwise contribute towards witcoin other than by suggestive idea.  And even as I say that, still I do not mean to imply that of a control freak type of consideration on my part.  I still offer consideration towards him in which even without those expertises, still, as we seemingly both agreed, we were co-owners of witcoin.  And glancing at my IRC logs, I see some relevant stuff from #witcoin beginning March of 2011. This statement is inaccurate as well.  While I was in Warszawa, I had access to all of my accounts including linode vps hosting witcoin as well as my personal computer remotely, which even then, my ex-stepfather charged me us$40/mo to keep it running, but my father generously helped me to pay for it in my absence and in place of us$400/mo rent.Also, not that it is important, but my alias is mizerydearia, not miserydearia.  I am not sure what this statement is in reference to.  Perhaps you could elaborate more than providing a count of such occurrences or 'times' and provide an example or one or more of such?To say that witcoin would have been the first site to have an android app is particularly a statement considering that of an idea, in which ideas are plentiful.  Implementing those ideas into reality, ...  based on the discussions below, it was interesting for me to consider and I had appended it to many notes I had taken for things to accomplish and fix.Scanning my IRC logs for #witcoin for case-insensitive "android" this is what I see, beginning from March 26th 2011:So, the idea lingered, and now in this statement of CryptoCoinMedia's above, it seems that the idea is being used as an example of sabotage, perhaps in the form that because the idea was never implemented, that inaction in itself is sabotage.  I guess that makes sense.  Even now, as I am still unemployed and struggling to afford doing so without my father's assistance, I am sabotaging my future.  The idea of which I could have a job and make money is not being practiced or pursued.  Heck, I could own a mansion or castle, as I consider in my fantasies.  It's an idea.  I do not have a castle or mansion yet.  I am sabotaging my future!  Help!This, that 'we' could have had venture capital, may be true, and even shortly after my interview with Spencer Dailey published March 29th, on April 3rd, Current-C private messaged me:and I arranged with him to meet me in #witcoin on Freenode IRC network, which he did also on April 3rd.  As I remember that day, I had hyped I believe in #bitcoin encouraging others to join and perhaps if anyone else were interested to discuss things about investing or donating or whatnot, but even from the discussion that day in #witcoin, nothing resulted from it.  Clearly my personality or technical expertise or other attributes or characteristics were not promising enough to encourage, inspire, motivate or otherwise influence anyone to invest in witcoin, at least not based on my skills at explaining things.  And even then, during that chat, I learned that tcatm managed to get an interview, in what seemed to be a private matter that he did not otherwise divulge further details.  So, since then, that was an example of which I haven't established myself as a prominently successful individual worthy or considerate of funding of investors or venture capital.  And so, with CryptoCoinMedia's concern or interest in seeking massive venture capital, something which I was afraid of also if you read the interview, and especially, I wasn't then and more recognizably now, am not so excited or enthusiastic about greed.  I think along with the excitement of bitcoin, especially for those that were early investors and participants, there is a sense of greed that is preserved amongst many of us, even I recognized such in myself, including when I invested in Ixcoins.  However, I do not enjoy the evilness that consumes me relative to that of greed.  And in the case of 'we could have massive venture capital' type of statement, it seems one ripe with greed, especially with the continued reference suggesting that 'I think miserydearia owes the users,myself and intersango an apology and I urge him to fix this mess.'  I am a tad bit confused as to how I owe an apology to the people behind Intersango.  From my observations of comments from others, it seemed that others had suggested for CryptoCoinMedia to express an apology towards Intersango for his slanderous statement.  But perhaps maybe it is more considerate of him to delegate that responsibility of apology to me?  I'm not sure, it's just an idea.  Otherwise, other than that, I do not see anything to apologize for towards them.  Regarding an apology towards witcoin users, yes, again, I am rather apologetic and express it repeatedly to those who continue to bring up concern about the website and project seemingly disappearing.  I will continue to apologize as long as still I haven't resolved the issues relative to it and also I will strive to do so as best as I can.  Regarding apologizing to CryptoCoinMedia as per his request.  Even without his request I have apologized to him both publicly and privately on several occasions.  And I do so again here as well, expressing that I am apologetic for my decline in performance and productivity relative to witcoin.  I am sorry that I have allowed my health to be interruptive and deteriorate my productivity to a point where I have become so very inactive and unproductive to handle these concerns that are still awaiting a resolution.  I will again strive to do so to resolve these matters, as I have attempted to do previously, however, I cannot make any guarantees, but I will still strive to do so.  Besides, I have medication from doctors now which may help me, even though they are for depression or mood/mental disorder and I do not feel they are correlated to the sensations which interrupt me from doing anything other than touching myself all over in response to each intense nibble sensation. My father would disagree with you.  Other than the three and a half months that I was in Warszawa, my father has been supporting me entirely for the last year and a half.  us$400/mo he is paying now to my ex-stepfather just so that I do not end up homeless, which even this very month and last few months, I am struggling with, and I have been struggling with for a couple years.  Anyhow, it isn't important to elaborate other than to clarify that Bitcoin Consultancy is not funding my existence.  My father is.Particularly I appreciate those that preserve an open an honest effort to explain things truthfully and considerately, rather than an effort to exaggerate or otherwise communicate misinformation.  However, I can understand such types of efforts and the relative personalities supporting such abilities as I have experienced them myself as I was younger, and still sometimes even today I may feel an urge to say something untrue, lie, or otherwise not speak, but for the most part, I try to preserve an open honesty about myself and understanding and comprehension of things.  It seems similar to that of open source culture vs proprietary or security through obscurity.  This is the very reason why I have documented and posted some logs/transcripts of the history relative to this issue with witcoin because I considered the possibility of experiencing that of a lack of openness or honesty, and especially even from myself, in the case that I lied, or otherwise altered my posts or story.  Actually, it's similar to Ron Paul, perhaps, in which I strive to be consistent. Search for "crypto" in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2516.0;allespecially see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2516.msg604783#msg604783October 26th, 2011 via private message: This is inaccurate.   noagendamarket, CryptoCoinMedia, David Hollis, registered the domain in December of 2010.This is true.  CryptoCoinMedia did register witcoin.com at hover.com and noagendamarket did initially mention 'witcoin' in a channel late December after another person had mentioned 'witcoin' in #bitcoin at the beginning of December.  I shall gather more info from my logs in which anyone else with logs can also confirm.Also, I encourage to not censor or delete this thread.  It is useful to preserve an open an honest account of all events. Hi world.  This was brought to my attention, and I shall provide some infos/response.My latest push to the private git repository for witcoin was June 3rd, 2011.  However, ever since February of 2011, my performance, enthusiasm and excitement towards witcoin has declined relative to my suffering from health issues.  Since the end of October there has been a controversy that erupted between noagendamarket and myself.  You may read that thread to learn more about the history.  And still, to this day, I haven't progressed with anything relative to witcoin development, management, maintenance, updates, restoration or providing an ability for users to recover their bitcoins, therefore this thread seems relative to the effort for me to overcome my inactivity, and again, well, I cannot keep using my health as an excuse... I am still alive after all, and I still have limbs for which I can type.This statement seems inaccurate or false.  There is no way anyone in affiliation with Bitcoin Consultancy besides myself could have any involvement to hinder the progress of witcoin.  While there have been efforts and interest especially by genjix to promote, encourage and contribute towards witcoin, still, everything was and still is entirely in my control and access and thus is my responsibility and also relative to the original sentence of the original post, entirely my fault and nobody else's.  The consideration of they or anyone else has offered or contributed to 'help' may seem considerate of them, but in no way are any individuals besides myself responsible or accountable for anything relating to witcoin.  Still, entirely everything is between noagendamarket and myself, in which even as we both self-established each other as co-owners, still only I have access to everything, and noone else.  So, the only accountability, responsibility for resolving anything relative to witcoin is entirely at my own efforts and accomplishments.This is inaccurate.  The codebase and wallet were never removed from the vps used for the site.  If you review this witcoin thread, you will learn that as of the controversy at end of October 2011 that erupted relative to noagendamarket's latest plea that he could no longer afford the hosting expenses and the collaboration between noagendamarket and myself, there was a growing conflict that led us apart: noagendamarket established an active affiliation with Cryptoxchange that participated in an attempt to establish control over witcoin, especially relative to my inactivity relative to my decline in health and procrastination.  I, in affiliation with others who were generous enough to offer helping with cost of hosting, eventually accepted amiller's offer, in which other than his friendliness, there wasn't any affiliation similar to that of noagendamarket + Cryptoxchange.  And even my affiliation with Bitcoin Consultancy, which amiller is not involved with, was unrelated to that of witcoin even though genjix effortfully provided reference to it on the bitcoinconsultancy.com website, which I mentioned to him a few times concernedly indicating it seemed strange, but he decided to preserve it, and in essence, it is perhaps that that causes influence that Bitcoin Consultancy is affiliated with witcoin or that witcoin is affiliated with Bitcoin Consultancy.  But, that is not accurate.  Still, there is no affiliation or correlation other than that I, as a human, have affiliated with Bitcoin Consultancy, but I have not included or incorporated my developments or efforts of witcoin into Bitcoin Consultancy.Getting back on topic, amiller helped to pay for the linode vps for a few months after noagendamarket expressed his ceasing payments around approximately October 28th.  Since them, amiller has paid linode.com for the vps.  And during that time, still I haven't progressed with the project/website.  After three months of paying, I did proceed in making backups of the data on the vps before mentioning to amiller that he was welcome to stop paying for the vps account, because, it wasn't his responsibility to keep doing so as he was merely offering a friendly gesture to help.  And since still I had been unaccomplishing, it seemed a waste of resources, in which I am appreciative for his helpfulness, but embarrassed and apologetic for the lack of usefulness that I pursued during those months that he helped.  I still have the backups of the site data and the bitcoin wallet and the affiliated bitcoins, all postgresql data, and everything necessary to prepare for a recovery or to handle resolving the issue that is still existing.  And still I would like to resolve this conflict as well as proceed with things, however, it is difficult for me because of my health issue.  And, even as I reference it again, I also recognize the idea of which referring to it seems quite ample of an opportunity to pursue malicious, scandalous, or otherwise devious, evil, or other corrupt efforts and activities, but I assure everyone again that that is not my intention.  However, I do encourage everyone to keep such ideas in consideration and to not allow overlooking it, because it is important to preserve an open and honest comprehension of important matters like this.  And especially, if I do lie, cheat, steal, or otherwise pursue fraudulent activities, I highly encourage taking necessary action to remedy such abuses.  Anyhow, proceeding with next....I also apologize, especially so much for the length of which still I haven't resolved any issues relative to witcoin and for which I am solely responsible.  However, eventually I will do so.  And especially in the case that this issue becomes one that involves legal system, perhaps that is useful as yet another inspirational or motivational factor to somehow overcome my interruptive health issue and stop being so lazy and procrastinative as well.  Like, right now, I am typing all of this instead of effortfully working on something relative to witcoin to allow users to recover their funds or to restore the site or something similar.  So, ... I must do that and soon.I noticed this a few weeks ago I think when chmod755 pointed it out.  It was quite surprising, because chmod755 pointed out that 'I' released the source code there.   But, I never did push the source code to a public repository.  I later realized that genjix took it upon himself to do that.  And, relative to my 'promise' that I mentioned last year, 2011, to release code before the end of the year, I did that, albeit very poorly, right here.  And even many months before then, I had already set up gitorious.org/witcoin/witcoin on May 12th, 2011.  And still that repository is empty because I haven't yet prepared the code base to be useful for others to use.  It is something I must do, but even as I haven't done it by the end of the year last year, still I did release a 'zip' (ewww) archive of the code as mentioned in the witcoin thread. linked just earlier in this reply.See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2516.0;allmm, I'm not sure how to accurately elaborate on this in an accurate sense.  I am not sure on the idea of my being 'hired.'  I don't consider that I was hired.  I did participate in an opportunity to participate on open source developments in affiliation with Bitcoin Consultancy in which my travel, shared living expenses and food were paid for, however, even after I returned and especially Donald Norman indicated that he wanted to compensate me for my time, even then I felt as if I had not contributed enough effort to be worthy of any compensation whatsoever.  Even as I was in Warzawa, Poland, I still endured much devastating interruption relative to my health issue and I remember even walking one day with genjix and he was concerned about my lack of productivity or accomplishments.  So, definitely I was not comfortable with accepting any compensation for my time there, in which I barely accomplished anything, well, other than making foods for us, especially phantomcircuit who was especially so very lazy to cook food or even eat, oftentimes forgetting entirely, or too busy or preoccupied to even realize his hunger.  So, I was somewhat useful, but it wasn't enough for me to feel worthy of any compensation.  Especially I was so very amazed and excited that I had an opportunity to travel overseas, my first time outside of united states country, and it was so amazing.  The experience was enough of a compensation for me.But as I returned, around the beginning of October, and for a month, I then proceeded in returning to my developments of witcoin.  I did not do anythning with witcoin while I was in Warszawa.  I did not want to allow witcoin project to interfere with the developments I was working on in affiliation with Bitcoin Consultancy and especially for it to interrupt or take away my time from such developments affiliated with Bitcoin Consultancy.  Besides, I already had enough interruption from my plaguing health issue.  And as I did return, and as the controvery evolved around October 28th, the site had been offline for an extended period since then, but still, until sometime in January, the vps was still running and waiting for me to continue working on it...but I didn't...  =/noagendamarket did express that he had conflicting ideas on taking witcoin in another direction than what I had in mind, and that was a kind of basis for the controversy that erupted in October 2011.  And especially I was attached to the code that I had written from scratch and wasn't sure how to proceed.  Anyhow, I shalln't elaborate so much about it here as anyone that is interested to understand more from my perspective can read the witcoin thread.For the moment still I am the only one with full copy of all necessary data (code, sql data, bitcoins) and am thus responsible for resurrecting, restoring, transferring or otherwise handling anything affiliated with witcoin, therefore, all eyes shall be on me, and for me to take action.Statements like these seem kind of defamatory or otherwise abusive.  I am a human existence and the sole person reliable for anything related to witcoin.  I have affiliation with others such as Taste of Thai where I was working a couple years ago in Appleton, my ex-stepfather where I am currently staying in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Bitcoin Consultancy, who I had participated with last year in Warszawa, Spencer Daily, who had interviewed me relative to witcoin and several others.  However, it seems that there is a concerted effort to specifically target Bitcoin Consultancy (or one of the projects affiliated with Bitcoin Consultancy, particularly Intersango, but not also libbitcoin, Momento VPS, bitcoin media or any other projects affiliated with Bitcoin Consultancy or projects affiliated with anyone that is affiliated with Bitcoin Consultancy.  In essence, it seems strange for one, in this case noagendamarket, to establish a kind of affiliation of Intersango, a bitcoin exchange, to witcoin.  There is no direct correlation or affiliation.  That is all I shall say on this, as I'm sure others may understand.This is kind of true.  I do accept the comprehension of my laziness and procrastination, but also I am suffering from a health issues which is driving me crazy to this day and this very moment.Again, this statement seems defamatory as well.  Again, I am the sole person responsible for witcoin and everything related to it.  Bitcoin Consultancy and others affiliated with it, e.g. genjix and phantomcircuit, are not responsible or do not have the access or ability to do anything relative to bitcoin other than help to motivate, inspire, convince or otherwise manipulate me to do something, and this is true for any other human existence in cluding that relative to any legal matters that result relative to my inactivity or progress on doing something.You may read my feedback on this earlier in this reply in which I mentioned that genjix took it upon his own interest to mention witcoin on the website, but in no way has witcoin been affiliated with Bitcoin Consultancy or even genjix or phantomcircuit.  It is something entirely at my own involvement, and also noagendamarket's in which there is controvery/dispute that must be resolved, and, well, it shall be.  I am merely, for now, clearing up some misconceptions or inaccurate statements that are being repeated in this thread.Again, the code was never removed from the vps.  Everything existed intact and practically untouched (other than for backups) until January 2012 when I suggested amiller needn't pay any longer at his own expense which he was kind and generous enough to offer.  I still have a backup and still I have the ability and full responsibility to restore everything and resolve this issue.  It is entirely my responsibility and all considerations should focus on me and not anyone else.  There is nothing anyone besides me can do.Again, Intersango is a bitcoin exchange.  Intersango is not a person.  Intersango is a project produced by Bitcoin Consultancy and particularly phantomcircuit as lead developer and also involving genjix and Incitatus.  None of them, nor the bitcoin exchange Intersango are involved or responsible for anything related to witcoin.  It is not their responsibility and even they do not have the ability to do anything.  Actually, the likely thing they could do is to assume responsibility over my existence and to generously offer compensation to others entirely at their own expense, perhaps similar to how MtGox did so with Bitomat when Bitomat lost all their bitcoins.  Again, I still have all the bitcoins and source code and everything necessary to return them, but it is something that I must take action to do, and until I do, it is my sole responsibility and all effort or consideration should be directedly entirely to myself and noone else, e.g. not phantomcircuit, genjix, Incitatus, spenvo, chmod755, or any other human existence. One of my previous housemates responded to me:So, I shall try to take showers less, try to not shower daily, and also effortfully try not to take baths.  It will be very difficult for me especially as I awaken and every time I do after a long duration of sleep I feel so dirty and grimy and my eyes, I need to rinse off the muck off and around my eyes, and my hair, I must....  no, I can't.  Even as I only bathe and shower many times and do not use any chemicals, perhaps it is merely the water, even the hard water that is here, that is dissolving my hair and my skin.  So, I shall try to shower less.Again, this post is relevant.
Daria Season 3 Episode 9, "Jake of Hearts", is related. Thanks for the recent suggestions.  Also, this post is related and something for me to think about relative to this thread. I updated my journal with a new entry and some resources for visit to a psychiatric crisis walk-in center today and other things.  My therapist referred me to go there this last Tuesday.  I was prescribed Paroxetine Hydrochloride for depression and Risperidone for mental/mood disorder, though the doctor specifically indicated that the latter medicine was for the nibble sensations.  O_O  I feel as if he did not understand that I wanted to be treated for the nibbling sensations and not for mental or psychological concerns.see more pics and stuff in resourcesResearching Paroxetine, I see:This scares me and reinforces that which I despise medication.  I do not trust taking that particular medication.Researching Risperidone I see:that it seems okay mostly.  Is there anything that I should be concerned about?  I am still hesitant to start taking it though. =/  My concern is more relative to the nibble sensations than that of depression or mental disorder.  I would rather first cure/resolve these nibbling sensations. Because `grep` (see original post) caught this.Code:Created by Registrar:                        GODADDY.COM, INC.I removed it.  Thanks.

See subject.  Note: You or anyone else can create a post or reply providing information for OpenVZ VPS providers.  It isn't necessary to attempt to encourage, influence, entice, motivate, inspire, persuade, force, manipulate or otherwise anticipate for me (1 of 50,000+ forum users) to do it.http://help.cinfu.com/what-is-a-vps-server-also-known-as-vds-server-13/ "For our VPS servers we use OpenVZ technology." Q: Are you also losing weight?A: No, still I weigh ~120-125lbs as I have for the last 10+ years.Q: How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?A: 30Q: How often do you bathe/shower?A: Until a few months ago, once a day.  Now still mostly once a day, but sometimes I take two or more baths/showers and have up to four times a day.  The reason for such frequency is so as to exist in a place that seems peaceful from the sensations, and during my additional baths/showers each day, I generally just relax in water and do not use shampoo/conditioner/soap as I'm already clean from a previous bath/shower.Q: What kind of soap and shampoo do you use?A: The same kinds I have for most of my life.  Currently and for several years I've been using TRESemmé products: particularly shampoo and conditioner.  And for the last 5-20 years I've been using Dove soap.Q: Do you know the pH of your water (i.e. do you have "hard water")?A: I don't, but the water in this home environment that I am currently living in has hard water.  I have lived in this home many times throughout the last 15 years and never had a problem relative to the water.  This health issue began at another living space, but I am not sure of the pH level of the water there.Can you put this in a more readable format (I do not understand your timestamp)? Once this is done we can attempt to look for a pattern.From https://gitorious.org/health-journal/mizerydearia/trees/masterhttp://65.30.35.48/nibbles.2011.11.21.phphttp://65.30.35.48/nibbles.2011.12.11.phphttp://65.30.35.48/nibbles.2011.12.12.php 1) No and I haven't taken any medications in at least half a decade.2) The timestamp is unix epoch timestamp.  Maybe see http://www.epochconverter.com/  Also I'll prepare a web based script to auto convert the timestamps and mention it here when finished.  The itchiness is relative to the intensity in which my mind comprehends the contact/sensation as undesirable and triggering of my touching it with my hand, and oftentimes also rubbing or scratching the affected location to relieve a mild itchiness that subsides upon contact, otherwise if left untouched, the itchiness subsides more slowly as with any other itch left untouched.  There is no pain other than the undesirability of the sensation which in itself is mentally or psychologically painful.  Also, though the sensations are not painful, in consideration of physicality, they are minisculy painful in that they affect a reaction from me to touch the affected area, but again, the sensation subsides.  It's been a while since I've had a mosquito bite, but I almost want to use mosquito bites as a comparison, but I'm not entirely certain from lack of experience with mosquitos in the last few years.3) Yes, 'strand' of hair is what I meant.  I am not currently picking at my skin, however, regarding my hair, even before this health situation, I would periodically run my fingers through my hair especially so as to detangle it.  It is naturally curly and I've been growing it out for three or four years.  Regarding varying thickness.  As the first missing thicknesses became noticeable, each affected strand of hair still possessed most of its thickness (my hair was very thick since birth) and in just a tiny spot on the strand, perhaps the thickness of the sharp tip of a small hair scissors, there was a missing chunk in which the thickness in that spot would be half or less than half the thickness of the hair.  However, from later observations of hair strands, rotating them so I could see all sides of the strand I noticed that the missing thickness was not all the way around, and was only visible at certain angles.  After over half a year of many of my strands becoming affected I noticed that many of the strands were losing much more of the thickness across the length of the hair, but in many cases, not the entire length.  To me, it seems like the erosion or decay of the strands were gradual and started from the location in which the initial chunks of thickness were missing, and then through days, weeks, months, the thickness of the hairs were eaten/dissolved.  Now my hair strands are very thin, but still they are thick enough to exist and grasp sturdily.  However, several of my hairs have also become noticeably elastic or stretchy.  I'm not sure if it is perhaps the insides of the hair that are naturally stretchy and perhaps an outer protective casing/layer of the hair are not stretchy, or if there is some other explanation, but some of my hairs are stretchier than others.  As of now, the thinness of each hair spans across the entirety of each strand.  A few months ago, the thinness and thickness mix of each hair strand was in random locations in each strand, some perhaps near the base or root, some near the tip, some in middle and again, several strands had several gaps of thicknesses and thinnesses, and again over time the length of each span of thinness became longer and longer until now entire strands have lost all of their thickness.  I am not entirely sure, but I may have some of my hair in a baggy from years ago, that I used for a particular art project, and if so, perhaps I can make use of it to compare it to my current hair.  It will be a while before I can confirm if I still have the hair, if it is even useful.  Last part of the question, initially, it was isolated strands, but over time, the isolatedness of strands became not so isolated as eventually most and all of my hairs became affected.  And now, 99-100% of my hairs are affected.  I can't even find a hair that is unaffected to compare to anymore, which makes it difficult to realize the reality of which my hair was thick at one point.  The only truth I have to my hair having been thick is that of my memory and also especially my parents who are most familiar with me.4)  Yep.  As stated in original post "Prices are as of January 25, 2012." I have not yet even seen a medical doctor.  I shall eventually. That study seems quite useful as yet another reiteration to resume consideration towards the patients each having psychological disorders as opposed to actual parasites, but does offer the reality for which investigations were limited such as with "There was no sign of an environmental cause, either, although researchers did not go to each person's house to look around.."added: But even without the effort to look into each person's home, that is not so necessary, especially considering that whereever I go, whereever I live, the sensations continue.  So, it is not necessary to look into my home environments.  It is more helpful to look at me, to test me, test, study and investigate my hairs, blood, whatever.As a victim of these very experiences that began a year ago, and the reality of which I know and trust myself (as do practically all people), I shall continue to strive fighting for my freedom to end these sensations so they do not occur anymore (whether they are parasitic or psychological), for it is the mere sensations that are disruptive towards me, and that is my greatest concern, to end them.And in the case that even with much influence to convince all affected patients (and the rest of the world) that these issues are psychological (as per influence from such 'studies' referenced in the article), what then?  Then effort must be pursued to train the human existence to establish thought processes that do not trigger the result of the sensation felt, as with any other psychological disorder that requires the existence to take mental action whether at their own abilities (which are unlikely) or with the aid of medicines produced within the medical industry that do not curse or destroy the thoughts, but merely allow the patient to subside to a weakened mentality so as to not trigger thought processes to occur, or something else entirely, I'm not entirely sure.  I'm not familiar so much with the medicines relative to psychological disorders.However, I still strongly believe that my issue is not psychological.  Even with the reality that I see physical events or occurrences that seem to represent a kind of fungal, bacterial or other parasitical existence, it is also easy to include such experiences as per psychological evaluation and consideration as well as to dilute the events with influence suggesting that as per the psychological impairment of myself, that the sights I saw were self-induced or self-inflicted.To me, with the conscience, understanding and perception that I have as per my experiences, I truly feel that still I suffer something parasitic.  I have seen with my own eyes while holding a strand of hair almost twenty-four inches before them, the tiniest of things clinging upon the strand.  To the touch of my fingers, they did not fall off the strand as I brushed them gently over the span of the hair.  In each occurrence (so far four) of these experiences, the specks of whatever (parasites?) dissolved before my eyes in a minute, and what I had initially felt while brushing my fingers over the strand of hair, was no longer.  However, on the latest such occasion or encounter of the phenomena, I saw what was more disturbingly shocking to me, that helped to strengthen my reality of which this health issue is parasitic and not psychological (again, it is easy to influence anyone that this is still psychological and that I was seeing things or even that I had made up the story in light of self-induced or self-inflicted experiences).  What I saw was another speck of whatever that had dissolved and just as it did, the strand of hair from where the speck was to the rest of the length (about two or three inches) had instantly bent upwards as it cracked.  And what was left afterwards was yet another thinned spot in the strand of hair.  Even before that very experience, for well over half a year I have endured the process of which my hair has become increasingly damaged and started with the first occurences of these thinning spots in which each strand had only one, and most of my strands of hair were unaffected.  Now ALL OF MY STRANDS are so very damaged to the point of more devastating erosion and decay.  And this is only my hair, but I feel it is the same infestation of parasites that has compromised my hair that is also compromising my skin and causing the sensations that I feel upon my skin.  I cannot feel sensations in my hair.  My hairs do not have nerves.  But I can feel on my scalp, and I oftentimes feel sensations upon top of my head, side of my head, neck, etc and everywhere else on my body even recently including a few now internal that I cannot reach to relieve touchingly or scratchingly.I am under the greatest of influences and considerations that my health issue is NOT psychological and that it is parasitic and I will not give up or be influenced so easily and instead prepare myself usefully to help establish precedent of which the health issue may be realized or discovered to be parasitical.  I have yet to see a psychiatrist or other doctor other than a therapist, but even my one therapist has on several occasions expressed that she believes my issue is not psychological.  I shall not give up.  I shall survive and continue to strive to help contribute towards discovering exactly what it is that is affecting me.  I continue to grow my hair and let it endure damage, and perhaps as it continues to decay and become damaged, perhaps it may be useful to study and test to determine if there are parasites infesting my hair and body.Also, thanks for sharing the article!  Perhaps I shall contact some of the people named in the article and share with them my public journal and effort.Also, I referenced the article and my response to my therapist.  I shall not add it to the journal, but instead offer reference to this thread as part of it. I apologize if you consider a suggestion or declaration of openvz as not real.  Perhaps 'real' is an inaccurate word to use to describe the difference between what openvz provides (or doesn't provide) to other types of virtualization implementations.  Wikipedia has a decent perhaps non-nasty explanation.  Besides...  the ability for any other human existence to prepare an alternative resource for similar or additional types of documentations is easily attainable, and if any such individual desires to pursue such efforts, they can easily make use of what I have publicly referenced here, including the gnumeric spreadsheet.However, also to be fair is the reality of which pricing structures for openvz vary quite differently to kvm/xen vps providers in the sense that prices for openvz vps are oftentimes very much lower than xen/vm vps environments, and therefore, mixing them together without uniquely identifying them may cause confusion.  And since I didn't add reference to distinctly indicate which virtualization platforms were used, I decided not to include openvz because of the potential for the vast difference in pricing causing some confusion. Microtronix doesn't offer a real vps environment, particularly xen or kvm.  I specifically did not include any openvz providers.  Feel free to take notice of the reference to such in the subject of this thread if it is of any importance, interest, concern, notability, value, substance, usefulness, significance or relevancy to you.

James B Powell is one of the racists, not Ron Paul, for it was James B Powell that wrote some of the racist contents that are used to blame Ron Paul.It is suggested many of the other anonymous writings are also similar in style to James B Powell's.Also, every president has been called a racist including Barack Obama."Talk of racism is lowest form of political discourse." I agree that racial relations should be an issue handled by individual people and not in any way influenced or handled by any governmental, corporational, educational, orgizational or other collection of people and merely the reality of which through word of mouth and other spreading of informations (e.g. reddit) the actions of all things (including efforts towards racial and other discriminations) the people can decide for themselves on how to proceed.Everything has varying values even in terms of racial discrimination.  The context of which the racial discrimination occurred and the longevity and other factors and characteristics of the single event of racial discrimination would determine the level of response and effort pursued by people that felt worth and value in responding and propagating suggestive information to others on responding as well.  And through freedom of choice the people can decide with whom to listen to and either participate or not.  Sometimes there is misinformation that is not clearly recognized, but it isn't necessary to rely on a kind of governmental, coporational, educational, orgizational or other collection of people community to tell us what is and is not misinformation and allow them to handle situations for us through fines, imprisonment or other penalties.  We can penalize such people, businesses, corporations, educational facilities, organizations, governments quite well as individual people.Resources for which events such as occurrences of racial discrimination can be reliably documented and searched for as part of determining which business to do business with would be useful.  There are tons of sites that offer reviews and ratings, but none which offer precise and specific types of informations or evaluations especially based on specific things, such as a list of racial discriminations, or a count of how many instances and the rating of each instance, perhaps an average rating, etc.I keep adding to this post and rambling on and on.  Perhaps I should continue to prepare it as a novel and see if I can find a publisher. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uphJqUFOyok It isn't necessary to federal government to make that possible.  It can be possible for each state government to make sure you don't have to drive fifty miles.  Instead of directing the effort towards their country to make that a reality, one can direct their effort towards their state. It doesn't matter.  What is happening now will continue then.  People will balk.  I and many others will become more active to expose the continued enslavement as well as continuously be ridiculed and disagreed with (until we are deaded or imprisoned), sparking further controversy, but as long as a peaceful nonviolence is preserved, all is well. hence my interest in Ron Paul.Clearly we need an atheist that is not recognized or affiliated with that reality so as to not be grossly ridiculed in relation to it.  It is likely that Ron Paul fits this role by pursuing an active affiliation with the cultist ideals and symbolisms, though clearly it is because human existences of societies are easy to discredit him otherwise.  I am already discredited, but I'm still alive. I agree about that.  There should be freedom of choice, even within families allowing the children (that grow to become no longer children) to make their own mind rather than punishing, ridiculing and treating them differently if they express a lack of interest, understanding or agreement.  Also, currency should be impartial.  I am appreciative that Bitcoin hasn't adopted any religious influence, though I am disappointed that the addictedly religious luke-jr has included religious based influence in his source code contributions to bitcoin and bitcoin-related developments. I'm not so sure.  Take even state senators and other governmental entities.  They oftentimes do not have enough time to read and pay attention to all the things and usually pass down the responsibilty to other human existences.  Though, perhaps similar to this, maybe if the letters were included in something like that, it may have been brought to his attention more impactfully decades ago when Internet and distribution of information all over the world or even country was scarce.  In today's society, however, it's very easy for awareness of such writings to be recognized and realized immediately and to take responsibility and action immediately.  One must also not discount the times decades ago and how slow spread of information was.Though, regardless of believing him it's good to ask questions and think critically about all the possibilies.  There is possibility he could lie, and like any other corrupt individual, even one instance of corruption, lie or deceipt should be recogized.  This is true for the current and past presidents too.More like 'character power.'  Again, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBlk1Vpeuwhint: the mighty morphin power rangers where characters. This is an interesting point, buuuuuuut, it's still difficult to presume that there is only one entity to rule over all of a country.  Consider the same as one entity to rule over all of the planet?  It may be useful to break down the rule and authority to individual states to allow each state to handle the dispute so that they can receive the same kind of effort that a president would.Sure it may be inconvenient to have to drive to another state if the state which you reside abolishes abortion.But what about if abortion is abolished entirely throughout the country?  Will you then complain that you must travel to another country?  continent?  planet?  solar system?I think the evilnesses and goodnesses in which authority exists should be made smaller (e.g. states vs country) as it then allows more direct attention.Take schools and colleges for example.  A class with 200 students vs another class with 20 students.  Depending on the size, each student will receive more or less attention.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses#Controversy
Besides, with a kind of open sourceness of medical techniques, and practice and perfection on those techniques, it should be fairly easy to establish a series of procedures (how-to guide?) on how to self abort thus cutting out the middle doctors and related fees/costs. I didn't see a related thread about paypal in this board, so here's a start with recent event: I used the word troll, but I did not refer to you as a troll.  The reference to you as a troll came from someone else.  Feel free to reread what I wrote if you'd like. mm, well, disregarding the 'troll' type of evolution of messages, concepts and ideas to be excused so easily and offensively I can understand the concern over dwelling on all possible imperfections of all possible presidential candidates especially to make sure everything is validated and acknowledged to a satisfactory, desirable and agreeable perspective for all existences that put forth effort to evaluate all the things of all the things.And in the case of the specificity of guarding something as being violent in nature, I am kind of confused as to what is the logic behind such an evaluation. I am not sure.  Perhaps I or any other human existence (that has ability to speak a language, probably English is most necessary) can research some contact information for those who own property on border of united states country and interview them to ask those questions to find out their answers.  google offers free calls to united states numbers, so this should be easy for anyone in united states or access to a server/shell account in united states to do. true lie -> Ron Paul has reviewed every detail of all writings of all people that have affiliated with him and therefore the views expressed in all of the writings, even those views which clearly conflict and contradict one another are entirely Ron Paul's views by order of anything is possible (see zombo.com) and nothing matters.  So, right, wtfever at Ron Paul.  He is racist.  I'm racist.  You're racist.  theymos is racist (since he runs this forum).  Everyone is racist.  Wooo, let's have a race!"Believe me sir I do my homework lol' <-- you got me at "lol"  professionally written researched/investigated facts (not opinions) ftw.  Btw, I'm playing with trolls and lost.  Hot Dog!  We have a weiner! sources?  Boycott FlipPro for more slander?  I want to be next.  Srander me preeze! slander ftlguard != violenceI worked at ACen for Anime Pavilion and most of my duty was to make sure nobody stole any merchandise.   I was a guard.  There were many of us watching.  When someone stole something we did not violently kill them or pursue any other violent reactions.  To promote that my duty as guarding the merchandise is violent is grossly abusive.  I can understand that if I had killed one or more human existences as part of my duty than my particular efforts would be violent, but not necessarily correlating to the responsibility of guarding.  Fuck that though, right?  Guarding is fucking violent, yo!  Fuck miz and their defensiveness towards explaining that guarding is not violent...fucking noob!Perhaps I should contact Anime Pavilion and all other businesses that have humans and technology set up or available to guard their merchandise and stuff and explain to them how it is violent in nature.  Same is true for home security surveillance systems.  Violence is widespread.  Even the forum moderators here and at other sites that are guarding the community from spam and other obnoxious usually automated posts.... What's with all this absurd violence?  Guarding should be abolished and illegal practice.  All the things should be unprotected!  Condoms?  VIOLENCE I TELL YA!Also the reference to "keep my friends from coming for a visit" is also grossly abusive slander that is inaccurate and misleading.  Misinformation/incompetence ftl.  By the way I also am not perfect and sometimes say inaccurate things, and I greatly appreciate the efforts by others to correct me.  That's what this is, but of course with the profanities and other types of sarcasm it's likely to result in further controversy.  Wooo, go me.hint: Profanity is not love, but fucking is part of it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDsdZMk4m5QList of sponsors to boycott:ToyotaVerizonNutrisystemAvisAIG Term LifeColdwell BankersVenus BreezeGeicoO'layJimmy Dean Sausageslawyers Weitz & Luxenburg, NYSudafedVideo ProfessorNatural's Cat Chow, PurinaMerneke Car Care CenterAm.

I convinced my mom to vote for Ron Paul.  All it took was indicating that voting for Ron Paul is voting for love (NSFW).Actually, it took a lot more, but that statement alone seemed to be convincing to her.  Prior to that, she expressed that she would not vote. I'm not so sure.  As you can see in the third post, I am repeating ALL THE INFORMATIONS relative to this issue, particularly, one informative post per resource (particularly covering yesterday's event involving Barack Obama's signing NDAA bill), and particularly focusing on the major resources, including those that that are considered biased, corrupted, evil media organizations.  I am fairly certain there is at least some misinformation.  For those that are concerned about the original post as being misinformation, thanks for participating to clarify it and to those that provide factual informations or analyses so that everyone can benefit from being more aware of true facts. My first encounter with this topic was based on the image referenced in the first post.  As can be seen in third post I have expanded to account for a multitude of sources of information.  The topic of the thread is also not so opinionated or biased other than merely establishing the consideration that the prevalence, importance or value of the particular event is of significance more so than perhaps other contents or events, thus 'bang.' * mizerydearia chuckles heh, settle down?  In what way does a simple post with a single image implicate the status of being or not being settled?  Also see https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=3909Perhaps in custom of some of my previous posts, if I had created a new thread with like 100 images and perhaps flashing and colored text and marquees and stuff, then it would be more easily recognizable that there is some unsettledness in which one or more others could respond suggestively to settle down.  However, a single image relative to a particular topic to trigger "settle down" response seems perhaps considerate of that the mere idea of promoting or spreading awareness of the particular topic, message or idea is implicative of that something is wrong and thus the existence behind it (me) must 'settle down.'Now that I have responded to your 'settle down' with the previous message, perhaps a kind of 'settle down' type of statement may seem more appropriate as it is related to a kind of defensiveness that may be unnecessary.  But, the initial 'settle down' suggestion seems unnecessary also.So, I welcome others to promote and encourage more 'settle down'ness in the case that this topic is hijacked (by the person that started it) from the initial topic of discussion to a discussion about settling down and other related ideas.tl;dr: I've been unsettled before, but as of my original post, that is not one of those times.  Settle herereddit discussion of image in original postIn addition to the image in the first post, which was the content I stumbled upon initially bringing this information to my attention, and I redistributed it to others such as by creating this thread, I also am openly including reference to additional sources and coverage of this information (and exposing the media participants that are not covering or have any mention of it) so that there is no bias expressed.  Note that I'm merely referencing contents created by others and am organizing them into a centralized location, but particularly starting off with a single introductory image (which again is not preferred over any other, but is merely the first encounter I had experienced as a human that surfs the Internet randomly looking for new and interesting things, maybe sharing them if they are worthy.)abc news: no mention yetaclu articlealex jones videoal jazeera articlethe arizona republic: no mention yetassociated press articlebay news 9: no mention yetbbc world news: no mention yetbloomberg articlechicago sun-times: no mention yetchicago tribune articlechicagoland television: no mention yetcleveland plain dealer: no mention yetcnbc: no mention yetcnn: no mention yetcontra costa times: no mention yetthe dallas morning news: no mention yetdenver post: no mentiondetroit free press: no mention yetexaminer articlefox news: no mention yetherald tribune: no mention yethln: no mention yethouston chronicle: no mention yethuffington post articlekhou: no mention yetkotv: news on 6: no mention yetkthv: today's thv: no mention yetktvb: no mention yetkvue: no mention yetkwtv: news on 9: no mention yetlos angeles times articlemsnbc: no mention yetnecn: new england cable news: no mention yetnews channel 8: no mention yetthe philadelphia inquirer: no mention yetnews12: no mention yetnews14 carolina: no mention yetnew york post: no mention yetthe new york times article (No mention of the specific bill by name: NDAA or National Defense Authorization Act)newsday: no mention yetnwcn: northwest cable news: no mention yetny daily news: no mention yetny1: no mention yetthe oregonian: no mention yetpbs: no mention yetphiladelphia daily news: no mention yetrt: russia today: no mention yetsalon articlethe san diego union-tribune: no mention yetsan francisco chronicle: no mention yetsan jose mercury news: no mention yetthe seattle times: no mention yetthe star-ledger: no mention yetthink progress article (3643+ reddit comments)pcnc: pittsburgh cable news channel (also wpxi): no mention yetstar tribune: no mention yettampa bay times: no mention yetusa today articlethe wall street journal: no mention yetthe washington post articlewfaa: no mention yetwwltv: no mention yetynn: austin: no mention yetynn: buffalo: no mention yetynn: capital region: no mention yetynn: central new york: no mention yetynn: rochester: no mention yetI like how some of the mainstream media news sources have no mention yet of NDAA being signed into law but still have some results referencing NDAA from weeks ago."I've been reading NDAA (H.R 1540) and here are the actual facts" - Reg717NDAA FAQ: A Guide for the Perplexed"The 14 Senators who voted against NDAA.

I haven't touched the code base since June and I am still suffering from health issues, so even though it's now the last day of the year, I still haven't made any progress towards preparing the code base to be suitable for distribution or usage for others, buuut, as per my suggested interest that evolved into a kind of promise to release code by the end of the year, here's an archive of the latest snapshot of the code base: http://www21.zippyshare.com/v/43869793/file.html license: AGPLv3 http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/the-good-wife-bitcoin-for-dummies/EP011583840061UStream's live chat

resources from those who were truly challenged."and mention it only for the reference to diverting resources (e.g. wealth, time, emotion, etc.) which is impacted by posting of this thread.  You could use those availability of resources to read other posts and pursue other activities.I may be challenged, but am I truly challenged (as opposed to falsely challenged)?Also, thanks to link from deego, and although it is not directly related, this TED talk Dr. Terry Wahls - Minding Your Mitochondria  is interesting: "Without your mitochondria you would be no larger than bacteria."In the talk there is reference to "which compounds body cells can manufacture and which are necessary to consume in order for reactions to happen properly" and also that Terry Wahls has learned that she needs B Vitamins, Sulfur and Antioxidants for her mitochondria to thrive.I have yet to pursue more activity in regards to preserving and maintaining my health relative to those and other nutrients, but I have prepared an introduction into doing just that as can be seen with "nutrient levels" here.  Perhaps with a blood test or some other sort of test I can have factual informations relating to those nutrients that I can reference as part of my journal and help me to determine what I need to improve.  I have yet to determine or understand how to proceed with obtaining these informations/data."And then it occurred to me, that I should get my long list of nutrients from food, that if I did that, I would probably get hundreds, maybe thousands of other compounds that science had yet to name and identify, but would be helpful to my brain and my mytochondria""But I didn't know where they were in the food supply.  And neither did the medical techs nor the food science techs with whom I consulted, but the Internet did""The Hunter-Gatherer diet has more nutrition than the American Heart Association diet, more nutrition than the American Diabetes Assocation diet and more nutrition than the USDA Food Pyramid diet."It's interesting that even though my family which are also considerately understanding of health (or so I would believe considering some of their occupations relative to health industry) still are quite abusive with health relative to food choices.  For example during an encounter this year of bringing to their home (where I weas at the time) fast foods and offering some to me which I declined, it had triggered them to become ragingly mad (why u no eat these which we bring for you?).  So, while it is convenient to consider focusing on healthier prospects for all of humanity, there is still a lot of familial and societal opposition that continues to support the thrivingness that is the fast food (and other related) industries including poor selection of foods at grocery/food stores and even poor selection of vegetables, fruits, meats (e.g. monsanto, or cows, pigs, etc fed corn-based diets in which the meats packaged and sold from said cows, and wtf about meat glue? or this O_x ...).Regarding the comparison of hunter gatherer diets to other diets from the american versions of associations/organizations , it seems that there is a concerted effort to better establish a lesser healthy individual by distributing and propagating such informations (the diets) labeled or branded with their seemingly friendly names and eye candy logos and other imagery which may naturally (or psychologically?) entice humans to participate and rely on such informations and influence and encourage them to preserve and maintain their health accordingly, only to fall victim to pursuing the diets and result with inadequate health and strength to abstain from the need to pursue medical or health expenses relative to the diets.  Anyhow, I look forward to completely ignoring informations from all such organizations as well as the related human peoples behind them as well as the many humans that are not behind those organizations but also share the same distribution of informations, feelings and other efforts to help and instead pave my own way (of course, with some help, but that of which I choose as opposed to that which is suggested to me (especially by doctors) that I am not convinced of).  And, related to help and as part of my journal, I am and will be providing full disclosure of everything (soon I will even start a journal of my food diet also) so that the reality of which all the things related to my humanness can be observed and evaluated in relation to my health.Again, to some, this effort of mine may seem quite obnoxious and obsessive compulsive, but, especially with consideration of the corruption of industries and related misinformations as well as the likeliness that I am not all-knowing (like phantomcircuit) and make mistakes, I prefer to emphasize a public full documentation of everything so that in the case I do make a mistake (such as accepting or pursuing something relative to misinformation or other corruptions), that at least it can be recognized more clearly as per the documentation/journalistic approach in that my efforts are revealed to everyone and not just doctors or other 'professionals' that ask.  We are all professionals, whether professionally professional, amateurishly professional, unprofessionally professional, etc.  ^_^ I appreciate the offer to assist and help, for the moment I will not [yet?] accept any donations or generosities (even from my father, whom I'm afraid to burden any longer also in relation to my continued living expenses) to help in relation to my health.  I would first like to make sure I prepare for an effective and efficient plan of action.  That will happen after I contact some doctors and determine how best to proceed.I do not want to pursue the most frugal of efforts, but I also do not want to waste moneys unnecessarily.  Most especially I do not want to be taken advantage of (by doctors) and find out I owe an incredulously massive amount of money.I will document all my efforts as part of my journal, and also I can report to this thread about my progress.Also, I definitely want to provide further proof of my situation so that I can acknowledge the reality of this situation of mine being authentic and not evil scammalicious effort.  At this time there is no such reliable proof and everyone should preserve skepticism before considering any generosity, though I appreciate the sentiment.For now, I have yet to make calls.On another note, I prepared the "health-journal" repository at gitorious so that other users can have their own health journals using similar git technology.  If anyone is interested in pursuing similar efforts, let me know.  You may contact me at mizerydearia@gmail.com also. Regarding trying the doctor route, I am a bit worried or concerned about it in relation to how costly it will be and especially to the reality that I have no money.  Well.... I could sell my computers and clothes for money, but that seems ineffective or not enough value to be useful for my health or other expenses.  And I don't think I could manage existing nekkid afterwards for too long, especially during this winter. As of yet I haven't seen a neurologist, but I would like to.I've suffered from various forms of distressful efforts or thoughts throughout my life, some quite severe and overwhelming.  However, at the time I contracted the nibbling sensations, I don't think any stress was involved, though, I had been quite distressed around the time.I'll provide some brief story-like details.I lived in Appleton for 6.5 years without any health issues.(briefly: I do not get along with my parents.)My father kind of begged me to come to Milwaukee to help him with some things (teaching newly arrived (from another country) family members English and some other work/help for him.  I came to stay with my father in Franklin (Milwaukee), experienced dramas galore, and I eventually stayed with my ex-stepfather for a while, as long as he let me, but it wasn't long.Without knowing where to go or how to continue surviving, my father insisted I move into a particular apartment in the ghetto of Milwaukee and that he would pay for it for me.  Related to dramas and his effortful initiation of force and other authoritative influences over me, I asked him if I had a choice and he said no.  After having lived there for like six months, everyone that saw the apartment was devastated/shocked at how my father could let me live there.  Anyhow, it was completely putridly disgusting and has greatly affected my consideration that my health issues sparked from living there also because they started shortly after I moved in.  I did not have any health issues just before moving in at all, ever, nada, nothing.But, even though my health issues started at the same time that I moved into that apartment, that alone does not guarantee or prove that my health issues came from it, and it could be from other things such as distress, but as of yet, that seems quite unlikely or I am not so convinced.  Though, I shall try to keep an open mind. =/ I think it originated from a living space, but it has preserved through several spaces including another country and back.  Moving alone will not help.  I must pursue other efforts and remedies to alleviate the situation.  Considering humans are 90-99% microbes/bugs, it seems likely that I will have to pursue some kind of treatment to minimize/reduce or destroy the affected infestation inside my body and perhaps also outside such as on my hairs and floating around like fungal spores.  Though I am not a doctor, and my continued recognization of spore infestation may be inaccurate. ugh.. I just typed a lengthy post and it's gone now.  Anyhow, crawling is inaccurate.  The sensations are more like nibbling or pinching or that of something cutting through and injecting itself into me (such as that of the experience I endured on December 9th which was most intense) The health issue began shortly after I moved into a slummy apartment in the ghetto of Milwaukee, WI.  The apartment was incredulously disgusting and filthy.  For example the refrigerator hadn't been opened for a couple years (as per slumlord's admittance) and when I did open it, I held my breathe and ran away to let the odor dissipate.  Inside was blackness and thousands of bug shell remains.  I'm fairly confident that my health issue is related to living in that location.At first there were bugs and the bugs were a constant, since February.  I killed several of them as they flew in front of me.  The nibbles began around then.  The bugs flew around, but less visibly afterwards.  I saw them, but never on me or nibbling on me.  Yet, I had influence or idea that they were the cause for my nibbling sensations.  But since that beginning, I have never seen bugs nibble on me.  The bugs persisted and followed me everywhere, including when I was in Warszawa, Poland.  But since I returned from Poland, now they have disappeared.  e.g. there are no more bugs.  But the nibbles persist.  Also, the damage to my hair began around the beginning of this year after I moved into that apartment.I remember distinctly that everything began after moving into the apartment because I did not have any of these experiences prior to that.  Buut, I cannot declare or be certain that I contracted the health issue in relation to living in the apartment, yet it seems fairly accurate or reliable that that is the case.A bit more details about my lifestyle while living in that apartment.From the day that I moved in to the apartment to the day that I left, I was in the apartment practically 24/7 other than going out to buy food.  I endured the disgustingness that was the apartment and the dirtiness was preserved.  It was too overwhelmingly disgusting to clean and I didn't have the money to afford cleaning materials.  I endured living there because I had nowhere else to go other than homelessness and my father insisted and offered to pay the us$370/mo rent expense and additional expenses (electricity/Internet).Gah...I really miss Appleton.  Ever since the day that my father came to visit me and insist to take me back to Milwaukee (as part of his pleading with me to help him with some things including teaching newly arrived (from another country) family members that couldn't speak English), my life has devolved so devastatingly and dramatically, though I'm not going to elaborate about those issues.  My sole concern which is impacting me most devastatingly is this health issue.My next efforts are to contact doctors (after holidays).  For now I wait at least until Monday.Oh, perhaps this community can help me in my effort to contact doctors.  I have no idea what to say or ask or whether I should make a statement, ask a question or both.  What perspective should I pursue in my contacting each of the doctors? Depending on the intensity, the pain is similar to that of a bite from a bug, for bugs that bite.  Mosquito bites are usually painless, and so that is not much of a comparison.  Perhaps in addition a bite sensation, a pinching sensation may be helpful to understand, each pinch sensation having a variable intensity, in which the most intense are quite painful in the sense that the pain is sudden or instant and with touching, it is relieved and the remainder of pain is mental or psychological.  I do not feel any burning or itching besides that of the immediate kind of itching sensation related to that of pinching or nibbling.  The itching does not persist.Prior to December 9th (see this) I did not have any abnormalities whatsoever.  Thus, for approximately seven months there were no noticeable signs other than perhaps my hair, which at this time I feel is a very related and important aspect of my health issue.  I believe it is related, but am not entirely certain.  However, on December 9th, I endured a most intense nibble sensation and during the minute after it happened I felt with my finger touching the affected area behind my right ear, as if something very tiny was working its way into my skin.  It produced a scab like wound that lasted for a while.  That wound is gone now.  There are a couple other irregularities and also some other undocumented oddities, but I do not feel they are useful, reliable, worthy, or visually revealing enough to assume perspective of physical health issue.  Though, perhaps microscopically relative to bacteria or fungii there may be noticeable physical defects, perhaps especially prominently in my hair.  I feel many nibbles occur on my head and from my hair.  I am very worried about my hair/head as if there is something up there.  I cannot see what goes on up there.I look healthy overall I think... though, my physical appearance is perhaps deteriorating kind of like the comparison of mugshots of a person over the several year span of their criminality which portrays the deteriorating facial evolution.  Though, my evolution of facial appearance may not seem unhealthy as of yet.Since approximately February of 2011.Kind of.  Towards the beginning it was minimal, but gradually and perhaps quickly (a month or two?) grew in intensity or frequency in which since then the intensities or frequencies still fluctuate perhaps sporadically or it seems kinf of patternistic also...a bit.  It is patternistic in the sense that during both of my nibble logs I was anticipating another swarm of sensations (what I'm experiencing right now, actually, on the surface of my head, over and over and over, 1-20 second intervals), but there was no swarm.  I had the idea that swarms would be daily, but it seems more patternistic that swarms may skip a day or two.  But then sometimes I endure two or more swarms in a single day.  Regardless of consideration of patterns, the nibbles are constant in which the interval varies from 0 seconds to maybe at the very most ten minutes, but generally 20-30 secondsI'm not sure what this means.No.  And also I haven't had sexual intercourse or other sexual relations or intimacy (other than hugging a couple of people) in approximately five years.Definitely.  I've been taking baths and long showers now practically twice a day because I need the relief.  Though, also I have taken baths waiting to feel the sensations whilst under water to better determine perhaps the reality of whether the sensations are triggered externally or internally.  Though recently a couple times I think I have felt the sensations while under water, I am not entirely certain and as of yet do not have any reliable evaluations related to under water other than that for the most part, it seems I am not affected under water.Mm, no worries at all, and I appreciate the questions (though, also you can find answers to some from reading my journal, but maybe tl;dr type of effort is evolutionary or societally normal behavioral expectation now and though I am still writing tl;dr answers, they are directly affiliated with your effortfully typed questions asked on demand and easily locatable as opposed to having searching through prior historical documentation/information...history, it's just that...history.  Repetition ftw!) as it helps to provide perhaps better searchability in the case others experience similar health issues, perhaps they may stumble upon my documentations and informations similarly to how I stumbled upon others' experiences as well (and disappointingly, my attempt to participate there resulted in censorship and bannage)Yeah, thanks.  I realize that and in relation to my biases, that is the basis for my full disclosure and journalistic documentation.  The health industry may keep privatized records on their patients.  Similarly, I'm keeping open public records on my healths.I have not.  Thanks for Occam's Razor reference.I guess even though I suggested my efforts are to be helpful for others than just myself, that may not be possible at all considering all humans health issues are unique and must be investigated separately...though, at least the information I provide as part of my journal and other discussions may be useful. Already listed at https://gitorious.org/health-journal/mizerydearia/blobs/master/infos and https://gitorious.org/health-journal/mizerydearia/blobs/master/links I have, however, the visits were uneventful, unhelpful and unproductive.  The last visit with a doctor at a hospital in Wisconsin consumed much of my time trying to convince me that my issue was a psychological disorder and that any other issue (e.g. bugs, bacteria, fungii, etc) is not something that the doctor or anyone at the hospital could treat and that any blood test work they would pursue would not test for anything relating to that.  The hospital was Aurora West Allis Medical Center.  I believe the lack of helpfulness and the persistance of psychological disorder is merely an effort related to the corruption (laziness and/or greed?) of industry, especially relative to the minimal or lack of monetary or other forms of wealth in which I am not worthy or valuable enough to receive related health treatments, inspections or other efforts to combat my particular health issue.  Actually, I think the reality of which there is no cure or resolution for this particular health issue in which some others have been suffering for almost a decade and maybe some even longer, is related to the reality that many of us humans that endure these health issues are not wealthy enough to be worthy of necessary research, investigation, understanding or related health procedures to establish a reliable and effective remedy, medicine or cure.  Many others who have been suffering from this and other derivative health issues have wasted so much monies pursuing ineffective treatments as suggested and offered by multiple doctors or other health professionals.Though I express the sentiment above especially based on the lack of helpfulness from the last doctor I visited, I have started a journal now and have better documented my experiences that may be more usefully or impactfully recognized that I'm not crazy or imagining things and perhaps it may spark some effort to consider the reality of the situation and to allow for better treatment for myself or others.  We shall see.  My publicizing the journal here and elsewhere is an effort to spread awareness of it and also maybe to try to encourage for better treatment as a result, if not for myself, then for everyone else that suffers similarly.Yes.  I have been quite unproductive and lazy even to pursue effort of seeing a doctor, but that was primarily based on my bias that no doctor will be helpful for me based on my already established biases of the health industry but also influenced by my last visit with a doctor just a couple months ago which acknowledged my doubts/biases (though, I don't mean to pursue stereotypical consideration that just because one hospital or a couple doctors at the hospital confirmed my doubts/biases that all doctors will as well.  I shall keep an open mind in that regard.)  But now that I have a journal and am detailingly and effortfully documenting my situation more reliably and informatively, I have a kind of inspiration to be more effortful and accomplishing to succeed in my quest (wooo, I'm on a quest).  Also, publicizing my issue is contributory towards my inspiration as well since it provides further incentive for me to be more effortful and productive in accomplishing my goals and desires to be peacefully free from this health defect in the sense that not only would I let myself down otherwise, but I would also let others down too in the case that they are aware of it and perhaps cheering me on or whatever.  Already, the few people I had collaborated with privateishly are concerned and worried for me and want to help me, and just knowing that is inspirational.  Buuut, I need moar inspiration.  MOAR INSPIRATION!!  So, I shall tell the world.  And it's not just for me.  I want to help myself, but I also want to try to help everyone else that suffers similarly.  So, what better way than to provide information?  That is the point of my journal.  And that is the reason why I'm openly publicizing here.  It's not about me, but more so about the reality of the health issue and it is for all human existences that are suffering and surviving perhaps still hopeful for freedom and peace.   blah, blah, go miz go! So, I feel completely and overwhelmingly obnoxious for this (and some previous efforts) to promote, mention or otherwise publicize this particular health issue that I am suffering and that is interrupting my participation and productivity relative to bitcoin-related projects and developments as if I am some sort of selfish greedy scam artist pursuant of an effort to take advantage of others' generosities, helpfulnesses, emotions, concerns, etc, yet, regardless, I must tell the world nonetheless, as an effort to better help myself and everyone else that is suffering similar and other derivative health issues.  The world must know!I'll keep this short and simple, and no, I'm not asking for any help, assistance or anything, because I fucking (profanity used as implication of seriousness if it can even be evaluated as such) despise greed...too much that it's unhealthy...oooh, perhaps it is my massive despisedness that is the cause for my health issues (I'll have to look into that)...Here's my reddit post.Here's my journal: https://gitorious.org/health-journal/mizerydearia/trees/masterTeh Aind! * mizerydearia wavesI'm still here and alive. http://godaddyboycott.org/ :"Boycott GoDaddy until they send a letter to Congress taking back any and all support of the House and Senate versions of the internet censorship bill, both SOPA and PIPA. Since the announcement of the boycott of GoDaddy, GoDaddy has just publicly dropped their support of the heinous Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA. But, they still support the Senate version of SOPA, called PIPA or PROTECT-IP. If you work on the internet and do business with GoDaddy you're supporting a company who is actively working against your best interests."http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/nokde/it_sounds_obvious_but_godaddys_sopa_flipflop_is_a/ :"It sounds obvious, but; GoDaddy's SOPA flip-flop is a PR stunt to try to stop losing money. They haven't changed, keep boycotting, please!"
At first they were like ""Go Daddy has received some emails that appear to stem from the boycott prompt, but we have not seen any impact to our business. We understand there are many differing opinions on the SOPA regulations."but then "Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it." Mm, actually, I didn't even bother searching and assumed that nobody else had put forth effort to verify all the domains listed at bitcoin.it wiki for all bitcoin-related organizations/businesses/operations/communities.  And so I did just that and viola, discussion!  Anyhow, I quoted your comment in my original post.in your post: s/effect/affect/ Discuss in ##SOPAIn affiliation with the efforts here I present evaluation of ALL Internet communities that have a Freenode IRC presence:Here's a list of domains referenced in the topics in at least one channel on freenode IRC network.And here is a list of domains that use GoDaddy as a registrar:Code:0fees.net supports GoDaddy101zenstories.com supports GoDaddy1800dealership.com supports GoDaddy1gn.org supports GoDaddy1url.com supports GoDaddy1y9y.com supports GoDaddy2600.net supports GoDaddy2gn.org supports GoDaddy37signals.com supports GoDaddy4shared.com supports GoDaddy68kmla.org supports GoDaddy7thguard.net supports GoDaddya11y.in supports GoDaddyaarontoponce.org supports GoDaddyaatrem.com supports GoDaddyableconf.com supports GoDaddyaboveaverageurl.com supports GoDaddyabsdev.org supports GoDaddyabstrusegoose.com supports GoDaddyacawiki.org supports GoDaddyacemonstertoys.org supports GoDaddyacidlinux.com supports GoDaddyadempiere.com supports GoDaddyaemod.me supports GoDaddyagi-wiki.org supports GoDaddyaidrs.org supports GoDaddyallegro.cc supports GoDaddyalphaonelabs.com supports GoDaddyalt.net supports GoDaddyalternatehistory.com supports GoDaddyaltjs.org supports GoDaddyam-utils.org supports GoDaddyamplesdk.com supports GoDaddyancientbeast.com supports GoDaddyand-developers.com supports GoDaddyandroid.net supports GoDaddyandroidpt.com supports GoDaddyandroidpt.info supports GoDaddyangularjs.org supports GoDaddyannvix.org supports GoDaddyanotepad.com supports GoDaddyanserq.com supports GoDaddyantiproxy.com supports GoDaddyantiwar.com supports GoDaddyanythingbutipod.com supports GoDaddyapassion4jazz.net supports GoDaddyapesol.org supports GoDaddyapexhab.org supports GoDaddyappcelerator.com supports GoDaddyappfigures.com supports GoDaddyarabian-linux.org supports GoDaddyarcemu.org supports GoDaddyarcfn.com supports GoDaddyarchlinux.org supports GoDaddyarchlinuxarm.org supports GoDaddyarchserver.org supports GoDaddyarduino.cc supports GoDaddyardupad.cc supports GoDaddyarklinux.org supports GoDaddyarsbitcoin.com supports GoDaddyasininetech.com supports GoDaddyaskubuntu.com supports GoDaddyasmartbear.com supports GoDaddyasteriskdocs.org supports GoDaddyastlinux.org supports GoDaddyastralsociety.com supports GoDaddyastralviewers.com supports GoDaddyastralvoid.com supports GoDaddyats-lang.org supports GoDaddyauroraux.org supports GoDaddyaustinhackerspace.org supports GoDaddyauteria.com supports GoDaddyautonomo.us supports GoDaddyavlug.org supports GoDaddyaxiom3d.net supports GoDaddyazloco.com supports GoDaddyazureuswiki.com supports GoDaddybabushka.me supports GoDaddybackpress.org supports GoDaddybadadev.com supports GoDaddybambuser.com supports GoDaddybasecamphq.com supports GoDaddybaseurl.org supports GoDaddybash.org supports GoDaddybasho.com supports GoDaddybashscripts.org supports GoDaddybayareaairsoft.org supports GoDaddybbpress.org supports GoDaddybbssh.org supports GoDaddybeagleboard.org supports GoDaddybeamjs.org supports GoDaddyin progress...Note, you may use IRC client to connect to freenode irc network and search for the above urls to find the channels which they came from, otherwise most of them are pointless, or worthless other than to the tinyesque communities or founders behind the websites.  Regardless, they are listed for sake of completeness.I gave up on this, btw.  It's not so important or useful as the other thread The list in my original post is complete as of now. See http://godaddyboycott.org/ for suggestions By the way, I made a mistake in capturing google.com domains because of the strange results that appear when using the linux app:Code:$ whois google.comWhois Server Version 2.0Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registeredwith many different competing registrars.

Actually, his message was exactly as I quoted it, including the quoted message from me written in an unquoted fashion.Also, note, "witcoin" is never uppercased similarly to how Indian or Internet is never lowercased. ^_^Thanks, I will look forward to resolving this concern directly with noagendamarket.  I only full disclosured about Cryptoxchange affiliations because the forum private message I received contradicted with that in which the communications in the last week show otherwise.I recognize that you and/or CryptoXchange may wish to abandon such responsibilities and affiliations and I will keep that in mind for further consideration of how to proceed.  This is related or similar to how I had previously been interested in proceeding to continue witcoin.com site on the very same linode 512 that noagendamarket was paying for (with funding from others such as the six months amiller had offered and credited a partial amount to noagendamarket's account), but with Cryptoxchange involvement, it had evolved into something else.Note: I am afraid of privatized communications.  Publicly disclosing accurately and honestly without censorship or modifications of informations allows for all involved existences to establish responsibility for their participations and communications.This is good advice: Stay out of forum debates. they just drain your energy and aren't productive.  Make announcements and keep putting out good software.

#bitcoinconsultancy on freenode November 1st, 2011,noagendamarket suggested "the linux guys," they "they" will clone it, "we are going to rewrite the whole thing" and "we need to migrate it."If not people representative of CryptoXchange who noagendamarket had also previously acknowledged and referenced from previous communications, then who are "we?"  Again, I, mizerydearia, am no longer affiliated with "we" in this context and also no longer affiliating with 'witcoin' name.For those unfamiliar with situation (and in case I didn't mention it in this thread previously), around October 21st noagendamarket had suggested yet again that he could no longer pay for the linode 512 vps hosting the site/project.  noagendamarket had stated such things previously as well in which I had provided him with some bitcoins to compensate for a few months of service.  During and after October 21st I sought asking for others with assistance for helping to fund continued payment for the vps and additionally others offered hosting instead.  I did not accept offers immediately as I wasn't enthusiastic about the limitations or restrictions and also was enthusiastic about sticking with linode if at all possible.October 21, 2011 via private message:October 21, 2011 in #bitcoinconsultancy:October 24, 2011 in #witcoin:October 25, 2011 via private message:October 26th, 2011 via private message:Although I had not made up my mind on any of the offers for hosting as of yet, but I was interested in amiller's offer, however I personally had not yet established a decision, I found this quite abrupt and unexpected effort a bit suspicious/awkward:October 26th, 2011 in #witcoin:In addition to previous hosting offers from others, I was not enthusiastic about that offer as well especially considering the link at the bottom of the page.At this time there had not yet been a noticeable effort between noagendamarket and I to separate continued witcoin developments and as far as my impression or perspective I had considered another alternative donation/offer for hosting the site.  This offer was from amiller and he offered to credit noagendamarket's account to pay for vps service for six months.It wasn't until October 28th, when I finally got a hold of noagendamarket after he returned from vacation/occupying that I learned noagendamarket preferred or desired to transfer continued witcoin hosting on CryptoXchange's server and also for them to contribute and help with development.  And later after continued conflict of interests, that had evolved into my losing interest in witcoin name and to continue my development of my codebase under a different name.October 28th, 2011 #witcoin:As you can see in the above dialog CryptoXchange has taken responsibility or put forth effort to handle witcoin stuff, which conflicts with CryptoXchange's declaration (see very beginning of this post) "As this is David's domain, and it is not CryptoXchange that is actually working with this project."Because of this concerted effort and also the private message with noagendamarket:October 28th, 2011 private message:Because of this, I realized that noagendamarket had established a concerted effort to enforce a direction of witcoin to be placed on CryptoXchange's server AND for CryptoXchange to contribute to or take over witcoin.  This was not immediately recognized by me, although I was a tad bit suspicious, until about now and at this point I realized that noagendamarket had established an agenda to continue witcoin with CryptoXchange who, in noagendamarket's perspective, had presented a more active development than mine, in which I admit that it had been months since I touched witcoin, which I had written entirely from scratch.I continued in #witcoin with consideration that there would be conflict of interest between noagendamarket (who paid for domain name and linode vps) and myself (who fully set up and administrated the vps as well as developed the codebase and database structure/backend of witcoin):October 28, 2011 in #witcoin:Notice how even though I had priorly privately communicated with noagendamarket telling him that amiller had credited noagendamarket's account to cover the costs of hosting the site, noagendamarket showed no effort or consideration of allowing for that and instead put forth effort and consideration solely into CryptoXchange taking responsibility of continued witcoin hosting and development.November 02, 2011 private message: That is interesting concern and first importantly depends on if some or all content is preserved at witcoin.com in affiliation with noagendamarket and CryptoXchange or at another site that I am reestablishing under a different name due to lack of domain name ownership.  What are your thoughts? Recently noagendamarket and I, who have been referenced as co-owners of witcoin, have decided to continue working on witcoin separately.noagendamarket in affiliation with CryptoXchange will preserve witcoin.com (and CryptoXchange's recently registered witcoin.org and witcoin.net) to reestablish some kind of site possibly with commercial interests.I am interested to reestablish the witcoin site as I had written and developed it with continued noncommercial interests that, but I will do so under a different name and no longer affiliate with witcoin brand/name.I would like to know others' thoughts on what seems most appropriate for the witcoin community.noagendamarket and CryptoXchange want to make use of my code base and affiliated database structure and all sql data of user-generated content and activity to recreate and recreate the site for their own use, whilst I want to reestablish the site as it was under a different name.We cannot both make use of the data since the affiliated bitcoins cannot be duplicated.I am uncertain how to proceed as I feel a kind of responsibility for the community behind the site that I made and do not want to make a poor choice of either: preserving the data to move to new site -or- abandoning the data for new ownership to use.Therefore, any thoughts from anyone in regards to what seems best or reasonable resolution to this concern would be appreciated.Some responses I received from others: oooh, I don't see the penguin symbol.  Any idea what I need to install or configure in linux environment to see it?  I see the rest. citation needed How about something liek this?

Interesting point.  I, for one, welcome our new operation mafia overlords I am uncertain in which way you have evaluated my referencing the video had any correlation to peacefulness.  I did not provide any such communications to describe, explain, detail, analyze, document, illustrate, explain, cover or otherwise characterize any contents, events or actions contained within the video.  My only reference to the video was one in which had let me to an article which I had found after I learned about the idea or precedent of barbed wire caging for humans (as may be already common for other animals).I wonder when there will be cagings and farmings for humans similar to other animals.  I, for one, welcome our new quality packaged human meat produ....wait, what? O____X link to this please http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANNOh really?  ICANN says otherwise. A very well written article:The Real Reason Why Police Cage Peaceful ProtestorsDan Hancox is a London-based journalist working for the Guardian and others, the editor of Fight Back!, and the author of Kettled Youth.I stumbled upon this article (which is quite amazing) after seeing this video. Is there an email address affiliated with this exchange?Is there a phone number affiliated with this exchange?Is there an address affiliated with this exchange?Is there a freenode irc channel or nickname affiliated with this exchange?[/b]see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47768.msg569634#msg569634 That is correct.  I do not understand that any assistance here would be pretty much a link to a Google search or one of you saying look on IRC.As of yet I have not received a response or assistance providing any particular google search query that is helpful in answering any of my questions.  If the information is not available, also I do not believe a google search query would be able to communicate that the information is not and will never be made available yet.  I believe this is also true for looking on IRC, in which according to my logs I see no information about the exchange that would answer any of the questions.Again, the questions are:Is there an email address affiliated with this exchange?Is there a phone number affiliated with this exchange?Is there an address affiliated with this exchange?Is there a freenode irc channel or nickname affiliated with this exchange? For reference, this phishing issue first documented hereDo it!Do it!

I see Wladimir J. van der Laan - laanwj@gmail.com was added.  Will the bitcoin.org site ever give recognition to all developers that have contributed to the bitcoin.org bitcoin release or only provide recognition to a select few that have been privileged/accepted? successively?  don't you mean succulently? Is there an email address affiliated with this exchange?Is there a phone number affiliated with this exchange?Is there an address affiliated with this exchange?Is there a freenode irc channel or nickname affiliated with this exchange? It could be argued that this statement is incorrect in the sense that had casascius not massly propagated this issue throughout all intertubes connecting all bitcoiners (in this case via emails only), then this would not have been as noticed as it has been and the following may have had continued:- http://casascius.net/ still existing as phishing site and NOT redirecting to https://casascius.com/ and  providing opportunity for additional fraudulent revenue  (note that the .net domain is still managed by the phisher and at any time could cease redirecting to .com domain)Perhaps the concern is more about the content of the mass email than the intent of the mass email.  This may be more accurately recognized in consideration of my similar efforts in which I emailed ALL THE HACKERSPACES and messaged ALL THEIR IRC CHANS asking a simple/short question or providing a simple short statement suggestive/asking if they've heard about the european bitcoin conference next month.  Most of the hackerspaces were appreciative of my spreading awareness and even offered to relay to mailing lists, etc. and were not defensive or expressing of dissatisfaction for such unsolicited technology-related informations/news.  Also, similarly my effort towards Bitcoin Around the World in which I unsolicitedly messaged all non-usian IRCers with short message similar to "hiya.  have you noticed #bitcoin-xx?  that is all ^_^ *waves*" were mostly accepted/appreciated since many of the individuals didn't realize there were others from their country or even forums, mining pools, exchanges, etc for their country.  (note: there were a few that backlashed/raged* similarly as to this experience here, but they were obnoxious minority)Let's evaluate what casascius's mistakes were:Sorry to be sending e-mail to the Mt.Gox leak list. (unnecessary/obnoxious)Please be advised that a recent e-mail purporting to be from me regarding Casascius PhysicalBitcoins is fake and leads to a phishing site.  Don't give out your info unless you're sure you'reat the right place. (maybe okay, but perhaps could be stated more simply)The real Casascius Physical Bitcoins website is at https://www.casascius.com. (This is the controversial part*)If you do not know how to verify my PGP signature, consider looking me up on the forums to makesure you have the right address and are not being phished. (unsure if this is acceptable or not)Sorry for the hassle and the inconvenience, but I suppose this was going to happen sooner or later. (also unsure)*controversial part: Is it better to link to the phishing site only?  the phishing site and the original/real site?  no links at all?  any reference to which site is the phishing site?  any reference to which is the real site?  is it acceptable to indicate which operation/site is being phished?Also, the smallest of concerns/issues liek these...small/family business: FUUUUUUUUUU, my business's reputation is declining...corporation: *ignore until it costs more to ignore than to not ignore* It shouldn't be so surprising.  Consider the idea that the person behind the domain is aware of this thread, realizes that they are only half-evil (e.g. greyhat/grayhat) and decided their evil ploy was foiled/discovered immediately and decided to abandon it and work on other evil ploys....and in addition to abandoning it, they also courteously prepared a quick fix to redirect to the original domain.Also...loosing?   seriously?  wtf is happening..  It's been liek a month since I have seen someone correctly spell "losing."Upon initialization of this thread, I was under the assumption/presumption/idea that there was no spam.  This was based on my personalized reality that I had not received any phishing spam and in anticipation of perhaps later realizing that there was or wasn't such spam as to be reported or not by others.  And less than five minutes later after initiating the thread, I learned that that was a case of phishing in relation to casasacius and without censoring or modifying (too much) my initial post (I did change the topic a bit), I shifted the focus/message to be more accurately depicting.  Of course, there were a few others that also took similar approach as mine in which they jumped to conclusions, in which their jumpages may not have provided additional considerations of their conclusions being inaccurate or obnoxious. Perhaps you seriously think other things too, such as that this is not nothing more than just a marketing plan (lowercased because it seems strange to uppercase this phrase) to do exactly what has happened.  In the case that you do think about this and/or other things, you should consider letting this forum know of those such thoughts as well so as to not withhold such informations derived from yuor thoughts. ^_^ Dear mizerydearia,This is obnoxious. ^_^l3estest l2egardedsness,Miz  Within minutes of collaborating regarding this issue and establishing better understanding of the issue, although it may seem a bit obnoxious to have received the email as I had referenced/suggested in my initial post, I do agree that it is helpful to better spread awareness of this concern/issue.  I have changed topic (in my own way) to reflect better reality of what is important: that there is a fraudulent site still that may trick/deceive/scam users and that they should avoid it.Add to your hosts file:Code:0.0.0.0 casascius.net Imp Note: HumansMen aren't perfect <- SexismNote: I received this email three times. O_OHint: I never received a phishing email most likely because I was not affiliated with the collection of email addresses that were sent phishing emails.Note: Casascius is real human existence (that frequents freenode irc network) and has contributed stuffs, however, this particular email seems a tad bit obnoxious.  Although, at least he apologized.Musical Note: Consulting with Casascius on freenode IRC network he confirmed that email is authentic and from him.I shall try this, one for each of my projects, and of course, provide an apology to excuse my sending to thousands of emails to propagate the message that contains links to each of the projects. ^_^  It shall be very effective without any backlash, eh?  Yay traffic to my websites!Perhaps there could be a better way to reach large audience of bitcoiners than relying on leaked email lists to better propagate these types of informations in a way that is more solicited/expected/desired?  Maybe someone can establish a site/service for this particular purpose? Perhaps something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_massively_multiplayer_online_games#Free_play_with_micro-transactions ?

the world, that as part of one or more of my efforts to as littly as possible (just more than not at all) mention things that are newsworthy in relation to bitcoin, it can seem undesirable especially in the case of recognizing such communications originating form a single person or entity as being the same communications reciprocated to others in other locations and especially in the case where such communications are to others that are not family, friends, co-workers, peers or anyone else that has an established localized affiliation or recognition.*breath*Basically, I should accept and consider more so that such unfriendliness (see thread title) iswas not entirely accurate and instead I should consider more so myself as being promoted or described in a way that better realistically evaluates that instead I am not so .If it's even worthy of discussing at all, which in this case, it's not, but I seemed to have brought attention to it anyway.

I was in the channel for at least a week without getting banned and then all of a sudden without having said anything for 7+ days, ban....yeah, tl;dr, nobody cares, so wtfever. ^_^ Also see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=49310.0 This may beis a tad bit obnoxious, but out of the blue I was banned from EFNet #unallocatedspace and I eventually learned it was in relation to bitcoin.http://pastebin.com/ke8ck5zaThis seems kinda familiar.I'm still awaiting unban, but meh, it doesn't matters I guess. Also see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=49179.0 http://openmetaverse.org/https://www.virwox.com/omc-open-metaverse-currency.phphttp://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2011/05/should-opensim-use-bitcoin-as-its-virtual-currency.htmlhttp://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2011/06/bitcoin-opensim-fail.html Discuss this at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MediaWiki_talk:Sidebar suggests neofutur I am running a couple projects, namely witcoin and bitcoin markets, on a single linode 512 vps (and with an exavault evbackup 10gb open remote backup account), however the current individual who has paid the costs of hosting for these projects can no longer do so as of October 28th, 2011.  I also cannot afford anything as I haven't made any money since a month or so prior to creating this thread last year.I would like to ask if there is anything that can be done so as to allow opportunity for me (and others) to continue developing these and futurely other projects.I have previously discussed with a couple others in various bitcoin-related channels on freenode surrounding this concern, but I haven't made a decision on how to best proceed.Kind-of-relatedly, if I have opportunity to continue developing bitcoin-related projects including especially the ones listed above, again, I will be preparing an open source release of witcoin sometime in year 2011.  I think as an open source project it would allow for better existentiality in the case of my inability to continue it and for others to continue or recreate it identically without reverse engineering or rewriting code-base entirely.Any thoughts from others is appreciated.Update: changed thread topic to "Seeking Funding"One thought I have is that if I can arrange for the projects to be funded by donations, then I could prepare financial transparency similar to http://www.geekshed.net/donate/accounts/.Update: I found hosting for bitcoin markets courtesy of joepie91 in #bitcoinconsultancy.  Thanks! Much appreciation to you (if you're joepie91)!  ^_^ A few days ago I suggested for MagicalTux to change the link to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Forums but he decided to not link to that page and instead link to http://bitcointalk.org/See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MediaWiki:Sidebar where you will notice all links except the forum link are wikified and not direct link to 3rd party website.  Perhaps the bitcointalk.org forum site is special because MagicalTux hosts it now and has special interests, whereas comparably MagicalTux does not host any 3rd party IRC server which he could especially link to instead of the IRC wiki page.Personally I think it would be much more communitively helpful to link to all the forums instead of link to a single forum so as to be helpful more so than anything else.  But maybe there are other things to be concerned about than helpfulness? ^_^ Except when you mine gold you do not validate any transactions.  Generating a block for bitcoin validates and secures transactions into that block. I will soon be implementing something like this into the bitcoin markets project. Coinabul offers gold exchange too iirc. I think one answer to title of this thread is 0. Bitcoin is not artificial intelligence and even if it were I do not believe it would have the ability to establish communication across necessary channels or mediums to interact with those necessary to make it possible to display ads on one or more video networks.  Besides, I find it difficult to comprehend how Bitcoin could even prepare video content to submit to the video networks as well.  I would imagine at least one or more humans would need to assist Bitcoin in this endeavour even if Bitcoin were to show such initiative.Perhaps you mean to imply referencing Bitcoin as a kind of entity or community, one that you are not part of?  e.g. something liek 'anonymous' or '99%' as an entity or community, and again, one in which you are not part of?Or maybe someone gave birth to an animal (probably human) and named them 'Bitcoin?'  Or someone officially/legally changed their name to 'Bitcoin?'Sultan:s/BitCoin/Bitcoin/s/SkyNet/Skynet/(some people liek to grossly abuse case ._.)case saixraep ftlFTFY I recommend also to consider Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry.

Imagine if generating (or printing) us dollars were profitable.  If that were true, then us dollars would be printed quite rapidl....oh waitAlso, validating/mining will continue and it will still be quite profitable, but primarily for those who are located in areas where cost of electricity is very minimal or free. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40272  http://willyou.typewith.me/p/euroconf_typosFeel free to help correct any mistakes. ^_^Currently It appears one or more people are using this historic event to claim the following misleading idea:This is inaccurate and I am quite disappointed that I have to follow-up on this issue to point out the exaggeratedness of this claim especially without anything to back it up, a claim created out of thin air.Just because one bitcoin-related torrent was removed which is known (because I caused a scene and documented it in relation to my torrent not being spam), does not mean all bitcoin-related torents will be removed.  In fact, if you review the information in the beginning of this thread you will have realized that there were many bitcoin torrents that existed and remained even after my bitcoin-related torrent was removed.  Again, fucking obnoxious claim is fucking obnoxious.Just because in relation to the scene caused, one or more people that mentioned bitcoin were banned from #thepiratebay.org does not mean all people that mention bitcoin will be banned from #thepiratebay.org.  Again, FUUUCKING obnoxious claim.I see some people that recurringly exaggerate or make partially inaccurate statements to misleadingly spread awareness of situations or entities/organizations/people and several other individuals jumping on the same bandwagon without recognizing the truth or accuracy of such claims.  Wtfever though.  To each their own reputation. Update: Apparently this is not a bfd and I shall chill out.  My apologies for not being chill.TLDR:Jeff Garzik, Please help recover the following channels: #bitcoin-bg, #bitcoin-br, #bitcoin-es,

action to Jeff Garzik and through several days of noticeable Internet (e.g. IRC) activity, he has failed to take responsibility or action in this situation where he is the sole existence on entire

 Should I prepare interfaces to see for both?For example, during mtgox's flash crash in which more than one person was able to withdraw bitcoins and/or usd (particularly the person who took advantage of the mtgox website vulnerability and there were a couple others that were actively trading and withdrawing at same time) and also of course there were many traders during that time which did not withdraw.  All trades during this period of time were reversed, I believe including those in which one or more people were able to withdraw funds.  Therefore, I am uncertain as to whether it is better to show data for all trades to establish a more realistic accumulation of data or to only show data for which have not been reversed, censored or deleted so as to preserve a more ...how to describe?... accumulation of data. Is there anyone that speaks Blissymbol (zbl), Brithenig (bzt), Quenya (qya), Sindarin (sjn), Glosa (igs), Ido (ido), Interlingua (ina), Klingon (tlh), Láadan (ldn), Lingua Franca Nova (lfn), Novial (nov), Occidental (ile) or Volapük (vol)? come chat in #bitcoin-jbo on freenode.  also see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47057.0 come chat in #bitcoin-eo on freenode.  also see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47057.0 I agree that the wiki page for forums is more appropriate especially considering that there are more well-established community forums that are deserving of attention than solely the bitcointalk.org established forum and simply because it was first is not acceptable enough to not account for promoting/spreading awareness of the other forums. booo... I would prefer a goal of becoming the most reliable, secure, stable, efficient, etc bitcoin exchange, but also would rather prefer for all exchanges to strive for best reliability, best security, best stability, best efficiency, best etc and to not necessarily compete with one another for superiority but instead even helping to promote those others that are superiorly equal due to strivances for best offering of service to consumers.However, it is not responsibility of each exchange to promote one another's established quality of service in all aspects. steve jobs dies and it's covered within hours and is repeated over and over and over and over, ....  Dennis Ritchie dies and almost a week later coverage start to appear.  Caner of #ipefix (on freenode) pointed out OpenUDC to me.I see a couple references to it on this forum:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3122https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=31573 Recreated and bunch of useless spams removed.  Thanks for bearing with me after my initial spam ridden spam.Yo dawg, I heard you don't liek spam, so I removed spam from your spam so you can avoid spam while you encounter spam.More spam here Fix?  That is the exact same. Thanks, but I still have the source data to easily repost without reproducing the entire compilation of data again.  I'm still working on converting the character entities though.   It's taking a bit longer than I anticipated.For example:Code:grep "&" g2/*|sed "s/&#\([0-9]\+\)/\\\x\1/g"The \x\1 doesn't evaluate to unicode value for the entity since the \x is evaluated as x first.  I'm still working on figuring out solution (by asking in #sed on freenode ^_^). Title was 'Sig Ads'I shall be recreating it in a few minutes.  It will be a tad bit improved with the character entities fixed. You can make use of any user's signature to obtain body text.Here's pastebin of old page view: http://pastebin.ca/raw/2089591
I would like to post them on this forum.  Is posting a compilation of user's signatures on this forum unacceptable? My Sig Ads thread was deleted?  WTF? o_XThis thread was full of all users signatures. =/  It took quite a while to prepare the data.  Tis disappointing that it was so easily dismissed as spam/deletion-worthy.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.01. Okay.2. Okay.  The thread had some value/significance as it allowed users to see all user's signatures in a single page view (e.g. view all pages - for threads with 25 pages or less)3. Okay.  See #2.4. Okay.5.

Added Bitcoin in Lojban Seems to be the cause for the flip flop Yes.  It is easy to weaken human population through food and water and it seems rather likely/believable practice.   Think of in relation to enslaving population for as long as possible and what strategies/techniques to use for accomplishing such a reality as well as what steps are necessary to continue preserving denial of self responsibility for such realities perhaps referencing 'conspiracy' as useful/popular word to escape wraith of us putridly disgusting human-liek worms.  note: we're not disgusting (or maybe I overlooking it due to self-bias / self-worth), but I can easily understand how others with such great wealth who are not interested in helping one another (of same species at least) may consider such individuals (e.g. myself) as disgusting in some fashion.Again, ~2% of world population with ~90% of the wealth/freedom to do wtf thy want, whenever they want at the expense of ~98% of population with ~10% of the wealth/freedom to wiggle and squirm defecatingly amongst one another in a fight for survivalism.also most definitely see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf4cpnpam3g (a much better explanation) Will you also consider using: Rapidshare, Megaupload, Hotfile, FileSonic, Wupload, Uploaded, Letitbit, Extabit, FileServe, Depositfiles, Netload, Easy-share, Filefactory, Badongo, 4shared, Przeklej, Dump, Uploading, Storage, Megashares, Furk, 4FastFile, UploadBox, GoldFile, GigaSize, Enterupload, TurboBit, Diglo, HitFile, Oron, Kickload, ZippyShare, SoundCloud, BitShare, PiggyShare, UploadStation, FreakShare and/or x7?  See http://filestube.com/ What about kitty porn? That is understandable.  However, wouldn't it be accurate then, that for government community members, such content is not illegal and therefore it is acceptable to distribute to such individuals in a lawful and legal manner?btw, my apologies for seemingly trolling ya about this, but I'm not trying to; simply making a point that the legality in situations involving governmental people is different than nongovernmental people and therefore it seems a bit inaccurate to claim 'not distribute illegal content to anyone' when precedent shows that individuals involved in such organized communities are not susceptible to the same legalities as those that are not participative or involved in such communities/groups.  Perhaps there is a more reliable way to indicate not distributing particular types of contents to anyone in a way other than referring it to it as 'illegal content' or 'illegal content based on us law?'  Maybe illegal content based on some other law which accounts for every existence whatsoever, including other species of animals and maybe even plants and other matters?' If one of your users is affiliated with government (such as employed at the Pentagon) are they permitted to bypass such legal restrictions since they are not governed by the same laws as nongovernmental citizens? Are you able to provide a complete list of all contents that are illegal based on those laws so that it is clear exactly what to avoid? Illegal content based on which law: civil/governmental/violence law, common law, religi***/enslavement law, other law?

It makes more sense to establish communities surrounding languages instead of regions, hence the desire to communicate in Dutch and not English. Anything is possible.  Think positive.  See http://is.gd/VqJnZu or http://zombo.com/ Glancing at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers perhaps I can evolve the list of channels into using ISO 639-3 language codes instead of the currently used ISO 3166 country codes. ftfy Good point.  Verify the legitimacy and accuracy of this news.Confirmed response from members@freestateproject.org.  See http://freestateproject.org/community/center.php Okay.  Then what about the 90% of the people that did not realize there are others in their country that participate in bitcoin community that they could eventually become aware of maybe if ever.  Perhaps in this instance of reality I am doing more harm than not by helping to introduce such awareness earlier than later (of course this excludes individuals which have become aware of such communities prior to my opportunity to introduce them, in which since they already know, no need to mention it to them)Perhaps this awareness of others in locality (whether through self-efforts or efforts initiated by others) is unnecessary?  Perhaps this effort established by me is similar to other symbolic efforts previously such as considering radio, tv, Internet?  e.g. Google helps to spread awareness of existence of communities, resources.  Although, in the case of Google, people go to Google, Google doesn't go to people.  But again, in the case of Google, how did people hear about Google?  Through word of mouth?  Perhaps my effort is similar to word of mouth in which I, as an individual, am mouthly wording existence of the communities (as well as helping to organize their existence for countries which yet do not have an established organized community)? ^_^Am I getting trolled/trolling? lodcrappo, see my revised reply above. Not quite.  Even prior to my initiative there were 10+ foreign bitcoin channels.  I decided to help better establish closer-knit country-based communities for the same purpose.  However, these communities (on IRC) are not retricted to the close-knit country-specific IRC chans.  They can easily join the global bitcoin communities on IRC (See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IRC_channels) as well.Yep.  Most of these foreign channels the dominant language used is nonEnglish.  It would be overwhelmingly distracting if, for example, #bitcoin channel were a mix of 50+ languages.This is a good point.  If countries US, MX, JP, BY, KZ all agree upon ideaA, ideaB and ideaC and countries US, KZ, MA, PK, CL and IT all agree upon ideaB, ideaC and ideaD, then it makes sense to create separate channels for ideaA, ideaB, ideaC, ideaD instead of for specific countries, since each of these ideas can account for one or more countries and therefore reduce the amount of distinct communities exist (unless, of course, there are more ideas than countries).  So, I can alter this country-based effort to instead make use of some other sort of classification to better distinguish or categorize groups of communities to better serve the very same people behind these communities, buuuuuuuuuuuuuut, I first must know what method of classification to rely upon and also I must be aware of all possible values to use to label them appropriately.  Any suggestions?   However, do keep in mind that this may prevent the ability for communities to rely on alternate languages to communicate with one another as there may be people in each of these communities that do not understand one other. Woo! btw, I just modified a few words in my post.  You're welcome to review them.Yeah.  I most always revise my posts after publishing them, rarely ever using preview function.  Clearly this should be obvious, otherwise, how would I be able to quote you before you even posted?  Oh, right, I'm psychic! I agree that posting a link to a particular historical issue/problem does not fix, resolve or solve the issue/problem.However, glancing at that thread which is started July 12th I recall that http://intersango.com/ at that time was running Intersango v1 (written from scratch by genjix) that implemented OpenID login mechanism.Glancing at http://intersango.com/ now I no longer see OpenID login mechanism and the site is now using Intersango v2 (rewritten from scratch by phantomcircuit).I presume the particular 'hack' or 'exploit' which is regarded as the 'problem' reliant on OpenID is no longer functional considering the lack of OpenID implementation.Therefore, reliance on a particular reference or link to forum thread as a resoluton of said problem seems a bit strange to suggest considering the problem seemingly no longer exists.Just my two cents. hummmm......  I can add these exchanges to http://bitcoinmarkets.com/ project if any of them provide json api for ticker, depth/orderbook and trade history. ^_^ Also, if you use Freenode IRC network, you can see real-time trade data for all bitcoin markets in #bitcoin-markets - Do NOT join these channels.  If you do, you will be an 'annoying asshole' just liek me (see reply below)   - boo drama-induced style of discussionsI appended to this reply instead of creating a new reply so as to be less 'annoying asshole.'huh?  o_X   competing channels?  (maybe this forum thread is a competing channel?)  x_O   product?  maybe service?For the sake of full disclosure, I grepped all of my IRC logs (even across dozens of IRC networks other than freenode) for all instances of "bitcoin-markets" to see where I (or anyone else) has 'advertised' them.The channels that I mentioned the channel on are (all freenode): #bitcoin, #bitcoin-anarchy, #bitcoin-ar, #bitcoin-aus, #bitcoin-br, #bitcoin-cake, #bitcoin-economics, #bitcoin-otc, #bitcoin-otc-foyer, #bitcoinica, #freenode, #mtgox, #solidcoin, #witcoinThe channels that sYN4P515 mentioned the channel on are (all freenode): #bitcoin-otc-ru, #mtgoxliveOther than #mtgoxlive (which I am not responsible for posting in), I do not see any 'competing channels.'Therefore I presume it is safe to indicate that speeder's claim of "including competing channels" is biased/misleading/misinformation.Also, I have received a bit more concern over https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47057 as being annoying in which ~10% of the people I have helped spread awareness to were retaliatory/annoyed whilst the remaining ~90% were appreciative/thankful due to not realizing there was bitcoin community for their country.

Any suggestions? Everyone is powerful.  Vote with your bitcoins.There shall be better organization of information as to which bitcoin exchanges are reputable, reliable, trustworthy.According to the information available at http://bitcoinmarkets.com/exchanges.phpThe following exchanges are possibilities for similar scam/fraudulent opportunities and should be used with caution (or not at all):aqoinBitchangeBTC-EBTCexBitcoin2CashBitcoin CentralBitMarketBitStampBitcoinyBrasil Bitcoin MarketGlobal Bitcoin ExchangeIMCEXMercado BitcoinOtcExchangeOzBitcoinRuxumThe Rock Trading CompanyTradehillActually, it may be useful to establish a kind of standardization to better evaluate and rate which exchanges are reliable/reputable.  Those listed above have little to no contact information that is reliable or reputable enough. and partially ixcoin Why in the makefile is there stillCode:all: bitcoinandCode:bitcoin: $(OBJS) obj/init.o obj/ui.o obj/uibase.o        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(WXLIBS) $(LIBS)also, compile issues: http://privatepaste.com/c9f75d6086 I haven't affiliated a list of core bitcoin (is this a reference to the http://bitcoin.org/ publicized release of bitcoin software?  something else?) developers as part of the bitcoin markets project (documenting information for all bitcoin exchanges and each of their markets data (e.g. trade history, depth/orderbook, ticker) and making all code and data available open sourcely).Currently I am the only developer for the project.  Is anyone else interested to contribute or participate in development? https://gitorious.org/bitcoin-markets/bitcoin-markets Maybe users can use http://bitcoinmarkets.com/exchanges.php as a kind of reference to see which bitcoin exchanges are trustworthy/reliable in which the contact information is available.HOWEVER....The information must also be verified/confirmed so that new exchanges do not provide false information to give perception of legitimacy and continue the fuckages taking advantage of gullible peoples.

Actually, that's not the case.  Jeff Garzik owns bitcoin namespace on freenode and can recover channels as necessary.  If he is run over by bus, then all of #bitcoin-* may be at a risk?  ._.Also, my method is to prepare the channels in anticipation for others to take over as communities form.  This should take only a few days actually, and is already progressing rather nicely.Also, since I rarely go outside and instead sit at my computers 24/7, the chances of getting hit by a bus are rather slim.  Even if a bus were to crash into the home I am currently residing in, I am not in a room that would be impacted and cause death or injury.   A bus would not be able to reach me.Otherwise, do you mean pc bus?Also, I noticed the following channels seem to have been abandoned or are opless and I have contacted jgarzik to recover them:#bitcoin-at#bitcoin-bg#bitcoin-br#bitcoin-es#bitcoin-eu#bitcoin-in#bitcoin-no#bitcoin-otc-sv#bitcoin-ru I don't see how to withdraw my 1 bitcoin.I also do not see a way to specify USD amount even.Code:<div class="row">    <div class="text"><label for="">Amount to withdraw:</label></div>                <div class="field">0.00 USD <img src="img/flags/usd.gif" /></div>   </div>Note that 0.00 is plain text and not an input field.Although, I did not have any usd in my account, only 1 bitcoin.I'm also a bit skeptical that this process is designed to fish for information of others in which the submitted images (if any) will be used for identity theft purposes.Again, bitcoin7 have no documented information as to who they are, so they are free to fuck with anyone and everyone as much as they desire.  Bitcoin7 will most likely respond assuring that this is not the case, but that easily can also be part of their effort to continue the fuckages through sense of doubt and willing to take risks, for anyone who is willing to naively consider such options. ^_^  My method of finding others to manually invite to country-specific channels involves the following:I have three network connections to freenode.One is for all bitcoin-related channels only (log files freenode-bitcoin-#*)  Another is for all altcoin-related channels (and some additional bitcoin-related channels due to 120 chan limit (log files freenode-altcoin-#*)Another is for all foreign bitcoin-related channels only (log files freenode-foreign-#*)Code:tail -f ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/freenode-bitcoin-#* ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/freenode-altcoin-#* ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/freenode-foreign-#*|grep --color=always "\.[a-z][a-z][a-z]\?)"|grep -v --color=always "\.\(com\|edu\|net\|org\))"I switched to znc: (list of nicks that I already contacted included so as to not annoy them again)Code:tail -f ~/.znc/users/freenode_altcoin/moddata/log/#* ~/.znc/users/freenode_bitcoin/moddata/log/#* ~/.znc/users/freenode_foreign/moddata/log/#* ~/.znc/users/freenode_foreigner/moddata/log/#* ~/.znc/users/freenode_global/moddata/log/#*|grep --color=always -e "\*\*\* Joins: .* (.*\.[a-z][a-z][a-z]\?)"|grep -v --color=always -e "\.\(biz\|com\|edu\|net\|org\))" -e "\(.*dearia \|Aklirg \|Alareiks \|ali1234 \|Anduck \|andyroo \|App3l_ \|arcane_ \|archevety \|ArmittK \|AStove \|ASY \|Atomim \|baz \|BCBot \|bdmk \|bencoder_\?

Yay!  Finally unklined! "Please, tell us that you will follow our channel policy and group registration."I had already responded to this admitting that I will follow channel policy (note, there is no established policy relating to what I did), however, still no response. Moved from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47057.msg560614#msg560614Email from me:Email response from Nicolas Coevoet (niko):note: The creating "hundreds channels under multi accounts in few seconds" is exaggerated claim.  The channels were about 100 (or eventually to be about 130), and the channels were registered using multiple accounts (chanserv allows registering only 30 channels per account), however the process was a LOT more than "few seconds."  In fact, if any logs were reviewed, it would be noticed that the first 30 or so registrations were in varying intervals and it was after those 30+ registrations (more than 30 were attempted, but failed due to limit) that I realized only 30 per account and that the next 30 were registered in the span of about 30 seconds (1 per second default irssi interval) and then a bit more delay as I prepared another account to register an additional 30, etc.  So, basically, this was manualized effort, not automated.So, let's look at http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnamingChannels on freenode are owned and operated by the groups which register them.Okay, I created these channels, but I do not own them.No minimum level of activity or moderation is expected or required of channel owners.Okay.The network exists to further on-topic usesOkay.  The individual bitcoin-countrycode channels were designed to be for the topic of bitcoin in each country.  This seems on-topic.and channels or groups may be removed from the network for activity which is considered to be off-topic.Okay.  The channels weren't removed.  A series of klines were triggered.How about http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml ?#bitcoin (the bitcoin* namespace) is owned by jgarzik (Jeff Garzik).  I am not Jeff Garzik.  So... I laterly responded:Although I do not mean to be picky and I easily recognize how registering hundreds of channels would trigger red flag, I don't see anything relating to not registering hundreds of channels.  Nor at http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtmlWhat I do see, however is...http://freenode.net/policy.shtmlChannel Naming: 1. Ensuring that groups and organizations own and control channels associated with their namesPerhaps it is this ensurance that triggered my kline.  However, I had previously registered many other #bitcoin-??? channels and that has not resulted in my kline.  Relatedly, others have also established many other #bitcoin-? channels in which there are hundreds.  I have as well in affiliation with a few of my projects.  Again, though, I am NOT Jeff Garzik.   So maybe I must request permission as he is the ruler of bitcoin name space on Freenode.Primary Channels: Primary channel names, formatted with a single leading hash mark (#), are reserved for participating groups and organizations based on their legal or informal claim to the associated name or name prefix.Okay.  Nothing about restricting users unaffiliated with a group from creating such channels.  I imagine this is established policy so that in the case that users affiliated with the official group have precedence over controlling a channel if they establish any effort for the particular channel(s).Primary Channels: Groups on freenode which clearly do not have claim on a name, or whose activities are considered to be off-topic, will not generally be given administrative control over primary channels bearing a given name or name prefix. These limitations may be implemented at the server software level at some point in the future.Okay.  So I do not have a claim on the 'bitcoin' name and perhaps my activities are somehow off-topic, then I will not be given administrative control over the channels.  This doesn't seem related to klline, does it?Aha... here we go!Off-Topic Use: Unlawful activities and their related support activities are considered off-topic, as are inappropriate advertising, heavy media file trading, gaming and proprietary game software modding, warez, hax0r activity, porn and various forms of antisocial behavior, including (but not limited to) political, racial, ethnic, religious or gender-related invective. Off-topic activity may result in users being barred from the network. So, registering a bunch of country-specific bitcoin channels...  (again in anticipation of preserving channel ops and not losing them and also to eventually pass on channel registration to someone else, preferably someone in the specific country that is interested in taking over ownership/management of the channel), let's see what this fits under.inappropriate advertising?  nope!heavy media file trading?  nope!gaming and proprietary software modding?  nope!warez?  nope!hax0r activity?  nope!porn and various forms of antisocial behavior?  nope!Okay, so maybe "here we go" not. =/Maybe...Termination of Use?Nothing related here.So... wtf?  Why was I klined?Again, I can completely understand that registering many of channels will trigger red flag and especially probably be against policy (especially to prevent abuse, although, my particular purpose can also be argued as not abusive), however, I am not finding anything related to justify my several klines.Laterly, via email to kline@freenode.net:In the meantime, 5 ips are still klined from freenode.  It's been 3.5 hours and FINALLY unklined!  woot!!!! Freenode seemingly has an unofficial policy on 'ban evasion' or 'kline evasion.'Searching Google for `site:freenode.net evasion` returns only http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml which has 0 instances of 'evasion' on the page.Searching Google for `site:freenode.net kline` returns a few results, but nothing seemingly documentative or explanative relating to policies or rules.Frequently upon being klined, when users reconnect they are advised not to 'evade ban' or 'evade kline' and immediately klined again.Recently being klined in relation to this, Nicolas Coevoet (niko) emailed me askingI prematurely and unproofreadingly responded My apologies.  I was k-lined (too many times) in response to this (pre-registering the channels in anticipation of passing them onto someone else for each country for the purpose of not losing operators in channels where others join, I forget to op them and then 10+ people are in a channel and nobody is op). =/See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47079                  8888    DDDDD                                                               ?88888?DDDDDDDDDDD                                                          D? 8888  DDDDDDDDDD       D?$              $D                                Z8 8 88 ?DDDDDDDDDDD       D $                                              7D0?8 8=   II0DDDDDDDD                 I8     ?

This is impossible.  You can't move!  mtgox has the most volume and you will thus be stuck with enduring mtgox wraith foreverz.  Very few (if any) users are willing to make use of any other exchange primarily because of the lack of volume at other exchanges*, thus, even with exchanges with 0% transaction fee and much better security, stability, reliability, you're stuck with continuing to provide additional revenue to mtgox simply because you have to!  Everyone's doing it!</sarcasm> received via pm Thanks.  This was true.  Within the JFK airport I was able to reserve a spot in a shuttle directly to EWR airport.  The ride there was amazing and quite fast.  It took about 70 minutes. I don't think one or more exchanges set the value (community members that use the exchange platforms do) and the disappearance of one or more (or all) of the exchanges has any affiliation with actual worth or valuation.  Instead the disappearance of one or more *coin-holding community members have affiliation with actual worth or valuation.  Putting pressure or blame towards those one or more exchanges (which are not the source for the items exchanged) seems like a misdirected effort. Even though it was admitted that not bitcoin itself, but the torrent release for 'bitcoin markets 2011.10 sql data dump' was assumed to be a ponzi scheme (or at least that is their excuse for the drama the last couple hours), it should be known that had any of the individuals affiliated with the pirate bay in relation to banning the account and the continued kickbanning of myself, genjix and a few others in #thepiratebay.org who spoke anything of bitcoin (which as far as I know, text content is not ponzi scheme in any possible way) actually glanced at the content or the related forum thread linked in the description, they would have immediately realized that there was nothing to do with 'ponzi scheme.'I guess it's easy to confuse sql, data or dump with "ponzi scheme"My idea of one or more of those individuals being incompetent still stands.Laterly: * Now talking on #thepiratebay.org* Topic for #thepiratebay.org is: Thepiratebay:  UP | Bayimg: UP | Baywords: DOWN | Suprbay: UP |  HTTPS avaible now at SB  | Ask in channel before PMing an OP* Topic for #thepiratebay.org set by [WTC-SWE]!WTC-SWE@crew.thepiratebay.org at Mon Oct  3 20:01:15 2011<mizerydea> thanks for the unban ^_^<[WTC-SWE]> np at all<mizerydea> Is it possible the account could be unbanned also?<[WTC-SWE]> Quote from: Richard Rahl on Today at 12:35:08 AM<[WTC-SWE]> I think he was referring to Bitcoin Markets, or w/e torrents you had up, being the pyramid scheme and not Bitcoins.<[WTC-SWE]> ^^^<[WTC-SWE]> that is exactly what happened<K`Tetch> we did a panel on bitcoins 4 weeks ago at Dragoncon<mizerydea> mm.  Okay.  Do you evaluate 'Bitcoin Markets' as not a ponzi scheme now?<K`Tetch> I do<K`Tetch> very much a ponzi scheme<[WTC-SWE]> and for the record i'm not 12 years old-...tell that to the rest of the guys and you can quote me if you wish:)<mizerydea> K`Tetch: Is http://bitcoincharts.com/ also a ponzi scheme?<[WTC-SWE]> Anyways as a good will i willlift the ban<mizerydea> Thanks<Qwizy> [WTC-SWE] must be 14!!!<K`Tetch> http://thepiratebay.org/user/ktetch/ the 2011 torrents have the audio for the bitcoin panel<[WTC-SWE]> mizerydea : As you can see, we don't ban other similar torrents.Anyways i lifted the ban for you.<[WTC-SWE]> Try to log in so i know you're ok.<mizerydea> [WTC-SWE], Yep.  I noticed and that was a cause for confusion.  However it makes more sense now.  I logged in to the account, but I see the torrent is gone also.  Can that be restored also or must I reupload it?<[WTC-SWE]> I'm sorry to say so,but you'll have to reupload it.<[WTC-SWE]> Give me the hash ,so i can clear it for you.<[WTC-SWE]> That way you'll be able to reupload it.<[WTC-SWE]> Look at your client at general..<mizerydea> [WTC-SWE], 3d54cf85135fe0f122fec2259bfc2e13ab8bd221<[WTC-SWE]> hash cleared <[WTC-SWE]> Go ahead and reupload it mizerydea<mizerydea> thanks<[WTC-SWE]> and sorry for all trouble.<Qwizy> Mod went nuts<[WTC-SWE]> Qwizy : It's not "nuts" it was totaly a missunderstanding. http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l00s8/the_pirate_bay_censorban_some_not_all/ - deleted this (a link back to this thread) since it had no comments/discussion and the issue has been resolved.

"I'm pretty sure the whole point of The Pirate Bay is they don't take down torrents"That may be true, and in this case, they didn't take down my torrent.  They got around that by merely banning my account.
Bitcoin Markets is an open source project similar to the closed source/proprietary http://bitcoincharts.com/ project that collects market data from all bitcoin exchanges and prepares the data for view on the web (website still in development), but also #bitcoin-markets (not to be confused with #bitcoin-market (with no s)) shows almost real-time trade data.  I don't see how that project is in any way a ponzi scheme, similarly as to bitcoin charts not being a ponzi scheme. An article by Rick Falkvinge: http://falkvinge.net/2011/09/29/anonymous-from-b-in-joke-to-sociopolitical-philosophy/"... devoted to the freedom of information and anti-censorship." Also, Rick Falkvinge will be speaking at the European Bitcoin Conference: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40272.0 This is offtopic, but I wanted to reference it here because Rick Falkvinge (affiliated with The Pirate Bay in some fashion) will be attending, and I recently experienced a bit of obnoxious bannage from The Pirate Bay crew both at http://thepiratebay.org/ and in their irc channel in relation to uploading bitcoin-related content to http://thepiratebay.org.  However, noticeably there still exists other bitcoin-related content at http://thepiratebay.org/ with the 'bitcoin' tag and therefore I am not entirely confident of their reasoning of banning my account because bitcoin is "ponzi scheme" (also disregarding that bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme) to be accurate since the other bitcoin-related torrents have not been removed or affiliated accounts banned.I do not intend to hijack this thread, so instead direct all responses to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46751 You can easily verify that I am not trolling by joining #thepiratebay.org on EFNet, type /bans and see the ip address listed above as being banned.  Also, you can verify that that IP address is location in Milwaukee, WI, where I live in united states.  If you need verification that I live in Milwaukee, WI, see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5398 or come on IRC and verify my IRC presence with this forum account and check my IP address. Related: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45969.msg554559#msg554559Gah, it really fucking sucks when people in charge of or responsible for organizations, corporations, etc are incompetent. =/I'm quite fuckingly disappointed in The Pirate Bay for this.  The only tag I applied to the torrent was 'bitcoin.'I see at http://thepiratebay.org/tag/bitcoin that there are still other torrents with the 'bitcoin' tag and therefore reference of bitcoin being ponzi scheme to justify banning of my account seems to be not quite accurate. Good point.  Comparably at http://acen.org/ (anime convention) the main page shows a link to Panel Request Form (must be logged in) and Panel Request Policy.Also, at the registration page, for the "I am a" field, I suggest changing "Miner" to "Miner/Validator."  I'm sure Amir Taaki would agree (or instead prefer "Validator" only). ^_^ From Linode's Lee Matos:I presume this type of hesitation to accept bitcoins until bitcoins are 'widely used across the public sector' is prevalent excuse across many businesses, and without any of them taking initiation and instead preserving hesitation, then there will never be an established 'wide use across the public sector.' Update the website with pictures of the confirmed speakers?I updated http://bitcoin.witcoin.com/p/1951/The-European-Bitcoin-Conferencemoved this line to end of thread to spread more awareness. We're not dealing with create-out-of-thin-air-fiat-currency-to-cover-losses-in-guise-of-insurance exchanges/banks.In the case of mtgox losing money (several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins, maybe a million or more, as of yet still kept secret/private by mtgox), mtgox was able to continue because of their transaction fees that generate us$20,000-us$100,000 profit in bitcoins per month and using those profits to cover their losses (which technically if everyone withdrew their money from mtgox, it would be clearly obvious mtgox had insufficient funds, but this didn't happen and mtgox has had (and still has) opportunity to account for losses in this way.bitomat was unable to endure similar experiences since the exchange had free transactions.bitparking seemingly has similar opportunity as mtgox has had (and continues to have) in which continued profit from transaction fees could be used to compensate users for their losses, however, in this particular case, the technological p2p cryptocurrency implementations are still vulnerable to provide a safe, reliable exchange market, whereas in case of mtgox, bitcoin did not noticeably suffer from such vulnerabilities as of yet.  Therefore, this added issue resulting in bitparking to continue offering services in the exact same exchange markets may prevent its opportunity to compensate users for their losses by using funding generated from continued transaction fees and instead would rely on using funding from other sources.And then when that happens, all bitcoin exchanges will probably endure similar experiences, but more devastatingly in relation to fiat currency investments. Originally only suggested or mentioned by Keyur of campbx, but now also agreed upon by Virtex, providing a json api implementation offering results by last trade id or last trade timestamp opens up a kind of cost or risk.Here's discussion with cavirtex.com:Perhaps this issue/concern can be discussed a bit to establish a consensually agreed upon idea on how to best implement a secure, stable method of allowing querying by last trade id or last trade timestamp; one that is not susceptible to abuse? Is the idea of listing other bitcoin developers on the bitcoin.org home page undesirable or unacceptable? Here is the October 2011 sql database dump compatible with Bitcoin Markets project:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6716850 The Pirate Bay claimed the sql db dump was a ponzi scheme and banned the account (now resolved, but torrent not reuploaded)http://bitcoinmarkets.com/bitcoinmarkets-2011-10.sql.bz2.torrentIt contains data for bitcoin exchanges, markets and trade history.  It's approximately 2gb uncompressed. Additionally with a working implementation to provide double spending abilities, it (the software) shall improve over time and be easily compatible with all p2p blockchains, including potentially even bitcoin blockchain if one or more individuals behind the implementation are able to accumulate enough processing power.

most important to make use of exchange with largest volume regardless of reputation, reliability, security, stability, etc?  Perhaps allow customers to select which exchange market for you to use? a few more days left in the month to meet the September launch claim ._. I would like to convince keyur of campbx to implement json api for trades by last trade id or last trade timestamp, however, I am met with a bit of concern from him:I responded to that statement suggesting:He responded with:Discussing in #bitcoinconsultancy about it, joepie91 mentioned memcache, and I agree using it would help, however, I'm fairly confident one could implement an efficient system that doesn't require memcache.  Asking phantomcircuit if he is using memcache for Intersango, he responded he isn't using it since it's not needed yet.I'm not certain how to respond to keyur, so instead I created this post.  Maybe someone can assist in determining whether my request is asking for too much and that such an implementation is indeed ripe for abuse or not. Is there a forum user affiliated with virwox? Can someone link the bitcoin7 user profile? +2 This doesn't seem liek an issue.  Perhaps a useful move would be for someone to put up a 'fuck you' I'm buying 30,000 bitcoins at us$6 (or whatever the price is) and buy them and then the person playing around would be left with us$ and without their bitcoins?   Even more useful would be if someone who were to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars were to take advantage of this opportunity to REALLY say 'fuck you' by writing a bot to wait for those orders to exist and then buy them up at such a great value.   I didn't see any instances of "dalin owens" referenced on this forum, so I thought I'd place this here: http://bitcoin.crimeunit.net/wiki/index.php/MyBitcoin_Somerandomguy_irc_log Example file sizes of json data per exchange market:bcEUR: 61KbbcLREUR: 61KbbcLRUSD: 61KbbcPGAU: 61KbbcmBMUSD: 28KbbcmLRUSD: 8KbbcmMBUSD: 16KbbitchangePLN: 12KbbitmarketEUR: 4KbbitparkI0C: 1KbbitparkIXC: 1KbbritcoinGBP: 9KbbtceUSD: 6KbbtcexUSD: 8KbexchbUSD: 38KbintrsngEUR: 7KbintrsngGBP: 9KbintrsngUSD: 3KbmrcdBRL: 10KbruxumUSD: 24KbthEUR: 1KbthUSD: 4KbQuerying each of these every 30 seconds results in 2,880 queries per day:@1Kb ~= 2.8Mb/day, 84.3Mb/month@61Kb ~= 172Mb/day, 5,147Mb/monthThis bandwidth consumption is guaranteed to be decreased if showing only latest trades since a specific trade id or date (since the last id or date detected) even with increased query time such a 5 seconds.  Especially in the case of an exchange market having 0 new trades in the last 1 second, then JSON "[]" or similar would be returned, which is only two bytes (1/512th Kb), which additionally greatly reduces bandwidth consumption.Looking at an example data file above with largest file size (bcEUR): I see the resulting file returns 950 trades, only 29 of them from the last 24 hours, each string of trade data about 64 bytes.  Querying for this data each second showing only latest trades since a particular trade id or date would then return 29 (instances) * 64 bytes of data + (2880 - 29) * ~4 ~= 13Kb/day, 388Kb/monthWith these example figures, is your exchange interested in saving approximately 5 gigabytes of bandwidth consumption per month reducing a single instance (for example mine/bitcoinmarkets.com(website coming soon), another maybe bitcoincharts.com) of querying from 5 gigabytes per month to less than half a megabyte (only true with above data, more volume will result in more bandwidth consumption) per month? Thanks.   Can you add trade ids to the data?Do you have any JSON APIs for depth/orderbook, ticker, trades?  I didn't see any on your site.
I opted to post this on the forum instead of emailing each exchange (which I will do anyway to alert them of this thread), which also allows for newly established exchanges to also participate:I am streaming trades in real-time to #bitcoin-markets on Freenode, similar to #bitcoin-market that I originally established and have since passed on to nanotube (*waves*), but with potentially much faster (the data is multi-threaded and for some markets, trade data results are faster, e.g. 2-10 seconds delay instead of 10-40 seconds) results.  The short delay is true only for exchanges with a JSON trade API implementation that allows for querying all trades since a last timestamp or trade id, therefore guaranteeing downloading only the trade history, reducing bandwidth and processing time.I have noticed some exchanges that have a discrepancy with sequential trade ids relative to timestamps; some trades have trades ids lesser than other trades but with timestamps more recently/newer than the same trades.  This type of exchange implementation provides a potential issue in the case of querying new trades since last trade id since the particular new trade would be new, but have a much lower trade id than the last trade id from recent queries.  Therefore, if your exchange is like this, it makes much more sense to provide a JSON trade API implementation that references date timestamps instead of last trade id.If your exchange is interested in adding implementation (or does it already have it?) to query trades either equal to or later than a particular timestamp or greater than a trade id, reply.Oh, btw, the open source python bot in #bitcoin-markets is still under development.Also see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=45783 Someone should post something (worthy) at http://theymos.ytmnd.com/ hmm, perhaps the Bitcoin article should be renamed to Bitcoin client to reflect that it is about the client and not about Bitcoin?  -or- split the article into two, one about the satoshi client and another about Bitcoin in general?  That should prevent confusion regarding names of people since there are many separate developments for bitcoin in which all such developments are developed by developers. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin lists only a few developers for Bitcoin.  Perhaps it would be useful to include everyone's name there? A bit delayed, but finally submitted and added icon in header. ^_^ Any progress on this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY8g_IsI_gY * mizerydearia cuts out eyes x_x Huh?  Apologize for pointing out flaws for poorly written proprietary, security through obscurity implementation of bitcoin market with history of lying, censoring/deleting forum posts, market data and other history-rewriting activities?  I, for one, would rather have high expectations of any and all operations and not offer any leniency or acceptancy of poor performers simply due to .... .. actually, I have no idea what reason there would be...  perhaps opportunity for expressing innocence?  incompetence?  other?Alternatively, instead of thoroughly analyzing/stress-testing mtgox market so as to establish any amount of legitimacy (or lack thereof), why not establish effort towards evaluating other later-established (later than early/mid-last year) exchange markets and to give them opportunity to establish themselves as reputable, reliable, trustworthy, secure, etc. exchange market worthy of establishing as bestest exchange markets to make use of...  What is it about mtgox that is superior to all of the other existing exchanges in that it has more volume?o/ obnoxious post is obnoxious Isn't federal reserve a company/bank?

 Regardless though, the codebase developed for mtgox.com exchange seems ripe for abuse and exploitation and will be a feeding ground for those that want bitcoins through the challenge of exploitation.I would imagine it would be more wise to collectively or consensually switch to a more reputable and secure/reliable exchange market and allow it to establish as most popular exchange site..... preferably one that has 0% transaction fees.   Otherwise with mtgox's 0.6% transaction fee from both sides of each transaction and approximate 1,200,000 bitcoins per month transacted, mtgox makes 14,400 bitcoins a month...and at us$6 each, that's almost us$100,000 profix per month.  OMFGZ!! =/ Here are some notes from the different markets offered by Bitcoin exchanges.  Let me know if there are any mistakes.Code:Symbol  Currency  Type  Transaction FeebritcoinGBP  GBP  exchange  0%, freebitmarketEUR  EUR  escrow  0%, freeintrsngEUR  EUR  exchange  0%, freebitmarketUSD  USD  escrow  0%, freeintrsngUSD  USD  exchange  0%, freebitmarketGBP  GBP  escrow  0%, freebitmarketPLN  PLN  escrow  0%, freebitmarketRUB  RUB  escrow  0%, freebcLRUSD   LRUSD  exchange  0%, freeintrsngGBP  GBP  exchange  0%, freebcLREUR   LREUR  escrow  0%, freebcPGAU   PXGAU  exchange  0%, freebcEUR   EUR  exchange  0%, freesldcn24SLC  SLC  exchange  0.1%btceUSD   USD  exchange  0.1%wbxAUD   AUD  exchange  0.1% (capped at 0.025 BTC) when buying BTC, 0.6% (capped at 0.25 AUD) when selling BTC, 3.0% (MTGOX AUD Voucher) when Depositing fundshbtc   USD  exchange  0.15% for sellers, 0.35% for buyers, minimum equivalent of us$0.02bitparkIXC  IXC  exchange  0.2%bitparkNMC  NMC  exchange  0.2%bitparkI0C  I0C  exchange  0.4%bitstampUSD  USD  exchange  0.5%bcmBMGAU   PXGAU  escrow  0.5% commission / sending money         bcmBMAUD   BMAUD  escrow  0.5% commission / sending money         bcmBMUSD   BMUSD  escrow  0.5% commission / sending money         exchbUSD   USD  exchange  0.54%btcexUSD   USD  exchange  0.55%campbxUSD  USD  exchange  0.55%b7USD   USD  exchange  0.57%b7BGN   BGN  exchange  0.57%b7SAR   SAR  exchange  0.57%b7EUR   EUR  exchange  0.57%b7PLN   PLN  exchange  0.57%virtexCAD  CAD  exchange  0.59% of transaction value in either CAD (buying) or BTC (selling), 0.01 (CAD/BTC) minimummtgoxUSD   USD  exchange  0.6%thUSD   USD  exchange  0.6%thEUR   EUR  exchange  0.6%mtgoxRUB   RUB  exchange  0.6%thAUD   AUD  exchange  0.6%thLRUSD   LRUSD  exchange  0.6%mtgoxPLN   PLN  exchange  0.6%mtgoxEUR   EUR  exchange  0.6%mtgoxAUD   AUD  exchange  0.6%thCLP   CLP  exchange  0.6%thINR   INR  exchange  0.6%mrcdBRL   BRL  exchange  0.6%mtgoxGBP   GBP  exchange  0.6%mtgoxSEK   SEK  exchange  0.6%mtgoxCNY   CNY  exchange  0.6%mtgoxTHB   THB  exchange  0.6%mtgoxCAD   CAD  exchange  0.6%mtgoxCHF   CHF  exchange  0.6%mtgoxDKK   DKK  exchange  0.6%mtgoxHKD   HKD  exchange  0.6%mtgoxJPY   JPY  exchange  0.6%mtgoxNZD   NZD  exchange  0.6%mtgoxSGD   SGD  exchange  0.6%rockSLL   SLL  exchange  1%bcmPXGAU   PXGAU  escrow  2% withdrawingbcmLRUSD   LRUSD  escrow  2% withdrawingbcmMBUSD   MBUSD  escrow  2% withdrawingbcmMLUSD   MLUSD  escrow  3% withdrawingvirwoxSLL  SLL  exchange  50SLL + 1.00%b2cUSD   USD  exchange  shipping and handling fee of us$5.00 when receiving us$ by mailruxumUSD   USD  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumJPY   JPY  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumHKD   HKD  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumTHB   THB  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumCHF   CHF  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumGBP   GBP  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumEUR   EUR  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumSGD   SGD  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumPLN   PLN  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumAUD   AUD  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumRUB   RUB  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumHUF   HUF  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumSEK   SEK  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumZAR   ZAR  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesruxumUAH   UAH  exchange  us$10 per bank wire transfer deposit for all currenciesbitchangePLN  PLN  exchange  withdrawals 1PLN See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg520870#msg520870  Anyone willing to suggest who the people that were contacted are?

Repost this to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=42459 and continue discussion there ^_^ Continuation of https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg516136#msg516136   Idea originally thought of by Blackout.Discuss ideas for a Bitcoin Monopoly game information and perhaps additionally someone (or several someones) can take initiative in contacting Hasbro with effort in helping to make Bitcoin Monopoly a reality.Come discuss at Freenode #bitopoly wow, luke_bitgit@dashjr.org owns a lot of repositories, including:http://tcatm.github.com/bitcoin-js-remotehttp://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-toolshttps://github.com/phantomcircuit/bitcoin-altall of which seem to not actually be owned by luke_bitgit@dashjr.org ._.Perhaps that list is simply syndicated and recreated git repos.Here's list of original repos:Bitcoin Wallet Android appgit://github.com/chromicant/Bitcoin-Wallet.gitAn Android widget that shows the value of a bitcoin in US dollars on the Mt Gox Bitcoin exchange.git://github.com/gostaj/MtGoxWidget.gitA Bitcoin network protocol implementationgit://github.com/cdecker/BitDroid-Network.gitBitcoin-Control-Panelgit://github.com/mizerydearia/Bitcoin-Control-Panel.gitSources for Bitcoin Poker Roomgit://github.com/hippich/Bitcoin-Poker-Room.gitA thin Android client for Bitcoingit://github.com/opposablebrain/BitcoinDroid.gitOpenCL miner for BitCoingit://github.com/Diablo-D3/DiabloMiner.gitFirefox extension displaying current Bitcoin pricesgit://github.com/frewsxcv/Bitcoin-Prices.gitA Bitcoin wallet, backup, and miner managergit://github.com/Fnordsoft/Bitcoin-Projects.gitModular, fast, efficient Bitcoin minergit://github.com/jedi95/Phoenix-Miner.gitunfinished bitcoin android clientgit://github.com/dirtyfilthy/bitcoin-wallet.gitBitcoin Private Key Extractorgit://github.com/dirtyfilthy/bc_key.gitBitCoin Money Making Gamegit://gitorious.org/bcmmg/mainline.gitXMPP/Bitcoin gatewaygit://gitorious.org/bitcoim/gateway.gitOpen source chain browser like Block Explorergit://github.com/jtobey/bitcoin-abe.gitbitcoin-altgit://github.com/phantomcircuit/bitcoin-alt.gitSet of bash functions for bitcoin address manipulationgit://github.com/grondilu/bitcoin-bash-tools.gitBitcoin Centralgit://github.com/davout/bitcoin-central.gitA wireshark dissector for the bitcoin protocolgit://github.com/blueCommand/bitcoin-dissector.gitspec file for bitcoin cryptocurrency programgit://github.com/sneakatdatavibe/bitcoin-el5-rpm.gitRuby library for communicating with a Bitcoin clientgit://github.com/requnix/bitcoin.gitAn open source generic exchange for bitcoingit://github.com/famulus/bitcoin-generic-exchange.gitJavascript remote for bitcoindgit://github.com/tcatm/bitcoin-js-remote.gitWallet Impl on Androidgit://github.com/bitcoin-labs/bitcoin-mobile-android.gitBitcoin library for PHPgit://github.com/mikegogulski/bitcoin-php.gitBitCoin perl implementationgit://gitorious.org/bitcoin/bitcoin-pl.gitFriendly bitcoin API binding for Pythongit://github.com/toomanysecrets0/bitcoin-python.gitBitcoin payment plugin for VirtueMart shopping cart for Joomla!git://github.com/mikegogulski/bitcoin-virtuemart.gitBitcoin payment plugin for WP e-Commerce for WordPressgit://github.com/mikegogulski/bitcoin-wp-e-commerce.gitbitcoin for iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPodTouch)git://github.com/udibr/bitcoinApp.gitBitCoin Bugzilla Extensiongit://github.com/darkskiez/bitcoinbugzilla.gitBitcoin integration/staging treegit://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.gitadd bitcoin to your rails appgit://github.com/danneu/bitcoiner.gitThis Sinatra application provides a REST interface for the Bitcoin server daemon.git://github.com/benmanns/bitcoinrest.gitPython-based tools for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency systemgit://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcointools.gitA prediction market in bitcoingit://github.com/kiba/bitpredict.gitBitcoin acceptance plugin for facebook.com applicationsgit://github.com/kaioless/btc2fb.gita naming/aliasing service for Bitcoin usergit://github.com/0x10/BTCnames.gitbtfeaturegit://gitorious.org/bitcoin/btfeature.gitSet of PHP classes to interact with bitcoin nodes.

From http://www.ugtv.org/glenneichler.php: I agree.  serious business only btw, I edited my post just above with an additional two sentences.  Feel free to read it. :3That is interesting to point out, and I agree my investigation has been one sided most likely due to bias.  My apologies.  I do agree more publicated information from phantomcircuit will be helpful.   Because of my bias, I encourage someone else to take initiative to gather more informations as necessary. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg498999#msg498999If you wish to learn more specific details, there's #bitcoinconsultancy on Freenode IRC network.  The rest of your post is interesting to shed some light on as well.  It'll be interesting for phantomcircuit to provide more details about his experience. Ah, yes, I misinterpreted 'business.'  I shall upgrade my interpreter to a more efficient implementation. thanks, also to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41456.msg505106#msg505106It would be exciting if contributions were displayed similarly.  Bitcoin is open source community effort.  Contributors should deserve better support/recognition for their contributions.   Currently only a select few are gaining recognition and attention from being listed at bitcoin.org home page. http://bitcoin.org/ official site currently lists developers as:    * Satoshi Nakamoto    * Gavin Andresen - (PGP)    * Pieter Wuille    * Nils Schneider - nils.schneider@gmail.com (PGP)    * Jeff Garzik - jgarzik@exmulti.com (PGP)Latest http://archive.org/ snapshot shows developers as:    * Satoshi Nakamoto    * Gavin Andresen - (PGP)    * Amir Taaki - (PGP)    * Pieter Wuille    * Nils Schneider - nils.schneider@gmail.com    * Jeff Garzik - jgarzik@exmulti.com (PGP)which removes Amir Taaki's name from the list.The site links to open source Bitcoin repository at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoinand latest commits in that repository for each of those listed are:Satoshi Nakamoto: 2010-12-15Gavin Andresen: 2011-09-02Pieter Wuille: 2011-08-03Nils Schneider: 2011-06-03Jeff Garzik: 2011-09-02Amir Taaki: Matt Corallo: 2011-09-02Daniel Folkinshteyn: 2011-09-02Giel van Schijdnel: 2011-08-11Fabian H jr.: 2011-08-16ovdeathiam: 2011-08-22Dev Random: 2011-08-23Michal Zima: 2011-08-17Venkatesh Srinivas: 2011-08-07Vegard Nossum: 2011-07-31JoelKatz: 2011-07-26Johannes Henninger: 2011-08-01Jeroenz0r: 2011-08-01Han Lin Yap: 2011-07-30Wladimir J. van der Laan: 2011-07-26Abraham Jewowich: 2011-07-18Michael Bemmerl: 2011-07-17Eric Hosmer: 2011-07-16Dawid Spiechowicz: 2011-07-14Stephanie Gimenez: 2011-07-14Patrick Varilly: 2011-07-14Jay Weisskopf: 2011-07-13Doug Huff: 2011-06-30Dylan Noblesmith: 2011-06-24James Burkle: 2011-06-24Jordan Lewis: 2011-05-16Dean Lee: 2011-06-09xHire: 2011-05-26HostFat: 2011-05-26Jakob Kramer: 2011-05-26ariel: 2011-05-25dabaopku: 2011-05-22Federico Faggiano: 2011-05-20m0ray: 2011-05-24Danube: 2011-05-25Carlos Pizarro: 2011-05-15Blitzboom: 2011-05-17Anonymous: 2011-05-18mewantsbitcoins: 2011-05-14Daniel Holbert: 2011-05-09Jaromil: 2011-04-23Carlo Alberto Ferraris: 2011-05-07Forrest Voight: 2011-05-08Amir Yalon: 2011-05-06John Maguire: 2011-05-05Ricardo M.

This change could be contributory towards establishing even better pump and dump than has occurred so far.  Congrats to mastermind?HOWEVERSolidCoin is open source and NOBODY has to use that particular release.  Fork perhaps?  Additionally with fork, restore the MIT license to be included? By the way, for clarification, the issue here is not affiliated with me directly (indirectly as part of bitcoin community perhaps), and therefore this is not my case.  I'm just participating in this thread at my own initiative. Okay.  AnyOnE wannA hElP me wIth mY CaSe?  In case I act liek a headcase or nutcase (or pillowcase?), feel free to showcase the post as example how not to (insert suitable word with "case" in it here). hmm, I guess I am okay with http://tinyurl.com/looking-like-this even though all the personal info that I accumulated was already on the Internet available for anyone to find out for themselves as well, and I simply saved them maybe an hours worth of time in which each person (take 100 persons as example) spending 1 hour each equals 100 hours of humantime.  I guess this effort of saving people this time specific to the case of researching a particular individual specifically in the case where the particular individual was pseudonymous is a 'shitty' thing to do in some (most? all? other?) perspectives. I think Stephen Molyneux has spoken a lot of noninitation of force and nonuse of violence including using others (e.g. police (hint: brutality)) to perform the violent deeds for you. The free market would work exactly how it is in this thread EXCEPT for all the reference to law and legal precedent.  There STILL would be effort to recover the lost/stolen property but instead of resorting to relying on established law governing human species (do laws apply to other animals?  If so, I would like to incriminate some pestering bugs that have been overwhelming me lately.), there would be resorting to other activities liek %$%#$&ing and ^*&*&^%#$ing. If this is true, then if a human initiates the sale of the bitcoins owned by the computer, then that is theft and the computer would have been victimized by the criminal human.
You know what this means?  Laws have been deprecated!  Woo!  We are no longer slaves!  FREEDOM! Discuss!  Also, see this. This (transfer vs possession) is interesting discussion (started a new thread for this) that contains some comments from this thread: ???? It doesn't matter if the item in question is a currency.  It could have been 511 stuffed animals and the case would still be the same, EXCEPT, this is NOT the stuffed animal community and then would not take place on this forum.Lastly, it will probably be necessary to repeat this every two or three posts, but https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg498999#msg498999 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg500176#msg500176 Re: this issue, ED anyone? Actually..... I think he's on to something.  For example one could disprove gravity by jumping until they no longer fall each time.  Similarly, one could disprove other laws in similar fashions. Congratulations!  You have become better at reading! +1 I would imagine that if an organization were to experience this situation recurringly, that after second and third times of repeating the same mistake would establish recognition that it may be a form of scheming and considered rather scandalous or malicious and affect the reputation of that organization.  Encouraging and promoting option of pursuing illegal activities (e.g. not returning the coins) in relation to 'teaching lesson' effort seems kinda ... well...  uhh...  hmm, criminal?  (for lack of a better description)Are you sure the condition for that if statement is accurate?if (too easy for businesses to get back coins accidentally sent) { accidentallysendcoins(); }if (not easy for businesses to get back coins accidentally sent) { tryanotherstrategy(); }Are you sure 'businesses" is correct way to reference these types of ethics/morals?  Perhaps something more evil or scammalicious is suitable in place of "business?"  Or, perhaps an additional descriptive word before business?  Although, there are many consensually agreed upon businesses that are evil (e.g. Sony, Microsoft, SCO, etc.), yet, trying to think of a business that is opposite, good, actually seems a bit difficult.  Even Nintendo has its share of evils.  Therefore, perhaps "business" alone is indication of evilness? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41155.msg501859#msg501859  ^_^ Updated https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg500238#msg500238 If this were the case, perhaps it would be wise to use an exchange that had a 99.9% transaction/conversion fee.

oops, see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg499984#msg499984 Would it be useful to establish legal precedent?Ah, I see.  You should publicize the threats. This deserves more attention.  Yay for Vladimir!gross incompetence?see abovehmmmm, I'm curious about this.  Can anyone acknowledge or confirm the validity of this statement? That seems to be a scam.  Perhaps bitcoin exchanges are scams too? I imagine (fantasize?) phantomcircuit had contacted him privately initially and probably in a polite manner, and it seems that BenDavis had ignored the private contact and thus led to contacting him publicly in IRC. Yeah, BenDavis didn't steal the exchange's money, he stole the community's money, which could potentially be yours. ^_^   Therefore, that means if everyone at the exchange tried to withdraw their money, they couldn't because BenDavis has some of them, the exchange doesn't have them anymore. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40934.msg498999#msg498999 I confirm that this is authentic.It starts with:and continues with (also see bottom):Continues with: Here's a simple bash script to download all trade history json data from MtGox.Update:Code:#!/bin/bashoutputfile=datalasttrade=0while test -n "$lasttrade";do wget --quiet https://mtgox.com/code/data/getTrades.php?since=$lasttrade if test "`cat getTrades.php\?since\=$lasttrade`" != "[]";then  cat getTrades.php\?since\=* >> $outputfile;  echo >> $outputfile;  lasttrade=`cat getTrades.php\?since\=$lasttrade|sed "s/,/\n/g"|grep tid|tail -n 1|cut -d ":" -f 2|cut -d "\"" -f 2`;  lasttradets=`cat getTrades.php\?since\=*|sed "s/,/\n/g"|grep date|tail -n 1|cut -d ":" -f 2`;  echo "$(date -d @$lasttradets)  tid $lasttrade" else  echo Finished fi rm getTrades.php\?since\=*;done#!/bin/bashoutputfile=datalasttrade=0while test -n "$lasttrade";do   wget --quiet https://mtgox.com/code/data/getTrades.php?since=$lasttrade   cat getTrades.php\?since\=* >> $outputfile;   echo >> $outputfile;   lasttrade=`cat getTrades.php\?since\=*|sed "s/,/\n/g"|grep tid|tail -n 1|cut -d ":" -f 2|cut -d "\"" -f 2`;   lasttradets=`cat getTrades.php\?since\=*|sed "s/,/\n/g"|grep date|tail -n 1|cut -d ":" -f 2`;   if test -n "$lasttrade"; then echo "$(date -d @$lasttradets)  tid $lasttrade"; fi   rm getTrades.php\?since\=*;done#!/bin/bashoutputfile=outputnext=0while test -n "$next";do   wget https://mtgox.com/code/data/getTrades.php?since=$next   cat getTrades.php\?since\=* >> $outputfile;   echo >> $outputfile;   next=`echo "$(cat getTrades.php\?since\=*|sed "s/,/\n/g"|grep tid|tail -n 1|cut -d ":" -f 2|cut -d "\"" -f 2)+1"|bc`;   rm getTrades.php\?since\=*;doneHere is a list of urls to download trade history from mtgox from very beginning tid 1 until tid 1314315710505672 with timestamp 1314315710 (Fri Aug 26 01:41:50 CEST 2011), each returning 100 results: http://pastebin.com/pmhMXZJudownload json data from torrent: http://www.wupload.com/file/124870046/mtgox_trades_json.ts-1314316120.js.torrentAlso see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MtGox/API#0.2Fdata.2FgetTrades.php More like free advertisement for bitcoin to show that it encompasses its children forked genesis key blockchains and that those blockchains are based off bitcoin.  Although, I suppose bitcoiners (or a couple of them anyway) would rather segregate maybe? Hey, genjix here, posting under someone else's accountIt's in the repo, https://gitorious.org/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blobs/master/bitcoin.sql Hey genjix here, I'm posting as mizerydearia since I'm not logged in ... blaa blaaHere;s a fast way to calculate difficulty. It uses a modified taylor series for the logarithm (you can see tutorials on flipcode and wikipedia) and relies on logs to transform the difficulty calculation:Code:#include <iostream>#include <cmath>inline float fast_log(float val){   int * const exp_ptr = reinterpret_cast <int *>(&val);   int x = *exp_ptr;   const int log_2 = ((x >> 23) & 255) - 128;   x &= ~(255 << 23);   x += 127 << 23;   *exp_ptr = x;   val = ((-1.0f/3) * val + 2) * val - 2.0f/3;   return ((val + log_2) * 0.69314718f);} float difficulty(unsigned int bits){    static double max_body = fast_log(0x00ffff), scaland = fast_log(256);    return exp(max_body - fast_log(bits & 0x00ffffff) + scaland * (0x1d - ((bits & 0xff000000) >> 24)));}int main(){    std::cout << difficulty(0x1b0404cb) << std::endl;    return 0;}Unfortunately I don't have much use for it in libbitcoin. Maybe some miner will find it useful.To see the math to go from the normal difficulty calculations (which require large big ints bigger than the space in any normal integer) to the calculation above, here's some python:Code:import decimal, mathl = math.loge = math.eprint 0x00ffff * 2**(8*(0x1d - 3)) / float(0x0404cb * 2**(8*(0x1b - 3)))print l(0x00ffff * 2**(8*(0x1d - 3)) / float(0x0404cb * 2**(8*(0x1b - 3))))print l(0x00ffff * 2**(8*(0x1d - 3))) - l(0x0404cb * 2**(8*(0x1b - 3)))print l(0x00ffff) + l(2**(8*(0x1d - 3))) - l(0x0404cb) - l(2**(8*(0x1b - 3)))print l(0x00ffff) + (8*(0x1d - 3))*l(2) - l(0x0404cb) - (8*(0x1b - 3))*l(2)print l(0x00ffff / float(0x0404cb)) + (8*(0x1d - 3))*l(2) - (8*(0x1b - 3))*l(2)print l(0x00ffff / float(0x0404cb)) + (0x1d - 0x1b)*l(2**8)Cyaupdate: Links added by miz Since bitcoin is peer-to-peer, does that fact alone 100% guarantee that it is incorruptible?Is it possible in any way or fashion to corrupt bitcoin?> wardearia it is "possible" but not easy> define corruptKardos, Having or showing a willingness to act dishonestly in return for money or personal gain.from google results> sigh, i mean in your contextI have no idea how to define it in my context> well theres plenty of scammers turning up> bitcoin itself is not an intelligent entity that can become corrupted by greedthat last line alone seems to imply such a sentence is erroneous-What seems like a more accurate way to rephrase the statement: Trying to compile (manually) bitcoind I get this errorCode:g++ -O2 -Wno-invalid-offsetof -Wformat -g -D__WXDEBUG__ -DNOPCH -DFOURWAYSSE2 -DUSE_SSL -I/usr/include/boost-1_42 -I/usr/include/db4.8 -I/usr/lib64/boost-1_42 -I/usr/lib64 -o i0coind obj/nogui/util.o obj/nogui/script.o obj/nogui/db.o obj/nogui/net.o obj/nogui/irc.o obj/nogui/keystore.o obj/nogui/main.o obj/nogui/wallet.o obj/nogui/rpc.o obj/nogui/init.o obj/nogui/crypter.o cryptopp/obj/sha.o cryptopp/obj/cpu.o -I/usr/include/db.48 -I/usr/include/boost-1_42 -I/usr/include/db4.8 -I/usr/lib64/boost-1_42 -I/usr/lib64 -Wl,-Bstatic -l boost_system -l boost_filesystem -l boost_program_options -l boost_thread -l db_cxx -l ssl -l crypto -Wl,-Bdynamic -l gthread-2.0 -l z -l dl -l pthread/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.6.1/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_systemcollect2: ld returned 1 exit statusmake: *** [i0coind] Error 1related: http://bitcointalk.org/?topic=636.0ChangeCode:-Wl,-Bstatic \toCode:-Wl,-Bdynamic \ Something like this as a mobile bitcoin atm would be awesome! Is there need for a concerted effort to manipulate or control behavior of one or more existences perhaps due to unacceptance of such activities, participations or behaviorisms by yourself or anyone else?  e.g. "be, do, think, etc. like us (read 'me') or we (each individual to various extents/degrees, eventually 'giving up' or whatever) will annoy, nag, pester you neverendingly/indefinitely?"  Is this normal?  Do you liek cake?If there is such a need, then by all means, continue propagating and repeating such efforts similarly as everyone else continues propagating their own efforts and natural phenomenon will continue as usual.hint: many people still blatantly refuse and strongly oppose, fight and resist bitcoin, decrying it as scam, etc.  Effort towards providing informations to them is similarly obnoxiously annoying and overwhelmingly useless.  If they do not understasnd or accept initially, then repeating yourself may result in establishing strong conflict and negative energy/experiences with such individuals.  Let them fail, die, make poor choices, etc.  One person's trash is another's treasure.  One person's scam is another's (opposite of scam). I'm quite surprised the original poster referenced it as IxCoin instead of the correct Ixcoin, just like Bitcoin is correct and BitCoin is incorrect.  Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuut, wtfevarz! re: creator as early adopter from get go, I just now thought of this: nasakioto generated first 6,000 blocks and then released the blockchain publicly, which at the time of release had a difficulty of 1.  How can 6,000 blocks be generated and still offer difficulty of 1?  Perhaps that means each 2016 blocks generated must be generated at 2 weeks or longer to preserve difficulty of 1.  Thus, 6,000 blocks (or 3 sets of 2016 blocks) must be generated in 6 weeks or 1.5 months.  He ended up generating 6,000 blocks in 3.5 months. Perhaps modify the hardcoded limit to 42 million and push a new version?  Scam is no longer?Also, See http://ixcoin.org/forum/The reason for mention on this forum about a bitcoin fork is the same reason many businesses, organizations and many other affiliations/associations with bitcoin (in any way) are referenced directly at the source as an extra opportunity to spread the word and propagate such information.
I propose a forum board to be created for all threads regarding Bitcoin forks.Moving such threads, including the wildly popular https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36218.0 to offtopic seems rather strange, if not kind of odd.

It was initially brought to tcatm's attention by Keefe with him stating "tcatm: would you consider removing the bad mtgox trades from the charts?"I believe the general community consensus is to encourage and help MtGox (and all other affiliated data traces including popular bitcoincharts.com) cover such mistakes/bugs from being historically public from original data sources.This is a common recurring trend that is for example heavily integrated into educational and informational (e.g. wikipedia) systems where many such educational and informational contents are manipulated or controlled/censored/restricted. I don't think the girl was concerned about sexual objectification considering her response of "What's the matter old man, never done anything wild in your life?"  It seems more likely the girl had assumed the guy was looking at her because of punk-liek fashion/appearance standing out or as being unique, and therefore attracting attention, which is what she was referring to as "doing something wild."

The teenager kept looking and would find my dad staring every time.There is not enough information to determine whether the man was staring at her because he disliked her, liked her, etc. and also no reason as to why he was staring at her, e.g. perhaps reminiscing times when he was young, wild, punk, whatever."What's the matter old man, never done anything wild in your life?"This seems to be a blatant or blunt judgmental attack in which the girl assumes he was staring at her for negative or unaccepting reasons."Got stoned once and fucked a parrot.  Just wondering if you were my daughter."Humor ftw ^_^ Fault points:The teenager kept looking and would find my dad staring every time."What's the matter old man, never done anything wild in your life?""Got stoned once and fucked a parrot.  Just wondering if you were my daughter." https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20224998-huge-bitcoin-sell-off-due-to-a-compromised-account-rollbackhttps://mtgox.com/press_release_20110630.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Kalimba+(Kalimba)http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22triple+salted+hashing%22http://hackerstream.com/?item=2718860http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/i74tp/mt_gox_sha512_multiiteration_triple_salted/ What order types do you liek other than limit and market? appended to previous postMods: Delete this obnoxious (due to size) and useless post I'm confused.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack[You] never release 0-day exploits without notifying original coder?  Seems like 0-day, by definition means you always release 0-day exploits without notifying original coder, otherwise it is not a 0-day exploit.Maybe this?

I see someone else had the same idea.  Nice! http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/105566 ._. See http://bitcoin.witcoin.com/p/1398/bitcoin-graphics Discuss I noticed yesterday that Mt Gox was no longer listed at bitcoincharts.com because mtgox.com site was no longer actively allowing exchanges in the previous 24 hours and therefore the site didn't have any data, and the volume was 0.  However, since then, tcatm had implemented a work-around specifically for mtgox to preserve its 24 hour volume data to appear as ... well, it's not real-time, so, I have no idea why the data is preserved at the site...other than maybe to help promote mtgox perhaps due to a vested interest maybe?  no idea...Anyway, Bitcoin Charts seems to be a mix of real-time and historical data, but currently only noticeable with bias towards mtgox.   I haven't monitored or noticed the data for other exchanges to determine if the data is real-time, historical or modified/manipulated in any fashion. X_X Also come chat in #bitcoin-onlyonetv on Freenode IRC network.  If you don't have an IRC client, visit http://webchat.freenode.net This is simple!!MagicalTux has a vested interest in more users using the site because of the 0.65% transaction fee for every trade.  TradeHill also I think with 0.6% transaction fee.  Thus, it is likely for them to preserve and maintain a reputable acceptance from community at any extent so as to preserve their profitability.In my opinion, this seems the basis for a kind of corruption of openness and honesty that is paramount within open source mentality/community.  e.g. proprietary (* through obscurity) vs open source.Also my opinion, I would be more comfortable with supporting (voting with my bitcoins and usage of) a more open exchange (openness in terms of quick and honest responses, to the point, blunt, etc), as opposed to one that delays and spends time on producing more nice sounding message and especially one that is not entirely accurate or believable especially with previous misleading, false, inaccurate or blatantly wrong/lying type of statements/claims.  uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhThe Bitcoin P2P protocol is NOT the web.  The Bitcoin blockchain is NOT the web.  http://blockexplorer.com/ is one site on the web.Other than that, the entire interview contains many poor informations or responses and also poorly formed questions designed to attack bitcoin.

I'm bringing this topic to attention again to continue discussing about bootstrapping methods in which many addresses are currently hardcoded into the Bitcoin client.  Are the hardcoded ip addresses permanently reliable?How about security concerns such as possibility of those ip addresses being compromised and directed to a fork of bitcoin p2p network? FTFM I am not so sure about this.  cuddlefish is 14 and doesn't sound like this.  Therefore perhaps age as a method of stereotyping may not be accurate. Here is a transcript of a most recent SMS / text messaging conversation I endured with teh mom:My thoughts on the conversation:I am uncertain what my mom's initial text message to me was in response to, however, her referencing the idea of her reminiscing of how I was when I was little as a kind of response to not experiencing desirable similarities today is a recurring communication of hers that I have endured many thousands of times.  Generally such examples of communications from her is a kind of reaction to various dramas or conflicts that ensue in which the cause of the drama or conflict is debatable.There may be similar types of recurring communications that come from me directed towards her that may be similar, and if so, I would like to better recognize and learn what they are (perhaps from my input from my mom) so that my perspective isn't targeting specifically my mom, but more so, targeting the statements that spark, cause or contribute towards dramatic conversations and/or experiences.I believe it would have been in my best interest to not respond as I did, however, I still have much foolishness and craziness within my brains.My comments on a specific experience that occurred while I was in San Francisco about two weeks ago:Amongst various dramas throughout the 'vacation' (if it can be called that, which I am not sure, since I wasn't free to enjoy my time as I wanted and instead had to enjoy my time as my mom sought fit and had planned out and throughout the various inconveniences to her plans caused quite a lot of obnoxiousness on her part even within Noisebridge environment, where others were able to notice such obnoxiousnesses as well) there was a kind of turning point that drove me quite overwhelmed and desiring of yet another escape (or vacation from a vacation).  Specifically that turning point came from a communication from my mom directed towards me suggesting the idea of never having me and I think then having more peaceful life or something.  I forgot the specific wording she used.  At that moment I was far too overwhelmed to continue simply "accepting her for who she is" and letting her do wtfever she wants justifying it with "accept me for who I am" statements.  My initial response was to walk around a couple blocks, which I did.  As I returned, my mom then went on a walk of her own still in her own rage.  I decided to continue the rest of my vacation without her continued influence, control and manipulation.  I grabbed my backpack and began walking towards her to say my goodbyes or at least give her an opportunity to recognize that I wanted to endure the rest of my vacation at my own efforts and without her influence, manipulation or control.  As I reached her and collaborated for a few minutes, her communications were still effortfully considering preserving a kind of control of things and me and that I should be more considerate and respectful to her, even through her abusive statement that triggered me to react devastatingly or depressedly.  I waited for my mom to turn and walk away before I did so.  she then turned and walked away back to her vehicle.  I then promptly turned and continued walking away in the opposite direction.  Then after less than a minute, without turning around, she had been calling after me and then chasing me.  I was walking a normal and even a bit slower pace; slower to be a bit considerate of my mom due to her poor health.  I knew she would chase after me as long as she was able to, but would eventually give up due to restlessness after 15-20 seconds.  I wasn't playing or fucking with her though.  I was simply walking away to endure the rest of my time in San Francisco without her continued influence, manipulation and control.  After walking kinda slow-pacedly for about 15-20 minutes or so, she managed to catch up with me.  I didn't stop though.  She was worn out.  She begged and pleaded with me to stop suggesting that I was causing her to be in much pain.  Apparently she was under the impression that I must rely on her to survive within San Francisco, CA and that I am unable to be responsible for myself.  Before she had made such vile statement towards me that triggered me to abandon her evilness, we were about to go eat somewhere.  So, as she caught up with me, she put forth effort into convincing me to accept her for who she is in exchange for getting food.  After liek 20-30 minutes, she manipulatingly convinced me to accept her generous offer of foods I believe in exchange for her supposed "I earned the right & I erned your" statement.  She bought foods for me (amongst a plethora of other motherly things she has 'done' for me) therefore she earned the right for me to submit to her, "accept her for she is" regardless of how evil, corrupt, manipulative, unintelligent or "crazy" she is.  To this day, I am foolish, crazy, or not disciplined enough to not be tricked into accepting her prizes, gifts or rewards (generosities) in exchange for her continued and preserved ability to influence, direct, teach, persuade, manipulate and control me, which usually stems from statements such as "I taught you better" or "I am thinking of you and remembering when you were little. I wish I could have done more to assure that you could have a happier adult life and with thoughts of me that could make you smile."  which probably means "I am thinking of you and remembering when you were little, naive and susceptible to punishment and discipline to control and manipulate you to my wildest desires and fantasies." <-- note: biasQuestion to the public (you): mom: "I realize that the facts are that you do not want to know me and you do not want to love me."This statement from my mom is one declaring a realization of facts.  It is not a statement of actual facts.  Note that this statement is one that is related to "beating around the bush" or using wordplay.  Is my mom using such a statement to indicate that one fact is that I do not want to know my mom?  As I try to decompile this statement communicated from my mom and try to establish a fundamental idea of what she meant and also derive meaning beyond a kind of programmatic meaning generally understood without critical thinking, I am uncertain how to proceed.  Disregarding the declaration of "fact" her statement is suggestive of the idea that I do not want to know my mom.There are characteristics/traits of my mom that I highly and immensely dislike and despise and I have openly and honestly communicated those things to her.  Her response to my such communications to her is generally "just accept me for who I am" and also "I realize that the facts are that you do not want to know me and you do not want to love me."What seems like a reasonable to of which if that how at is on in response or reaction to this? Hi World,I would like to use this thread as an opportunity to interact with my family in seemingly personal context in a rather open and public context so as to better learn how to handle or resolve (or not) dramatic types of experiences; in my experiences, all experiences have dramatic influence.Please be advised that this thread may contain controversial or offensive contents and is not safe for noncritical thinkers, trolls or individuals who endure sexual gratification from drama or controversy.  Also, my posts to this thread will be in a context specific to my family or experiences, which may be conceptually similar to experiences of others.l3estest l2egardedsness,Miz Usamah bin Ladin has been dead since 2001.  See http://breaking.witcoin.com/p/1476/Osama-bin-Laden-already-died-in-2001 and http://breaking.witcoin.com/p/1549/Statement-From-the-Family-of-Osama-bin-LadenNote: scientifically symbolic Earth object is much larger than usa matter and voices of creatures existing within us contamination zone as led or influenced by president and/or government control is not necessarily worldwidely recognized or accepted due to immunity of the related diseases including, but not limited to manipulative or brain dissolving gmos. -- This message brought to you courtesy of Disney.Note: Agreeing with and propogating through acceptance and agreement with story that OBL was buried in h2o on May 1st, 2011 is a method of defense allowing individuals to prevent from being kidnapped and tortured due to spreading information that conflicts with and competes with propagandas.  Save your life by keeping your head down and submitting!  Spread propaganda today!  Also, carrot > bitcoin!He already has us$3k worth of influence or incentive.  Although, Gavin's willingness to present or discuss bitcoin for x monies is negotiable.  For example, would Gavin be willing to present to CIA for us$0?  Would he be willing to present to CIA for us$1,000,000,000?  Would the difference in Gavin's presentation be affected by the amount of monies he has received?  e.g. us$0 vs us$3,000 vs us$1,000,000,000?  If so, does the amount of money provided as a kind of influence have any association or affiliation with the level of corruption or incentive to manipulate and intervene with Gavin's time and efforts through money?In any case, regardless of Gavin's singular existence participating with organized crime/corruption/terrorism, as Gavin pointed out, Bitcoin's success is not reliant on any leader that has potential of being corrupted.  Even if Gavin becomes evil and contributes to stuff liek at http://death.witcoin.com/ Bitcoin will survive and thrive, but not deprive you to stay alive with jive and arrive with vive wive to swive and stive and skively rive and then revive the live of wife, her to shrive of your strive to slively drive a hive of five that i've yet to see dive and derive a shive on a smartdrive.

Now http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/Bitcoin Although you may consider that this communicated event without any lack of evidence or proof may provide suspicion that he is not dead.  It is more likely that the effort of supposedly burying him in a way that is practically untraceable is to cover up the fact that he deaded over a decade ago.It is VERY easy to fake: http://breaking.witcoin.com/p/1476/#r-2429The fakes do not have to be realistic.  As long as you are a kind of entity that has a following, whether you lie, fabricate, make up stuff or not, the people that follow after you will tend to repeat from you, because you are their friend or are acceptant of them.I, for one, am not acceptant of my corrupted parents, family or friends.  I appreciate more individuals that are not lazy, excuseful, corrupted or have hidden or malicious agendas.Anyone here on the forum is welcome to reject and oppose these types of informations as they desire.  This type of rejection is similar to other types of oppositions/rejections (e.g. opposition/rejection of using Bitcoin).  I will not bother to respond to such oppositions or rejections as it is obnoxious, meaningless and practically troll-liek.  My parents are trolls and quite obnoxiously corrupt.  They have no value to me; not even today, Mother's day.** Yes I did just recently visit my Mom for vacation in San Francisco.  However, OMFGZ DRAMA due to corruption and craziness as well as lack of comprehension or understanding of words that I communicate and their related meanings, which are met with nonsensical scripted responses.  I don't want to become anymore crazy than I already am particularly from corrupted and compromised influencial sources, especially parents.The particular individual is unimportant other than the advertised or marketed value established of him, whether from actual provable events or entirely fabricated like fictional movies, books, sitcoms, newscasts, etc.Wrong.  Don't vote at all.  Voting for another president will be voluntarily causing further contributory efforts towards the continuation of corruption, control, enslavement, and misinformation propagation.Even if Ron Paul establishes effort to uncorrupt the plethora of corrupted government agencies, corporations, individuals, etc, it seems like he would be assassinated or murdered before having opportunity to accomplish these types of things.  It seems more likely that he (like anyone else) would be susceptible to corruption and therefore evolve into yet another terrorist (one that is not marketed or advertised predominantly as one, but that approves of or shows acceptance towards plethora amounts of terrorist activities/efforts that are instead marketed or labeled in words that help to convince others to accept and approve such activities/efforts (e.g. "department of defense" instead of "department of war").As referenced above, "to cover up the fact that he died a decade ago." Most people foolishly or naively believe that Osama Bin Laden died a week ago primarily due to plethora of corrupted media sources helping to propogate such misinformation to continue deceiptful perceptions amongst billions of people that cannot think or understand critically.Hint: http://breaking.witcoin.com/p/1476/Osama-bin-Laden-already-died-in-2001I am one person.  I do not consider myself corrupt.  Do you? I agree.  abuse is fairly simple.It will be difficult to determine whether a + or - was unjust, and especially in cases of one or more users using a greasemonkey script as linked above, it may be fairly difficult or spammalicious to moderate if too many users start noticeably abusing it, or even providing a not so noticeable form of abuse such as by modifying the script to include randomness in whether or not to + or - or skip altogether.It makes sense that for such actions, there should be some sort of cost or expense. The same reason just five days ago my mom was bursting into tears* in utter frustration and disappointment that Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! misspelled her name with a 'C' instead of an 'S' even after just twenty-nine seconds prior my mom had communicated to Amy Goodman that her name is specifically spelled with an 'S.'  Spelling and capitalization is important and serious business.* Note that my mom was already bursting into tears and in utter frustration and disappointment in me because she saw my facial expression in reaction to the amazingness of Amy Goodman's talk and she was jealous and mad at me that she hadn't established a similar reaction from me due to her not being as amazing. I think it matters."Bitcoin" is easily recognizable as an alternative to "bitcoin" and it isn't necessary to use the nonstandard or unofficial variation of "BitCoin."  What would be the reason for capital C?Perhaps for related naming schemes these would be appropriate also then?MoZilla FireFoxMicroSoft InterNet ExPlorerAdoBe PhotoShopGnuMericAbiWordAudaCityRhythmBoxKonQueror See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7413.0;topicseen It is the gross abuse of the spelling that has been established by several users who seem to have not recognized that the spelling was "Bitcoin."  I therefore established this poll to help provide better awareness of the issue.  See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7269.msg108845#msg108845 for one example. See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7413.0 What is the general consensus for case of "Bitcoin?" "BitCoin" appears as a gross abuse of the generally consensused and originally established "Bitcoin."  I secretly (forget) established a filter to correct these types of abuses used at witcoin. Ohnoes, I must permit the government to steal a percentage of money from me and possibly later to allow me to collect a percentage of the stolen monies at a later date?  What is the reason for this again? What Freenode IRC channel seems suitable to gather and collaborate/discuss in (in addition to the mailing list)?#bitcoin-livecd, #bitcoin-linux, #bitcoin-cd, #bitcoin-os, #bitcoinos, #bitcoin-distro, other? Assuming the federal reserve company still exists and us is still controlled through violence (read "presidency and governments") I believe this is fairly reasonable projection of how many us dollars will exist: us$100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00At that time it will cost about us$100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00 to order a coffee at a restaurant. Who will take initiative or lead to organize this effort? sony == evil; ddos sony == goodmtgox != evil; ddos mtgox == badHowever...Simply by admitting to affiliating with or triggering the distributed denial of service attack does not imply that the ddoser is evil.Expanding upon the simplicity of the two lines above, it appears that btcex had a partial good (or nonevil) motive, whether it is accepted or agreed upon by one or more community members or not, that may have been misunderstood by an initial "ohnoes, you're ddosing something I use... you're evil now." (hint: "ohnoes, you're ddosing playstation network that I use to play games... you're evil now.")  In the case of ddos against sony, there is a kind of established consensus amongst intelligent critical thinkers that ddosing sony is good and therefore there are many acceptant participants.  In the case of ddos against mtgox, there is not yet any kind of established consensus amongst intelligent critical thinkers that ddosing mtgox is good and therefore there is currently only such known efforts by one individual.The particular individual that ddosed mtgox is Russian, and that is an additional stereotypical negative reputation factor, however, not all Russians are evil by default.  And some supposed evilnesses of Russians are assumed and perpetuated.I'm not sure what the point of this post is, and although I will probably never use btcex (as well as most likely never use any physical currency to bitcoin exchange market because I have intention of working for bitcoins instead of working for us dollar), I am not immediately convinced that the supposed ddos attack is guaranteed negative reputation for btcex.  People make mistakes and cause drama (e.g. my mom is horrendously wrong, crazy and evil and blatantly denies it as well as responds oppositionally and retaliatorily in quite nonsensical ways), however, such efforts do not necessarily affect their reputations directly.  e.g. Just because my mom is drama queen, behaves irrationally, causes much frustration, aggravates and frustrates others, whines, complains, hissy fits, interrupts, verbally assaults, excuses herself (e.g. hypocrite), etc. does not mean that I trust her any more or less.  Actually, I just recently vacationed in San Francisco, and she was quite reliable or trustworthy in regards to being there to assist me in responsible and helpful ways.  So, just because she does something that I do not agree with (e.g. triggers a ddos or complains about the Noisebridge community) does not mean she is any more or less reputable, trustworthy, reliable, etc. It's not exactly a wiki, but allows user-generated content:  Feel free to submit sites to http://bitcoinsites.witcoin.com/ without fear of censorship from witcoin.

I would like to couchsurf with any bitcoiners if any are available and interested.  Then I can save money that would be spent towards hotel and use it to party!  Also check out the bitcoin party thread.I am visiting the area for a couple days/nights to visit with and rescue my Mom (and to return to Wisconsin with her).  However, I will not have a location for myself for shelter for my duration of stay because I have no money. =/  If anyone is interested to meet and possibly assist with such accomodations, perhaps I can spare a few bitcoins as gesture of appreciation. ^_^Additionally, by beginning of May, on the road trip back to Milwaukee, WI both my Mom and I would also appreciate possible sleeping accomodations if at all possible.  I can also spare a few bitcoins as another gesture of appreciation.  Here's a map of our route.  I am not entirely certain where on the road trip we will stop to rest, but somewhere in the middle seems likely.We will pass through and probably rest somewhere around the following locations:Salt Lake City, Utah 745m ~12hRock Springs, Wyoming 929m ~15hRawlins, Wyoming 1034m ~16.5hCasper, Wyoming 1152m ~19hMidwest, Wyoming 1192m ~19.5hGillette, Wyoming 1276m ~20.75hI will be flying back to Wisconsin on May 3rd.

I agree.  However, contemplating the idea of monetary incentive may help some people to establish potential interest in participation.  However, the profit opportunity would have to be substantial enough for all participants in order to be useful.  How to incorporate profitability in p2p social networking, I have no idea, but it's an idea that popped into my head. well, there goes my interest in asking MyBitcoin to participate in the charity system I established... yes... you need it!  come to witcoin and get it! ... wait, what?  O_X see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4298.0 anagrams?hardr consecutiveconsiderate vurchchucd reservationdouch transceivertreacherous dvincchorics adventurecrouch n advertisecourtesan verdich Not to be confused with gaia onlinemy suggestions:peerwit enterprises: peerwit.com, peerwit.net, peerwit.orgproficia ventures: proficia.net, proficia.orgbrisk bizness: briskbiz.net, briskbiz.orgspry enterprises: spryent.net, spryent.orgkeenshare: keenshare.com, keenshare.org chinese chicken? maybe you could write at witcoin? ^_^ Maybe P2P in a physical sense?  e.g. send the package to any other peer in the community, and if that peer is the final peer destined to receive the package, they can keep it, otherwise they should update a kind of status and send it out again. ^_^Suggestions: Alli, military items/instruments, information, manuals, weapons, vehicles, armor/uniforms, firearms, weapons and knives, offensive material, replicas, counterfeit items, unauthorized copies of items: handbags, mobile devices, bootlegs, sunglasses, wallets, watches, fake autographs, pirated movies, videos, music, photos, software, video games, alcohol, animals and wildlife products, art, artifacts, catalytic converters and test pipes, cell phone service contracts, contracts, used cosmetics, counterfeit currency and stamps, stamps, credit cards, electronic surveillance equipment, embargoed goods, event tickets, government documents, IDs, and licenses, hazardous materials, human parts and remains, items encouraging illegal activity, lockpicking devices, lottery tickets, mailing lists and personal information, coupons, medical devices, pesticides, plants and seeds, police related items, political memorabilia, postage meters, real estate, recalled items, slot machines, stocks & other securities, stolen property and property with removed serial numbers, tobacco Taiji is another spelling of tai chiPerhaps this playlist is similar? http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1031.msg12857#msg12857http://www.diasporaforum.org/forum/showthread.php?49-Other-Decentralized-Social-Networking-Services&p=106#post106http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/socialweb/wiki/FinalReport#Decentralised_Social_Networking_Projectshttp://gitorious.org/social/pages/ProjectComparisonhttp://libreplanet.org/wiki?title=Group:GNU_Social/Project_Comparison Also see http://meta.witcoin.com/p/348/Transactions---float-conversion-issue Have there been any progressive developments on a POS implementation?

Gah, I spoke with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now when she was in Milwaukee, WI and suggested similarly to her, "to check out bitcoin" and she responded with "okay."  However, I wonder whether or not she will "check it out."

Are you back yet? ^_^ Before you trade with bitcoins for something, whether using bitcoins or any other currency, you should probably establish an idea of whether or not you trust the individual or merchant, whether by knowing them or their reputation or some other acceptable method that seems legitimate and verifiable. http://consumerist.com/2007/04/astroglide-generously-provides-the-internet-with-a-list-of-250k-people-who-use-their-lube.html heh, I found this thread from http://forumquotes.witcoin.com/p/340/A-distasteful-but-not-dangerous-item-mailed-to-a-politicianinteresting idea!

Actually, while you may consider that the 'window' is starting to close, that is only based on the current value of Bitcoin in relation to the expenses to establish hardware dedicated to mining Bitcoin.If you consider that regardless of the expenses for mining Bitcoins, that there will still be Bitcoin miners since there are ~140 years remaining to establish all the Bitcoins.I think a better comparison is for individuals to depict the costs of mining using their own hardware and electricity compared to costs for investing in Bitcoind Pooled Mining Association.  In this case, for users that want to contribute towards mining Bitcoins, they would still have an opportunity to do using either of the two methods suggested above depending on which is lesser expensive for them.I believe it is still useful to establish a mining association that offers best performance at best value regardless of how difficult it is to generate a block or the cost to operate*.* Unless the cost to operate is comparably more expensive than users establishing their own individual hardware setups to mine. Mm, I do agree that food is an established want|need to satisfy the preserved health and continued existence of the individual asking for food.However, this may be comparable to the established want|need to satisfy the preserved and continued effort of the individual asking for burglarization.Food and burglarization are different things and in our minds and understandings we recognize these things as different and therefore apply different expectations or responses.In the case with the request for food, the food potentially fed to the daughter may be the property of the Father's.In the case with the request for burglarization, the home potentially burglarized may be the property of the Father's.btw, I do not mean to blatantly troll, as I do not necessarily agree myself with the direction of my posts, but I am curious about the ideas. Hmm, that's a good question FreeMoney.  I don't mean to agree or disagree by the following response, but I thought of the following when reading and thought I'd share.Let's say you are a Father or Mother and have a newborn child.  If you are uncertain what level of obligation is required if any at all, then it may be possible for an individual to establish birth of a newborn human species existence and due to lack of sense of obligation or desire for relation with the creature (*grin*), you simply allow it to establish itself in its new environment, providing it freedom to 'be the best it can be' without any positive, negative or neutral influence from yourselves, perhaps acceptably considered creators.  In this instance, I can understand that many human species existences will indicate that this is wrong, unacceptable or whatever, but for various species, this concept exists or occurs.  Why should humans be subject to not allowing for such opportunities?  Anyhow, humans have established sense of societally accepted obligations differing slightly or greatly throughout various [cult]ures (similarly to the differences spanning across various species).Nice wording: Instead of examining these long-winded platonic derivatives, look at what happens in practice. It is my understanding that assertion != use of force.I wonder how 'broken record' is considered: Is it assertion even if one were to repeat themselves hundreds of times?e.g. consider these two scenarios:scenario one, repeat infinitely:scenario two, repeat infinitely: I received response from Stefan Molyneux:  See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=804.0 where there was quite a bit of effort I emailed him link and summary of few comments from this thread to Stefan for him to consider.  However, since he is not bitcoin-inclined, I think it may be useful for someone bitcoin-inclined to assist him with using bitcoins since he may be too busy to establish acceptance of bitcoin on his own efforts.  However, it may be necessary for someone that is friend or family of his to introduce it to him before he shows such acceptance or willingness. This is the basic functionality for the site:There are categories.  Categories are associated with a single user (for now).  At this time I have not prepared implementation allowing users to establish their own categories and I have not worked out 'ownership' or 'rentorship' in relation to categories.  This is something I must further think about.  For now, categories are owned by a single user entity.  At the time of this posting there are three categories witticisms (http://witticisms.witcoin.com/), faq (http://faq.witcoin.com/) and bitcoind (http://bitcoind.witcoin.com/).  There will be more later.  I will explain this further in another post or elsewhere.There are posts.  Posts are contained within a single category.There are replies.  Replies are contained within a single post.There are upvotes.  Upvotes are applied to either a single post or a single reply and therefore contained within the post or reply.As a user posts content into a category, the cost of the post will be distributed equally to the site and to the category owner.  e.g. if posting costs 0.01 witcoins, which it does at the time of this forum posting, then the site will receive 0.005 witcoins and the category owner (this word is used loosely and may be changed in the future as consideration of 'rentorship' of categories is further considered) of the category will receive 0.005 witcoins.As a user replies to a post, the cost of the post will be distributed equally to the site and to the category owner.  e.g. if replying costs 0.01 witcoins, which it does at the time of this forum posting, then the site will receive 0.005 witcoins and the category owner (this word is used loosely and may be changed in the future as consideration of 'rentorship' of categories is further considered) of the category will receive 0.005 witcoins.  Note that although the reply is contained within a post that the poster is not included in the profiting from the creation of the reply.  This will be explained or understood more thoroughly later, but in the example case of a poster asking a question and a replier answering, it is strange to distribute a portion of the funds from the cost of posting the answer to the user posting the question.So, recap:posting cost is distributed equally to site and to category ownerreplying cost is distributed equally to site and to category ownerNext is upvoting: Both posts and replies can be upvoted.  The cost of upvoting is distributed as well.Upon the first upvote, the cost of upvoting is distributed equally: 33.333% to site, 33.333% to category owner, 33.333% to poster|replierUpon the second upvote, the cost of upvoting is distributed equally: 25% to site, 25% to category owner, 25% to poster|replier, 25% to first upvoterUpon the third upvote, the cost of upvoting is distributed equally: 20% to site, 20% to category owner, 20% to poster|replier, 20% to first upvoter, 20% to second upvoteretc.You may observe rather noticeably that there is no downvoting.  I haven't fully established understanding as to whether or not downvoting is necessary since if downvoting exists, there will be a cost associated with it similarly to cost of upvoting.  I haven't developed an understanding on how to distribute the cost of downvoting.  I think that if downvoting has a cost that it may discourage downvoting. One bitcoin will always equal one witcoin.  The costs in witcoins will fluctuate.  This allows for previously experienced users who have a witcoin balance to preserve their witcoins without noticing or recognizing a loss of value (because one bitcoin will always equal one witcoin).  Also it should prevent the idea of feeling panicked, discomforted or otherwise alarmed that the value in relation to bitcoins of their existing witcoin balance has changed (because one bitcoin will always equal one witcoin).Since the value of witcoin will always be at parity with bitcoin, then only the costs of each action will change in relation to supply and demand similarly to the cost of everything made available for bitcoins changes value in relation to supply and demand.o/ I encourage users to assist with this (and other) questions and answers at http://faq.witcoin.com/ so that better written answers and questions can be prepared by whomever and each author of the question and answer can profit or lose accordingly based on the submitted content (e.g. question or answer).Similarly to my explaining here, you're welcome to ask here or in the IRC channel #witcoin on FreeNode, but it may be useful to prepare the information on the site as well.  Instead of preparing the fa questions on the site myself, I look forward to users frequently asking the questions themselves and maybe also answering as well, but I too will provide answers to questions that are relative to the site that other uses may not be able to answer such as if my answers here or elsewhere are not enough information for them.My reason for allowing other users to answer instead of myself is because I recognize that I am not as skilled or talented at communicating/explaining things as others, and instead of asking others to assist me with explaining better than I can or did, and then submitting the answer as my own, I allow for individuals to answer for themselves and establish their own profitability or lossability instead of my profitability or lossability. Stefen Molyneux expressed a lack of interest in accepting Bitcoin donations in favor of PayPal donations.  If you consider it, it's quite conflicting considering his agenda. You should email that to him.  He is human and reads his emails.  He's replied to mine a couple of times.host@freedomainradio.com witcoin has been redesigned.  let me know what you think. It would be interesting to see action of a 'broken record' in the sense that for example, similar to Keene getting arrested for wearing a hat, and then later an additional friend getting arrested, it may be interesting to see after certain duration that yet another individuals pursues a kind of behavior that while recognizably acceptable to society may seem liek yet another volunteer to be enslaved and therefore also arrested.  It would be AMAZING if this continued dozens, hundreds, even thousands, maybe ten thousands and more of times all in the same incident.Eventually the currently engaged police officers would recognize the pattern and perhaps call in additional 'force.'  In that expected situation, it would be interesting/amazing for even more citizens to contribute towards this stream of activity resulting in even more arrests and enslavements.I highly doubt that the civilians in the entire locality can be arrested, but if citizens of the entire locality organized with each other to pursue such experiences, it would be very interesting to see the outcome.Or take the idea of getting arrested for recording the police.  It would be interesting if one person caught recording teh police were being arrested, and then another individual showed up who also contributed towards another recording and then was also arrested, and then yet another individual was found nearby noticeably and actively recording and then was also arrested ...... 100 more arrests ... and then YET ANOTHER individual was found to be recording and also arrested...   ........ what are we at so far?   10,000 people arrested in the same incident!  Woo profits!Other than inaction and ignorance is there reason to be 'chill?' I thought of some things while seeping.  Here's the brevity:slaveryThe policing and imprisonment system through the united states and I believe similarly well-established throughout the word is handled very similarly to slavery in that it may be a kind of evolved form of slavery, especially considering the established behaviorisms of related personnel in which they do not 'serve and protect' the public but instead 'server and protect' the continuously incoming profits from their actions of imprisoning and enslaving as many as possible or as much as they are permitted by society.  Each individual or group of individuals that experience these types of abuses in relation to their friends and family being enslaved may feel as if they cannot do anything about it even as they try almost desperately as they are only one or a few distinct individuals in support of a single or few additionally established slaves (for varying durations of time).  Recently watching videos at http://freekeene.com helped to reinforce or establish the ideas that made me to consider this concept.matrix / food / couponsThe mass produced food in which we consume may be made available to consumers in a way that is contributory towards enslavement and control of the minds of individuals that consume such foods.  e.g. you are what you eat.  Although it may not be accurate depiction for all food suppliers offering coupons, coupons for particular products may be made available to undercut prices for competitive products allowing for the particular product related to the coupon having more recognition for having the cheapest monetary price at time of sale.  This may allow for established monopolistic food entities to provide food offerings that may be detrimental or contributory to one's health perhaps in the form of GMOs designed to aid in such deteriorations or even to offer opportunity for consumers to feel a need for further reliance on medicinal remedies made available by health industry to cure or remedy common symptoms such as cold, upset stomach, flu, digestion issues, etc.  These issues seem very related to the food we eat, that if we choose healthy foods, then our bodies may recognize that they are healthy and not become weakened or damaged due to unhealthy foods, especially ones specifically designed to be unhealthy.  The matrix reference is in relation to scene of babies feeding the system. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVrCSAMnf6I Maybe http://www.ossec.net/ ? #ossec on freenode Why not post it to http://bitcoind.org/wiki or http://bitcoind.org/mediawiki ? This club could benefit from further assistance with preparing a website to outline/detail the ideas and efforts of this community.  Would anyone like to volunteer? Perhaps the payment could be handled in bitcoins. I contacted my Uncle again regarding the latest headline from EFF https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/bitcoin-step-toward-censorship-resistant and he replied suggesting:It is a bit disappointing that based on his initial statement his concern seems to be focused on 'governments.'  While I recognize that majority of people have established the idea that the world revolves around government control and without that control (from governments) then the idea may be replied to in a kind of oppositional manner, it isn't so exciting that people pursue that ideaology.  However, the initial statement merely suggests that he 'thinks the odds are not in favor.'  Perhaps even though he had communicated merely that he 'thinks' the odds are not in favor, that his actions (or inactions) based on his thoughts (or communicating such thoughts) will be representative of the very statement that 'he thought,' particularly that of not being in favor of any anonymous exchange medium.  Therefore because he 'thinks' the 'odds' are not in favor, he also will therefore not be in favor of any anonymous exchange medium.  I, on the other, have no concern what 'the odds' (what odds? or rather, if this concept has odds, then everything has odds) are and also have no concern for any similarities to that of gambling, but am enthusiastically in favor of the Bitcoin exchange medium, much more favorably than that of the us dollar exchange medium.  By the way, I had also linked to my Uncle the thirty minute cartoon entitled The American Dream which explains the us dollar, federal reserve, current system of 'exchange medium,' however I did not receive any response from him in relation to that video and am uncertain if he watched it or any portion of it and also if he does or does not agree with any or some of the content expressed within the video.Continuing past the second opening sentence of his, after his first, suggesting that the EFF is great org., "The master keys of the key technologies are always held by government entities, for many sensible reasons, chief among them is fraud and crime."Now I clearly recognize that he did not watch the video and that he also is not aware that ~100 years ago there was no government entity and therefore of any 'key technologies' that existed during such times, that there was also no 'master key.'  Other than that, due to lack of consideration or realization of such realities of history, I have no further statements.Anyone else care to respond to the insights brought on by my Uncle?Actually, I just noticed before even reading his response fully, that my Uncle had declared not to publish his comments.  It is too late, and even so, information wants to be free.  I imagine that in my posting his response (which may be similar to many other individuals and can probably be reproduced or the same ideas can be established from other publicly accessible resources).Considering my Uncle's stature in society I imagine that if there is any violation of law involved in my posting his message written to me and also based on our not so well established closeness in regards to Family or acceptance of one another as individuals that there may be 'legal' concerns established with assistance from brutal us government, law, policing, control, power, manipulation, money, greed system that is established throughout the world (as has been seen relative to Julian Assange requested to be extradited even though not us citizen) directed towards this particular forum post.
Although I initially considered Chris Angelini as being affiliated with Tom's Hardware ( http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1011.0 ) I later realized otherwiseFor the moment what he wants is an answer to the following question: ^_^http://twitter.com/chris_angelini]"I manage tomshardware.com, test hardware, and write reviews, not always in that order.

I installed ati-stream-sdk-bin-2.3Code:[1/17/11 12:32:14 AM] StartedError: Compilation from LLVMIR binary to IL text failed![1/17/11 12:32:14 AM] ERROR: Failed to build program on ATI RV770 (#1)Code:# lspci01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV770 [Radeon HD 4850]This is my first time trying DiabloMiner, so I'm uncertain how to proceed.Particularly, as Diablo-D3 pointed out, do not use the Gentoo ebuild and insteadAlso, as per Diablo-D3's suggestion, ati-stream-sdk v2.1 is faster than v2.3 and he suggested to pass switch "-w 64" to DiabloMiner Well, considering the latest video, Living Free in an Unfree World: Stefan Molyneux at Libertopia 2010, it appears more clearly recognizable and understood that our society as it is now is achieved through a kind of exploitation in which a few individuals have learned or discovered away to dominate and control the masses.  Considering the concept of software exploits and the existence of very talented hardware and software hackers both of all types (black hat, gray/grey hat, white hat, etc) which are diversified in many different areas not necessarily limited to technology, it appears fairly reasonable to consider that similar efforts or talents of "hacking" can be pursued or established to help correct or resolve our flaw or bug in which majority of humanity are enslaved to minority or whatever else the bug or flaw is or if there are multiple bugs or flaws.  I imagine that in consideration of comparing our exploitation of society to exploitation of technology may help to establish similar methods of reason or logic regarding determining how individuals can help contribute towards fixing or patching the flaws, bugs, holes in which currently black hats continue to take advantage of the unpatched holes of society.  Does this make sense? Well, based on insights from Stefan's videos particularly:"We Reap What We Sow"and"True News: 'No Place for Violence in our Political Discourse' ?!?!?"and most importantly/primarilyLiving Free in an Unfree World: Stefan Molyneux at Libertopia 2010So, with realization or the idea that the control, slavery and power over majority of humanity by a minority of humanity is reinforced by ourselves (the minority, slaves), then it should be fairly easy for white hat social engineers and other experienced, talented intelligent hackers to establish/produce and preserve a kind of exploit in which the slaves recognize the actions (from the exploit) as being the normal reinforcement of statism in their minds and will result in the exploiter participating in similar achievements, establishments of power and control as the already existing masters, powers that be, whatever.  But since they are not black hat, they do so in a way that redistributes the established achievements and power back to the slaves.  This strategy could be a kind of effort (or several efforts) in which the funding and support that would normally go to the numerous individuals that have established master status or control over majority, would then be stolen or diverted from them and over time weaken their grasp, control, power until they are no longer able to sustain themselves.This idea for exploitation opportunities is only one idea in which many exist to help overcome our current dilemma, but it seems likely to be very opportunistic considering it is very similar to yet another black hat exploiter joining the efforts of the existing exploiters (individuals of power), but instead of pursuing black hat strategy and being evil, the efforts would be white hat-style and give back to the community what the community has foolishly and naively fallen for.My question is primarily asking if this idea for exploitation seems possible or likely and if so, would I would like to expand upon what kinds of exploitation opportunities could potentially exist in which perhaps many individuals can pursue collectively to help combat the efforts pursued by those currently pwning us.Note: I was looking for the particular video (last linked) for the material that I wanted to reference, and after reviewing the first two (linked) and not finding it, I did find some material from other videos (that may be somewhat related) and referenced them before encountering the last most notable video. Perhaps you could track derivatives by using a 1x1 pixel hotlinked image and suggest to others that produce copies or derivatives to leave the image intact (for tracking purposes) and also to publish or post the derivatives in publicly accessible web-based resources (for easy web-based access)?  In regards to 'vandalism,' that depends on the attributed license.  Regarding allowing everyone to edit, use the Bitcoin wiki? Is it possible to produce exploits (not software, but perhaps related to social engineering) in which individuals around the world are led to continue their support of ideas as they normally do, but in a way in which their support is directed towards those that have exploited and instead redirect the support into other ideas (particularly those expressed clearly by Stefan Molyneux)?  For example, individuals participative in the collective "powers that be" (similar to the swarm of anonymous) can simply pose as such and establish support from and control over others, in which the support is funding not continued enslavement of humanity, but instead funding help to reduce and minimize such control and power. miku chan!!!  check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6m2NzdN7o0see http://www.youtube.com/user/17586063 's videos http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu9HUBs5mp0 is brilliant Have you heard of http://justanswer.com ?  Answerers are professionals with credentials. Based on an idea from noagendamarket (which may have been inspired from this thread, I'm uncertain), I have been working on a site that is establishing similarly to the ideas expressed in this thread. 2011.01.13 <gavinandresen> I got email from Satoshi about a tricky bug today.  He's just busy. Maybe in two to three months someone can submit a /. article regarding Satoshi Nakamoto similarly to http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=11/01/15/016241 What is there to worry about?  On one hand, I understand concept of worrying, but on the other hand, some individuals from the established community may be able to take responsibility or initiative to take where satoshi has left off.  And if satoshi were to return, any updates initiated or responsibilized by the community can be pushed back to satoshi so that he may continue where the rest of the community has left off, and if satoshi deems that all or any of the updates from the community are not the direction he had anticipated for bitcoin, he can revert them at his discretion. I moved and have reliable/stable Internet access again, thus http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin is available to those that asked about it (and to everyone else). * mizerydearia succumbs to kiba's master-liek prowess and becomes very afraid http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qID7Jsu1K0sAlthough I recognize the slave/master theme that still ensues for earthbound existences, what can be done to prevent further "happiness in slavery?"Near the end of the video Stefan suggested Sam should offer his education for free and instead accept donations.  Perhaps there could be some sort of establishments in alternative education methods/systems that allow Bitcoin donations to fund individuals that would like to educate others?  It appears ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_degrees ) that individuals can earn or establish degrees online.  I am not too familiar with such forms of education, but I believe that with the Internet as being a superior database of information (mix of misinformation and accurate information) and with swarms of individuals pushing to bring out the accurate informations more so than the misinformations, there should be some method to implement a kind of reliable education system that allows individuals to learn and establish themselves in a way that forks from the current master/slave-influenced system.  Maybe a p2p type of education system?
An unnamed friend of mine (not bitbot) replied to this thread suggesting "heh interesting... seems like a large fancy system, for basically replicating mybitcoin..." From one of my Uncles after introducing Bitcoin to them:I am not familiar with what a "closed-ended bartering mechanism" is and thefore I do not understand whether it is accurate understanding of Bitcoin or not. =/  Regardless, I am not certain I can best explain Bitcoin since the countless individuals I have discussed with or tried explaining to, I failed mizerably and haven't been able to peak anyone's interest.  Therefore I instead direct them to partially participate with the rest of the community/enthusiasts, if at all likely for them to engage in such participation. Wiao... I created a poll!It was the first poll I created without doing anything. ^_^* mizerydearia wonders why there are strings attached Excellent video!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me2wQAQCip8#t=68 Perhaps a bit of unrealized lemmingism. no, some mornings he shoots puppies for a bit of varietynice vid http://veritas.maximilianeum.ch/bitcoin/irc/logs/2010/12/01 Heh, thanks for reporting it.  It was mentioned in IRC also, and I fixed the issue.  It wasn't anything to worry about actually.  I simply forgot a final else statement near the very end of the script. I encountered Bitcoin Darts and played a total of ten times each for 0.1btc.  I came out ahead by 0.41btc.  So I decided to investigate further the odds of winning.I analyzed the PNG image and noticed a bit of antialiasing and also a bit of green bleeding into the bullseye area.  Additionally I wasn't certain how to evaluate the black pixels, whether they are to be included and if so which color to evaluate it as.  I figured perhaps the code is designed to regenerate a position if black is picked.  Additionally I wasn't certain how the code would handle antialiased pixels that do not match the exact rgb value of the majority of colors, so I recreated another image with no antialiasing that I then wrote a script and parsed the data from.Attached is the image I produced and below is a PHP script I wrote to gather and output the following data:Code:<?php $im = @imagecreatefrompng("5x2ki8jf.png");

Bitcoin Control PanelI would like to prepare this initial code offering for wide adoption.  I am uncertain if it is a best implementation, but it is functional and minimal in design.  For the moment, a PHP-based server-side backend is made available, however, I would additionally like to expand this particular project to account for other server-side scripting language environments, however, I am not certain how to accomplish this myself.Any feedback is appreciated, and especially I encourage others to help contribute and expand upon it if it seems worthy. Editing is now fixed.  Sorry about the b0rk3dness. Well, in a few more months, 13,000btc will be valued at $30,000.... I fixed the issue and the site works for Opera v10.63 build 6450 for linux.It was a "jquery rounded corners" script issue in which nonrounded corners were set to false value (to preserve the corner as square), which worked for Firefox and possibly other browsers, but wasn't compatible with Opera.  Adjusting the value to declare the corner as having 0 radius (also square) resolved the issue for Opera. I sent follow-up email to cyriak to see if he is interested in this video opportunity yet.  I still haven't received any word back from him since my original contact attempts. Please try again, as the site has been experiencing a few difficulties as there were a couple bugs during the past couple hours that I believe I have fixed.Let me know if you are still experiencing this issue and I will try to resolve them and probably succeed. Yes.  Provide me with the Bitcoin addresses you sent payment to and additionally a Bitcoin address you would like me to return your payment to and I will send it back.  PM me on forum or IRC. There is a known issue with the return funds implementation that I cannot fix at this time.  The issue is in regards to sending the Bitcoins back for those that want their Bitcoins refunded upon submitting a question or answer.  The reason this is happening is because the Bitcoin client cannot afford to send them back as it does not have any funds.Although users submit funds to the site, it is designed to work with 0 confirmations so as to prevent delay from using the site, something that I have decided was too time consuming and may detract from using the site based on its implementation (temporary come and go Bitcoin addresses instead of more permanent pre-fundable ones).  Because of this and because there aren't Bitcoins available in the client and most importantly because Bitcoin client doesn't consider amounts received with 0 transactions to be part of the available balance, the client produces an error when attempting to send Bitcoins that it doesn't have.So as to prevent potential misuse of the site in the future as well as to prevent this error from occuring frequently, I think I will be change to requiring 1 confirmation, but only for those that request their funds to be returned.  This will prevent the error of insufficient funds but also create a delay, that should be acceptable for those who want to ask and answer freely for fun rather than those who want to invest in asking for getting answers to their questions or invest in answering to try to answer someone's question (and possibly be rewarded for it by the question asker sending them a reward for answering their question), etc.Actually, depending on the amount sent, the 1 confirmation may be increased a couple or few more for better reliability of the funds being spent only once.Update: This has been resolved. Yep, thanks. ^_^Additionally I am working on a method in which Bitcoin amounts sent for creating questions and answers can be refunded upon form submission.  However, note that the value of the questions will be reduced to 0 as well and appear lesser than questions and answers that have established Bitcoin funding.

You may find alternative video sources or discussions (and even a link back to this thread).Additionally, discussions regarding this recent topic at various sites may benefit insight from out community perhaps in ways that Bitcoin-based implementations can help to create better privacy alternatives. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJDCxzKmROY One suggestion for improvement which doesn't really affect anything other than to meet the same style as other drupal modules:Use table uc_bitcoin_payment instead of uc_payment_bitcoinI'm working on a code snippet for adding the bitcoin address to the order in the "view orders" admin page.  I'll submit it here shortly.Here it is:Code:function uc_bitcoin_order_pane() {  $panes[] = array(    'id' => 'bitcoin_address',    'callback' => 'uc_bitcoin_pane_bitcoin_address',    'title' => t('Bitcoin Address'),    'desc' => t('View the order\'s Bitcoin address for receipt of payment.'),    'class' => 'pos-left',    'weight' => 4,    'show' => array('view', 'edit', 'invoice', 'customer'),  );  return $panes;}/** * Handle the "Products" order pane. */function uc_bitcoin_pane_bitcoin_address($op, $arg1) {  switch ($op) {    case 'view':    case 'customer':    case 'edit-theme':      return uc_bitcoin_bitcoin_address($arg1);  }}/** * Return a Bitcoin address from an order object. * * @param $order *   An order object. */function uc_bitcoin_bitcoin_address($order) {  if (is_array($order)) $oid = $order['order_id']['#value']; else $oid = $order->order_id;  $result = db_query("SELECT bitcoin_address FROM {uc_payment_bitcoin} WHERE order_id = %d", $oid);    $address = db_fetch_object($result);  if ($address->bitcoin_address != FALSE) {    return $address->bitcoin_address;  }  return FALSE;}Note when viewing admin/store/orders/# that an additional pane appears.  I was considering adding the data to the existing "Payment" pane as it is more suitable there.  Perhaps I will work on writing code for that next unless someone else does it first.Also I noticed when permanently deleting an order from the site the bitcoin address associated with the order is preserved.  While it may be useful to preserve the bitcoin address for a kind of reference it doesn't seem to be helpful to have as reference if there is no further data to associate it with.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to add a hook for deleting an order to also delete the associated entry in the bitcoin address table?I requested a CVS account at drupal.org and I recommend anyone else to do so as well to co-maintain the development of the module. Maybe add a price handler?  Something like:Code:function uc_bitcoin_uc_price_handler() {  return array(    'alter' => array(      'title' => t('Bitcoin price handler'),      'description' => t('Handles Bitcoin pricing alteration.'),      'callback' => 'uc_store_price_handler_alter',    ),    'format' => array(      'title' => t('Bitcoin price handler'),      'description' => t('Handles Bitcoin price formatting.'),      'callback' => 'uc_store_price_handler_format',    ),    'options' => array(      'sign' => 'BTC',      'sign_after' => TRUE,      'prec' => 2,      'dec' => '.',      'thou' => ',',      'label' => FALSE,    )  );}Perhaps you could contribute your code to http://www.ubercart.org/contrib instead of drupal site.I created #drupal-bitcoin on FreeNode IRC network if you'd like to collaborate about developments. It is convenient to have the project integrated into drupal.org website though. Yes, I haven't updated the ebuild for svn in a while and the latest patch I produced for monitoraddress no longer works.  Yesterday I decided to use gavin's release at http://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin and produced a bitcoin-git-9999.ebuild and pushed it to the git repository. I've been rather busy lately and haven't been able to maintain the live bitcoin ebuilds lately, so if anyone would like to take over they are welcome to.You may also try adding net-p2p/bitcoin-git-9999 into /etc/portage/package.keywords and see if it works for you.  It worked for me on two different architectures. This patch doesn't work anymore.  Is this still necessary or has it made it into official svn? I suggest you to establish a project page at drupal.org - See http://drupal.org/cvs-application/requirements also http://drupal.org/node/7765I am working on a drupal-based project that I will use your module for and could provide feedback on and possibly assistance with development. Is this offer still valid? ^_^ Is it so surprising?   You referenced her name in a not so exciting thread.  I doubt she will return unless you are able to associate more interesting or positive keywords around her name to reflect her and other women in better light as well as spark more interesting and productive debates.  Hint: think of the search results Sorry for edits not working. I organized files a bit and forgot to preserve file permissions.  Edits should work again. Page becomes editable when a Bitcoin amount greater than or equal to the last amount is received.I will implement this soon I think I will need a spokesperson to communicate on my behalf for the website.  Anyone interested? http://please.bitcoin.meThanks to noagendamarket for the inspiration of the idea.  All proceeds go directly to noagendamarket for funding further developments. More revisage in progress:bbl sleep, awaked, soon to sleep again Is anyone available and interested in proofreading and possibly offering helpful revisions to this letter I have prepared for sending to hundreds of restaurants in the pizza industry in regards to the website I am developing?Thanks to doublec from #bitcoin-dev for many suggested revisions to prepare the above revised draft hehe, that's cute http://pizza4btc.com/rfc - If you would like to help contribute to Pizza4BTC
Good idea.  I will implement a kind of "escrow" user role. It will function similarly to an escrow The purpose of the site is to match 3rd party buyers with those that want to order pizza and pay with bitcoins.My goal is to prepare an interactive site that allows placing pizza orders from any pizza restaurant in teh world. Hi everyone.  I'm in the process of building an exchange.  I have big plans for it, but I still have a lot of work to do.  It will be a real market where people will be able to buy and request pizzas for each other.  In the last few weeks I established a website with a basic framework.  Please bear with me as it is not usable as of yet and also I may look forward to any assistance from the community to help make the site useful by populating it with some franchise, restaurant and pizza informations.  You're welcome to come to #pizza4btc on Freenode IRC network if you would like to learn more.Note: intentionally plagiarized and inspired I finally followed up to Chris's latest response from October 13, or so I thought.I had written the above response after focusing on his first email to me.  During entire time of writing my response I was under impression that the first email was his latest response.  I later realized my mistake and wrote: don't use cafepresscheck out http://zazzle.com I suggest some of our technical experts/developers that are interested to join dns-p2p community to help establish their project, because in a sense both projects are related and can use similar underlying techniques in implementation and possibly compliment each other.efnet #dns-p2phttp://dot-p2p.org jgarzik's getblock patch has some extra information that your patch doesn't have.  Is it possible you could add them to your patch, particularly nBits?  For now I wrote some lines to patch your patch.This is line from jgarzik's patch for nBits:Code:+    obj.push_back(Pair("bits", (uint64_t)block.nBits));It would be nice for both of your patches to be merged into one. *bump* so this gets more attention/effort. Fatal error: Call to undefined function http_get_request_body()I apparently don't have the HTTP extension and am uncertain how to provide it.Workaround is: file_get_contents('php://input') I agree.  A "monitorall" command would be quite useful.This should show the data that is passed along.Code:<?php file_get_contents('php://input'); ?> Yay, another demo later today.  Come to #dragonstale if you're interested in participating. Hummm...  I was able to use one patch or the other.  When trying to use both patches, I couldn't apply the patches.  Perhaps I did something wrong.  I will try again.When applying gavin's monitor patch first and your getblock patch second, the following error occurs: http://pastebin.com/CUr1cvgSWhen applying your getblock patch first and gavin's monitor patch second, the following error occurs: http://pastebin.com/6UY4dscY Upon logging into my account I see reminders:1 users are awaiting feedback from you1 new messagesThey are plain text however.  It would be convenient if they were links that led me to pages with more information so that I wouldn't have to search through the site to find the appropriate pages.

Come to freenode #dragonstale if you would like to have textual intercourse regarding teh Saturday, October 9, 2:00PM EDT (GMT-0400), 90 minute play session I had contacted Aaron (EFF's Aaron, not Aaron name changed below) yesterday with the following message:Here is their response:* Bitcoin community member name changed since it is not identical to their forum alias.My follow-up: Response from LastPass Added to http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=repositories How is it bad?  More importantly, though, without losing focus of my original question, what else do I need to do besides update the makefile?

Wikipedia seems to have similiar controversiesAlso: commentSee brraaaiiins svn ebuild: bitcoin-9999.ebuild updated (currently revision 157)http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=611.msg14576#msg14576http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=984.msg14575#msg14575 original post edited to include link to patch. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1303.msg14562#msg14562 doesn't seem very business-like. bitcoin2cash: "You could have easily parsed the block chain yourself and found an address that has a suitable balance."Additionally, your very first post has offered a similar deal and you haven't established much of a reputation as a legitimate business as far as I see.  Also, google results for the Bitcoin address do link to a Russian site and Russians... stereotypically scammalicious, imo.There are some people that pursue an established sense of trust or naivety and "try" deals like these only to later learn their mistakes.Additionally, there are some people that pursue an established sense of distrust or awareness and proclaim illegitimacy.If you truly are legitimate entity then you will accept both negative and positive feedback and only reply on those that merit a response.  To try to squander or deter negative feedback or review (even as a noncustomer) seems rather implicative of your intentions.  A more friendly perspective would definitely help to establish a positive reputation.Consider restaurant industry for example.  Waiters and waitresses may have horrendously difficult, obnoxious, greedy, rude, etc customers, however they are still treated nicely as any other customer.e.g. I may be horrendously difficult, obnoxious, etc, buuut, I may still potentially be a customer that will help yuor business to succeed.  If you are legitimate, you will probably focus on efforts to encourage such business. news at 11? http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30.msg2452#msg2452 - July 12th: Automated system and complete website coming soon. Three months later still no soon? Your wife is kyuuute:  As doesconsidering: $0.0639 each for BTC200 ($12.78) at bcm:pp.  Total amount for BTC200 is $12.78This is a possibility.  Perhaps they are trying to shape the market with this service, however, I am certain that since it requires mailing monies, that it will not succeed as well as mtgox or bitcoin market which use Internet-based monies and do not require any snail mailing. It is unlikely bitcoin2cash will establish a positive reputation from their efforts in this manner.Cash by mail could possibly become "lost" and therefore create profit for bitcoin2cash.Only a percentage of the incoming funds need to be "lost" in order to generate profit.e.g. the first us $1.00 sent to them will supposedly trigger bitcoin2cash to send 25btc.  However, current market indicates: $0.06195 each for BTC25 ($1.54875) at mtg.  Total cost for BTC25 is $1.54875Therefore, in order for bitcoin2cash to afford sending 25btc, they will require at least $2.00 which will then produce an estimated $0.45 worth of profit.  Therefore, one of the two "$1.00" payments received will be claimed as lost.  I would claim it as lost if I were pursuing same scheme. I suggest that if you are concerned about what you say being associated with your identity than you should put forth the effort to conceal or make difficult/impossible to determine your identity and not require or expect others to do the work for you.  Besides, if you already have said something that would affect you in some way, then regardless of the public logs, other privately established logs can be used and you will have no recourse.It can be argued that a public log makes information finding easier, and yes, that's the point.  Information wants to be free.Previously I have quoted insightful commentary from others that had sparked further discussion amongst the forum community and possibly the rest of the world.  The ideas/discussions that have been initially limited to the IRC community due to lack of replication throughout other communication models could be expanded to the web to provider others to express their insights, etc as well. unu, fher, naq gura fbzrbar nccyl n fpevcg (ternfrzbaxrl?) gb ebg13 ntnva ^_^ I am uncertain what is necessary to protect against as I am still new to SELinux.  However, if there is a kind of extra layer of protection that can be established, I would like to learn more about it and possibly help to establish it. I will be moving over next few days and nullvoid.org and bitbot may be unavailable during this period.  I will try to prepare availability as much as possible. This is good idea.  I suggest, however, writing plugins for existing Bittorrent clients rather than writing a new client or forking an existing client. I just noticed http://stuff.caurea.org/irssi/freenode/%23bitcoin-dev/2010/ or (c) public anonymous logging with Tor and nothing can stop it, so tough ^_^Of course, if anyone does establish such a service on Tor I will probably be first to blame.  I don't mind. Like many open source developers who maintain their projects even ones as small as individual Drupal modules or similar, it appears that perhaps the open source version of their Bitcoin client will be unmaintained.  Someone can pick up the slack, however, and if necessary create a fork.Just as there was little effort previously, there is little effort now.  It is up to the community's open source developers to pick up the slack, and if none of us are capable or willing, then other noncommunity members shall appear and join the community and perhaps they can contribute.  Maybe even promoting or requesting assistance with this from the worldwide open source commuinity may be helpful? It is fairly simple to have raw uncut logs and to present them with a script that handles censoring nicknames as desired.  However, additionally, anyone else can anonymously host uncensored logs using tor and never reveal their identity.  However, for a community-based effort as a kind of service simply to prepare previous discussions to be available, it should be fairly acceptable to censor a nickname, or possibly even to by default randomize all nicknames for the sake of anonymity for everyone.
Apparently it is considering at http://pastebin.com/10k74rSd (which is a summary of Bitcoin client hosts in #bitcoin on LFNet as of about 15 minutes ago) lines 432-529 are all GAE.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1068.msg13665#msg13665 Since it is possible to detect majority of all nodes in the p2p network by visiting the bootstrapping irc channel, it seems fairly easy to determine where exactly all the nodes are in case any attempt to disconnect Internet, seize hardwares or some other action ever occurs.  Is this something to be concerned of?For example, I can determine all the IP addresses of p2p nodes availableCode:/who #bitcoin and then proceed from there. Mm...  On a slightly unrelated issue.  Since it is possible to detect majority of all nodes in the p2p network by visiting the bootstrapping irc channel, it seems fairly easy to determine where exactly all the nodes are in case any attempt to disconnect Internet or seize hardwares ever occurs.  Perhaps another thread should be used to discuss this. For IRC I set my user name to 8332 and my real name to 8333 as per server connection configuration and then connected.Code:/whois necrodearia[necrodearia] (8332@address.net): 8333* [necrodearia] #bitcoin-dev #bitcoin* [necrodearia] peacock.heliacal.net :Chicago, IL USA* [necrodearia] idle 00:00:09, signon: Tue Sep 21 07:46:38* [necrodearia] End of WHOIS list.Using this method, it is possible to embed port numbers that a client is using into their IRC connection so that ports are not restricted to 8332 and 8333.  I suggest implementing this or a related implementation into a future version of Bitcoin.Satoshi o/ Well, it depends on what you mean by project.  If you are referring to a project for creating the animation that is supported by the bounty contributions from this thread, then I have no idea.  I am not aware of any active projects as of yet.  If you mean project as in this thread as being a project to offer bounty, incentive for an animation to be produced/designed, then unless everyone that offered to contribute retracts their offer, I imagine that it will continue.Patience is a virtue. ^_^   There is no need for rush.  In fact, the longer that it takes for an animation to be produced, the more potential for the value of the bounty to increase and to possibly create even more incentive. Of course, however, the community must* attract cg artists in order for this idea to take off and for quality Bitcoin-related animations to be common or exist.* If you participate in art/cg/design communities, mention Bitcoin if it seems convenient to do so.  It would be amazing for artists to create or participate in a kind of community that offers compensation in Bitcoins for designed works.Slightly unrelated: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=909.msg10901#msg10901 As long as Bitcoin community doesn't contain 10,000+ developers, trac seems suitable.Trac can communicate directly with the SVN repository and track live changesets that are linked to ticket IDs.http://retrospectiva.org/ looks interesting and it is based on ror, therefore it is obviously a serious bug tracker for adults 'this' as in the pay it forward project or as in bitcoin?I suppose to give up on 'bitcoin' would be similar to giving up on other types of currencies as well, and in such cases giving them away or destroying them.Or perhaps it's similar to giving up or quitting smoking, in which bitcoin in some way is detrimental to one's health and is necessary to prevent further association with or consumption of.I suppose in the sense that a new currency is existent and is currently limited in use cases compared to already established currencies, many individuals who put little to no effort into developing, contributing or helping to establish its use or future potential may pursue a kind of 'giving up' on Bitcoin since it doesn't meet a kind of expectation of currency as recognized by general society and ease of use of existing dominating currencies.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_currencies is a list of currencies, many in which you may notice several similarities to Bitcoin (e.g. difficult or time consuming to obtain) that could also actively be 'given up' on.  However, it is likely that those types of currencies do not garnish any interest or attention and therefore unlikely to be considered as necessary to give up.  However, additionally, it may be a currency that one has previously had none of and therefore is not in a position to 'give up' on considering lack of use.Humm, I'm not sure what my point is.  I think I'm rambling.  I give up.  ^_^lawl nelisky | |\|/  That may be difficult to implement across variety of operating systems, especially if Bitcoin client were to be implemented on portable devices.

Maybe when gavin's mime type implementation is useable, someone could write an SMF plugin and then this forum should be the first SMF forum to use it. If it is possible to see individual or total of transactions sent to a specified bitcoin address, I suggest someone to write a patch to make this available in API 2 weeks2,419,200 secondsSame amount of time as expected time to generate 2,016 blocks
I agree with using something like trac or mantisbt.  I suggest we try one of those two and if it helps improve things, then continue using it.  Otherwise it it doesn't seem to work, we still have the forum and nothing is lost.Also, since `bitcoind ""` is not a bug, then for my gentoo linux ebuild init script to exec as that (dependent on /etc/conf.d/bitcoin containing BITCOIN_OPTS="") is the bug and I will fix that.Fixed! I do not believe so.  I rarely see Xunie around anymore, and I have never seen satoshi.  What kind of meetings would be useful? http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=133.msg12921#msg12921 Definitely add a switch!  I'll add to my gentoo ebuild when there is a switch. How about now?  Anything? I sent sourceforge-based message to Satoshi suggesting enabling MantisBT or Trac.  Perhaps he will notice it.

Be advised that this isn't implemented yet, but is in consideration.Attempting to bid or ask for an amount:2000@0.05055001 will result in a bid/ask placed for 2000@0.0506 <-- bitcoinmail!2000 * $0.05055001 == $101.100022000 * $0.05060000 == $101.20000$0.10 difference for 2,000 bitcoins isn't so noticeable, but, exchange 2,000 bitcoins back and forth for example 1,000 times if you are a trader1000 * $0.10 == $100Maybe 5 decimal places?  And then when you switch to 5 places, we can argue for 6 places, and then 7, 8, ... OVER 9,000? O_OOn a separate note This wiki page was just for reference.  I suggest creating a "History of Bitcoin" specific wiki page for documenting the history. This patch doesn't seem to be compatible with this patch.  Can these patches be combined or is one better than the other?
This doesn't seem to be compatible with Slight change so that JSON-RPC binds to all/any IPs instead of just the loopback..  Can these patches be combined or is one better than the other? Is anyone willing to start and establish a "History of Bitcoin" wiki page?  It would be interesting to document notable events as they happened.The content at http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=incidents could be integrated into a fully documented history of Bitcoin-related events. From here discuss SSL certificates from various authorities.  Do it! NAO!you failWhenIsaSelfSignedSSLCertificateAcceptable?SecurityCertificateWarningsDon'tWork22MillionSSLCertificatesInUseAreInvalidWhatWouldItTakeToHaveOpenCAAuthorities? So as to not hijack this thread,  discuss hereBetter as in?So as to not hijack this thread,  discuss here I am learning SELinux and would like to establish a policy for Bitcoin.  Does anyone have any experience with SELinux and has established any related efforts?At the moment I haven't established any results.  I have no idea where to begin.  I do not understand c++ code. If you place a Bid for 1,000btc @ $0.175 each and also have $0.00 balance in your mtgox.com account, then there will be an inactive bid for 1,000btc.If you had or place an ask for xbtc @ $y and a trade occurs involving the asked amount, then you will have $ balance in your mtgox.com account which will then activate your previously inactive bid, or at least part of the bid will become active and the remaining amount that cannot be accounted for, due to lack of enough funds, will remain inactive.Additionally, it appears this may also show signs of some sort of bug.e.g. if lowest ask is xbtc @ $0.07 and an  ask for 10btc @ $1.00 become active or is placed, will the bid match the lowest ask and result in a trade for 10btc @ $0.07 each for total cost of $0.70?  Or will the trade result in 10btc @ $1.00 each for total cost of $10.00?  Based on what happened, it appears that if you were to, right now, bid for 10btc @ $10.00 each, that you would buy 10btc for a total cost of $100.00.  I am not willing to test this theory to confirm, however. ^_^ <mtgox> The really high trades are because the someone had an order that was inactive for those prices. He didn't have $ so it wasn't an issue until someone bought some of his BTC. And then his orders were filled at that high price. I should probably change it so an order that goes from inactive to active is treated as a new order. How about 20 Radeon 5970s and OpenCL client? 40?~$700 * 20 == $14,000Maybe $400 for rest of computer parts * 20 = $8,000Only $22,000 + cost of electricity + closed OpenCL client to completely pwn the network.ArtForz?  Do it!!!  Hurry, before an open source client becomes available!Although, it is unlikely he would do it because it would probably cause the value of Bitcoin to fall to $0.00000001.Instead he is pursuing most profitable method while preserving value of Bitcoins. ^_^ zeldabmovimucentricopenlink data spacessocialrivermozilla's drumbeatdiso projectappleseedhiggin's projectgnusocialsmobonesocialwebstatus.netmorealso... Ah, I missed 34.  I understand now. I am sure satoshi and sirius-m as well as all the other open source contributors to this project as well as a plethora of other open source projects have spent a considerable amount of time offering their developments at no cost.Watch this vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJcAdditionally, an acceptance of 10,000btc to open source seems indicative that the proprietary version isn't generating enough profits as intended or desired and perhaps open sourcing it will feel as if effort to create proprietary implementation and convert to open source was worth the time.In regards to donating or providing a contribution to one's efforts, I would rather show generosity towards someone who doesn't ask for it, then one who asks.  In a sense, asking for things for one's accomplishments has a negative perception/connotation. Do you have the impression that one or more individuals within our community that may indicate, suggest or to have admitted to use a proprietary closed source Bitcoin-related application is indicative that "we encourage closed-source implementations?"  Who is "we?"  Is "we" a kind of central authoritative figure?  I think there will be individuals that pursue their own decisions, choices that may conflict with others, however, it should not be considered that if one or more individuals share the same or similar decision or choice, even if such decision or choice is majority, that "we" as a community are representative of that choice.I think there may be confusion being generated about this topic.  Perhaps a poll can help to provide a better understanding as to how others feel about using proprietary clients.  However, again..That is a good point that should be reiterated for these types of discussions.For example, if Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Apple, etc. were to show acceptance of Bitcoin but release a proprietary version that is integrated within their product (e.g. proprietary implementation integrated into ps3/ps4, just like all the other proprietariness within), there is no point in arguing against Sony's actions.  Arguing about it is pointless.  In the case of Sony designing their own proprietary implementation integrated into their hardware, there most likely will also be an initiative to hack the system and to provide an open source implementation anyway, and for those that are geek enough, they will probably use the open source version instead.  For those that just want things to work (majority, mostly computer-illiterate and prefer to consume time pursuing other activities anyway), then they will use proprietary version.In the case of Bitcoin, the open source version is currently the dominant version.  It is the most recognized or the first noticed.  As far as I can tell, proprietary versions of Bitcoin haven't been advertised to the masses more so than the official open source Bitcoin client, so although there is discussion about the particular version, it isn't taking over or becoming more popular than open source version.It is probably most productive and best for the community overall for those advocating open source and against proprietary to learn how to program (if not already familiar), rather than arguing for it whilst expecting everyone else to develop/program open source alternative.  While it can be argued that one is not a developer or doesn't have necessary skill, perhaps that is just a sign of laziness or unwillingness to stand up for one's beliefs.  It would be more reputable, admirable if one were to pursue their argument by contributing towards development to support their argument.On a side note, Macho, is that you in my profile picture?  *chuckle* 1RayJSScakAmpRtQRbqyN5xfchKnqQNb9 is mine.  Feel free to send 0.01btc and I'll send it back? That is a good point that should be reiterated for these types of discussions.

Binaries compiled from open source code can potentially be confirmed by the community that the binaries are indeed related to a particular svn snapshot of source code.  I am not sure how, but I am sure this is possible to confirm.Binaries compiled from closed source code can not be confirmed by the community that the binaries are indeed related to a particular svn snapshot of source code without modification, because the code has obviously been modified and there is no way to know what the modified code looks like. If I were puddinpop, I would release versions of my proprietary client that seem legitimate at first and really are, but gradually implement code to kind of taste what users are doing with my client and also of course monitor how much income I am receiving.  If I notice that I am receiving more and more income, at a point where there are hundreds, thousands even millions of users who have established trust into my product because it is so helpful to others to generate bitcoins, on my next update I would then proceed in secretly changing the 5% sent to me to 100% as well as add code to send to me ALL bitcoins left in each user's wallet and then suffer having a bad reputation at the expense of others as is furiously posted to the forums and users gradually discover my evil intent, but I will have already exchanged the BTC for another currency.  As far as I know, there is no illegality for doing this, because I haven't established any terms of service for my product.  Instead I simply released it on a forum without any related informations or anything. Hummm, well, I didn't have any luck finding how to determine what constitutes as an address examining the c++ code, but here's a PHP function that should work as expected:Code:<? function is_bitcoin_address($address) { return preg_match("/1[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32,33}/", $address); } if (is_bitcoin_address("17NdbrSGoUotzeGCcMMCqnFkEvLymoou9j")) echo "yes"; else echo "no";?>Ah yes, thanks for clarifying theymos.  I updated my code.  I confirmed and of all of my addresses they contain at least one of all alphanumberic characters except 0, I, O and l. Or how about a version for BeOS?  It's not dead yet! Syke: While I understand some of the community may not appreciate the manners in which a seemingly friendly community member has established their proprietary product, consider businesses that offer products or services for profit.  Now consider that one of those businesses or entrepreneurial individuals has established a kind of closeness within the community.  Instead of focusing negatively on their activities, they should instead be appreciated that they are nice enough to participate amongst the community directly.  From my observations, puddinpop is providing a valuable service and is handling the negative reviews/feedback as an accepted or nonevil organization/business would.While I particularly advocate and look forward to an open source implementation, it isn't necessary to aggress on those that conform to such expectancies.  To do so establishes bad reputation for the consumer.  Consumers can be evil too. ^_^In regards to your comment, an MIT license allows the code to be open source and for anyone and everyone to use and implement bitcoin into anything and everything, whether it is released as open source or established into a viable for-profit product.  To aid in the acceptance of Bitcoin for already-established businesses, MIT is a convenient license that will allow a business to consider Bitcoin.  If the license were GPL, then it would hinder growth/acceptance of Bitcoin throughout well-established businesses.The particular friendly community member that is offering a product that generates profits is not a well-established business and perhaps the product isn't a kind of product you would expect to pay for, but it is a product nonetheless, and therefore, you must consider evaluating it as such and handle responding, considering and associating with the individual as you would any other business.  Blah blah blah, I'm sure you get my point.  What if you were to rely on the special spoon for so many years and then you realized that you couldn't live without that special spoon and are locked in?  e.g. similar to ms windows vendor lock-in kinda http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=909.0 I updated the initial post with follow-up from Chris.Perhaps I shouldn't have emphasized small at the end of my reply.  Boooo me.  Buuuuut, yay for honesty!

Bitcoin on VPS - Perhaps there will be a type of VPS service established that offers Bitcoin hosting.  Perhaps potential Tom's Hardware Bitcoin benchmarks can help to provide which hardware is best value and to rely on that information for establishing a VPS hosting business specifically for Bitcoin.There are many profit-oriented individuals that come to the IRC channel discussing excitement towards generating but sometimes are disappointed that their limited khash/sec will require weeks or even months to generate a block.  Some of these individuals may be turned on to VPS hosting to turn a profit.A slightly more open approach to bitcoin on the GPU I submitted an initial email to Tom's Hardware with only the following:Chris Angelini responded:My follow up:note: I was too excited to write back to Tom's Hardware asap and didn't bother to revise or correct grammar/spelling mistakes.  However, in follow up above, I have corrected some grammatical/spelling mistakes.Follow-up from Chris:My response: *grin*    I was kidding.  Sorry to hijack your thread.

You're right.  :3  *hides* What is the solution? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropia_UniverseUSD-backed mmmorpg  Nope.  That's wrong.  Try this --> 1JfP83VXvByLL512KF6H2f67JEMF2F966E*evil grin* Perhaps it can be considered that based on the license as it is now that establishments as exemplified above could allow for individuals to dominate large percentages of total Bitcoins and nothing can stop them.  Could this could be a deterrent for the acceptance of Bitcoin and hinder its ability to succeed?  e.g. I haven't the programming/development skills to produce similar works and therefore establish equal or similar amount of block generations and therefore have a disadvantage  to others with proprietary implementations.While it may be considered to allow for proprietary implementations to establish wider acceptance, it also may be a hinderance to establishing wider acceptance for allowing proprietary implementations. I am not sure how it would affect current/existing clients, but I believe switching to gpl would possibly stifle ArtForz's estimated ~25% dominance of block generations and total Bitcoin balance.Total Bitcoins as of now: 3914550If ArtForz had 25% of total Bitcoins, then: 978637.5If each Bitcoin is worth $0.06, then total value: $58,718.25These figures are not reliable, but are an example.Here's a better reference:7.28.2010: <ArtForz> for my opencl sha256 code the 5770 is only 5% faster than the 4870 per core-mhzblock 70800 1280322359Code:# date -d "@1280322359"Wed Jul 28 08:05:59 CDT 2010So estimated start time of ArtForz's opencl client was at block 70,800.  Current block count is 78,292.  7,492 blocks.7,492 * 50btc = 374,600btc.374,600btc * 25% = 93,650btc93,650btc * $0.06 = $5,619.So, it is fairly safe to conclude that ArtForz has approximately ~$5,600ish value (and will most likely increase in value over time)If they were to sell all bitcoins right now on open exchange markets,

$2348.64719856 Although I don't use windows, I'll donate some bitcoins to puddinpop if they release the client source code as open source.  Otherwise I'll donate some bitcoins to the first person to release a hacked/modified version of the client that disables the 10% autopayment on block generation, whichever comes first.puddinpop would ultimately establish far more profits if the client remains closed, at least until using the client is no longer beneficial as the difficulty will have increased far too much for it to be as beneficial as it was compared to noncuda clients.  However, reverting back to a noncuda client would be worse than continuing to use the cuda client and therefore unless an alternative is established, puddinpop will continue to receive plenty of profits from usage of the client.  While it will be nice to donate a nice amount to puddinpop for their efforts, I personally feel 10% for all block generations from everyone is too much, and I would like to encourage open source or otherwise rewarding those that defeat the proprietary profiting addition.Keep in mind while khash/sec is increased providing higher chance to generate a block, more electricity is used to do so.  I don't believe puddinpop is willing to pay 10% of electricity bill or cost of extra electricities used from usage of this software.Also, Satoshi and sirius-m Have put forth a lot of hard work into the open source Bitcoin client and do not force donations.  I would like to donate to Satoshi for his efforts. ^_^ You should specify which ebuild is yours so that others know.  Currently there are two ebuild versions in the repository.Ah, I didn't check git repository cdecker's logs: http://veritas.maximilianeum.ch/bitcoin/irc/logs/cdecker (and also myself) would like to offer web-based linking and displaying of chat discussions and one liners from the Bitcoin IRC channel.I have chat history as far back as about mid-July but there are some gaps (from disconnections/etc) that I'd like for others to help combine to create a most complete data set for preparing the history.  Any help is appreciated.I will update this post with more informations momentarily.If anyone can publish or link to chat logs that they have, I can help to prepare them into a master log data set for use in this project. I've donated to others as well, especially nanotube who has helped me a lot with bitbot!  The amount in the image is not indicative of how much I have, but rather total amount of donations overall.  Also, I would like to preserve some balance for future usage/expenditures/donations.  However, beyond scope of my Bitcoin balance, I am still unemployed and have no money remaining for any purpose (including foods) and am still lazy other than dedicating most of my time/effort towards Bitcoin-related projects. I would like to request for a patch to be developed that treats sending bitcoins to an address that matches one on the same computer like sending to  any other address.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=241.msg9333#msg9333 I would like to request for a patch to be developed that allows a bitcoin client to have configurable ports (currently 8332 and 8333) using configuration file to determine which ports to use.  So as to incentivize development for this patch I would like to offer 5btc (I am poor) and if anyone else would like to additionally contribute so as to offer more incentive, feel free to reply.     5btc (miz)+ 200btc (aceat64)--------  205btcjgarzik's patch I too will offer a service of proving that you have read assigned material (e.g. book) even in cases where you have not read it.

Would anyone like to start contributing/preparing some Halloween-themed Bitcoin graphics, animations, media, sprites and other content for possible use next month?  If so, this thread should help establish some interest. http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/53/noyes.htmlIs that his expert advice?  O_O  What a pity...  Perhaps we should presume that his advice truly is "expert" and cease Bitcoin establishments and focus on uhm, "mutual credit clearing."Although, he is ~74 years old.  Perhaps he can elaborate on his perspective just a tad more.  Maybe he will blog about it?  Maybe we, as inidividuals comprising part of the community need to actively discuss more with him?  Perhaps someone can help us to establish a kind of interview or irc-based discussion panel or something?  That would be AWESOME!  If that would be a  possibility, perhaps we could gather up some topics for discussion and that may help to establish a better perspective as to how Bitcoin could be useful and THEN he may blog about it and perhaps it could help awareness?http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/328601/the_end_of_money_and_the_future_of_civilization.htmlIf he proposes one solution as a web-based trading system and Bitcoin offers opportunity to establish a web based trading system (e.g. Mt. Gox, Bidding Pond) and there is plenty opportunity for anyone else to contribute even more web-based resources for exchanging/trading systems, then why does he also respond with "I may be missing something, but I see no real need for it?"  He must clearly be missing something if he responds with such contrasting views.

In case anybody ever experiences an issue similar to mine:I returned to my computer noticing there were network issues.  I resolved them and in doing so I `/etc/init.d/net.eth0 restart`ed which stopped and restarted my ethernet connection to the Internet.  Bitcoin client was running before and after this time.  Shortly after restarting the connection, I sent Bitcoins to an address.  I noticed after more than two minutes that the transaction showed as 0/offline?  I also noticed that I had only one connection as listed on the status bar.  I presumed it was due to my previous network issues and perhaps especially after specifically stopping and restarting the ethernet device.  I promptly stopped and restarted Bitcoin client.The transaction then appeared as 0/unconfirmed.  After two confirmations for all my other transactions I noticed that the latest transaction still showed 0/unconfirmed.  I worried a bit, contemplating that perhaps I had lost the Bitcoins.Then a while later (less than an hour) the transaction now shows as 3/unconfirmed.  Teh transaction was eventually resent. My intended focus is more on informing charities and organizations of the existence of Bitcoin and how they can benefit from it rather than focusing on suggesting to the charity that our community would like to donate.I took out the "appreciates your efforts to provide clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations" part as it is irrelevant to indicate that our community is appreciative since the focus differs from the Letter to EFF. I couldn't find the reference in the FAQ that you were referring to:faqmore faqHowever, it has been discussed before.transaction fee Bitcoin can majorly pwn Western Union.  In regards to "charity" idea, I established a thread to help establish how we can best communicate or write to charities and organizations.I agree.  Bitcoin to revolutionize how charities receive donations seems promising.I think there is a need for a web-based interface to work with the daemon.  There are some efforts.  I'm working on a php-based templating implementation.  I will release it in a day or two.

Perhaps those that are contributing towards the development of an animated movie should be specific of their expectations.  For example, anyone can put forth their own effort to produce an animated film of Bitcoin, but will it be worthy of all or any of the bitcoin donations offered to produce a short anim?  Clarification on expectations are necessary. late grammar nazi:Code:before: Many have expressed their desire to donate to your foundation, with 800 Bitcoins pledged to date.after:  Many have expressed their desire to donate to your foundation with 800 Bitcoins pledged to date. <offtopic value="slightly">I would rather die without any nonfree medical treatment than to pay for my health.

Perhaps instead you should  raise some real pigs and sell them for Bitcoins.  Real meat ftw! trying to make profit off of games that are already free?  O_O I sense this thread will become obnoxious... I second that.  Perhaps edit your first post with examples of your work. hmm? For reference purpose, Gentoo has the following work-around for specific wxWidgets versions:Code:$ eselect wxwidgets listAvailable wxWidgets profiles:  [1]   gtk2-ansi-release-2.6  [2]   gtk2-unicode-2.9 *  [3]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.6  [4]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.8$ /usr/bin/wx-config --version2.9.1# eselect wxwidgets set 1Setting wxWidgets profile to gtk2-ansi-release-2.6$ /usr/bin/wx-config --version2.6.4I'm not sure about other distros though.http://www.pathname.com/fhs/Gentoo Linux is designed so that all (99.99%) packages are compiled from source, so yes, I compiled wxGTK using an ebuild from Portage, the Gentoo Linux package management software.I don't understand this.  Which header?I don't see where I misspelled bitcoin.  Which file?I am uncertain what "optimizations" are.I am not familiar with which parts of code are static and could be converted to dynamic.  I only prepared an ebuild because it seems nobody else has.  I am not skilled enough to perfect the ebuild, however, if anyone else would like to contribute towards making it better, I set up a git repository: http://github.com/mizerydearia/bitcoin_gentoo_ebuild See http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=930.0 for Gentoo ebuild
bitcoin ebuilds for gentoo linux2011.03.02: bitcoin-git-9999 ebuild updated outdatedCome to #bitcoin-gentoo on Freenode for latest I glanced at http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=list_of_patches and haven't noticed any updates for this.  Is listtransactions established or useful/functional yet?  Is there a binary release (official or unofficial) that integrates this patch that I could use?  I would like to use the data extracted from using the listtransactions method to implement into my website if it is reliable to do so.Specifically in a current use scenario I would like to be able to determine the last transaction that occurred for a particular address label and to extract related data such as amount and date/time. I would imagine that the tea industry wouldn't have any particular interest in tobacco parties either...unless there happened to be tea-flavored cigs/cloves or tobacco-flavored tea.   Then I imagine there would be quite a party. This should be easy to implement!http://hackaday.com/2009/01/02/twittering-washing-machine/Soon instead ofthere will beHowever, additionally, Bitcoin could also integrate with twitter in the sense that once a Bitcoin transaction occurs/is confirmed, then a tweet could be produced to trigger the washer/dryer unitsTrue.Additionally, it would be better to modify existing devices to provide this type of functionality than to buy devices that are designed to provide the integration, primarily for cost and also due to not all styles/colors/etc will be available as would be if you modified your existing devices.Perhaps there could be an organization to establish that provides this type of service of modifying devices to integrate with Bitcoin?In regards to laundrymats, this organization/business idea could potentially be very successful if it were to revolutionize the laundrymat industry.  From my roommate: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=873.msg10728#msg10728 is somewhat related What kind of attacks or risks does that involve for Bitcoin users?Should there be concern that many homes will be raided by swat teams?Perhaps in such cases it is good to have an offsite backup of wallet files so that current income aren't lost and can be transferred to other addresses in the case of hardware being stolen/seized? I agree, however, if you compile from source, a single change fromrpc.cppCode:!mapArgs.count("-disablesafemode")toCode:mapArgs.count("-safemode")will thenCode:// Observe lockdownthrow runtime_error(strWarning);You can examine the code at http://bitcoin.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bitcoin/trunk/rpc.cpp?revision=142&view=markup to see what is happening.It seems a bit strange to only show an error when -enablesafety is used.  Perhaps it is unsafe or insecure for this to happen?http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=apiFrom my understanding of the code it appears that when using one of these http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=api methods other than getinfo, help, stop, getgenerate, setgenerate and most importantly when there is a warning, that:if -disablesafemode was passed to the running process, then the warning will not be displayedif -disablesafemode was not passed to the running process, then the warning will be displayedhttp://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/stdexcept/runtime_error/ http://lipsum.com skull88: Your image links are broken.I write here to suggest perhaps you may be interested to help in establishnig some professional looking symbolism/imagery to potentially be used for http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=804.msg11112#msg11112On a side note, very nice site at http://bitcoin.nl !

Reverse engineering will occur and regardless of satoshi's desire to have dominant control over the one and only [multiplatform] client, this will seemingly and ultimately ruin some things.  I am not sure of the legality, but I do know that if there a kind of legality enforced, I would lose all interest in mainstream Bitcoin client and would expect a fork, if at all possible.However, if things were to be more open and documentation were made available, that would truly help to establish the Bitcoin community much more exponentially and bring incentive for others to create clients for other architectures or environments, such as embedded devices, mobile/portable devices and everywhere and when that happens, Bitcoin client everywhere will be very helpful to increase adoption.Right now, as it shows very well, there is very limited developer effort put into development of Bitcoin.  This is gradually increasing and there are very skilled/talented developers that are contributing a LOT and amazing code, but, more is better.  More eyes to examine the code, but more importantly, more eyes to understand how things work, e.g. documentation, is much more helpful than reverse engineering an understanding of how things work by looking at code. Bitcoin 0.3.10 for 64-bit linux : reproducable alwaysWhen I close Bitcoin (e.g. file -> exit in gui) the following appears.  How come?Code:************************UNKNOWN EXCEPTION       bitcoin in CMyApp::OnUnhandledException()Perhaps this would be useful to file as a bug report instead of a forum post?  Do we have a bug tracker yet? Thanks for the reference!  I wasn't aware of that.However it appears there is a need to reinvent the wheel due to control over the underlying software/system as well as required reciprocal gifting.I am familiar/semi-skilled with Drupal and can implement an equivalent and offer using open source, however, I am also not sure that using Drupal is best environment to implement for.Additionally, to use Community Forge in a kind of Bitcoin established LETS system that is to be used by local communities as their own system, seems like it could establish into a lot of work unnecessary or potentially costly work for Community Forge.  This is so because the Community Forge system is a service offered instead of a product (software) offered to let the community handle the service for themselves.Perhaps a third competitor, but primarily based on implementing functionality with Bitcoin, and one that is released/distributed as open source would be worthy?  If anyone is interested in establishing this idea, perhaps I can help to create/establish a community to develop this under.  Any ideas for a name?-I just noticed http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Exchange_Trading_Systems and I see that there are more than two competitors, and Cyclos is one too. bugs: satoshi, I am not certain of best methods for disclosing details of bugs, exploits, however, it seems that there may not be a recognizable way in doing so?  Maybe email is not suitable for such things?  In any case, perhaps pming anonymous (or for them to pm you) would be helpful to resolve the bug asap.  It seems serious and there has been a publicly disclosed crash output that can potentially be used by malicious others to reverse engineer and reproduce the method to crash and cause serious havoc on other Bitcoin users.domination: I am running `nice -n 19 ./bitcoin -server -4way` on linux system.  For a while I hadn't observed any system performance issues, but since sometime yesterday it has been very noticeable and slowing my system to a crawl.  I am not sure how to diagnosse the issue other than that closing Bitcoin client resolves the system instability.locking: Is there an implementation to lock the associated database file when an instance of Bitcoin is running? Automatic update for linux is far more difficult than for windows considering in windows installation of software across different versions of windows is fairly similar and has practically same hierarchy of file structure.  This is not the case across different distributions of linux.However, automatic update is not recommended.  An alert indicator to notify the user to take action is best.  Perhaps the bitcoind version can be configured to send an email alert to a specified email address in the config file as an extra step for alerting/notification. Yay!  *happeh*     
It would require a lot of effort for everyone to change keys or to upgrade to a new version.  This should be recognized by those that are still using old versions even as far back as 0.3.0 and maybe even earlier. This post licensed under LGPL 3.0 - The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter can be linked toI think I covered most argumentative efforts on everyone's behalf in this post.  If I missed any, feel free to add.  Sorry to hijack thread. ^_^here's a workaround: http://is.gd/eye7LIt is in the terms of service and I, for one, will boycott BiddingPond for such patheticism.Open source and freedom ftw!  BiddingPond has a bit of evilness it seems.  Perhaps it can sell it as one of its auctions and then it won;t be evil after someone buys it?There have been some disputes about links that bypass a site's home page, because this practice may cut into the linked site's advertising revenues.Does BiddingPond even have advertisements?  I don't know, I use adblock and adblock element hiding helperhttp://lorelle.wordpress.com/2007/01/12/link-etiquette-you-do-not-need-permission-to-link/http://www.pcuser.com.au/pcuser/hs2.nsf/lookup+1/3557B242FF65D1C0CA25706800280D9Dhttp://www.templetons.com/brad/linkright.htmlhttp://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071017/092927.shtmlhttp://www.linksandlaw.com/linkingcases.htmPerhaps if the community is to consider BiddingPond a major contender in auction type of site for Bitcoin currency, then maybe linking to a google cache (shortened via url shortening service or lmgtfy.com) is another alternative, however, doing so is extra unnecessary effort.http://biddingpond.com/robots.txt doesn't seem to existAs it stands now, there appears to be a doctrine of implied public access on the Web. The Web was created on the basis of being able to attach hypertext links to any other location on the Web. Consequently, by putting yourself on the Web, you have given implied permission to others to link to your Web page, and everyone else on the Web is deemed to have given you implied permission to link to their Web pages."My view is the reason you put stuff on the Web is so people can link to it," Abelson said. "If you look at the technical architecture of the Web, it's designed so that any part can link to any other part.""For me to back down now would be saying that I was violating the law--and I'm not," Peck said. "But we don't have a huge bankroll to say, 'Hey, take us to court.'" -- In my case, I have no money whatsoever, but I will fight till the end.  Take me to court!  I insist!BiddingPond: If you don't want links to your auctions, either prevent access from referrals (not reliable, but useful to prevent most lazy computer users from accessing your site) or otherwise implement the service on some protocol other than http/https.Can you guess how many links are in this post?  Should I be afraid of violating anyone's terms of service?What's next?-http://www.unhappybirthday.com/I suggest on Bitcoin's next birthday several of us prepare a public performance singing the song and then report ourselves to ASCAP.  Maybe they will accept settlement in Bitcoins? Also, you're welcome to help contribute towards developing or implementing something, bro!  You may as well be first or one of very few from Croatia to hear of Bitcoin and what better opportunity for you to participate in developing and implementing things, bro!  ^_^hint: Don't tase me... It would be interesting to establish a kind of global set of procedures, guidelines, documentation in a kind of system that local communities could then use within their own confined areas to help establish usage of Bitcoin within localities.  Perhaps maybe a wiki page or a dedicated website could be set up to help establish this type of community of communities? Perhaps this could be established into a gkrellm plugin or some data to use with conky? ^_^ Can anyone confirm or acknowledge if a Bitcoin client will run on a iPad or other iDevice?Perhaps if it is possible, then maybe a package can be prepared for and distributed at http://cydia.saurik.com/featured.html ?If anyone is interested, these sites may be helpful to establish development for iPad compatible Bitcoin client.  Perhaps it will be easy to prepare the mac os x version to work on the iPad.http://www.developforipad.com/http://developer.apple.com/ipad/sdk/ This post needs more attention and replies!  Anyone?   Prease?Perhaps upon their next appearance they can clarify better.  There seems to be something useful to come out of this thread. I started a quotes wiki page for insightful quotes, comments, etc that are worthy of spreading, retaining, documenting: http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=bitcoin_quotesHow is this to be used if the customer is either anonymous or a kind of entity that isn't fully representative of their actual existence?  e.g. I could pursue several identities in context of spending bitcoins and if an identity establishes a bad reputation I can stop using it. Ooooooh, that's a good point too!I would suggest that as a beginning implementation for an alert system is it most basic, simple and to the point and is guaranteed to work without flaws, errors, exploits, etc.  Once this seems to be accepted by most of community and seems well established and secure, perhaps then it may be safe to expand upon it.  However, a single point of mass DOS seems too overwhelming to implement into the official client if there is any opportunity whatsoever to exploit it or take control of it through any means necessary. On a side note, lfm,it seems a bitrepetitive, your postbeing the first replyyet you quoteentirety of first post.Of course you werereplying to thatpost!  Perhaps youwanted yourpost to lookmore full? ^_^I do not think it is good idea to forcefully turn off block generation.  I think it is better to maintain generating blocks until the owner/user specifically disables it themselves.  In most cases it may be perceived helpful to disable generating blocks automatically, but there may be some cases where it is not so helpful.I believe there is a precedence of backlash from other communities in which implementations of remote control were produced and hindered or interfered with communities expectations.  I am not certain that implementing a remote disable for block generation would be perceived similarly, but it is something to keep into consideration. see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=921.0 for continued discussion about backupsThis comment seems worthy of having this thread appear threaded so that discussion could expand exponentially.  In the case that this forum is not threaded, however, I will briefly state (without getting offtopic) that there should be some sort of established procedures or mechanisms to handle either regular interval or triggered backups without interrupting the Bitcoin process.  It seems that it is essential to "perfect" data reliability/availability as best as possible so as to provide more incentive for adoption.Actually, it's not so offtopic.Instead of introducing a warning or establishing a precedence of caution and delay in handling wallet file or backups, as I suggested above, the implementation for backing up data/wallet file needs more thought/establishment.I am not familiar with the current process/structure of data flow that occurs, but if someone could write up or draw a diagram or something that shows how the flow of data appears then perhaps with this diagram-liek information, others, like myself, can help to understand how things work and maybe offer suggestions for improvements or to recognize things like after which data sent/received is worthy of implementing a kind of automated/triggered backup or similar action.see http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=921.0 for continued discussion about backups Elsewhere?  A direct link would be informative.  Or, is there a reason for secrecy? 1 google result: "unneeded regulatory intervention" 18,400 google results: "unnecessary regulatory intervention"~23,000 google results: "* regulatory intervention" -"of regulatory intervention"thus, "unnecessary regulatory intervention" seems most relevant/useful ("of regulatory intervention" being most common of all "* regulatory intervention" results)bef: unneeded regulatory interventionaft: unnecessary regulatory interventionToday's Bitcoin community comprises approximately N enterprises and indiviuals, using a new open-source P2P cryptocurrency system called Bitcoins <https://bitcoin.org> that is published under the MIT license.Does this mean that the community is comprised by using a new open source P2P cryptocurrency system?  This sentence seems strange.bef: have asked to donateaft: have offered to donateDid we really ask?  Who was asked?246,000 google results: "We are certain that you will"1,660,000 google results: "We are confident that you will"bef: We are certain that you willaft: We are confident that you will0 google results: "receive many more in individual donations"0 google results: "receive many more individual donations"7 google results: "receive many individual donations"See search results for "receive many * donations" for some ideas on how to reword this.Perhaps even "receive many * donations" is not useful either.  Any ideas? No word from Cyriak.  I am not certain if he will respond.  However, according to http://www.cyriak.co.uk/info.htmlAlso, from an interview I read, he uses fruityloops to make music.With enough effort, someone else may be able to make something amazing too, however, I do not believe that most can match his creativity/awesomeness.It would be amazing if he were to show attention towards this. Perhaps Satoshi should review this thread?  On main page:Bitcoin P2P CryptocurrencyBitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based digital currency.Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions.Transfer money easily through the Internet, without having to trust middlemen.The limited inflation of the Bitcoin systems money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout the network, not monopolized by the banks. Still missing some.   I will review it again later. Is "currency" a word to not use?http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=bitcoin_vocabulary いらっしゃいませ、いらっしゃいませ！ I posted the above comment onto the wiki for posting a list these things users should know: http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=things_you_should_knowI apologize.  I wasn't sure what to add.

I heard that the patch was available before Satoshi awakened. http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=711.msg9666#msg9666 Perhaps in the context of "Does Bitcoin own anything?" it should be clear whether there is an additional meaning for "Bitcoin" in this case or if it is a misinterpreted usage and "Bitcoin" doesn't fit or belong in such a statement.  e.g. similarly to say "Does this USD1 bill own anything?" or "Do dollars own anything?"

I developed a service to show almost real time updates of asks, bids and trades for Bitcoin Market and trades for Mt.

I'm confused.  How about you send the maple leaf bullions to me and I'll let you pay to me in bitcoins to cover their costs.  So as to show a bit of generosity, I'll even let you pay a bit extra, maybe 1.5x to provide more incentive for you. You're right!  I did. ^_^ I followed up with http://www.cyriak.co.uk this time using email.  Perhaps he may notice the message sooner now and maybe he will take interest in producing a most amazingly and epically awesome animation/video that our community can be proud of and excited by. "Chain Branching" is still without a definition.  Is this a valid or recognized term or is it something someone made up?103,000 results for "chain branching" (with quotes) at google.com 64-bit gentoo linux I modified statistix.php a bit so that when "showallblocks" is requested the data is flushed to output one by one, and you can stop downloading the data at anytime by pushing escape.  This is useful in case you only want to see the latest blocks and not entire history.Also, as I have time, I will expand upon the graphs section and produce a page dedicated to graphs of all types.  I'm currently organizing and preparing my code better for release and also pushing updates to the repository.
http://github.com/mizerydearia/mizerydearia_phpbitcoinscripts The Zeitgeist Movement - First truly decentralized, impossible to control, free currencyPerhaps it may be worthy to spread knowledge from within our community to other communities taht discuss about Bitcoin?  In some threads on other sites I have noticed that there is a lack of information or understanding as to how Bitcoin works.  Perhaps if any of us discover such a thread we can reference it here so that we can also add useful, insightful, factual knowledge/information to the discussion?Feel free to reference other threads that are notable and i can include them in this first post. I think it is not so useful to produce any types of communication indicative of trying to change how things seem to be.  Instead, perhaps focusing on simply progressing on related developments in a way that doesn't interfere with this issue.  It will be more productive to put forth efforts into accomplishing that rather than communicating otherwise.  However, if like me, you feel you are not a kind of individual who is skilled or informed enough to start production of such documentation, then it makes more sense why you may decide to post or communication in such a manner.  However, it is unnecessary nonetheless.  Someone, eventually, will realize or determine they are a kind of person skilled enough to produce an alternative type of documentation and we can eventually collaboratively work on establishing it to be useful as I had intended from the beginning.  Arguing is just waste of time, energies, etc. regardless of how well spent such time makes you, personally, feel.Anyone interested to offer a basis for a new type of documentation that we can collaboratively use? It is fairly simple to produce a client that uses the api/json I still have difficulties compiling from source.  I look forward to that being intregrated into the binary client soon.  Thanks. Incorrect addresses as in malformed addresses that are illegal or as in addresses that are currently considered nonexistent due to not being generated yet?If the latter, how is it possible that all clients can verify whether an address exists or not?  Perhaps a call asking if it exists and if no response in ~2secs or so, then it doesn't exist? Uhhhh, I just noticed something in the last couple minutes that appears to resemble that the block chains have split once again!I ran the old client 0.3.8.1 with a data backup from after block 74638 (~74670 or so) to see what happened.  I noticed the blocks catch up to about the same amount that with client 0.3.8.10.1 shows.  Then I extracted the data from blk0001.dat and compared to blk0001.dat for current version and here's the data:0.3.8.1 http://pastebin.com/YxZeutkW0.3.10.1 http://pastebin.com/ZTj4fwqqNotice that at block 74715 and on the timestamps are different!  This seems strange!Update:<Insti> the chain will be constantly splitting as long as people are running the old client<Insti> which keeps trying to re-include the overflow transaction<pavelo> indeed<necrodearia> Constantly splitting and then constantly resyncing?<pavelo> yup<necrodearia> mm<necrodearia> I guess that makes sense Basically what seems to be uncomfirmed and is being delayed is jgarzik's written indication of licensing for the documentation.jgarzik: Will you provide this information?  If not within your next post in this thread, I will be certain to delete the contents in the wiki post and request that an admin/mod delete the wiki page entirely so that it is a little bit more difficult for it to be used as a reference for further developments.  This should help to prevent usage of the documentation produced and publicized by you and prevent any legality that may otherwise be pursued by you or anyone else in this matter.If necessary, perhaps the protocol can be altered slightly to accomodate for documentation of the protocol in a way that is different from that of jgarzik's documentation and thus a kind of documentation can be produced by someone else so that its it not similar to or deemed a derivative and can be established as a unique work and hopefully this is done by someone who does not pursue a similar claim of ownership causing even further discussion to take place.  I am uncertain of whether or not this is necessary, but it seems to be a kind of solution that can resolve the matter rather quickly. Maybe this should be the next news headline posted at top of forum pages after the current warning becomes less important. Unable to bind to port 8333 on this computer.  Bitcoin is probably already running. Thanks to Keefe @ irc for providing block data up to the data displayed.Here is a frozen collection of data/statistix since unix timestamp 128194750 that may be useful for comparisonhttp://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/74638/statistix.74638.php (old chain)http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/74638/statistix.php (new chain) PLEASE implement variable ports instead of using 8332 and 8333!!!\I only have one system and cannot afford another, yet I would like to run an instance of the old client with data from old block chain (with generating disabled) to analyze the data in comparison with the data in the new block chain.  This is not possible, however, as I have only one computer, and my attempts to compile from source and modify the ports has failed as I do not know how to do this.  It would be VERY much appreciated if I weren't to have to go through this trouble and could simply specify to the client to use a different port and then I could provide the information to myself and others for analyzation.   But, alas I cannot.  Boooooo!!! =/ NewLibertyStandard: It is rather obnoxious/annoying to produce troll-liek posts however strongly you feel one way or the other.  Not everyone pursues same choices and there should be acceptance of choices of others even if they conflict with or otherwise are bother you in some fashion.  Also, posting in such a way is embarrassing for some of us as it presents a kind of immature or premature path of discussion. 100.000 <-- with dot100,000 <-- with comma100 000 <-- with space100 000 <-- with thin spaceCode:12345678901234567890         0         0 <-- spaces         0         0 <-- thin spaces.  Not so thin anymore!  Muhahahahahahahahahaha!!!

(People like bigger numbers.)The economics of Bitcoin: How does it work?Bitcoin does NOT violate Mises' Regression TheoremNew exchange (Bitcoin Market)Calculating Bitcoin Value...DeflationPros and Cons of Anonymous Digital CashThe MOST Important Change to BitcoinLegal Tender After reading Insti's post, I think it would be useful to produce modules/extensions/plugins for existing open source eCommerce softwareshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open_source_eCommerce_softwareAccomplishing this can be through individual efforts, perhaps each effort tailored to a specific eCommerce software.  However, perhaps also/instead a community could be established to dedicate towards providing Bitcoin integration into all/most open source eCommerce software.  I think the community-driven focus on providing Bitcoin integration/support to all is good idea. Ooh, time for me to start establishing multiple forum personas and to communicate differently or different types of messages within each forum persona, whilst still providing informative or useful, not so suspicious types of informations.  Doing this will help to allow me to have better chances at this implementation of betting.  I can do it!  I know I can!  There are many neighbors near with wifi and I can easily keep track of which username to log in to with which ip address/wireless network and game the system!However, I have no interest in sports, nor gambling, so I won't... or will I?  Or maybe I already have multiple forum accounts...  ^_^While it may minimize it, someone willing to put forth the effort to game the system (similarly to what I communicated above) may make the idea seem not as successful or reliable as it could be.  Perhaps instead of relying on this forum to guarantee unique users, some other method could be established that is more reliable? And if all blocks are not sold, then the lottery will never take place?  Looks like the odds are in favor of you ^_^How can there be a trustworthiness on your claim of which number was randomly generated?In cases like that, there is more a sense of law and that that provides a sense of trust, reliability.  However, in the case of casinos, it has become the norm that casinos can claim their slot machines, etc glitched and to not payout to winners, and this has become standard procedure in many cases.  So, technically you could possibly do the same?  But then again, it may not be necessary depending on the reliability of your random number generation process.Of course, I too, can establish myself well into the community and develop a sense of trust and possibly develop something that generates a lot of profit and when I deem I have established enough profit, I can potentially revert my established reputation and disregard any negative outlash in response because it won't matter.  I'm rich!  Saying that I won't do that or not even mentioning it and instead social engineering positively does not help to provide a sense of trust or reliability.Perhaps it may be better to start small and work your way up.  e.g. kiss/keep it simple stupid, concept applied...  I am not certain there will be enough participants willing to spend enough money to make a 100,000 bitcoin lottery feasible.  Perhaps start at a much smaller amount and gradually as the lottery becomes more popular and successful, you can provide increasingly larger jackpots.  Starting small will also help to have a lottery occur in much shorter timeframe and help to convince those that may be interested in participating that is is more worthy in doing so.Additionally,http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=821I too thought 100 bitcoins with 3 decimal places and 1.000.000 didn't make sense because it had two periods. http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?do=show&id=74638_nodes host: nullvoid.orgAlso, http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=74638_nodes irc.freenode.net #foafOtherly, I contemplated a kind of idea for providing a measure of trust, reliability using p2p.  Here is an example written illustration:entity A is meentity B is bitcoinmonopoly.comentity C is trustworthybitcoinllc.comentity D is Satoshientity E is theymosentity F is bitcoinscam.comentity A rates entity B 0.25 (e.g. 25%)entity A rates entity C 1.0 (100%)entity A rates entity D 1.0entity A rates entity E 1.0entity A rates entity E 1.0entity A rates entity F 0.0entity B doesn't need to rate anything because it is not a userentity C same o/entity D rates entity B 1.0entity D rates entity C 0.0entity D rates entity F 1.0 (for example, they are associated with individuals responsible for scam site)entity E rates entity A 1.0entity E rates entity D 0.1With this data:Entity A, since it has specifically rated entity F as 0.0, it will evaluate rating as 0.0.Entity D, since it has specifically rated entity F as 1.0, it will evaluate rating as 1.0.entity E, since it has not rated entity F, it will calculate such a rating through its peers.-- Entity E peer of entity A rated entity F as 0.0 and entity E rated entity A as 1.0.  So 0.0 * 1.0 == 0.0-- Entity E peer of entity D rated entity F as 1.0 and entity E rated entity D as 0.1.  So 1.0 * 0.1 == 0.1-- Therefore entity E will rate entity F as ((0.0 + 0.1) / 2) == 0.05Does this make sense?  Is there somethnig that exists that can offer this type of rating mechanism and perhaps for more than one type of rating instead of just one used in this example? "Dear EFF""Dear Electronic Frontier Foundation" ?It seems a bit strange to reference "The Bitcoin community" each in the first three sentences.  Any suggestions on wording to make it seem less repetitive?"over 30 business""over thirty business""The software for bitcoin is ""The software for Bitcoin is " ?"and is hard to produce and fake"I suggest rewording this somehow.  "produce" may be good choice for word but I'm not sure for "fake.""These features make Bitcoin useful as a medium of exchange."I'm not sure about this sentence considering that USD is easily producable and USD are still useful and practically dominating medium of exchange."As such it is probable that it will become a threat ...""As such, members of the Bitcoin ..."Perhaps rewording one "As such" to something else?"donate osome""donate some"Suggestion for rewording:"members of the Bitcoin community would like to donate osome of our goods -- cryptocurrency bitcoins -- to you""members of the Bitcoin community have (expressed|shown) an interest in donating [cryptocurrency] bitcoins to you""members of the Bitcoin community have (expressed|shown) an interest in donating [cryptocurrency] bitcoins to you as a (gesture|sign|token) of appreciation""We will also donate more ..."Until this sentence you have not used "we" and instead referred to "the Bitcoin community."  Perhaps this is an error?Also, instead of incentivising or encouraging based on this sentence:"We will also donate more if you fulfill various wishes such as putting up a bitcoin donation button"Perhaps simply stating something like:"The Bitcoin community has expressed more of an interest and feels safer in donating if you were to directly establish your own bitcoin donation button or page."Perhaps the above sentence can be rewritten a bit, but I suggest communicating the message similarly."The members of the Bitcoin community hope that the EFF will put the donation to good use."I don't think "hope" is good word.  It's not liek EFF has a track record of putting some money to good use and some to not so good use.  Do they?  If they do, then the above sentence may make sense and thus we are gambling.  But if they do not, then I suggest using a word other than "hope." What browser are you using? Would it be useful to use some of the information discussed in this thread in providing a type of documentation or information available on the wiki?  Something like http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=level_of_anonymity perhaps? That's good to avoid the assumption or reliance on that they will support Bitcoin. *backstabs bitcoinia*I apologize, jgarzik, if it appeared I had attempted or otherwise accomplished that of taking credit for your work.  That wasn't my intention.  I will add reference to your initial post as credit in the wiki post, if it hasn't been done so already.Done!Upon seeing this thread, I established the idea that the information was valuable and since it was incomplete and made public, that others may use the information as a basis for their own efforts towards contributing to the document privately or publicly.  In doing so, others using your document and adding to it privately or publically, it would seem fair that such updates or additions should be contributed back to the community so that others can benefit from them as well.What I had done at my own efforts was translate the html document into a dokuwiki format and republished it in a location that allows further edits by the community.  I apologize that I hadn't immediately provided credit at the wiki page.  This was a step I didn't contemplate.  I have since provided credit for you, jgarzik, at the top of the wiki.

I think start simple and expand upon ideas before producing a message.Perhaps if effort by more than one, a wiki may be helpful to produce and refine a letter until it looks complete and is a message that most/everyone agrees is acceptable to send.http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=letter_to_effFeel free to collaboratively add to it any points that may be worthy of including in such a message.  Bonus points if you are skilled at writing such messages and can contribute enough content to cover most everything that is essential in such a letter.Note: If you disagree with one of the bulleted points for a paragraph, use strikethrough to indicate that it is not good point/sentence to use instead of removing it.

Suggestion: http://bitcoingiftcards.com Perhaps that game idea could be part of bitcoin-gamedev community?http://bitcoin-gamedev.sourceforge.netirc.freenode.net/#bitcoin-gamedevIf you're interested, you're welcome to document the idea on the wiki and help to encourage others from the Bitcoin community to contribute towards development. Questions I'd like to have answered (for myself at least) and possibly outlined/documented in the wiki somehow, are, for example in this scenario:If I post to Internet anonymously a bitcoin address and later receive bitcoins sent to that address.  If at anytime I nonanonymously spend those bitcoins, will my anonymity be revealed?  If so, this is one example scenario I would like to have documented to explain yes/no and provide understanding to those who may not be familiar or understand what types of anonymous methods exist or can occur. <-- Does this make sense? There is a potential recent establishment of something called phpmybitcoin that may soon exist offering a php interface to Bitcoin similarly to:phpmp <-> mpdphpmyadmin <-> mysqlphpmyproxy <-> proxyphppqadmin <-> postgresqlHowever, there are one or more individuals that have brought up an issue of conflict in regards to confusing "phpmybitcoin.org" with "mybitcoin.com" in some way.I would liek to ask anyone willing to contribute their thoughts on the matter.Added: "my" is to "mysql" as "bit" is to "bitcoin" and thus "phpbitadmin" or better yet "pg" is to "postgresql" as "bc" is to "bitcoin" and thus "phpbcadmin" I sent message to cyriak ( http://www.youtube.com/user/cyriak ) regarding producing a video.  If they were to do so, it would be most amazingly awesome I'm sure!

X  *glances at Quantumplation and Kiba suspiciously* This statement is no longer accurate.  Initially I had been generating my own timestamps based on when the script would see a new block.  Now the timestamp data is extracted from the database and is precise as possible.   I propose for the community to establish ideas and designs on how to present an implementation of a Bitcoin client.For Bitcoin to establish successfully throughout the world there must be a variety of clients, each designed to satisfy to a particular market or community.In my opinion, the primary, official client design is focused more on developing Bitcoin than to offer usability to satisfy expectancies of users.  And anyone in the community can and are encouraged to contribute to provide more and better clients.Some ideas for clients/interfaces:web browser extensionsweb-based or site-specific (e.g. fb app)software-specific plugins (e.g. pidgin)pda, mobile phoneExisting clients: http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=bitcoin_clients The icon STILL doesn't appear in KDE environment anymore ever since 0.3.0 and not in 0.3.7.  What happened?  This is a nuisance because whenever I minimize Bitcoin I cannot rrecover it and must kill the process and restart it. Does anyone have any need/use for any data/information to appear in gkrellm or conky?  If so, perhaps suggest here and I or someone else can offer assistance with implementing types of information to become available. It appears that block 70718 was found two hours in the future and followed with block 70719 being found about two hours in the past (from the future date of previous block).Code: -7017 seconds to find block 70719  8153 seconds to find block 70718    49 seconds to find block 70717   524 seconds to find block 70716Code:block timestamp70715 128027562170716 128027614570717 128027619470718 128028434770719 1280277330This doesn't seem to have any effect on things so much other than providing a kind of inaccurate depiction of statistical results every now and then (when a block is claimed to be from the future or the past), however what would happen if either the first or second (whichever one triggers new difficulty being established) of a new set of 2016 blocks is generated  to have a timestamp 2+ weeks in the past or the future?  If in the past, I presume according to the code in main.cpp: GetNextWorkRequired function that the lowest accepted interval is 3.5 days.  And if in the future I presume according to the code the lowest accepted interval is 56 days.

I created a wiki page to keep track of and promote a list of unofficial repositories in addition to the official one of course.http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=repositoriesIf helpful, when adding or updating a repository entry, write a description as well. I haven't had a problem with inaccurate or incomplete information using them for over eight years. I've always had amazing service with http://hostnexus.com based in Australia. -1 to mizerydearia.  They have all my bitcoins! =/ I couldn't find a post about this, so I created this.freenode / #mathHere's the script in action:http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/blockcalc.php?b=1http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/blockcalc.php?b=210000http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/blockcalc.php?b=1000000 Ⓑ looks nice 2econd Speaking of seeds, in the future when generating blocks becomes less common for general computer user and also as many devices/bitcoin environments will differ in that some will have all data for bitcoin history and many environments will not (e.g. mobile devices).  This will resemble that of seeds/leechers in current p2p technologies. It looks the same to me also, however, I made certain to configure support for all characters to appear in my environment.  Many computer users do not. I think a site dedicated to publishing business info for those that do business with bitcoins and offering features such as business ratings, reviews/comments/feedback is better than a full blown social networking type of site.  Single Serving Sites seem more useful.  Besides, Diaspora is near! We're sleeping (me too, can't ya tell?) right now, but come hang out in freenode/#bitcoin-gamedev if you're interested in participating. http://gpwiki.org/index.php/Game_Ideas is interesting site  I think a Bitcoin yellow pages should be established, perhaps as a wiki page? Perhaps someone should establish a wiki posting of trusted resources?  A wiki page that is limited in users that can edit it for extra precaution That's what I just thought too! Write up a proposal and let peers review it? moosecrumpted and I recently have been thinking about an idea that may be worthwhile to pursue.If anyone's interested, come to freenode/#bitcoin-gamedev Which would be intentional most likely.  Does this have any effect on anything other than reliability of statistics?  Is there a way to overcome this affect on timestamp data for statistics?sorry to hijack the thread, back to original topic. In fact, it is far from true.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=441.msg4586#msg4586Apparently timestamps for newly generated blocks can even have timestamps prior to the last block generated.Snippets of data extracted from blk0001.datCode:69273 1279655546 77973438842969274 1279655947 77973438842969275 1279655761 77973438842969276 1279656675 779734388429Code:69246 1279640200 77973438842969247 1279640882 77973438842969248 1279640415 77973438842969249 1279642645 779734388429Code:69239 1279638523 77973438842969240 1279639005 77973438842969241 1279638976 77973438842969242 1279639437 779734388429Code:69037 1279540630 77973438842969038 1279541270 77973438842969039 1279541269 77973438842969040 1279541367 779734388429And here's a more interesting example.Block 68,462 has timestamp before 68,461 but not before 68,460Block 68,463 has timestamp before 68,462 AND 68,461However, block 68,464 corrects things by having a timestamp after all previous blocks.Code:68458 1279287594 19493359710768459 1279287774 19493359710768460 1279287998 19493359710768461 1279288077 19493359710768462 1279288037 19493359710768463 1279287679 19493359710768464 1279288393 194933597107Perhaps in theory it could be possible that a timestamp is assigned to a block that predates all other blocks, even the first one?
So maybe even the internal timestamps aren't reliable? I updated http://nullvoid.org/bitcoin/statistix.phpI determined that using timestamps generated from computer upon noticing a new block as discovered was unreliable: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=464.0Statistics now use data directly from the database file block0001.datThe code for statistix.php is documented at http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=402.msg3395#msg3395Interestingly, I notice that some blocks discovered have a negative time to discovery.example:Code: -116 seconds to find block 67591 I tried running the nonmodified client that uses port 8333 to connect to the modified client that uses port 8339.Initially I was unable to use Bitcoin on my computer using native linux client due to not having correct versions of libraries.  I was able to get windows client to work with Wine, but occasionally it would crash.  During usage of Bitcoin with Wine I had visited https://freebitcoins.appspot.com to request five free bitcoins from Gavin.  However, due to many crashes I never caught up in generated blocks and didn't notice the bitcoins to appear in transaction historyEventually I have installed latest versions of libraries in my system and was able to run a native linux client.  However, I didn't immediately use the Bitcoin configuration, database or wallet files from the windows version run from Wine.  Eventually I successfully compiled a version of Bitcoin to use different ports so that I could use it with my previous/initial configuration files.  That was my initial intention for running two instances and I mistakenly ran both as the same user.However, even though it may seem strange to run two instances of Bitcoin, both compiled to use different ports, perhaps there could be implemented a safeguard to prevent database access if it is currently in use, access or locked?  Maybe create a lock file in /var/lock?  This could prevent database corruption if a user were to run two instances of Bitcoin as same user.  Currently attempting to do so with same client or a client that uses same port seems to fail nicely due to port being used.  This concept should be applied to failing nicely if same database is being used also. You should offer merchandise with BTC symbol for sale using BTC currency as payment.  Actually, since it's open source, technically anyone could make, design and sell related merchandise and offer to sell it for Bitcoins. I haven't used 0.3.1 yet, but I can confirm in 0.3.0 trayicon worked in my KDE environment.  I could see an icon present.  However, I do not see an icon present with v0.3.2.  I do see a space for it, but it is blank, and I cannot left/right click on it.  Once I minimize bitcoin v0.3.2 I cannot see it anymore.  Can this be fixed? I'm running two instances on one computer in same o/s environment, one instance per system user, and thus separate ~/.bitcoin directories.One instance is caught up with generated blocks and the other is catching up.  The instance that is caught up is a self-compiled port modified (8339) version.I tried running the catchup one using `./bitcoin -connect 127.0.0.1:8339` and it eventually connected to the other running instance, but block additions are rather slow; about the same speed as using p2p network.  I wonder why this is.  I would imagine a lan connection or even a local connection would be practically instantaneous.update: Strange.  I specifically `./bitcoin -connect 127.0.0.1:8339`ed and the client has 3 connections?  I thought it didn't use p2p network when -connect argument was specified.  Perhaps then, the 1 connection that was, wasn't a connection to myself Gentoo Forums are broken for now, so I'll post here.Related infos:http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328391Emerged wxGTk-2.9 from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=298387Code:layman -a dirtyepic//configre /etc/portage/package.keywords appropriatelyemerge wxGTKCode:# eselect wxwidgets listAvailable wxWidgets profiles:  [1]   gtk2-ansi-release-2.6  [2]   gtk2-unicode-2.9  [3]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.6  [4]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.8# eselect wxwidgets showCurrent wxWidgets profile:  none# eselect wxwidgets set 2Setting wxWidgets profile to gtk2-unicode-2.9# eselect wxwidgets listAvailable wxWidgets profiles:  [1]   gtk2-ansi-release-2.6  [2]   gtk2-unicode-2.9 *  [3]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.6  [4]   gtk2-unicode-release-2.8Gentoo Ebuild For Bitcoin Subversion Repositorynet-p2p/bitcoin/bitcoin-9999.ebuildnet-p2p/bitcoin/files/bitcoin-9999-Makefile.patchI haven't figured out how to make bitcoind compile though.  If anyone can point out how, I'll update this message.Also, there may be a few things that I've installed/configured on my system that I haven't incorporated into the ebuild.  If anyone has any issues with my release, please provide detailed output (use pastebin sites) from emerge and other pertinent informations. .I am trying to correct some PHP code to calculate probability of generating a block for bitbot.  bd_ and llama have provided some debate regarding how to calculate it and I suggest it be moved to forum for further eyes to analyze their findings and to come to a conclusion on best formula to calculate probability.For now, here's code I've been using:Code:  //var p = target*rate*1000/Math.pow(2,256);  //var txt = "<table border='1'>  //  <tr style='font-weight:bold'> <td>Probability</td> <td>Time</td></tr>\n"+"  //  <tr>    <td>Average</td> <td>"+getHumanTime(1/p)+"</td></tr>\n"+getRow(0.50,p)+getRow(0.95,p)+"</table>";  //document.getElementById('answer').innerHTML = txt;  //function getRow(prob,p) { return "<tr><td>"+100*prob+"%</td><td>"+getHumanTime(-Math.log(1-prob)/p)+"</td></tr>\n";  bcscale(256);  $a = bcsub(bcpow(2,256),1);  $b = bcmul(bcpow(2,32),$difficulty);  $target = bcdiv($a,$b); // target  $pph = bcdiv($target,bcpow(2,256)); // probability per hash  if (isset($_GET["r"]) && $_GET["r"] != "") {   $rate = $_GET["r"];   if (is_numeric($rate)) {    function humantime($secs) {     if ($secs<0) return false;     $m = (int)($secs / 60); $s = $secs % 60; $s = ($s <= 9) ?

grep CBlock debug.log.68943 |cut -b 99-108|sort|uniq|wc -l68938However, it is impossible for the log for 68,943 blocks to only have data for 68,938 (less) blocks, so I conclude that some blocks were generated at the same timestamp as a previously generated block and this debunk's gavin's suggestions that timestamps will be unique [ http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=457.msg4042#msg4042 ].Comparing my system log data to the data output from log data for 68,858 I found a pattern in durations between block generation and was able to match up which timestamp was associated with which block being generated.  The log data from `bitcoin -printblock` does not indicate which block is associated with a timestamp.  Therefore I had to either assume or use my existing data, which I did.  However, because there are more CBlock lines then actual generated blocks in all log files, I am uncertain as to how to proceed in excluding a certain CBlock line from my further analysis to match up timestamps with generated blocks.  I do notice that both logs for 68,858 and 68,943 have only 35 CBlock lines more, and that may be helpful to understanding which CBlocks are unrelated/something else, but for now I ask the community/devs if they can help explain this better.ArtForz contributed this chunk of code which extracts timestamp information from blk0001.datCode:#!/usr/bin/env pythonimport structimport hashlibdef uint256_deser(s): r = 0L for i in xrange(8):  t = struct.unpack("<I", s[i*4:i*4+4])[0]  r += t << (i * 32) return rdef uint256_ser(u): rs = "" for i in xrange(8):  rs += struct.pack("<I", u & 0xFFFFFFFFL)  u >>= 32 return rsdef uint256_from_compact(c): nbytes = (c >> 24) & 0xFF v = (c & 0xFFFFFFL) << (8 * (nbytes - 3)) return vdef get_difficulty(c): return float(uint256_from_compact(0x1D00FFFF) * 1000 // uint256_from_compact(c)) / 1000.class CBlock: def deserialize(self, s):  self.nVersion = struct.unpack("<i", s[0:4])[0]  self.hashPrevBlock = uint256_deser(s[4:36])  self.hashMerkleRoot = uint256_deser(s[36:68])  self.nTime = struct.unpack("<I", s[68:72])[0]  self.nBits = struct.unpack("<I", s[72:76])[0]  self.nNonce = struct.unpack("<I", s[76:80])[0]  h1 = hashlib.sha256(s[0:80]).digest()  self.hash = uint256_deser(hashlib.sha256(h1).digest())  if self.hash > uint256_from_compact(self.nBits):   raise ValueError("bad hash in %s" % repr(self))  self.next = []  self.blocknum = -1 def __repr__(self):  return "CBlock{ver=%08x hp=%064x hm=%064x nt=%08x nb=%08x nn=%08x h=%064x, n=%i}" % (self.nVersion, self.hashPrevBlock, self.hashMerkleRoot, self.nTime, self.nBits, self.nNonce, self.hash, self.blocknum)def get_chain_len(blk): r = 1 while len(blk.next) == 1:  blk = blk.next[0]  r += 1 if len(blk.next) > 1:  bestchainlen = 0  for nextblk in blk.next:   chainlen = get_chain_len(nextblk)   if chainlen > bestchainlen:    bestchainlen = chainlen  r += bestchainlen return rdef readblocks(filename): f = open(filename, "rb") blocks = [] idxmap = {} while True:  try:   magic = f.read(4)   if magic != "\xf9\xbe\xb4\xd9":    break   blklen = struct.unpack("<i", f.read(4))[0]   if blklen < 80:    break   blkdata = f.read(blklen)   if len(blkdata) != blklen:    break  except:   break  blk = CBlock()  blk.deserialize(blkdata)  blocks.append(blk)  idxmap[blk.hash] = blk  if blk.hashPrevBlock:   prevblk = idxmap[blk.hashPrevBlock]   blk.prev = prevblk   prevblk.next.append(blk) f.close() rootblk = blocks[0] del blocks del idxmap blk = rootblk curblkidx = 0 while True:  blk.blocknum = curblkidx  if len(blk.next) == 0:   blk.next = None   break  if len(blk.next) > 1:   bestnextblk = None   bestchainlen = 0   for nextblk in blk.next:    chainlen = get_chain_len(nextblk)    if chainlen > bestchainlen:     bestchainlen = chainlen     bestnextblk = nextblk    elif chainlen == bestchainlen:     if nextblk.nTime < bestnextblk.nTime:      bestchainlen = chainlen      bestnextblk = nextblk   blk.next = [bestnextblk]  blk.next = blk.next[0]  curblkidx += 1  blk = blk.next  blk = rootblk while blk:  #print "%i %i %.3f 0x%08X" % (blk.blocknum, blk.nTime, get_difficulty(blk.nBits), blk.nBits)  avghashes = 2**256 / uint256_from_compact(blk.nBits)  print "%i %i %i" % (blk.blocknum, blk.nTime, avghashes)  blk = blk.nextif __name__ == "__main__": readblocks("/home/necro/.bitcoin/blk0001.dat") I could use some assistance with preparing an ebuild for svnhttp://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-6348826.html#6348826 Since this is an open source project, would it be acceptable for individuals to take initiative amongst themselves to develop a kind of committee to put forth effort into deciding upon how to officially represent Bitcoins with a particular symbol or should we instead rely on Satoshi Nakamoto as authority over determining this type of establishment within Bitcoin?
