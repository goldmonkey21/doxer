Very interesting, I hope you will succeed.I've got one concern: in both Ethereum and Bitcoin transactions are validated and then rebroadcasted by each node. In Bitcoin, transactions are very cheap to validate, and nodes have little to no advantage to refuse checking and broadcasting them. On the contrary, some Ethereum contracts might be quite expensive to execute, and while miners do have the incentive to do this - the transaction fees, which are relatively high, - ordinary nodes don't. If we assume that nodes are rational, they may refuse to evaluate and rebroadcast complex contracts transactions that do not affect themselves, because this would reduce load on their computers and will not result in any penalties.Additionally, high transaction fees favour selfish mining (http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243). I did not review the GHOST blocktrees concept and have no idea if it could protect from the selfish mining attack. Very interesting idea, I like it. Few thoughts, though:1. I really hope that you're going to publish a piece of code that crawls through Bitcoin blockchain (or unspent outputs pool, depending on your implementation) and deterministically selects the addresses for initial distribution instead of just giving a blob of addresses chosen by you. If not, you surely will be blamed for cheating and filling the list with addresses own by you or your friends.2. Are you going to give any details of your PoS implementation (white paper would be the best choice)? It would be good if the community could review it for possible flaws or weaknesses before the actual release.3. I like the idea of coloured denominations, but dislike assigning amounts to the rainbow. It may be hard to distinguish between adjacent colours at a glance, and this surely will be used for scamming. The colours should differ as much as possible, i.e. Black, Red, Green, Orange, Blue, Yellow, Purple (violet), White. 【】Oh, those chinese parentheses... They tell a lot. >10 seconds>halving every 8192 blocksDoesn't this mean that block reward is halved every ~23 hours? Wrong. Read the OP post: the wallet will try to us the oldest coins, and a warning message will be displayed if your funds are going to decay.They may use fraction such as uXRC or nXRC (micro- or nano-) as the base unit. Thank you guys for support!  Hmm, I wonder why did he delete his posts. Thanks!It's funny how thoughts sometimes come to different people's heads at the same time. The other name I was considering is ReCoin (XRC), I'll use it instead. [403 Forbidden Error] - You might be blocked by your IP, Country, or ISP. You can try to contact us at http://www.witza.com/contact.phpI cannot even check it. Hi there. Somebody may still remember my previous attempt to make an altcoin, which however didn't receive enough support from the community and eventually became dead: Onecoin.ReCoin inherits some of its predecessor's features and adds something really innovative: all funds that have been lost (e.g. by losing wallet.dat or sending them to nonexistent address) will slowly return into circulation, ensuring that the effective money supply will always stay the same once initial mining is complete and counteracting the deflation.This is achieved by delayed demurrage: any unspent output will remain intact during the first 525600 blocks (roughly one year, block target is 1 minute), after that it will lose 5% per year from it's initial value until the output is renewed or completely exhausted (this will take ~20 years). All funds that have been recovered are added to miners' reward, providing additional incentive apart from transaction fees when block reward becomes small.One thing must be emphasized: there is a big difference to Freicoin. With Freicoin, you always suffer from demurrage, making this cryptocurrency unsuitable for long term investment. With ReCoin, your money will be safe provided that you renew old outputs once a year. Renewing is simply sending your funds back to your address and is almost free (standard transaction fees apply). There will be a simple GUI (as well as RPC command) for achieving this task, and a warning will be popped up if your funds are approaching the deadline. Even more, the wallet software will prefer the oldest outputs when you spend your money, so chances are that you will never need to renew them if you use your wallet from time to time.Other features:- PoW, scrypt hashing;- No premine, no instamine (high starting difficulty);- Total cap of 1 (one) coin, dividable to 18 decimal places;- 1 minute block target, 525600 blocks per year;- Difficulty retargeting every block (PPC algorhythm);- Starting block reward is 2 uXRC;- Reward is halved each 250000 blocks (~0.48 years), the whole 1 coin will be mined in 20 years;- Forked from latest Bitcoin sources and following Bitcoin development.Project timeline:January 2014: Release of first version. Exact date and time will be published in advance. It won't contain any demurrage code yet.June-July 2014: Release of second major version, fully supporting all innovations. Users will have plenty of time to upgrade.July 2014: The first halving of block reward.December 2014: A network alert will be sent to all old clients forcing them to upgrade.January 2015: The first block with additional reward from lost funds will be mined.The specs are not final, I'm open to all propositions and discussion. Sunny King has added ONC to his PPCoin marketplace: http://ppcoin.org/market (discussion: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=238604.0). Why not?  Bump  Thank you guys for supporting the currency  You've built sources from head of master branch, while the release version was in a separate branch, tagged with v0.1.0 (I told to checkout this tag in OP post). After a while I realized that people will build sources from master anyway (so was you  ), so I merged the release branch into master. The problem is that your current wallet.dat thinks that it was created in version 0.8.99 (this is the version of Bitcoin sources in master branch), while Onecoin version is 0.1.0. I suggest you to send all your money to a new wallet and drop the old one.I will be doing this in a day or two.Updated OP post, thanks! I've noticed, that ONC is the only currency among recently launched ones where you used linear graph for Minted currency chart instead of logarithmic one. I come to a conclusion that Onecoin is a coin with so far the most uniform distribution of minted currency  You guys are awesome! I added all links to the OP post.BTW feeleep, the three letter code is ONC, not OTC  Great, thanks! Here is the result of my attempts to port p2pool. https://github.com/cre8r/p2poolIt's based on https://github.com/forrestv/p2pool with additions from https://github.com/Rav3nPL/p2pool-yacCurrently it does run without exceptions, but it incorrectly determines the difficulty as 1.0, so I cannot even check if it accepts shares from worker. Awesome, thanks!
I really appreciate this!BTW Difficulty reached 0.02. Awesome! I've updated the OP post. It is a logarithmic curve. The Nfactor is on the left, the day when it changes is on the right.Code:6 07 268 599 10010 15211 21712 29913 40214 53115 69516 90017 115918 148519 189620 241221 306322 388223 491224 621025 784426 990027 1249028 1574929 19853And here is the number of days each Nfactor value will be in effect. The central column is for Onecoin, The right one is for Yacoin. You can see that Yacoin's Nfactor increases at a quite strange rate.Code:4 0 75 0 36 26 37 33 98 41 39 52 2410 65 1211 82 3712 103 4813 129 4914 164 19415 205 9716 259 29117 326 38918 411 38819 516 116520 651 38821 819 310722 1030 310723 1298 679 Thanks Aggrophobia for generous donation of 10 micro-ONC! This is a standard behavior. It is totally the same behavior as that of Bitcoin. The addresses in the transaction list are your addresses, and you do own the mined money. If a transaction disappears, it means that it has been orphaned, it is a common event while the difficulty haven't settled. Screw me, lol. Mhashes, of course.My i5 is giving around 36 khashes. OMG. Did you use cpuminer from the link in OP post? Try also to add "-s 1" to minerd options, this will make cpuminer get the latest information from wallet every second. Not yet, but one (order lists with escrow) is coming soon.BTW network hashrate estimates to 2.2 Gh/s Thanks, I'm glad to hear this. Yep, after block 25500 the reward will be 500 nONC. This should happen tomorrow or the day after. Awesome site, man. I would be happy if you add Onecoin to your list. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=200177.0 Yep, with built-in miner. cpuminer crashes for some reason, didn't have time to investigate it yet. Don't get upset! You didn't miss a lot, the block reward is still less than 1/5 of its maximal value, and it was even lower before. Also I'm getting a plenty of blocks with my i5. I've updated the OP post. Sorry for misinformation. Are you using Yacoin's miner? They are not compatible. You're doing something wrong. Are you using cpuminer included with wallet? Total network hashrate estimates to 1 Ghash/sec. I got only 150, lol. 2000 blocks mined. Aaaaaand I've got my first 10 nONC!
26 users in IRC channel  My bad, forgot to add link to minerd sources. https://github.com/onecoin/cpuminer It's not compatible, so don't bother trying  It's probably because your CPU needs to support SSE Here you go: http://sourceforge.net/projects/onecoin/files/onecoin-qt-v.0.1.0.zip/download Which errors are you getting? As soon as it finishes building, lol. None, the network is seeded by IRC channel (a working one), just wait for someone else to join. Anyone complaining about premine may check their block rewards once they start mining. The first 1000 blocks have no reward, and for first 25500 the reward is lowered. This is done to ensure the launch is fair. That's a good point, I've pushed the sources to Github. Checkout tag v0.1.0 You won't miss anything, since there will be no reward for first 1000 blocks for everyone interested to catch up.Nope, the problem arised when I changed client version to 0.1.0, it turned out that the client version is used internally to check database version and capabilities. I'm building the fixed client at this moment. Sorry for delay, got some minor problems. I hope I'll upload the QT client in 15 minutes. Nope, the coin is CPU-only for this time. Get ready, release is in 2 hours! Yep.Sure, I'll do it. Well, there are so many scrypt altcoins, and only one using scrypt-jane. I want Onecoin to be a bit more different to existing coins. Okay, so now scrypt-jane is using BLAKE 512 and Salsa 64. Also I rewrote GetNfactor() to make Nfactor increase more uniform.cpuminer for Onecoin is coming soon (it should be a lot faster on 64 bit machines than the built-in miner). All right, what do you think about combination of BLAKE 512 and Salsa 64? Salsa 64 doesn't seem to have working GPU implementation yet. I personally don't think that it's exceptionally bad that scrypt-jane will be once mined on GPUs, at least (if you believe in what is said in corresponding topic) Litecoin's scrypt implementation is no more ASIC-proof. That's the way the technologies advance, no algorithm may be considered protected from such events.   All right guys, the game goes on. Onecoin WILL be launched, and it will happen soon!Read the updated OP-post.Another-useless-altcoin haters gonna hate.
